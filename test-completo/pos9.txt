 Go dukes!   6 unearned runs in this series arguably all because of Desmond's April woes. Unbelievable.    Yeah 106.7 the fan is really good, unless you're not in the DC area then you won't get that, and then I'm no help...   Still would rather den Dekker out there...   161-1 HERE WE COME!!!!!   BRYCE MVP CONFIRMED    Kelly Olynyk, and that's it   AAHHHHHH!!!!!   Proving that not every statistic is interesting.   boooo  	10
 Hi 2X.  This is a throwaway.    So, I've recently been put on Wellbutrin, about a month ago, for depression, which is scaring me a lot.  But I'm not sure if my depression is the cause of my sadness with my boyfriend (and school, but that's another can of worms) or if the problems with school/boyfriend are causing the depression.  My boyfriend and I have been together 2.5 years, and we moved in together in May.  he moved across the country for it (I had gone to grad school across the country).  So, we are far away from any family support.  At that time I was *so sure* that we were going to be together for quite some time, I really was.  I'd never felt that way before.  Now fast forward about six months.  I want to end things with him.  It scares me to be with the same person since I was 21 (I'm 24) and he feels like he wants to be with me forever.  I do not feel that way anymore.  I don't feel the same way about him as I did.  At all.  As clich as it is, I love him but I'm not *in* love with him.    However, I don't know if this is all because of this depression shit, or real feelings.  Anyone have any advice? It would be so greatly appreciated.  TL;DR--is my depression causing me to not love my boyfriend anymore?   That was very useful, thank you :)  I guess part of the problem is I don't really have a family support system, even if they are far away.  Some stuff transpired that kind of ripped us apart, for a silly reason I think.    We are very lucky.  I am glad to hear that someone who has been there is also feeling better, it makes me happy :)  	2
 if you click on the Youtube video, the link is in the description.   Tommy linked this post on his solo project's Facebook page!    That's adorable!   Brilliant.    Commence war flashbacks   Squealed like a schoolgirl upon recognizing his voice.  He is dearly missed.    Music major here. Can confirm. Currently trying to get out of my own pretentious outlook.    Name checks out.   	8
 Or, go to the professor and talk and tell them what had been going on and how to pass. Professors will help you and even pass you if you're willing to improve and go to their office hours.   Try and get a leave of absence due to your depression. I did this and it was very easy. My psychiatrist just wrote my diagnosis and that I should take a leave. Good luck   Criminal minds! It's great because its always on TV ha   Hmm. That sounds really interesting to me. I've been on an epistemology/spirituality/quantum physics train of thought lately. Every time I try and watch it though, I turn it off because it bores me.   It was a great movie and book. I have cried while reading all his books. Paper towns and looking for Alaska are next on the big screen and will have the same effect.   Neither are necessary.   Yeah but it sounds like you know what to do and have a plan. And you're motivated. This is just a hiccup in life. Dogs can be great for healing and company so think about that... Produce dopamine.   Uh not really   Twilight or kings crossing by Elliott Smith.    Thanks! Steppenwolf looks awesome   Ooh yeah. Well you need to get her to understand the changes in mood and potential of harm she can do. But, shed not going to listen to you if she's impulsive and unhealthy, that's on her and you can't really change that because she'll resent you and then rebel. So, it's kind of something she needs a therapist for.   Since you're her big brother, she will take what you say and how you act with more emphasis than a parent. You're close in age and did it to. What she's doing isn't all that out of ordinary for a HS  student, but you may need to worry because she was a higher chance of addiction and risky behavior.    Good choice   Drugs and alcohol with mood disorders (or similar) do not mix. She'll end up feeling worse, it keep chasing the high.   You need to figure out yourself and who you are, not just the job you want. What you need in life should be found in some ways within your job.  A trade school or a life coach may help.   Two were surprising to me, still is but who cares. The other 2 I kind of l smelled something fishy, I was right.   Yeah, definitely. I enjoy it when we embrace and its more than just thrusting and I feel involved. I love sitting on top of him while he's sitting up against a wall or chair and riding. Same intimate feelings as missionary.   Really. I hate this question because they're all good. Can't be too picky   Mental marathon is a perfect description. This happened to me on independence day and I felt so sick, like the kind of lethargy after a panic attack. I don't have anyone to talk to anymore either. I try and people do like me and care for me, but never to the best friend/lover/first person I talk to extent. One inch at a time I will improve. I will go out. I will experience life and not take the backseat. I will think it and I will do it.   Oh, and as far as saint chappelle, I liked it and it was pretty quick.   Paris was crazy. I literally ran around the city to to each big landmark to make sure I fit it all in. Usually I'd say this doesn't work and not why I travel, but idk, I'm glad I did it. The only thing I'm mad about it not taking much time in the Louvre. That was on my bucket list but skipped through.   Basically, its up to you. Is the culture or the landmarks more important to you, how do you feel about skipping many major places like the love lock bridge, arch, Louvre and other museums, a few awesome churches, etc.   Figure skating. What the fuck   Ask someone who has done it themselves. If you don't feel comfortable contacting an owner of a bar around you, ask around Reddit to pick some minds.   Yeah, my first thought as well.  But I see his point obv.   I bet 12% take something.   Because they have different priorities which changes their outlook (in theory).   Go on stumble upon or okay Yahtzee with buddies on your phone   That makes a lot of sense.   I hate this keyboard and autocorrect.   Yeah they're from my hometown and making headway across the US. Theyre one of those bands that are respected no matter if the person likes their music or not.  They told me theyd do another AMA here once their album comes out.   Damn. Chaturbate is going to get me into all kinds of trouble.   Yeah I thought it was a bent knee for about 30 seconds.    Got fucked over in about $250 in drug deal money through out my time. Blame it on the police   They have a product, I think it's called monkey butt or something similar. Made for your ass swear but works the same   High on what?   Yes, ruined my life.    I like Ohio. This is probably not someone's first choice but I do.   Reminds me of the babadook... And brainwashing.   And most places here will accept Canadian money.   I kind of think of it as my country too. I can hop the border for lunch, see the Falls anytime, and go to a specific store to pick something up for half an hour. A lot of Canadians come here as well, mostly to shop, so we integrate well.   As a person, how would you describe yourself?   Be prepared to out in more effort and work. Do participate in class, ask questions. One if the biggest things I regret was doing this and not going to a professors office hours to form a relationship. Definitely will help down the line with recommendations, plus networking is always a necessity.   Oh, and as much as grades DO matter, if you pass you're okay and no one will care.   Free to be insane. Free to be unique. Obviously we have laws, but as a white female, I hide in the cracks.   Nope. Oatmeal could work though.   So what do you like to do? How do you have money?   Similar to any public service, I thought they were unfair until I needed them. I support it, but also believe in limitations.   Can't upvote enough!   Yeah I was hoping one she touched the memories at the beginning and made them sad, they'd make ALL them sad because that's how it feels. I looked too far into this movie psychologically    Love Pixar, had high expectations on this and felt let down because I was trying so hard to relate it to my brain. How did you feel about it?   I've had my leg hair look like that before. Winters are long and lonely.   A true man right here.   Download some podcasts or audio books   I like your outlook   Have him try this:  http://www.depressionquest.com/dqfinal.html   Both are in the wrong. If the workers said that they should have been fired. The lady sucks though.   I mean let's review   Where's Picasso's?   So good.  Post pop punk is my groove.   No one knows my band either. Mostly because I don't have a band.   Not him but I am!   True. Theyre not my thing but it's sad how fast they faded after the hype from the song with soupy died down.   Only heard a few songs here and there but listened to their full albums today. So good!      $paid   $paid   Apparently I'm the only one that did not like this.  	65
 why is this guy being down voted? its just his opinion    fucking buzzfeed! really?   when I was at universal studios in florida. I was playing with a men in black alien gun I got. Then went around shooting all the park workers telling them to 'Die scum'    permission to use 'Holy Crappers' from now on ?   jesus she's fucking beautiful    You sound like an asshole   know that feeling mate :(   http://i.imgur.com/qWAAjRp.gif   http://i.imgur.com/HeWzZv6.gif   Yeah it was fun knocking Psg of there perch   Yeah I'd lost 3 champions league finals before this one. So if i didnt win this one I might have just went outside and used my laptop as a Frisbee    (Passionately) Thanks boss I won't let you down!    I mean When is Poo not sappy...wait a minute    Lyon 2025, just won the quintuple    Hi everyone. I'll cut to the chase because we need to get through this awkward post. I've been clinically depressed for about 5 years suicidal for 2 and I just wanted to sincerely thank this community for giving me an escape and making me feel like I'm worth something to someone. even on a game. It means a lot and I love you all    I've spoken about my situation so much can we keep it light. I'm sorry for the bother but.i'm craving killing myself I've been wanting to for nearly 3 years now. and this is the night where I'm not going to be a coward and chicken out    Holy shit    Like see if it works on a windows pc ?   Im not 100% positive of anything ! How do i find out if its failing ?   but how else are we going to show we're all funny in a  kind of nostalgic way   GET YOUR FUCKING TITS OUT !!!!!!!   I did that already, same thing happened    COCKS OUT LADS ITS HAPPENING    Hi everyone I apologise if this is not a suitable question  for this subbreddit but I don't know where else to go.   So I have a seagate 500gb hardrive that I used with a windows laptop. wanting to use this hardrive with a mac I tried to format it in Disk utility, However every time i try to Partition the hardrive. Or repair it. or erase it. it always comes up with an error saying 'File system formatter failed'.   Is there anything I can do. Any help will be greatly appreciated    I really admire him, and I wish I was more like him. I can relate to everything he's saying. 'Fuck em' too right !   Me too. I need another Scorsese Gangster film in my life !   Wow he sounds like quite an incredible man. wish i had a grandpa like that !   Is it confirmed because i've been reading rumours for a long time ?   Tell me more about him    Shit now i look like an idiot    Im writing that on my desk so i can read it every day   I haven't no,but I cant see why you cant submit into multiple contests. It'd probably say in the rules somewhere but i cant see why that would be banned.   I will They don't announce till october but it gives me a sense of adrenaline when I'm writing its cool !   Thats Exactly what I was thinking I guess I just wanted to hear it from someone else. I just want to write and improve my craft and enjoy it    Yeah thats true ! Thanks for the support    I think writers who think of the other stuff are people doing it for the wrong reasons personally    I mean I just want to write great pieces I think that if i start thinking about other stuff like studios and finances you start to not concentrate on your writing. Most of the contests i've seen has a short category so i guess Short scripts are still valued pretty highly   Why are all my posts being downvoted ? What the fuck did I say ?   Maybe I really Love the characters and narrative i've done. I haven't planned on it because I developed it strictly as a short. I might write another short with a similar protagonist and story world E.G Drive/Only God forgives  How about you. want to trade and read each others ?   A short    Thanks :)   The shore scripts screenwriting competition. I don't think its very prestigious or anything but there was a deadline soon so i thought why not. Is there a list or a calendar of must enter contests or anything. Theres so many out there I don't know which ones are worth entering    Yeah I got rid of Gourcuff pretty early to expensive. I tried to build the team around Grenier for a few years.  Benzia did a good job for me but he never became a star-player for me. Sell him with a profit percentage in the deal would be my advice   Yeah thats what i've heard and I enjoy writing to a deadline and i've been getting upset lately because people have been telling me the way to get noticed as a writer is to make the film. which i don't like ( did a very practical film making course hated it) sorry to rant but yeah writing for contests is fun and a good way to get noticed :)    Hi everyone I'm not sure if this post is appropriate but i've just submitted a script to my first contest and i really enjoyed it. I've been getting really worried lately about how to break into the industry and blah blah blah but I'm just going to focus on my writing getting better and entering contests and if my work is good it'll get noticed. I just wanted to share. I'm enjoying working to deadlines and its very rewarding.   Well starting off they have some really terrific youngsters. Ferri Fekir. and you have a pretty good squad starting off. but you have to get rid of gourcuff (shit speller sorry) he's on like 84k. Get rid of him and try to add some cheap young players to the ones you already have then you can try and flip them for profit. Hope that is some help       I Think its a very fair comparison. Both are quiet but ultimately want the same things 'Companionship' 'Love' but they both know that can never happen and are destined to stay alone because of their actions. Both pretty sociopathic but feel like their actions are for a just cause.  So I think its a good comparison    Those Red Wing boots are sexy !   well i've just finished a short that took about 2months ish including development and research    I was doing good until i saw that lonely guy thread on here, making me remember I'm lonely. dammit i was having a good day !   Haha no worries ! got any good saves going on at the moment ?   I bet you're fun at parties    heres a link to it, I'm a little dumb so i dont know an easier way of linking it but here it is  https://benosullivanwritesstuff.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/sex-addict-project-draft-3-2.pdf   Hey Guys was just wondering if anyone wanted to read the 3rd draft of a short I wrote. Look forward to getting some feedback. Thanks a lot   P.S I don't have a name for my main character yet so I'm just calling him LOSER for now. https://benosullivanwritesstuff.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/sex-addict-project-draft-3-2.pdf   Cool mate cant wait to share   who cares    easier said than done isn't it. i need a drastic change of though process and mentality    sorry for coming of as brash its not like I'm holding on on purpose. because of the anxiety i have ruminating thoughts which means these thoughts of lauren are always there. and i don't know how to get rid of them. being with her is the only feeling of happiness i've ever had. i want to let go. just how ?   do not tell me how i feel. I'm not going on a 'self-pitying rant' i thought this subbreddit was called ofmychest. i thought i was allowed to come and get something off my chest not be judged or be told what to do by you.   Thought he was great in 'Brooklyns finest' 'Dead Poets society' and the 'Before' trilogy    Cool lets be friends ! shall we write to each other ?   Hey everyone basically i've had a super rough year and i've lost a lot and learned a lot (feel free to go through my post history to get a flavour of whats been happening) Looking for some friends or just someone to write to. Im a aspiring writing and looking for something a bit more real in life. anyone want to be friends ?   yeah should be, RDJ PR guys should get a massive bonus after coming out of this episode being seen as the good guy    There both in the wrong yet RDJ is getting defended because he's the star who is well-liked because tons of PR guys work night and day to make him funny and likeable and this time it didnt go his way, its justified in his Unprofessionalism ? part of any job is dealing with curve balls, thats just life and clearly From what i've read in these comments RDJ is justified in his immature behaviour.    i understand humans act childish when they lose control of my emotions but part of RDJ job is to look a certain way in the public eye, public imagine is obviously massive for RDJ so he has an obligation to maintain professionalm, not all of our jobs involve looking cool and maintaining  an image. Krishnan wasnt gossiping he asked quite broad question about his past clearly trying to work a certain issue. Fucking joke     Im so glad someone else agrees !   i think it was an attempt to talk about an issue or is RDJ the only one allowed to talk about drug problems ? he's allowed to use it for positive 'i've turned it around publicity' but when its used for an agenda relating to a wider issue its not allowed, well since he's heard it a million times before maybe he should learn to act with a sense of dignity and decorum rather than confirming the primadona steroytype. I understand he gets personal questions a lot and it must be frustrating but it makes it worse if he gets it a lot and he acts this childish, have a sense of a workplace ethic, pretty embarrassing on RDJs part.   What a joke.    Getting up, making a sarky comment and walking out, is not being respectful in my opinion. and he made a big song and dance and walked out. hardly very respectful. He was there to promote the film but the interviewer wasnt there has to be a mutual give and take in this situation    He wasnt But the interviewer was. my point being there has to be a bit of give and take he'll get his movie promoted sure but he has to give a bit back to the interviewer give and take. i made my point pretty clear not my fault you failed to understand it   Yes it probably does and i get that, but surely with his past he must find a way of mainting a bit of professionalism, I think it speaks volumes about his character that he petulantly gets up and walks out. or am i the only one who thinks he should act more professionally. or because he's a star who can afford to walk of stuff he hates doing that makes it okay ?   Well i think throwing your toys out of the pram is not handling it nicely at all, i think its a very rude and immature way of dealing with it, he's the star so he throws a tantrum. He's not there to promote the film he's there to talk about an issue, It cant all be about him there has to be some give and take, RDJ acted like a big-baby    But do you not think there has to be a give and take when it comes to doing these things, we'll promote your movie but you have to give us something to support this news segment. surely there has to be some leeway don't you think ? RDJ Should act a bit more professional i understand he does it all day but he acted like a petulant little twat.   please do, talk later   you're giving me hope say more things like that    what do you mean ? because i've been suicidal for like 2 years now and have yet to experience the euphoric high    thats kind of how i felt when i was with my ex  	75
 Your vagina is very compact - my gyno   I've drowned myself in a bottle of wine tonight. I feel so alone, i just want to get away from everyone and everything. I can't help myself anymore.    Thanks x   Hi all, I have just purchased some John Frieda volumising shampoo and conditioner and some hair mousse. I have only tried it a few times, and had not much change so was wondering if anyone had any ideas onto a to create more volume in hair. My hair is bum length, red/Brown and never coloured before, it's quite dull and flat too.   Thanks :)    Thanks everyone. You've all really helped :)   Thanks so much xx   Thank you :)   	7
 WOO LOW WINDS  I play euph but sh   http://i.imgur.com/ep4pm0u.jpg I enjoyed puzzles and shoes that didn't fit me.   I LITERALLY JUST POSTED THIS ON THE OTHER THREAD BUT IM SO BORED. annamarie225/16/f I like squirrels and I sleep a lot   annamarie225 16/F I like squirrels a lot and idk I sleep a lot   Let's play a game called "how hard can I roll my eyes"   Shake it Out - Florence and the Machine   For some context: four years ago my friend's older sister died from cancer. All three of us are into marching band. Then the other day he was driving me home and said "Ya know, when I see you I don't even miss my sister. I don't need to go visit her or think about her because it's like she's right next to me again. You're both so dedicated to what you do, and you both make an effort to be kind to everybody." And I cried   If you greet me with "Hi." I'll get annoyed too, it just seems unfriendly. I wouldn't answer like that because it's bitchy and she still shouldn't have said that, but yeah.   My school would never be having that. We have a gay-straight alliance and a really LGBT-positive atmosphere. If any group were to exclude a group of people like that, it would be shot down so fast. It blows my mind that anyone thinks that's okay.   Nash in this picture    They're on vine and they're literal trash but girls still love them   http://i.imgur.com/OdSlzsJ.jpg  Cat.   I've only had one (but it was very minor) and I literally didn't feel a thing. Don't worry.   Idk what happened between 11th and 12th but I'm so jealous    3236   You regularly get your eyebrows done. Cuz they're on fleek.   http://i.imgur.com/gxR7wnR.jpg  It me   As of right now  "The look of love - the rush of blood The "she's with me" - the Gallic shrug The shutterbugs - the Camera Plus The black and white - the color dodge The good time girls - the cubicles" - No. 1 Party Anthem by The Arctic Monkeys   ??? Why does that bother you? There are very few people on my bus that sit in the same exact spot every day. I have a seat that I prefer but if someone sits there I just shrug it off and sit somewhere else.   I was just there this weekend for a marching band thing! The campus is sooo beautiful.   I'll think about it! I have to make it out of high school first haha   University of Michigan or UCLA, then med school at Harvard (but that won't happen)   15 wasn't horrible IMO but I'm dumb. 19 year old you can hmu tho    Favorite: Spanish or German Least favorite: French. It just sounds ew to me.   Sorry I forgot that I was obligated to like everything that everyone else finds fun. My bad.   Be careful. It effects some people differently than others. I did it one time and while my friends were all having fun, I kept hearing things that weren't there and I couldn't swallow or stand up or move my feet. Personally I hate it because it has that effect on me. It's really unlikely that will happen to you but just be careful. If you decide to do it and stuff like that happens then just lay down and be calm.    It seems like people either thought the reading/writing was hard and the math was easy or vice versa. Like, I had no problems with the vocabulary. But the hexagon can go fuck itself.   The conversation went: "Did you not have enough time to do them?" "No I did" "THEN WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT" "Eh"   Maybe you should have taken classes from young sensei.   I'M TOO JEALOUS THO. My eyebrows are extremely thin so there's not much I can do with then, and they're also kind of like, half eyebrows. And they're blonde. So I pretty much don't have any.   "Nah I'm good at math I don't need to look at the practice test" *leaves a quarter of the math portion blank because I'm a dumbass.*  Also, for the non multiple choice math portion, my friend wrote 21 for every single one. Okay.   Eyebrows on fleek   7:30 AM tomorrow ;-;  But at least I get to go to another school for half the day and see my other friends   Being an ass to substitute teachers who already get ridiculed all day by students.

You can go buy a cheap scientific calculator at Walmart for 15 bucks:   I've been listening to a lot of Deer Tick lately. I found him because Watsky sampled him but I fell in love with his music. It's really Bob Dylan-ish   She might just assume it was an accident. That's happened to me before where I accidentally get tagged in pictures and I just figure it was accidental and I delete my own tag.   If it makes you feel any better, my friends were Facebook stalking my band director and they accidentally tagged one of them in his profile picture.   It's not always caused by things, in most cases it's kind of just there.  But yeah tbh a couple times a week I'll get really really down and kinda just lay on the floor all day. I used to be on the medication but then it made me gain a ton of weight. So. Yeah.   http://open.spotify.com/user/1218887343/playlist/5IBZ2VyOFtll1a0KHK1Pun  I have music from every genre but there's 70 hours worth. So. Yeah.

Tallest Man On Earth The Rosebuds Foxygen   Don't - Ed Sheeran   That wouldn't fly at my school hahaha   Parenthood   Sitting, Waiting, Wishing by Jack Johnson. Yeah.   Annamarie225 16/f   I like books and music and tv and animals. I do competitive robotics and marching band. I'm also bored out of my mind so plz.    Shout out from 3098! 3   Why  What makes you think that's a good idea   I'm one of the 15 people at my school choosing to take the PSAT (most people don't because it costs money and we're an ACT state) and I'm not planning on studying much. I got a practice booklet to look over and that is probably all I will do. Remember it's just a practice test. It's meant to prepare you for the real thing, not to be the real thing.   Nice Fox by The Rosebuds or San Fransisco by Foxygen   We have a big homecoming every year and I have never went because I feel like I'm the only one who doesn't want to be grinded on in front of my English teacher.   We watched a short documentary in sociology today called Behind the Swoosh. It's about how badly Nike mistreats their employees and what it's like for people in sweatshops that make all of your "Made in China" or "Made in Indonesia" etc products. It's kind of eye opening and I've been viewing everything differently since I saw it.   "You are the smell before rain, you are the blood in my veins." - The Boy Who Blocked His Own Shot by Brand New  "Some men die under the mountain just looking for gold, some die looking for a hand to hold." -Archers by Brand New  "You are my sweetest downfall." -Samson by Regina Spektor  "When papa is gone, he will never be gone, because the sound of our sneeze is the same." - Wounded Healer by Watsky   I had no idea what that blue button was so I would always click it and just make stupid faces in the camera but then I found out what it was and I almost cried bc I did that ALL the time.

Okay! Thank you so much, I appreciate it!   Thank you! Yeah it was really cheap and his tinny sounding speakers. It was all I could afford at the time so I went ahead and got it. What kinda do you suggest? I'm sorry I'm so dense sounding, I just blindly went into this because I had a Bon Iver record laying around not being used and I'm really into it now.

 Hey what's up man I'm sorry to hear you've OD'd so many times. For what it's worth, to me it still seems like you have some relative stability in your life like a job and a place to stay. I hope things look up for ya in the future man, cheers   A few of my closest friends know I use occasionally and if I'm high they'll usually ask what I'm on and I'll tell them H or oxy. If someone else asks I'll just say I haven't had coffee and I'm tired. I shudder when I try to imagine the fallout that would occur if my parents or any of my extended family found out. But that's the nature of these drugs, you have to be able to keep secrets from certain people.   I can't stop the drool from running down my chin.   I have it saved :)      http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/2y9t1b/by_request_of_several_people_my_method_of_making/      edit: Buying seeds is legal and isn't sketchy at all, you can get a couple pounds of seeds (make sure they're unwashed) from Amazon and have them shipped to you.   I really enjoyed reading the ending to the series yesterday. I hope there's gonna be more stories on the way!   Ahh okay. I've only tried PST once and I used a pound of seeds. I liked the nod but not enough to pursue it I guess. It's a great option if you can't find anything else though.   That's pretty peculiar, I've heard that w/ds from PST are some of the worst. What quantity of seeds do you use when you make the tea?   That's really sad, I'm sorry for your loss. Terrible circumstances   I snorted some adderall, had a few shots of vodka, smoked a blunt and couldn't get it up. Needless to say she was disappointed, but she was also fucked up on vicodin and alcohol so she didn't care too much. We cuddled and watched some Netflix, I took an ativan to fall asleep and that was the night.   Ahh nostalgia. Thank you for posting this   Ahh okay that makes a lot more sense then. I'd be sleepy as hell on all those antihistamines.   Doxylamine is a first generation antihistamine used to potentiate opiates. Not sure why you'd want to take it at the same time as DPH though.   Someone mentioned it elsewhere in the thread but apparently biker gangs (?) moved tons of these things from Canada into the northeast US. The pills I got are from the Boston area. Beyond that I couldn't tell you.   Snorting them feels pretty great, I'd say try one if you ever come across any. They're cheaper than real oxys too since they're fake.   Coke, oxycodone, xanax and hash oil is my favorite combo. I make sure to decrease the dose of each drug when I do combos though.   I was told that these were fake 80s by my dealer but that they did contain a moderate amount of some opiate. When i snort half a pill there's not much euphoria but there is a very heavy nod. The nod doesn't last as long as dope. Maybe it's fentanyl but I don't consider myself experienced enough to say with any certainty.      The analysis of antinociceptive efficacies produced by co-administration of ascorbic acid and morphine or tramadol for different levels of nociception, revealed that co-administration provided better antinociceptive coverage than the individual drugs. There is neither a simple explanation for the mechanism of interaction between the two drugs, nor for the type of interaction at different levels of the antinociceptive effect.      Very interesting. It's unfortunate that the mechanism behind this interaction isn't well understood yet. Something I'm curious about is how Table 2 lists the dosage ratio of morphine to ascorbic acid as about 1:260 and how this would translate to actual dosage in humans.   Really great story. Good to hear you've been clean of such a heavy habit for so long and it's worked out for you. Respect   Actually it depends. If the drug you're snorting has better oral bioavailability than intranasal then a drip is actually desirable and may slightly increase absorption, i.e. oxycodone. But with other drugs like ketamine for example, a drip is less desirable because of how bad oral bioavailability is.   AH-7921, U-44700, parafluorobutyrfentanyl (relatively new), butyrfentanyl, and methylfentanyl to name a few.   Good looks on the peace tea, I don't hear people mention it very often. By far my favorite type of iced tea. I like the peach flavor the most but snoberry and razzberry are great too.   CWEs all day bruh   Hi :)      Currently pretty high on this combo and I love it. I find that the oxy takes the edge off some of the uncomfortable twitchiness from coke.      But I also have a question. I'm aware that cocaine is cardiotoxic, but would adding an opiate such as oxycodone to the mix put more "strain" on the heart, making the combination even worse for your heart?      I'd also like to hear what people think about mixing coke with other opiates. Are there any that you prefer mixing coke with? Thank you all, I lurk a lot and don't post too often but I really like this community.   I love the chewy Spree   Ain't no tellin what the future will hold.   Hi OP   1. I had tried quite a few drugs (but not nearly as many as some people on here) before trying opiates. One day I was finally able to get my hands on some 5/325 vicodins. Took 2, smoked some weed and had a great time.      2. The high has a physical aspect to it that just isn't there with weed. No matter how high you get on weed you won't experience the same extent of analgesia you get from opiates. Or the "not giving a fuck" type feeling because of how absolutely amazing you feel from the euphoria.      3. I only use occasionally so that my tolerance stays low and so I can avoid addiction.      4. I would say they've had a negative effect on my social life. I've had to hide my use from most of my friends. It really depends on the person but the guilt from hiding it from certain people can get to you after a while. As for the positive aspect, getting high on opiates is better than every other drug I've tried.      5. I've never binged on opiates since I try very hard to space out my usage.      6. Know that physical withdrawals are the least of your worries compared to the social stigma, monetary cost, tolerance, psychological addiction and even death if you shoot up.  	28
 I've never been self employed though :-S in 2012 I worked in a call centre and in 2013 worked for a soft furnishings company. I never received a final P45 from the call centre (they were a front for a timeshare company so I'm assuming they didn't file the documentation properly) and the soft furnishings company evidently didn't have me on the right tax code; I'm currently paying back that debt.  HMRC have the details for my current employer as I contacted them when I started last year, so I don't need to fill in tax returns now.   Edit: To clarify I worked for the call centre Jan - July and Aug - Nov 2011 (was paid off both times) and I worked for the soft furnishings company from Feb 2012 - Feb 2013 (company went into liquidation)   But I didn't receive notice that I was to file a tax return until 19th March. This is what is confusing me.   I've received two penalty notices for tax years 2012 and 2013 and a combined penalty of 200. I filed my tax self assessment on April 1st (which I believed to be the deadline day)   Was I just a day late? Surely if I'd be receiving a harsher penalty if I'd gone any further over. I'm so confused and I'm sorry I don't have a lot of information but I just want to know if I have messed up or if there are grounds to appeal.   I'm seeing a lot of comments urging users to switch to Voat in response to the decisions of Reddit upper management.  Can you give me an ELI5 breakdown of Voat?    I'm guessing this is a regional thing as in the UK this is pretty common. You have your guests at the ceremony and "wedding breakfast" (the reception dinner) and once that is over you can have additional guests at the evening reception. A plated meal is not normally provided during the evening party but usually a buffet is.   If this is not common in your area it could be interpreted as rude and your idea of a later ceremony seems more cost effective if you don't go down the evening reception route.   I'm in Scotland. I think I've been a bit ignorant and assumed humanist ceremonies were legal in all the UK. It seems bizarre they aren't.  Sorry if my comment was misleading.  	6
 Yeah I've still been doing deadlifts. The trouble isn't so much the joints themselves, but that the doctors don't want the muscles to overdevelop in the wrong direction and then be more difficult to correct after the surgery.    I'm having joint trouble in my knees and because of that I can't do squats until I have a surgery. I know it's a really useful exercise to build core back and leg muscles, so are there any more isolated exercises that I can use to get similar results?   Hey I just wanted to ask where you guys started seeing muscle growth first when you started making gains? I've been at it for a month, and while I've started seeing gains on my arms shoulders and chest, I've gained a lot more muscle on my back then anywhere else. Did you find that a certain muscle group developed a lot faster than other ones did when you started?   Yea I'm finding it really sobering. I knew I had depression, but had a feeling there was something more to it. Somethng else interesting that came up after she diagnosed me is that I'm not an introvert, I'm more of an extrovert whose being limited by symptoms of ptsd. I also don't have traditional social anxiety, it's more rooted in years of traumatic experiences and problems trusting people. Really the diagnosis makes a lot of sense when I look back on things.    I recently moved to a new city and have been seeing a new therapist to manage my anxiety and depression. For the last few sessions we've been going over my difficulties and getting used to each other. For the first few sessions I described my problems with interacting with people, feeling unable to connect with others, problems with concentration, and "brain fog." For the first few session she said I definitely have social anxiety and suffer from depression. This is pretty much what I've been told before, and that's fine I knew what I had to work on.  That is until the last few sessions where we spoke about more specific issues. It came up that I actually have dissociative issues with my appearance and identifying or experiencing my emotions. It's to the point where I almost can't describe myself. I started talking about bullying that I experienced as a kid, moving to different towns several times, babysitters with mental issues, and the rejection that I've had from other kids growing up.   Some examples; Literally my first social interaction that I remember outside of my family is a neighbour kid jumping on my back (with no provocation, the kid had issues) and biting a chunk out me. This happened when I was five, it was a deep bite and I had to be on antibiotics for a while. When i was ten another kid with emotional issues in the neighbourhood tried to crush me with a washing machine that was lying around. This kid had it planned out and booby-trapped. It would have permanently injured me or killed me easy. Had babysitter who'd leave my brothers and I outside for hours in -30 weather for hours and refuse to let us inside. In highschool I lived in a very isolated community where I never really fit in to the very small town community. I can remember taking so much shit from my "friends" then. People who unfortunately still manage to keep themselves in my larger social circles.   Anyway, when I was talking about my highshcool "friends" with my therapist I was clenching my jaw the whole time without realizing it. My therapist pretty much stopped me and told me that I almost certainly have C-PTSD and that most of my anxiety, body, social, and depression issues stem from it. It's almost refreshing how much it seems to make sense.    This is my personal example.  I have an ex-girlfriend (who I've been friends with for years)  who's been confiding in me a lot about her depression and feelings of loneliness. I have experience struggling with the same problems, and I have a lot of advice to share, but I know I can end up talking about my own depression. I don't really know what to tell her when she says something like "I just feel empty," other than "I feel that way a lot of the time too." I've told her that I don't know how to deal with those problems myself, so I'm not the best person for her to talk to. I do listen to what she has to say and I give honest input, but I feel like maybe I should just not talk and listen more.   Is it better to give input and try to share your relevant experience and feelings? or is it better to just sit and listen? I'm just looking for advice on how to be a better comforter   I've been playing guitar for years, but have only recently made the effort to start writing on it. I'm a piano player and I have my theory down, so that's helped a lot, but I find I'm stuck on strumming chords. It's really difficult trying to make a song sound more interesting when I'm just hammering out some chords. How can I learn to play and write more textured guitar parts, instead of just strumming chords?    Whenever I get "stuck in my head" (as my friends and family have started calling it) I look at the ground. I just completely check out and let my thoughts go, and I'm only vaguely aware of what's happening around me when I'm thinking like that. I've had to make a conscious effort to walk with my head up and shoulders back, so that it looks like I have some self-esteem haha.    I just started physiotherapy to correct knock knees and hyperextension. My physiotherapist has recommended that I don't do heavy squats as part of my workout routine, until we make some progress with correcting my knees. Pretty much they don't want my knees strengthening in the wrong direction. What are some other exercises that I can do that'll work similar muscle groups as squats, but in a different way?   I know! haha I've just got to go to relax about it, but I think I'm still getting over getting this attention in the first place.    Over the past few months I've been working hard on building up my confidence. I've been working out, meeting new people, and being a more assertive person. It seems like it's been working, because I've noticed that whenever I make eye contact with girls I'm passing on the street, or around campus 9 times out of 10 I get an insanely cute and genuine smile. I'm not used to getting such open body language from girls and I need to how to approach them.  Does a "hey, how's it going?" work or should I say something about their appearance/smile. Day game is new territory for me, so I need your advice to get me started.     Do you still get the benefits of the boost after the 7 day mark. I mean other than turning me into a horny animal, I'm concentrating better and getting way more things done, so it'd be great if that stays.   I'm 21 and this is the second time I've made it to one week and I'm finding it horribly difficult. I'm horny all the time, I stare at girls constantly and just can't stop thinking about fucking them. I spent a whole three hour class today imagining what the girl sitting across from me looks like when she cums. I only slept for an hour last night because I my heart was beating like mad and I was sweating. When I woke up, I was UP, it didn't feel like I missed any sleep because of the feeling of adrenaline. I've been hitting on my friends constantly and I can't seem to help it. It just blurts out like a natural response. Pretty much if I can make a sexual comment I do, and I mean it most of the time.  I've also been having whole days where I just wake up in a rage/depression and stay like that all day.  A big problem is that I haven't been meeting a lot of people at university since I took a year off and I'm having a hard time making those social connections that would lead to meeting women.  The worst part is I live off campus (not too far) at my university, and all day I'm just feeling resentful of all the people who are just hooking up in dorms and meeting women through the campus community.   I've been hitting the gym hard, but I'm trying to gain weight and muscle so I'm only going a few times a week so I don't burn off all my extra calories. So going for runs is pretty much out of the picture. Meditating's been fine, but I have to fight my way from sexual imagery.  I feel nauseous and like I have a headache constantly, but I can't fall asleep and feel like I'm rushing with adrenaline all the time.   Do you have any advice to help me push through this?   I'm my experience, the best thing to do when someone snubs you is to just leave the conversation and don't contact them until they contact you. If they're actually interested they'll get a hold of you and be more accommodating next time. People who think they don't need to meet you half way in a conversation are wasting your time.    Yes! Your last line is a really good way of putting how I feel after work. I work at a coffee shop and I know I go into an autopilot mode to get me through the day. By the time I leave work at the end of a shift I feel really scattered and can't collect myself till I'm away from work and doing another activity. The only other time I feel like how I do when I'm finished a long shift of repetitive tasks is when I'm waking up or over tired.    I can't take mundane activities, but other people around me seem to manage them just fine. I work at a coffee chain and an 8 hour shift is often too mind numbing for me. I get off work feeling numb and drained, because my brain stopped working half way through it. I find most of my coworkers manage the grind of everyday better than I do and don't let it outwardly get to them.   How do mundane tasks or jobs affect you?   nope I just had short term dating and out to make friends on my profile, so there's no way to mix that up there.   So I had a really great night with a girl the other night. The date went great and we had sex afterward, it wasn't great sex as we'd both been drinking a bit. I don't think I'm really too physically attracted to her and I'm not really interested in anything serious. What's the best way to communicate that I'm sort of "playing the field" and that's kind of where I am right now?   NT people talk to themselves too. I mean they try to hide it as much as possible, but especially under stress everyone talks to themselves.    Was for a while. It was a sedative too, so I didn't feel like I could get any creative momentum, and it gave me some pretty serious brain-fog.    Almost every person I've ever been close to tells me that I overthink things. The thing is that, especially in social situations, I have an uncanny ability to know what is going to happen or how people are going to act and react. My analyses usually bother people, especially in personal conversations, and frustrates me because I feel like they don't have the same investment that I do in whatever we're talking about.   I do actually overthink things sometimes, and I've got myself in some pretty serious thought loops that caused really bad anxiety. I'm more aware of it now than before, but I still struggle with it. I usually keep my opinions and thoughts to myself, because I usually go much deeper into my analysis than a lot of people ever care to.  Here's followup answers.  - I was talking to a friend who I've occasionally been romantically involved with about how our relationship is a lot more complicated than what we like to admit to each other. She told me I overthink things ha.   - Not for a long time. But I don't often share a lot of my opinions or thoughts, because not many people want to get as in-depth into things as I do.   - I suffer from depression and anxiety. I dealt with existential depression for about a year, and still struggle with general anxiety. I've had depressive episodes for years, but as I get older and understand it better I feel I'm starting to manage them.   - The female form is honestly the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I'm a straight male, but even aesthetically there's just something pleasing about women.   - My biggest dream is to write something that means something to people beyond myself.   - Biggest fear is to lose my mind.   - We can't, but I don't think that matters.   - My day felt very long, and I have a headache, because I drank too much coffee.   It's nice to overthink sometimes, especially when it gives you a chance to sort out whatever it is you're thinking about.       I've noticed that when I'm tired I'm terrible at socializing. I make stupid comments, I mumble, I can't think of anything to say or what to talk about (unless it's something about myself), I complain about things, I can't hide my emotions, I stumble over my words, I don't listen well, and I'm not as aware of how the people around me are feeling. It's embarrassing and I feel like I don't deal with it as well as other people around me.   I find I have a lot more trouble with this at work than anywhere else. This is a real problem because I work at a coffee shop and being tired really kills my ability to interact with customers and coworkers. I can't hold a conversation, and it makes it difficult to connect with the people I work with when I'm having trouble halfway through an eight hour shift.   When I'm feeling good and energized I'm usually pretty quick on my feet and friendly, but being even a little tired makes me dull and anxious.   Do any of you have advice for staying socially energized? or being able to maintain when I am tired?  EDIT: Posted this after a long shift at work; Just look at that title.    It's a very safe, very relatable topic that almost anyone can feel comfortable participating in. Everyone knows what the weather's like, what it's been like and how to compare it to other weather they've experienced. It's also a good transition topic to other things like where someone is from or where they've travelled before. The weather is most people's go to because it's easy and they prefer talking about it to silence.    Knowing everything about your sexuality might be unneeded, but from what I can gather, sexuality is a large part of most people's psyche and development. There are things in your development and behaviour that he was probably looking for. Just me hazarding a guess.   I've been thinking about how I speak and come across to others.  I've been looking for alternatives to the generic slang terms I've been using since I was a kid. Terms like "cool", "awesome", "sweet", "what's up?", and calling friends "man" or "dude" seem childish and outdated. I especially fall back on these terms when I'm feeling anxious, and it makes me feel like people see me as immature.  I'm not sure if this is even a thing that other people notice or not, but I'd like to hear your input on it. Do you think it's something I should work on What do you think I could do to developing different default default language.  Just to give some context, I'm 21 and male.    When I'm anxious and trying to talk to someone I think I come across upset and impatient. I default to a lower voice, and don't have as much control over my intonation as I usually do. This can be really off putting, especially when I didn't start the conversation anxious, and then gradually slip into seeming impatient and angry.   Any advice on how to mange this better?   Sexuality is a large part of most people's behaviour. If a psychiatrist doesn't understand your behaviour, how are they supposed to help you?   I find that whenever I'm tired I don't talk much, and get into a very bad mood. This has affected how I act at work, especially early morning shifts. I know I get remote and impatient, but when I'm really tired I can't seem to help it. What's the best way to manage being over tired when you have to be social?   I've moved to a city with a very lively night life, and because of this I have to deal with a lot of drunk people walking around at night. I'm a 21m and on any given night I might have to walk past scores of drunk people to go to and from pubs or friends places or walk home from work. A lot of drunk guys my age show off by screaming at and trying to belittle any other guy who's walking by them. I'm in shape, and dress well, I usually look put together, and I'm beginning to feel like that's a factor in how aggressive other guys are when I'm walking alone at night. For example I was walking home tonight and a couple guys just start harassing me for drinking a bottle of water as I walk by, I literally got a "You like that bottle of water faggot?" shouted at me. I had a few comments I could have thrown back, but nothing I felt would be really affective. Is there a way of dealing with them without starting a fight? I feel like ignoring them is a too passive, but confronting them could end up with me picking my teeth up off the sidewalk.    Haha I'd like to think that's how someone would see it  	30

 It is so much lower than you think.    I just finished this book last night, I loved every second of it. The last few chapters definitely felt rushed, as though the author got bored of writing it and only continued because she had already spent so much time creating the characters so she may as well finish it. I don't understand why so many people disliked the ending. While I can see why people may find it unsatisfying, to have Nick or Amy kill the other would be completely out of character for both of them. I got the impression that Nick, deep down, knew all along just how much of a psychopath Amy was. When he figured out that she was framing him, his first thought was to admire the sheer brilliance of her plan. He knows that if his catastrophic love tragedy with Amy comes to an end, nothing will compare to it, for the rest of his life. He loves the depth of her intelligence, her ability to manipulate and weave stories of fiction into reality.   No, the ending wasn't exciting - but it was realistic, and true to the characters that the author created.    What are your sources for this accusation?   What about the new exploit they used in the new version of the Pangu tool?   I wouldn't call wanting to see proof for a claim before I believe it is genuine wanting "to believe" a "narrative"   Sorry, but I am honestly having trouble with believing any claims ionic makes on twitter:  https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/482002723026788352  https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/482394671705247744  https://twitter.com/i0n1c/status/481392466202210304  he makes some pretty wild accusations without anything to back them up.   Except the Pangu team used logic and critical thinking and decided that using the exploit for iOS 7 before 8 came out made rational, logical sense given that it was likely to be patched for 8. If they hadn't, ionic would have continued to withhold the exploit until 8 came out, and by then the exploit would be wasted. So now, instead of saving an exploit, 2 have been used because of ionic's childish kicking and screaming, and asshole apologists like you.   No one cares, not even i0n1c  uh, have you seen his twitter lately? I'm pretty sure he cares, a lot.   Are we looking at the same tweet? The tweet doesn't tag any other twitter users in it, it simply links to a reddit post by /u/BarCouSeH, which doesn't seem to have any links to the Pangu team.   Why do you care? Ionic 100% gave them this code of his own free will, and they decided to use it. They can do whatever they want with it. If you've never paid hundreds of dollars to attend a class and then use the skills and knowledge you learned during that class then I guess it's hard for you to understand the situation.   Uh, yeah, that's entirely accurate. Is there another, valid reason for ionic to keep the exploit secret? I don't really understand how that equates to = pangu did it to teach him a lesson. It doesn't imply that at all; I simply stated a fact.   you think Pangu took bugs from i0n1c just to teach him a lesson  sorry, whereabouts did I say that?   Can you provide a source on him being apart of the Pangu team?   Um, who already told me that? The only comment saying so is yours.    I was under the impression that ionic revealed to them a bug or vulnerability in iOS that they then exploited with their own code. The vulnerability may have given them access to the system, but they still had to code an actual jailbreak from there - a jailbreak often takes multiple exploits/vulnerabilities to access various parts of the system. So how is it obvious that they "fucked it"? Even if they had copy and pasted a ready bunch of code that ionic wrote, does it matter? Honestly he deserves it for being such a dickwad and teasing everyone with his jailbreak, and he was retarded to think that it wouldn't eventually happen given that he didn't take any precautions against it. Additionally, the fact that the Pangu team released the new version with a new exploit proves that they are a completely capable team on their own feet, and simply used ionic's exploit because it was likely for it to get patched out in iOS 8 and there was no reason for it to be kept secret (except, you know, to make ionic money...). The fact that Pangu simply re-released it with their own exploit instead, not because they were in the wrong, but because they can't be bothered engaging in childish drama, speaks volumes about their character - especially in comparison with ionic.  This whole thing is beyond a joke, I have never ever seen a community that is nearly as dramatic, childish and whiney as the jailbreak community. Ionic should be embarrassed.    All that does is prove how melodramatic and childish he is.  And to further back that up: https://mobile.twitter.com/i0n1c/status/475664357893079040  So he is fine with people using his exploits, so long as they don't release to the public (so he can keep making money from his classes)? This kid is a grade A douchebag.    But they didn't use his code? They simply used a vulnerability that was shown in ionics class. They still had to write the exploit and the jailbreak code. IMHO they have done absolutely nothing wrong, and ionic is just being butthurt because now he can no longer tease on twitter "omg guess who has a jailbreak for 7.1.1? ME NOT U LOL"   God I hate this thought process. Ionic taught them these vulnerabilities in a class that they PAID FOR. They had every right to use them, just like someone has the right to use code they wrote in a programming class. They do not need to ask him for permission, and it sucks that they felt so bullied/intimidated by him that they used another, separate vulnerability that could have potentially been used for ios 8.       Its extremely likely the nexus 4 will see L at this point. The device would have no issues running it, and google quoted the fact that the manufacturer for some aspect of the galaxy nexus' hardware was the reason it never saw an official KitKat update, not because they didn't want to update it. Everyone just chill out, and be patient.    DNG *is* a RAW format.    Nexus 4 would probably get it before GPE, IMO   tbh the bright, flat colors remind me a LOT of ios7.   Sorry, what I said was actually incorrect. I just checked the xda thread for multirom and it turns out it does support multiple android versions, provided that you unchecked the "share kernel" option when installing. Apologies for the misinformation.    Keep in mind that the galaxy nexus certainly had the ability to run kitkat, but it never got an official update.    Looks like [this guy](https://plus.google.com/103847211392162949263/posts/hZWiNuMoJGt) was almost spot on with the multitasking (almost 2 months ago).   Multirom doesn't work across multiple android versions.   Edit: this is incorrect, see my comment below. Sorry.    Same thing happened to me when I had a car accident, a lady waited with me until the ambulance came. Never knew her name, I don't even remember her face - the only reason I know is because the EMTs that saved me told me so.    Or a person can get a job as an assistant bartender/barback, and get a year's worth of experience WHILE getting paid.   Sorry but how is any of this incorrect? I've been bartending for just over a year now and everything listed is pretty much entirely accurate. I've found that the majority of people don't mind explaining whats in a drink and even if someone gives you shit for not knowing, that will only ever happen once for that particular drink - once you know, you won't have to ask again. It's all about learning. Its unreasonable to expect someone to know every single possible drink and cocktail combination, bartending school or not.   http://www.redmondpie.com/download-ios-7.1.1-ipsw-for-iphone-and-ipad-download-links/  Once downloaded, shift-click on "restore" in iTunes and choose the downloaded ipsw. Make sure you download the correct one for your device, cause it can really fuck things up if you install an iPad ipsw on an iPhone. (Side note - restoring hacked ipsws was how some early jailbreaks were done!)   Yeah it really wouldn't have been much more trouble to add the vendor prefixes, there are websites you can just copy and paste the code into and it will automatically generate the extra code where relevant.    A lot of the stuff he's using (rotation, skew, border radius) is css3 spec, which Firefox only has basic support for. Chrome pretty much supports everything.    What makes you say that? Outside of /r/android, the nexus line is meaningless to the general public. I have a nexus 4, and people constantly ask me "is that the new Samsung?". Google has put ZERO advertising / marketing into the nexus line. I don't think I have seen a single advertisement for a nexus device here in Australia, whether that be print, television or internet. In fact, I'm pretty sure the only way to get a nexus phone in au is to buy it outright, off contract.   While it seems silly for google to drop the nexus line, it isn't completely outside the realm of possibility. I doubt they make much money from it.    Ota won't work with those changes to your /system partition. AFAIK the ota updater does a checksum of /system and compares it to the stock image of your current android version to see if it matches, if it doesn't it will refuse to install. Best bet is to update using the factory images (make sure to remove -W from the script, otherwise it will wipe everything - either that or just flash each image manually with adb).   That or you can go ahead and undo all the changes you made to your system partition (remove cerebus and su binary from /system etc)   Only downside to this: nobody to tell you what happened while you were in the bathroom.    kinda looks like a [kelpie](http://www.pups4sale.com.au/black_tan_kelpie_01.jpg)   Kelpie!   20d represent   Assuming a stock ROM, being rooted has no effect.    /r/imgoingtohellforthis ?   As with all dark humor, it is context sensitive. I was just pointing out that I feel that I have attained the right to make jokes at my own expense in company of people that I am comfortable with and would not take offence to such a joke. (My mother's reaction to my above comment was a sharp intake of breath covered by a hand, "that's terrible", followed shortly by a suppressed giggle)   Thanks for the suggestion. I did look into other options but after consulting with my doctor he said it wouldn't really be worth it given that I'm staying in a relatively low-risk area (siem reap in cambodia).   from the original comment:   Killing yourself isn't really something you joke about. Ever.  I was just pointing out that, like many tragic things, suicide can be joked about in the correct context.   As someone that has attempted suicide before, and suffered depression for 4+ years, I think I'm allowed to make jokes about suicide. I love to make people squirm.   Example: I'm going overseas for the first time soon and so I had to get shots for things like flu and hep a, but we decided against me taking the vaccine for malaria (comes in pill form instead of a shot) because it has a significant risk of causing a relapse in people who have suffered from mental illness (or currently are). When we found out about the potential side effect, I turned to my mum and said "So what should it be, suicide or death by mosquito?". She was not pleased.  edit: this is gold. downvoted because i'm being insensitive about something that happened to... myself? i guess humor isn't an acceptable coping mechanism on reddit.  edit 2: i am finding it extremely amusing watching this and my comment below swing between negative and positive karma every few seconds. looks like reddit is really torn on the appropriateness of dark humor.   omg i cant get a job   here's a list of jobs that are below me and i refuse to apply for   wait what? how do you get it to mirror the monitor?   Are you aware that's exactly what I just said? Different shutter lengths (all other aspects remaining the same) = different exposures. The exposures are then overlaid.   Ok, so explain to me exactly what "low level" HDR is?   The HDR on the Google camera is done by taking three exposures: under, on point and over - which is a true HDR.    Do you also tell people to stop being happy because someone else has it better?   "You shouldn't be happy because someone else has it much, much better than you."   See how stupid that sounds?   That's kinda the point though, isn't it? The more people that use it, the larger it will grow and you'll be able to use it for more stuff.    Finally, an askreddit thread I can actually contribute to!   I was officially diagnosed with depression in the October of 2011, after a suicide attempt - but I suffered from depression dating back to as early as 2009. I've read many of the responses here about exercise, diet and hobbies, and while they are very accurate and can be extremely helpful to a person that suffers from depression as a result of an event or life situation, sometimes extreme cases of clinical depression require additional life changes such as medication and therapy.  I've written about my experiences on reddit before, so I'll try to keep this short. I suffered from very severe depression for about three and a half years (my diagnosis has jumped around a fair bit because of my unpredictable behaviour and mood; things like bipolar II and borderline personality disorder were thrown around before they finally settled on clinical depression and severe anxiety disorder). Depression cost me countless friends, almost tore my family apart and has come very, very close to taking my life more than once. It is indescribable and if you have never suffered from it you will never be able to comprehend the depth of the despair a depressed person feels when they're at rock bottom. I used to fake a lot of smiles and laughs, and I remember the first time I genuinely laughed I immediately burst into tears; I realized - after years of nothing but a dull plateau that was occasionally interrupted by extreme spikes in both directions - that *this was how normal people felt all. the. time.*  Anyone that's suffered from a depressive episode and then started a course of antidepressants knows the way it feels when you start to feel normal... have you ever had someone sit on your shoulders for a while, and then taken them off? Once they get off, you feel so *light*, like you're about to float away. You just feel... good. Nice. Everything doesn't take stupid amounts of effort anymore, you can hold more thoughts inside your head, and everything feels warmer and moves quicker.   I'm stable now, and currently not taking any medication. When you have depression, there is no beating it. It is just something I have to manage, and I will do so for the rest of my life. I know the signs of when I start to spiral, I have devised and perfected the necessary steps to keep myself safe, stable and functioning. When I see the signs, the first thing I do is let someone know - usually my parents - and ask them to keep an eye out for any strange behaviour and let me know. I know what the onset of a panic attack is now, I know how to keep my thought patterns in check and the kind of situations and people that I need to avoid.  Having said that, it's hard. Its really fucking hard. What is normal everyday life for other people is an uphill battle for me. Few people will ever understand why, while waiting for a train, I have to close my eyes as it enters the station. Or why I cut contact with my best friend because he has certain personality traits that have triggered depressive episodes for me. Why I say no to social outings sometimes, because I know that if I spend a lot of time with other people I have problems adjusting to being by myself again so I start to crash. None of even my closest friends get it, and in all honesty I hope they never do - because it would mean that they have experienced it themselves.  Its ok. This is my lot in life and I'm glad for it. Being a depressive make you see the world in a completely different way, and I like that.   That comment didn't actually say anything about the persons gender.   Your references are out of control man, everyone knows that.    No, Gerald.   You mean Gary   Yeah it is. Its to avoid YouTube's automatic copyright scanner thing.       What happened to klyph?   Look at ops comment (currently at the top). He cut the guy off because he was previously waiting in the line but got OUT of the line to cut ahead. Not cool.    haha love your take on this, thank you!   I think people get caught up in it, I have honestly never seen anyone "freak out" about it though. Its important to follow it when you're first starting because it takes a while to learn when its appropriate to break the rule. Someone who has never followed the rule of thirds will not have the compositional skills as someone who followed it religiously and now knows when, and how, to break it.    Don't know if its what you were going for but I'm getting a real tron vibe from this and it is AWESOME. Thanks!   I love watercolor, thanks so much!   I really like the first one, thank you!   sorry I honestly didn't mean to come across as demeaning or condescending, but after re-reading my comment I can see how easily it would be perceived that way. Most smartphones have a "tethering" feature that essentially creates a wifi hotspot that would make a chromecast operate as desired. :)   God damn I keep coming back to my jawline haha. It's such a small part of the drawing but I love the way it looks.   this is really good, especially for something drawn in such little time. Thanks!   Not Australian until its a green hose pipe.    Don't know about op but I personally work in hospitality and regularly do 12-14 hour shifts. When you're in a fast spaced environment like a busy restaurant, bar or night club, the hours fly by really quickly, since there is always something to do. (Except if you're closing. FUCK those last 2-3 hours).   Could you not setup a wireless hotspot on your laptop (adhoc) or phone? It only needs a WiFi LAN connection to work.       Your launcher has little to do with it.       I was instructed by management to do it, and it was one of a very long list of reasons that I left.   I guess so, but RR (or at least, the ones I worked at) are particularly bad (especially compared to say, McDonald's - I have worked there also). A few things off the top of my head:  * It is common to still serve food that has been dropped on the floor * Chips are often served 30+ minutes old in a slow period - the heater keeps them hot but they are still old chips (they are sometimes dipped back into the fryer to freshen them up) * Stores would regurlarly re-date the desserts kept in the fridge - it was not uncommon for customers to come back complaining about their cheesecake or chocolate mousse being sour/out of date/otherwise off * When food was returned to us (due to a customer complaint) it would often be re-used (with us having no idea what the customer has done to it during the time it took for them to bring it back) * Our gravy and mashed potato is just made from powder + hot water (this one ain't so bad, cause it tastes fucking delicious anyway lol) * Rooster rolls are made using 3+ day old chicken that they were unable to sell. They are made in the morning and kept in the fridge until close and are simply microwaved when they get ordered - it is not uncommon to find bones in them (kitchen staff have to strip the chicken from the carcass when making them, and kitchen staff are fucking lazy) * If you order chips without salt, there's about an 80% chance they will simply drop already salted chips back into the fryer for a few seconds and then serve them to you * Those banana fritters that everyone loves - has anyone tried pulling off the crumbs to see the banana underneath? 95% of the time they're a mushy, black mess.  * Gloves and hairnets are optional  The ONLY thing you should eat from that place is the roast chicken. They have good quality chicken, and it is properly slow roasted in ovens (although how clean those ovens are depends on how quickly the kitchen closer wanted to get out the night before) for about an hour.   I worked at a red rooster on the gold coast for 3 years, and covered shifts for pretty much every store on the gold coast... Trust me, you do not want to eat there.    Voxli used to be able to do it. You had to install a plugin though.    I had to scroll too far into the comments to find this reference.    What about it didn't you like?   Are you being serious? I thought Sinister was really well done.    Again,less to do with actually using the software but more about converting a database over to its system, possibly manually reentering tags and creating collections.    Workflow in terms of modules, presets and the persons database (how tags and star ratings are handled, as well as collections and filenames) can be quite different and extends further than "a bunch of sliders".   Short blogger was pretty good before the official app was released, but I stopped using it since I preferred the official one. What don't you like about it?   This can be fixed with custom ROMs/xposed but your point is still valid. Full screen landscape keyboard has no place in android anymore (or at the very least there should be an option).    Can confirm, currently using a 20D. :( I love this body to pieces but it has terrible ISO performance.    I have the TTL 465 and love it.    That's my point here... its not actually doing any SMS sending - the app does this over data. Turn off your data and wifi and the app won't work anymore.   No they don't? That's why there are no SMS app replacements on the app store. You have to be jailbroken.   Huh?   You can apply the preset in the develop panel and then click the compare button (the Y|Y button down the bottom of the develop module) if that helps?   There is no difference, all canon DSLR flash mounts are the same. They're just trying to saturate search results (people will often search "flash for canon t3i").    You can replicate this by layering the original image and the filtered one on top and just lowering the opacity.    How will they manage that when apple doesn't allow apps to interfere with sms at all?   Its not House on the Haunted Hill or it's sequel, Return to the House on the Haunted Hill?   fuck sake i hate reading things like this cause it always gets me upset and angry. i broke up with a girl i had been dating for 4 years - it was me that initiated the breakup but i was still extremely heartbroken to do it (i still very much loved her but our relationship was toxic for the both of us). knowing that my best mate was kind of a dick head and a desperate virgin, i specifically asked him not to try anything with her and, because he was pretty much my only friend at the time (i lost the majority of my friends through the breakup. fuck people are petty) that i would really need his support for the following months. what happens the next day? he's texting her and snapchatting her nudes. FUCK PEOPLE.   /u/mediumpace   Did you read the article? The title is a bit sensationalist but it basically boils down to KitKat is now only allowing apps to write in a specific place on the sdcard - this is good for everyone! No more sdcard clutter.    Why?   Its not a feature in gravity box unfortunately but some ROMs do have this. I know cm does for sure.    A good barista should be able to control how much foam goes into the cup without a spoon. ;)   Nothing in this thread has touched me but this hits hard. This was something me and my ex used to do every now and then (OK I lied, we did this quite often, we were both in our mid teens so our metabolisms could handle it without it affecting our weight)   Assuming the machine is hooked up to a water source, it pushes water through the coffee in the group handle (the cup that holds the coffee) and into the cup. Then you froth the milk using the further (which also heats it).   Source: I'm a barista.    It's a joint so its a little but different.    People still make fun of me for taking antidepressants.       The gravity box dev recently released an update that allows you to turn off individual tweaks, so if you disable the navigation bar tweaks you shouldn't have any conflicts (the reason you were having issues with it was because gravity box is really only meant for stock and so your ROMs navbar implementation was conflicting with gravity box's).

 Those are gorgeous!! Im knitting my mom a shawlette right now in knitpicks stroll... Those socks look awesome i might just have to try!   Beautiful! Do you have any good projects in mind? Im trying to find a simple but elegant sock. Maybe a few cables or something. Time to search the depths of ravelry :)   I just gave in - bought some in atlantico yesterday. there colors are so beautiful i can't stop looking at it!   I have a puppy and hes pretty big :( wahh i need a cat so i can make one of these!!!   I LOVE that idea but i only have 200 yds and want to work with what i have - thats a great suggestion for the future, and tarn is a great choice because of its durability...   Great idea:) my mom would like that!  	6
 I'm trying to pursue teaching abroad in Asia, and most programs require TESOL as well as a basic elementary English degree. I (currently) have no plans on teaching in the states for a long time.   I did consider the cost, but when I had just started middle school my dad moved and also made my mom uproot her life and move to NC so I could get a "head start" on getting in-state tuition for UNC (for residency requirements are that you have to live here five years I think).    Its required to teach English abroad in Asia, which is what I plan on doing.    How does she like teaching TSOL? I've been interested in it for soo long and I'm very excited to join the program if I go to MSU     I plan on joining Teachers Without Borders after college, so I haven't really given it much thought. Thanks for the advice about the teaching license.    Basically, my dad went out of the country (San Miguel de Allende, Mexico to Bostom, MA) for college and he HATED it. He doesn't want me to feel isolated and alone in a different state. Him not paying 50% for out of state tuition is a way to try to get me to stay in state, which I have always been adamantly protesting since my sophomore year...   I have visited MSU and I genuinely like the relaxed feel the student body has. I feel that itd would be much easier for me to graduate near the top of my class with amazing grades. But on the other hand, UNC is more prestigious but I feel as if my grades wont be up to standard.      Going in for a major is English Education and a minor is TSOL! :)   They are one of the only universities that offer TSOL as not only a major, but a minor as well so thats what really won me over.      Well, for MSU my mom and dad (divorced) are co-paying 50%, while I pay 25% with work-study and the rest is covered by merit scholarships. On the other hand, if I attend Chapel Hill my dad agreed to pay the full tuition.   And thank you for the tip. I'm going to brainstorm pros and cons right now!     My dad has always loved UNC Chapel Hill, and its one of the reasons why my family moved to North Carolina when I was in middle school, in hopes that I would attend UNC.  Two days ago I got my acceptance letter, and although i was thrilled, i told my family i had never even planned on going (I got a fee waiver and thats why I initially applied on a whim). I find that I will be happier up north at Michigan State, and although my mom and her side of the family is all for me going to MSU, my dad and his side of the family want me to attend Chapel Hill.  Well, I have tried explaining to my dad that I don't think I will do well at Chapel Hill because my grades weren't stellar, but my extra curriculars were what got me in. I dont think I will excel academically because the level of intelligence at Chapel Hill is so much higher, as well as the competition. I also find that I like the student dynamics more at MSU where there is more diversity and more suited towards my personality.   I've tried explaining to my dad but he will have none of it and has even shunned me for today because I told him that I will NOT attend chapel hill.    How do I go about this? I dont want him to keep ignoring me, but I also don't want to sacrifice my happiness and well-being over a school.   **tl;dr**: My dad is unhappy that I'm making an adult decision about my own future.  Edit: Since people are asking about financials, here's the breakdown:  If I attend MSU, my mom and dad pay $10,000 EACH (so $20,000), I cover $10,000 with the work study I have been offered, and I have a merit scholarship for ($10,000)a scholarship for out of state ($7,000 and a scholarship for having studied abroad ($2,000)   If I attend chapel hill, my dad will pay $25,000 full.  Edit 2: Maybe my question was unclear, I'm asking for advice on how to speak to my dad and find a way to discuss the different opinions we have about college.   Last year I was diagnosed with GAD, and my parents opted not to put me on medication. At the beginning of the school year we decided to try Buspirone. I was advised that it would take up to a month for it to take effect, but I still have anxiety attacks (though they're only mild instead of severe).   Has anyone had a good experience with BuSpar?   I would say to just be friendly! I'm very shy around strangers and at first I was PETRIFIED when people randomly hugged me (mostly the younger convention goers do this), and when people asked for pictures I always said yes.   Of course there will be creeps, but generally everyone is there to nerd out :)  One suggestion is to bring snacks and drinks if the venue allows it, because the food they sell is almost always overpriced and terrible. Another thing to bring is a travel kit with tiny scissors, a couple tiny spools of thread, a needle, and a small tube if superglue. They're usually sold at craft stores, and they're so useful if you need a touch up or if a fellow cosplayer needs one.   I hope you have fun! :)   she looks like the kind of girl that would set your dog on fire when you dump her    Wow thanks for the compiled list! I couldn't find anyone who had made a chalice that was lightweight, because many people made it with clay, which I've never used before.   I'll check out all the links and see which method would be the easiest. Thank you so much :)   I LOVE this! If you dont mind me asking, how did you paint the hammer? I have all the supplies and the paint, but I dont know if I should just paint it solid brown and then create the "wood" look by layering it with dark brown/black...     I'm planning on making a [FFCC chalice] (http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080417022815/finalfantasy/images/3/31/Ffcc_crystalchalice.jpg) for Animazement Raleigh in May and I don't know where to start. I've only been in the cosplay scene for approximately 2 years, and this is the second prop that I'm going to try to make.  I was thinking of creating a wire frame around a plastic fishbowl and then covering the frame with paper mache, but I'm not sure if the end result will look "rough".   How else could I make the chalice? I'm open to any suggestions!    I'm a little behind as well but I think Harley is only *attracted* to Deadshot because she sees the Joker in him. Harley/the Joker are forever my favorite couple, though.    God this is my dream room     5 centimeters per second   Basically just call her super Goth and creepy (style wise), and musically they shit on her vocals and say her voice is depressing and makes them want to kill themselves.    I never even realized that! I LOVE the eye makeup they do for the "Diamond Are a Girls Best Friend" scene     I guess its just the people in my area, but even on the radio station the disk jokies poke fun at her voice because its not the typical pop voice    Definitely Moulin Rouge. Nicole Kidman looked KILLER as well as the rest of the ladies!   First of all, that lip color is perfect on you! My only CC is that your blush looks very strong, so I would either try to blend it out more or find a lighter shade   *breathing intensifies*   	24
 ..................    fulfill  to realize, perform or do, as duty; obey or follow, as commands   "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets.  I have come not to abolish but to fulfill them.  Amen, I say to you, **until heaven and earth pass away, not the smallest part or the smallest part of a letter will pass from the law, until all things have taken place**."   Jesus breaking old testament laws while he claims to be here to fulfill them is just another case of the bible's contradictions. That's pretty amazing mental gymnastics to spin that as a good thing for Christianity!   	3
 What thread are you talking about?    Sitting in a puddle of self pity waiting to feel better is the new norm.  Based on what? Your own opinion?   *Doesn't move a muscle until nightfall*   How does this offer any practical advice to OP?    anything would be better.  Okay, let's draw a massive schlong that spouts anti-something hate.   BY GAWD JACKSON IS BROKEN IN HALF   Still waiting for you to throw the first stone at this guy, Pretty.    You typed an essay when you could have summed up everything in a couple sentences: Witcher already had most of the concept art (e.g. Geralt's design) and the engine done. Star Citizen is a new company making something from scratch.   It's shaped like a diner! And it's on this really tall pole!    I have a 10 year old cousin who is constantly raving about Five Nights at Freddy's, the Slenderman game, Flappy Bird, Angry Bird and all kinds of mobiel games, but has no idea what Grand Theft Auto, Metal Gear Solid or Rayman are.  Who fucking cares? Tastes change and a 10 year old shouldn't be playing MGS and GTA in the first place.   not concept art   Well if you are a Christian, you believe God has spoken for himself as Jesus Christ   M'lady   Oh that man is sick!!   The Supreme Court...What great men he would join: John Marshall, Charles Evans Hughes, Warren Berger... Mmmmmmm... Berger...   All of you people are such fucking hypocrites. You yell to the moon telling people not to pre-order any game but when reddit gives its bullshit seal of approval to one developer, pre-orders are suddenly okay? Fuck off   Watch Cowboy Bebop.   Damn, gets my vote   This isn't for me, but for my brother. He was born with [sotos syndrome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotos_syndrome); a defect in one of his proteins at birth caused over-growth, but delayed intelligence. He is 16 right now but acts more like a 10-11 year old.  Me and my brother, the older siblings, are okay - no disabilities or anything. We're both on-off wrestling fans, but our little brother has been a fan for years. One of his favourites is Bret Hart and I am sure it would make the year to him to meet Bret in person (he's only been to a house show; big John Cena and Big Show fan).   These pants were suppose to be baggy...baggy!   He-he. Best in the West. That rhymes!   How can someone abuse their body like that?? Moe! Don't throw out that [brine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brine)! *proceeds to drink entire jar*   The high me really thinks this is funny.   I'm a bad wittle boy      The ring came off my pudding can   Were you sent here by the devil?   Keep watching the skis! I mean sky's...   Well that's just luvoly   Alalallalallal   I hope someone got fired for that blunder   Just a fun idea some architect firm whipped up. Unrealistic and will never be built; but now the company is on various news sites so the plan for exposure worked   Tyson Kidd and Nat are both Canadian. What makes their team "European" other than Swiss Cesaro?   You're going to have a great time.  My brother is mentally disabled and when we went to a house show, the guys brhind us were chanting John Cena SUUUUCKS. My bro turns around and gave them them YOU CANT SEE ME hand wave and they shut up.   Oh, everything's cruel according to you. Keeping him chained up in the backyard is cruel. Pulling on his tail is cruel. Yelling in his ears is cruel. Everything is cruel. So, excuse me if I'm cruel!

 Liars and Fools   Sofa fm boot liquor is an online radio station I would give a listen to, it has many of the artists suggested along with a variety of others. I'd say it's a good place to start.   Lonely Too Long or In My Arms Instead   Grab a snack, it's a long list: The Hours, Chicago, Drop Dead Gorgeous, Beautiful, Sugar and Spice, Simone, Miss Congeniality, Looper, Gravity, Unforgiven, The Proposal, The Housesitter, Star Wars: A New Hope, Wag the Dog, All About Eve, Singin' in the Rain, Little Miss Sunshine, Funny Girl.  I made my own movies as a kid, wrote my own scripts as a teen, and watched a lot of movies. I don't watch as many as I used to but these have always stuck out as my favourites whether or not they're critically acclaimed.   Clarke Griffin from The 100. She's so badass.   I think that's what it is. Thanks!   Okay this seems familiar. Thanks for the help!   My trainer came up with a routine I can do while I'm traveling and don't have access to a gym. One of them is titled as a dumbbell burpee and the instructions are to row on each arm, push up, and then lunge on each leg.   I don't remember doing this since I was super tired the day we went through this workout. I'd rather not bother my trainer at this time since its late.   Anyone know what exercise this is? I'm at a loss of exactly how I should be performing it. Google isn't any help.   Kenny Chesney is pretty entertaining, so should be a good show overall. Have fun. :)   I can't answer how long his set will be just that you should go. I saw Eric Church recently and he puts on a great country-rock show.    I remember seeing that as well but can't find it now.   1) 26 2) Bisexual 3) PS4 and 3DS 4) PS4.

I think it was my first grade teacher. She was really pretty and really nice. She went on maternity leave before school was out. I still kind of remember her all these years.   First girl crush that I was completely aware of was on this girl in high school. She knew I liked her because I told her. Anyway, she married a guy and they have a kid now. I feel weird whenever I see her now because I turn into that awkward and shy 16 year old all over again.   * **Budget** - $300-500 cdn, flexible   * **Source** - Dell laptop, iPod classic   * **Requirements for Isolation** - some isolation, for home.   * **Preferred Type of Headphone** - over ear   * **Preferred tonal balance** - neutral, not a fan of bass     * **Past headphones** - Sennheiser HD 558, I liked them. Denon AH-D5000 were too bass-y.   * **Preferred Music** - Country and Indie Pop. * **Location** - Canada   I think she was purposely trying to speak "clearly" to be understood by the American guests which made Graham laugh.   I was 10, too. I was playing in front of my house when I was catcalled by a guy driving by in a car. I was too busy playing to pay attention. The only reason I remember it at all was because my 14 year old brother came storming out of the house, chasing the car, and yelling at the guy.   So glad I got to see them when they toured Canada.

 Well some of the maps are not in the works though, as they had critical flaws to them, if you happened to get this information for maps off the wiki, sorry for not updating that page recently, I had been doing it for a while.   Met Yetii during the gym, and she's my best and maybe only friend and I love her  ^ ^    Well, except that some of the maps you named were never added to the rotation, like arkansium and Elbe, etc   Bellows is one of my all time favorites, as well I did kinda like Plains, as boring as it was, but no molgan, NEVER molgan   GammeX^see^I'm^funny but seriously probably Del, Dans, and Audicy   i just preferred if the map makers did their own lore for the map they made, rightfully so. And you're welcome, i did my best! :P   a need for spacing became something much more beautiful in the end :P   were you looking to add in the lore to the map yourself?   Were you still looking to make the lore for the map when you get the chance?   I like it a lot! I'll edit a few grammatical errors in tense, but other than that I like the story!  Edit: I also used your screenshots from the original map thread for the slideshow, hope that's alright!   Well, I mean, the facts could be wro ng, but instead of telling me, why not change it yourself? :) The person that made the system for map lifespans made a basic one that works, but you could always change it!   Its stuff I came up with, and kinda just needed it to fill the space needed by the slideshows for each map. I suppose they can just be replaced by map showcases or something, just need it for formatting purposes.      And I do :/   And I do :/   And I do :/   Just a quick correction, there were 4 heroes max in a default game   I just, feel so useless, that I'm not really good or even decent at anything, that I'm just shit at everything and only hurt people :/   No, just, games I like are kinda lack luster as of late because all I want is to die :/   Sandboxes are fun, I just wish I liked other stuff, I just don't like anything anymore, everything just turns to death for me :/   well the glass on Hidden Valley only broke from Blaze Cannons, and after that it was just poor bedrocking, so if I do the Bedrock correctly, no worries   ~~I thought it meant that he wanted to lower the player count so a game starts every ten minutes, but you could be right as well.~~ edit: as well as not commenting to the right person, Rob and Nis proved me wrong on the most recent update.   The only difference between my pack and the DvZ one is the 32x32 textures, dunno if it would be that different.   It is, but I made this in a few hours, so hey, why not see if its worth redoing.   Well, it shouldn't look that different, the only difference between my pack and the DvZ one is the 32x32 textures.   Probably not, but its not that they're that important anyway.   The map essentially lacks two very, VERY important things, bedrock, and a front. I do realize that these two things are pivotal to the actual playing of the map, but I threw this together and just wondered if it was worth the hassle at all, so I'd like to know!      Shooters and Indies, sometimes open worlds, not much else though :/   Just video games :/   I just, dont have determination to be strong like that :/   Just being worse and worse in my depressive state :/   Just who I am is utter shit and I can't fix it.   I do enjoy the escape sleeping brings, but it can also bring terrible nightmares, I never have trouble sleeping, just hope I never wake up.   Distractions never really distract me, the feel comes back fairly quickly or while I'm doing the thing :/   I honestly have very few people to talk to, and I'm just on the brink of giving out :/   I just can't fix any of my own problems, no one can.   I just, don't want to be around anything anymore, I want to be how I feel, nothing.    I do listen to them, all the time, but I never really can do much for them :/    I think I'm going to smash my laptop though   I have, but more into the PvP stuff myself.   I like minecraft, but beyond that, it's just shooters and indies.   I'm not a big fan of sports, love video games though, really my only hobby. I watch doctor who and the walking dead as well.   Pretty much, except I get worse and worse as the process goes on.   I just, really don't have much to say, just want to die.   Many people cared, they all said they'd never leave me. They all left me, I am beyond hated.   Well, I am a bad person myself, and I cannot be forgiven.   I really don't think anyone could ever like me.   I just, always need someone to talk to, to the point I get annoyed if someone is doing something else and can't talk to me. That's why I understand I'm terrible, because it's wrong I get annoyed by that, people should do what they want, but I just can't stand being alone.  People that never met me dislike me, just, I guess because of my immediate impression.   All these people tell me they care about me, that they like me and say I'm a good person. Then, weeks, sometimes days gone by, they hate me, they like nothing about me. People that never really met me hate me, no one can stand how I am and what I do, and I only blame myself. I'm pushy and needy and everyone hates it.   I sit here, and I keep thinking of ways I can kill myself, I try my everything to find a way, and there have been several. I posted before, yesterday even, and I still have nothing but want to die. I'm still just sorry to all those people I hurt emotionally, and I hate how terrible a person I am. All I want, and all I need, is to die, the world would lose nothing by it.   I honestly cannot have a friendship or relationship with anyone, I'm just that terrible.   I have gone to a hospital once, I only found it to drive myself worse. I never find hope for anything in the world, and I'm tragically ironic. I dislike most people, I like few, they become my reason for the world, and then they hate me because of how I am, and I'm terrible. I have been this way for years, and I honestly just give up, and I'll figure out a way to fix it.    I am not, in any way, a good person. Everyone tells me that the first time they see me, everyone tells me they were wrong in a very short time.   But nothing would ever smile back at me, I do nothing but drive people to anger.   This post is more located here for the fact I can't put it in a place people know me because it would be rude and against guidelines.  I've posted here before, I've given up before, and I find no guarantee I will kill myself today, but I sure really want to and will think of a way to. I don't find hooe in the world, as I'm lonely and destructive in friendships, and most people end up hating me. I'm sorry to all those that I hurt, especially her, and I'm sorry that I was such a stupid ugly person that only annoyed others.  I'm sorry.   Its nice that guys like you exist, and are able to be a light of friendship and hope to others, when some of us just, have no hope left, like myself :'/   I sadly have, just never works out, and I always ruin it, whether I try to change or not :/   Just happens people dont like my company.   It comes back to that thing where I feel like I hurt people more than I could give them. :/   No, not really, I just play by myself :/  	61
 Phones and computers are outside of the room for this question.   At least she's popular. That's something, I guess.   App, tool, service, etc.      Good or bad.   A single screw from Home Depot.

A show on the WB about a royal family of vampires living in England.   Win some, lose some.  A reality show following two bearded guys and one hot girl traveling the world in a VW bug to taste the hottest things and then rate them on how much it made their assholes burn.   She does have some nice tennies.   A show about my boss. Plain and simple.   A reality show about a 30 year old guy in New York, working as a model...and living with a severe case of hemorrhoids.   Sounds like a Japanese game show.   How about Dam(n) The Office?  A show about a construction crew made up of beavers, working on a riverside business park.   Boom! Roasted.   Wow a biography.  Nice.   O'Doyle rules!   And what would the newly named show be about?   Sounds like he has a good relationship with his girlfriend's wife, though.

 How do you like your flight box? Do you have an authentic or a copy?    This is SO great.    This, dude. Who is taking the picture? Someone outside the car?

This is the greatest link I've loaded all day.   I'm surprised it runs so well on mobile.    Just curious! I hate all of my rdas.

When Obama came on reddit and posted an image of a short thank you letter he wrote to us regarding fighting for net neutrality, this user wrote him a short letter back (wrote out on paper and posted an image) and spelled his own username wrong.

The app is beautiful looking. The one thing that is really bugging me is that it is impossible to read through a really long thread. While scrolling, if I make the slightest sideways movement with my thumb, it exits the thread and takes me back to the front page. I've had to open this thread over 5 times and try to relocate the place I left off.   Another issue I'm running into is that YouTube links will not open when the thumbnail is clicked (the internal browser doesn't work), but it will run the video in the YouTube app if I click on the title of the post.   Overall, the app has a beautiful appearance, but some functionality issues are bugging me a bit.    A good thing it remember is that every medication effects every person really differently. The best person to talk to is a doc or a psychiatrist.  I took Welbutrin, and I noticed that while it did help my levels of motivation, that it murdered my appetite and increased my levels of anxiety. Usually with every anti-depressant, you're going to take it for 2 weeks and feel little to nothing (except I felt quite a bit of energy the first 2 days of welbutrin), and then around that 2 week mark is when you start feeling the changes your medication will bring.   I can tell you that I took effexor for quite a long time, and while starting it (especially while leveling up doses), I couldn't even form sentences. My brain was just adjusting hardcore and I was totally just lost in a fog for a couple days. It went away quickly, though.  If what you're feeling persists for too long (a week, or less if you're real uncomfortable), talk to who prescribed it to ya.   Feeling down tonight. Figured I'd share a beautiful song.  Here's [Thank You - by Royksopp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLLbFDRG2zc)  Thank you,     forever,     for the things you've done...  Nothing     could be better,     than to say it...       .

That's really great to see.  If you feel that a stay in the hospital would be fitting for you, I'd advise to not shy away from it. While it was a hard experience, it gives a person the tools they need to really begin to start changing their life.  If you want to look into therapy, try out this awesome resource: https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/  Put in your zip, instantly get a lot of therapists around you - and you can sort by price per session (it shows what insurances they accept). I've personally gone with a therapist off there who offered $35 per session over the table, and it's one of the best choices I ever made.  That website allows you to send emails directly to each therapist, and in emailing 4 that I saw, I found that they all reply really quickly.  Just introduce yourself, and ask what their availability is like :)   That's not cool, man.   Hey there.  I feel you - I get what you're feeling. I just wanted to pop in and say that I'm feeling the same, even today. I'm a type of person that is always looking for music to comfort me in every situation, and for this situation I've got [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ7hdF7Xyns), actually called "Why Won't They Talk To Me." If you're interested in music at all, have a listen. If you like it, that whole album (Called Lonerism) really reflects that same feeling of people around you just isolating you. A few tracks are sort of like - hey fuck them, I'm better off by myself anyways (Track: Solitude is Bliss.)  Best of luck, friend. I'm trying my best to start meeting new people, because while I feel that I'm always there for everyone around me - when it comes to me being down, no one is ever really there. It's a shitty feeling to have.   You're all doing it wrong.  Use [Nuttit](http://www.nuttit.com).   True that, my friend!   Thank you for knowing this. NJOY, known as Sottera at the time, was the first company to bring the electronic cigarette to the United States. They do have beginner setups and actual vials of Eliquid with fruity flavors. Never tried it, but I support them. I got one of their cigalikes and it of course tasted real bad, but it's the only cigalike I'll use if my setup breaks down.

I can dig it up tomorrow. There's a patch that you flash before flashing Hyperdrive to fix the WiFi issue.    Did you fix the issue?   This has actually happened   This is garbage... They tested a DIY version of the product that they made, and admitted that, in the commercial version, not only might they use a higher proof alcohol, but it might be absorbed by a completely different substance - a type of sugar instead of powder. I don't understand what this is besides good comedy.    No   JOOR ZAH FRUL   Reynolds, eh? Shall we further this conspiracy and ask if this Reynolds is related to the CEO of Reynolds American -  the big tobacco company? That would make this even more interesting.    I need to see this again. Have a link to the video by chance?    Ahhh yes. Thank you.    The only issue I has with that was returning moments of mindfuck anxiety 2 days after each smoke session. Killer amounts of THC in that strain. Smells fucking strong and amazing.    Seems to be the most efficient way   Did you really photoshop this just for this occasion? This is great, man. Deserves more than 8 upvotes for sure.    Died.    Ahahahahah   What is this from again?    You probably just made my entire night. I'm gonna go get stoned and watch off the air for the rest of the night. Remind me later and I'll report back for an AMA.    This would be a really good /r/brokengifs   I've seen Outlaw 1%ers wearing swastika patches. Came here looking for a similar answer.    "Loud pipes save lives."   Can you link to the context, please?    I don't know if you seen it, but the Outlaw's female shirts say "**Property** of Outlaws MC" - I'm pretty sure it's across the tits as well.    I've spent some time around Outlaws.   Are you the racist,  anti-semitic type of Outlaw?    I've also had two bottles of skittles flavors from two different companies than the one stated both turning out tasting like rubbing alcohol.    To add onto this, I believe you're having dry hits because of the massive amount of wick. Generally, in addition to having it pulled through the coil, you'll want as little cotton as possible. Because you've got quite a bit of wick, the liquid in the wick is all sitting elsewhere and not able to move very fast to the spot you're heating with the coil.   My general rule of thumb when wicking is to put enough wick through the coil so it's not thin enough to slide through the coil on its own (without you pulling it), but it's not ever getting stuck in or choked by the coil (not difficult to pull through at all).   Also, is your coil getting red hot while it's wicked? That shouldn't ever happen. Something is up there, too.    Tobacco Company Lobbyists.    Nitecore-i2-Intellicharger is outdated. I'd recommend you don't recommend them anymore. Check out the Nitecore-D2-Intellicharger.

You don't know whether it's bad or not because you haven't done any studying. Swallowing propylene glycol, vegetable glycerin, and flavoring concentrates is completely fine.    You could drink nicotine free Eliquid, and it'd be just like drinking a soda with really concentrated flavor - or more accurately, drinking Mio.    Take it to /r/shitty_ecr   I'm actually not.

 I plan on moving to SLC, in a few months, but need to take care of things. Like, getting a job and an apartment. But I don't want to get a job without have my own transportation. I'm 21 and I don't know how to drive, nor do I have my license. This is causing me a lot of anguish, because I lived the past three years in NJ without a car, so walking to school was a nightmare, especially during the winter.  I'm tired of walking everywhere or having to spend money on cabs, or rely on people for rides. I don't know anyone in SLC, so I definitely can't rely on anyone for a ride.  Is learning to drive expensive? And since I'm 21, would I still have to drive six months with someone older than 25 before I can get a real license? That was a law in NJ. I'm not sure if it's the same over here.    Hey, I should paint Dale! I felt a special connection to him... because his name was Dale :P And thank you very much!    3   Thanks!   Haha, thank you!    Maybe sometime in the future, but as of right now, no. I like to move on to other illustrations. Like I said, this was a study. I'm not the most masterful painter in the world, nor do I have a ton of experience under my belt. I've never been the best at capturing likenesses, but this is a much better improvement that I've seen in my work. I definitely could not paint this well, three years ago.   	6
 MY PHONE JUST DIED AND WONT CHARGE SO I WONT GET L A D SCROLL AND NOT THAT FUCKIN STARTER PACK I WAS JUST GETTIN READY TO BUY AND NOW IM FUC PISSED'!!!   First would be Fuck , second My and third Life   nailedit   "WAZZZZUUUUPPP?!"   Ohh that looks amazing !   I will go with thrusting, but some kind of knotting would also be pretty good, thats why I was thinking about going for Chance since I like the head shape.   Its kinda hard to say which one i prefer since i love both of these feelings.   Hey man and thanks for answer,   Yeah I really enjoy the "filling" feeling, but I thought something with some kind of knot would be nice.   I know that plug is pretty small and I have no problem to go like 2 or more times deeper.   I was thinking about going for the Chance since I like the knot at the head of it, or shape of it (not sure how to call it), but lately I was considering something with big knot.  I would like to get something that would challenge me, but wouldnt be crazy overkill.   About the firmness, I wasnt really thinking about it, but I think that Firm would be the go-to.   Yeah Im ordering to Czech Republic so Im prepared to pay some extra, but I can deal with that.   Hello guys Im 18 years old guy who found out about Bad Dragon recently and i must say i totaly love this ! I love the people around here and all the stuff that bad dragon produces, I m just student so my money balance is pretty bad but I decided to get myself something to play with.   So here s the thing.    I m not sure what to go with, I already have (not bad dragon) [this](http://www.lovehoney.co.uk/product.cfm?p=6406) home and I can get myself open pretty good i think.  (probably not enough for large Chance, but thats pretty hardcore :))   So the thing is can you guys gimme some recommendations for what toy would be good for me ? If you wanna know something feel free to ask, I can also provide with photos if it will be of any help :) , or you might enjoy it :) .    Thanks for reading such a long post and I m sorry if I made any English mistakes :)    I know that feeling bro, I just got into Hunnie Pop and i just cant stop !   "what color is this ? "   I'm colorblind.  	10
 One night I was sitting in my couch when I saw my neighbor in his running clothes outside my window. I usually see him several times a week since he runs a lot and I spend a lot of my time in my couch. But this time something felt different. I realized something. That used to be me. I used to run a lot and I used to love it. Why don't I do that any more?   It was almost like it wasn't a decision at all. I just downloaded the app and started doing it. Sometimes it felt hard. Sometimes i wanted to quit. Most times it just felt natural and right. Like remembering something you had forgotten for a long time.   I'm finally a runner again. And now I'm on to new challenges. Keep working hard and be as awesome as I know you can be. Thanks for the support and inspiration!      I love this! Have been using something simliar on and off for the last couple of years. I always see better results on the scale when I'm actively logging my weight in my spreadsheet. Now I have a spreadsheet on google docs where me, my siblings, my husband and a friend regularly log our weight. It's really fun. Great for maintaining your weight to.    My favorite couple from The Walking dead (maybe kind of a spoiler for issue 79).  [Eric and Aaron](http://i.imgur.com/XJ5dHZk.jpg)   That looks like so much fun! Love that after pic!   	5
 What do you guys do if you're trying to fall asleep during or shortly after your comedown? Should I take NyQuil or something? Thanks   Okay so I ended up getting the Logitech G600: http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g600-mmo-gaming-mouse  it's a good mouse, has a ton of buttons (A third button to the right of the right mouse clicker AND side buttons on the scroll wheel) plus custom LED's, the works. Not sure if I can handle it all though! I just tried last night and remapped all my hotkeys and it's a little overwhelming. Maybe I just have to get used to it?   If that's not a sign I don't know what is.   Me personally I don't mind clicking on the toolbar to use my potions if it means extra keys for attacks.   Those are going pretty cheap lately too, aren't they? Never thought I'd need that many buttons until now   Oh I'm currently using all of the hotkeys on my mouse, hence why I mentioned them aha I just need more   I don't know what it is, but this image seems off to me. The bags seem smaller. Anyone else see this?   I've been meaning to get a mouse with more keys but I haven't been playing many games that demanded more buttons lately. All that changed when I bought Grim Dawn during the Summer Sale. Right now I'm stuck with the basic keyboard hotkey setup and five extra buttons to use on my mouse. What's everyone else's setup like? Any mice recommendations?   Dude I thought I was the only one.  Not only do I not have the urge to talk, I'm just 200% chill. I can sit there in silence and just watch everyone around me and be fine. It's also a little difficult for me to speak when I'm high cause my voice gets all shaky and quiet. Not really nervous but you can tell I'm blazed. My friends don't get it, they're much rowdier than me.   Please update with the models present on the board! I'd love to see more of your work :D   This is ridiculously bad ass. Nice fucking work!   Just wanted to make sure this was a genuine strain, no BS. Thank you for the response though!   At the same time, r/ShroomID is just going to be filled with people asking for ID's and nobody answering because most of them aren't knowledgable.. Which is why they're there in the first place.   Okay, we can agree to disagree at least. I just think it's really silly that everyone's getting up in arms about sales that they're not entitled to is all   But it's not hard to realize that it has a slash through "$80". I think it's common sense that most people know new games are worth $59.99 so if they "accidentally" click on it then I mean really, how can you be that careless? Not you in specific but anyone who would get angry at such a thing. I don't think they were trying to trick anyone and be nefarious about the whole thing.    Bitching about a game because you can't refund it? Were you planning on playing and then getting your money back and you're made that they "foiled your plans"?   I think OP is just disguising his reasoning. Either way it's a little whiney.   "Your game wasn't on sale so take THAT! HMPH!"  Come ooooonnnnnn haha The game only came out a little bit ago anyway. Plenty of brand new games didn't get a sale. Not Rockstar's fault everyone's too cheap to pay full price for a game. You aren't entitled to a sale.  	18
 Reflexive property, everything is equal to itself.    Should probably use a throwaway, but who gives a shit? A similar thing happened to me about a month ago, and a few months ago, but with a twist. This beautiful, amazing girl and I went on a few dates. Then she disappeared. I messaged her saying I understood if she didn't want to see me and that I would respect it, but she told me that she had depression and was into in pretty bad and she disappears when this happens to her. Then a couple months later we got together and dated for about a month and a half..then she disappeared. Long story short is that I think I scared her away by trying to see her to comfort her, and because she was my gf and I wanted to see her. Sorry this became a long story but it's making shit worse for me and I ended up venting it here. But to relate it to you, when things got better for this girl I dated she came back to me. Your friend will probably do the same.   Is it bad that I'm pretending that this is the girl who broke up with me like a month ago? Probably.  	3
 If not, Where would i start reading from?   Yes,Yes,YES!   How do you do it?   Rinoha(ff8) could be a princess of let's say Spades Since in the games Leon (Squall ff8) implies that Rinoha is either dead or somewhere "far-away".  Tiana(Princess and the frog) Spades  ...and maybe remove attributes(they aren't very well defined) just fill it with random princesses   Can animals become gods?  does eating a soul rejuvenates the body  and kudos for having easy to come up with enemies if what you told is correct.  Could you explain more about the event of a god abandoning his humanity (Going full-time god) what happens?   Could you explain entitlements? How p can they be? And are there minions and such and could an army be considered one minion since none of the soldier alone are special? After 100 hundred years do the gods start aging again or do they just become "killable" How fast can a gm come up with another god on the spot?   Well how crazy can things get? Power level wise can i make kusanagi's sword? It can cut everything.  How do the charactee feel do they all feel the same wheb playing?    Pretty much what's in the title remakes and stuff are also welcome but please tell me if there are differences from the original, thanks in advance.  oops so sorry   Pretty much what's in the title remakes and stuff are also welcome but please tell me if there are differences from the original, thanks in advance.   If so, what was you experience with it?  it looks kind of like nobilis but more streamlined and less "confusing"  	10
 I care how my genitals look and so does my wife and that does matter.   6 months tomorrow!    I'm also married to a lesbian! However, since I am one and I'm actually married to her, I think mine turned out better.   Well we have been married for 6 months tomorrow. I guess it was the right choice!   Thanks for clearing this up!   All of that is estimated extremely high and is a setup for two gerbils.   Don't get one; get two. They are very social.   We haven't! Exhibit a; my mother. I like girls and am married to one and that's great. I wear men's shorts and all of a sudden I'm trans and no longer her only daughter.   I'm a trying-not-to-be-trans only "girl" of four as well. I hope it goes over well!   Lesbian here as well. My wife takes everything. She's high femme yet somehow all of my t-shirts and jeans and boxers and sports bras and hoodies are always missing.   I'm sorry to hear that. I live in the states, and qualify for welfare health insurance so mine is paid for despite living in a country known for shitty healthcare. I hope you find something that works for you.    Little kids laughing, dogs sniffing flowers, strangers saying good morning.   Well I'd start by calling a hotline to keep myself from doing it. If I needed, I'd make my way to an emergency room.    I sort of have this. My wife is agreeing to me taking time off until I'm ready to go back to work, but I do resume college in August. I haven't worked or gone to school since mid February. I am using it to sort out my mental health issues. I have depression and anxiety and suspicions of PTSD/BPD/bipolar, and any combination thereof. I'm working on that. If I were healthier mentally I'd be getting fit, since I'm fat. Right now though, I don't need the added stress of counting calories and stress of not losing fast enough.    Yep. They pick through the garbage, pick through dumpsters, pick up change to buy food.   1346 words 7493 characters, ignoring the last line about mods.

Race isn't real, so you can't have a "white soul". And why does it matter what makes someone trans? The only thing that helps transpeople is transition.   What black child wouldn't want to be white? It's easier to get a job, less hassle from police, and plenty more perks.   You provided nothing to say that people even experience racial dysphoria. They are different because race is not real and gender is.   No, I don't, but until you can show me proof of "racial transition" being an affective way to treat "racial dysphoria" I don't feel it's equal to transexualism. There are tons of sources of proof that transition is the only affective treatment for transpeople. Are you actually trying to imply that transitioning is equal to blackface?   Do you realize that killing pets during childhood is something many sociopaths do? I think they should err on the side of caution and take her to counselling.   No problem! I hate seeing people upset when there isn't too much of a reason for it. I get how /u/Aerik came to his conclusion but I just didn't see it that way.   Race isn't real, sweetie, that's already been established. People try to darken their skin all the time; it's called tanning.      I'm a lesbian. I think it's more like he feels bad that he couldn't be "good" enough for her to want to continue to completion. He did something better than that, though. He stopped when her consent was gone, even though she had already agreed.    I don't mean to pressure you, but I kept trying to get better on my own and trying to ignore it. Make one appointment. If you hate it, quit. If you like it but hate the person, switch. It is so worth it to go. Just give it a shot. One appointment is an obligation to nothing more than an hour. Please try it out.   I thought Ireland legalized a couple weeks ago? Anyway, I'm sorry you had that experience. For me, being gay in high school wasn't so bad. Aside from my wife I had supportive friends and a younger brother who beat everyone up who picked on me. Even teachers weren't awful. I had a few issues but never physical violence. I hope you can do something to help you get better with that. Maybe try counselling; it helps me a lot.   We do! Since I'm not even 21 yet we were told to bring our marriage licence everywhere. We live in a state that is kind of ass backwards so we were told that for safety we should always have it. We think we are the youngest married same sex couple in our area. We also appreciate that we are each others only sexual partner. We got really lucky that we met so young.   I'd wager that it's a fake name and not really identifying. Hell, my username will lead you to my fake name Facebook.   I was nervously writing more neatly than usual. When I take notes in class I can't even read them. I don't even bother anymore.   My older brother is adopted, and we are 24 years apart in age. He and I are so much alike it's scary. My mom will call me (her daughter) his name is frustration. Familial ties have nothing to do with blood.   No the very first time per session anything is inside is the best feeling in the world, even if its only a little bit in.   My wife disagrees with you, and she has a big leeeeeeesbian crush on me, so suck on that!   Hahaha well she was sort of seeing/friends with a girl at my table so she was around a lot. I've always had a ton of male friends so she thought I was dating three guys at once. We ended up having a lot of friends in common and when things went sour with the other girl, she came to me because, since I was gay, it was a safe spot. We became friends fast since I'm wonderful and yeah. I made a point of being a shining star for her. I stuck up for her in two different lunch time drama events and then waited for her by the busses the next school year and carried her bookbag the one time each day I had the opportunity. I didn't know how to go about proving myself without being "the guy" so that's what I did.   Fun fact: it took me three months from meeting to learn her name.   [OP Delivers](http://imgur.com/MwAc6eq)   At my school, sort of poor meant 40 cents for any lunch and really poor was free for any lunch.   My mom always made sure we had lunchables for field trips for this exact reason! We got free lunch so regular school days we had hot food.    I graduated three years ago yesterday. I still talk to my wife, one friend and her husband who I went to high school with.    Female here. I used to work with a man with Down syndrome. His father informed me that his handwriting is nicer than mine. He was so right I couldn't even be mad.   Wal-Mart brand is edible. Way better than Digiorno.   60 seconds? Bro I can pop a top and grab a fork in like 7 seconds.   I'm not prego, but grew up poor. Lunchables are where it's at.   No, no! It's a good thing when boys do that! It means they like you! /s   You do realize this went from issues faced by a group to "but sex lel" right? It's not just someone stating that they are attracted to short girls.       When I was 15, I met this girl in the lunch line at school. The first word she ever said in front of me were to a mutual friend about me; "Can you please get this girl the fuck away from me?"   For me, it was love at first sight. It took six months, but I finally told her how I felt. She rejected me, but nicely, saying that if how she felt changed, she'd tell me.  Two months later, she said she liked me, too, but was afraid of ruining our friendship. Three days later, she finally changed her mind. That was October 10, 2010. By December we were picking out baby names.   On Wednesday, it will be our 6 month wedding anniversary. I love this girl more and more every day. She's so great.   I wouldn't; he seems like a pushy dick.   I think whoever asks is expected to pay. I'm a lesbian, so there is no man. But for the people I know, the understanding is that whoever asks the other out is planning to pay.   Fuck yeah objectification!   Yay for you! Love comes in all kinds of packages. Enjoy your budding love.    My wife. She is just so lovely. She hugs and cuddles me when I need it and she is my hero. I love her so much.   You know this is a subreddit to make fun of neckbeard behavior, not flash it around, right?   Don't look at me, I voted for Kuzko.     Caitlin Jenner is not brave, soldiers and kids with cancer are brave. Brave can only describe one person you see.   It's a cool place; and they say it gets colder    At that point you should just stand in the kitchen.   Woot woot! Congrats!   Okay? An adopted child may very well identify more with the culture of their family than their own "racial" culture. Surprisingly, though, race is a created concept. There is nothing to actually separate races.   Except you file your own tax return, not list it on your parent's.   It's a photo ID issue, not birth certificate. If you don't live in a city, IDs are hard to acquire. It requires that you have the time off when the DMV is open, you have to have transportation that you can afford with your day off to go to the DMV, then you have to remember to do it all again in a few years when it expires.   Hey there! My wife's mother is in fact Mother Gothel and my father is a hoarder who likes to threaten to kick us out! My dad and I got good now by us leaving for a few days. When he realized how much he needs us here to help, he got over himself. My wife is finally good with her mother by leaving. It hurts, but show her that you aren't afraid to cut her out. It will build respect. Also, remember that hoarding is a mental illness and she really can't help it in a lot of ways. Best of luck and pm me if I can help at all!   Are you just not a good candidate for a vback? I feel really bad for you that you can't have all the children you want. Are surrogacy and adoption out of the question?   If you don't mind my asking, how does the c-section keep you from having another baby? And I wasn't aware that the cord being wrapped could cause special needs. The more you know I guess.   I love my rodeoh boxer harness paired with a Maia suction dildo. So does my wife.   Even if his girlfriend were male it isn't relevant to the story.   I'm 20(f) and shop at Aeropostale (men's department) almost exclusively. The over branding has really gone down and the clothes are cheap and last and fit me well.    That really made me bust out laughing!   Makes transphobic comments, has a stupid username, I'd say that's an asshole.   My wife actually signed up to be a Mary Kay lady just for the bag of cheap stuff and that's the sunscreen I use now, it just isn't cheap.   I don't know how much i believe that sub. I post fairly commonly that I'm a woman and that I'm a lesbian and I have never received a creepy pm.    I got banned from r/feminism and they won't tell me why and from all related subs despite being a feminist. I also got shadowbanned last week because my wife upvoted me in trollx.   Russia isn't exactly the third world, bud.   But you don't have the temptation of Tinder   I think I understand what you meant; often straight, white, cisgender, Christian men are unaware. Our society us designed for everything to be perfect if you fall into those categories. That doesn't mean they are all unaware, but many are.    Not all men!!1!!!1   I hate when it's just number two. I don't sub fph for a reason. I hate when this sub circlejerks as fph Jr.   Did you even read what I wrote?   They carry it at my Dollar Tree! Try looking there next time you need it.   I am a big fan of turking which beer money recommends. That helps me fund mine, too.   I've had it my whole life on my arms. I use my face routine on my arms, but I exfoliate daily and use a lot of salicylic acid on my arms that I don't on my face. It's clearing up well.   One thing that, growing up, always dissuaded me from proper skincare was the cost. When you are poor, the investment is often too much to come up with, even though many products will last you a really long time. I have excellent skin to begin with, though it is very sensitive. I get hormonal acne when I ovulate and during my period, but mostly my skin has always been clear. I have created a guide for products that I've used and have seen work well but are low cost and not harsh on my sensitive skin. Obviously I'm not a dermatologist, so your results may vary.  **Spot Treatment**  **$1** [Acne Cream](http://www.dollartree.com/Acne-Cream-1-5-oz-Tubes/p346503/index.pro) as it is simply titled has worked great for me. It disappears and I add moisturizer over it and have never had any drying. It only costs a dollar and is available online at that link or at most Dollar Tree stores.   ^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(.5%), ^carbomer, ^cetyl ^alcohol, ^dimethicone, ^glycerin, ^glycol ^stearate, ^methylparaben, ^propylen ^glycol, ^propylparaben, ^squalane, ^triethanolamine, ^water  **Cleanser**  **$1** [Acne Wipes](http://www.dollartree.com/Premoistened-Acne-Face-Wipes-30-ct-Packs/p321467/index.pro) which are also simply titled are something I use once every other day. Also available from the link and Dollar Tree stores.   ^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(.5%), ^water, ^cetearyl ^Isononanoate, ^ceteareth-20, ^fragrance, ^cetearyl ^alcohol, ^glyceryl ^stearate, ^glycerin, ^ceteareth-12, ^cetyl ^palmitate, ^propylene ^glycol, ^methylparaben, ^disodium ^EDTA, ^propylparaben, ^2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1, ^3-diol  **1$** [Acne Cleanser Pads](http://i.imgur.com/6s6Nyaq.jpg) weren't listed on the website for Dollar Tree, but that is where I have purchased them. They are a bit stronger than the wipes and I use them when I have breakouts, still every other day, and when I'm in a rush.  ^*Ingredients* ^Salicylic ^Acid ^(1.0%), ^alcohol, ^aloe ^barbadensis ^leaf ^juice, ^fragrance, ^polysorbate ^20, ^sodium ^chloride, ^tocopheryl ^acetate, ^water  **$6.47** [Equate Gentle Skin Cleanser](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Gentle-Formula-Skin-Cleanser-16-Fl-Oz/10417272) is used before either of the other two products, as neither are true cleansers. This is a generic version of the much raved Cetaphil product and is much cheaper and very effective. It also has the option of leaving it on your skin and not requiring a rinse. It's slightly expensive at $6.47 for 16 fluid ounces.  ^*[Ingerdients](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Gentle-Formula-Skin-Cleanser-16-Fl-Oz/10417272#Ingredients)*  **Exfoliation**  **$2.97** [Equate Blackhead Clearing Scrub](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Acne-Medication-Blackhead-Clearing-Scrub-5-oz/10403006) is a product for under three dollars that works very well, including clearing up sebaceous filaments. It is a little harsh, and I can only use it every other day to every two days, but it works immediately and the effects last. It is a physical exfoliant and a lot of people don't like that, but I like this product.   The ingredients are in the link.  **Moisturizing**  **$6.47** [Equate Moisturizing Lotion](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Fragrance-Free-Sensitive-Skin-Moisturizing-Lotion-16-fl-oz/10403103) is another product comparable to Cetaphil. When I first bought this, I hated it. It took me a while to learn that only a very small amount should be used, otherwise my skin was greasy and it was causing breakouts. Like it's cleansing cousin, it's a bit more expensive at about $6.50 for 16 fluid ounces.   Ingredients are in the link.  **$6.27** [Equate Oil-Free Ultra-Gentle Facial Moisturizer](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Equate-Oil-Free-Ultra-Gentle-Facial-Moisturizer-4-fl-oz/37233433) is a smaller bottle for about the same money, but never left my face greasy no matter how much I used. It's a 4 fluid ounce bottle at about $6.25.   Ingredients are in the link.  **Sunscreen**  **$1-$5** I generally just buy what doesn't eat my face from either Five Below or Dollar Tree. I used trial and error to find one for me, and it's baby sunblock.   ~  With the products that I use, I spend about $3.50 a month on skincare. I used poor lotion until I could swing the good stuff and it never really hurt me, other than learning that I'm allergic to Jergens but I only used it for three days. Dollar Tree carries moisturizer, but I've never tried it. If anyone has, please offer input. I built as I needed to, not everything at once. I hope this helps even one person to be able to take care of their skin on a budget.   It's a grandma thing to compare guns and cell phones. It's a grandma thing to be progun and anti cell phone.    I live 3 exits on 80 into PA. We're like next door neighbors! I frequently got called Teresa and I always have to spell "Tricia" out for people because they always want to spell it "Trisha" even though we all know "Tricia" is better. I hated being called Trish until I was like 14. I wanted Tricia. Now I don't care either way but I could never get behind anything but Trish for a nickname.    My understanding is that they usually figure it out by then. Though, if they don't the parent should definitely tell them. From what I've learned telling a kid too soon can be devastating and cause more problems. I guess it's all about finding a happy medium.   My mom picked Tricia because she specifically didn't want me to go by Pat or Patty. Since I'm a butch dyke she probably made the right choice in forcing me to have something about me be feminine. I don't know where you live, but I live in PA and a lot of transgender people I know changed their names for under 40 dollars.    I've heard that it's best to let a kid who is high functioning figure it out themselves.   Not that it excuses his behavior, but sometimes guys in their 30s react that way to fatherhood. Its scary for a 17 year old and they notoriously make poor decisions. Just love your boy and do what you can to fill that role. If the father doesn't want to be involved, your kiddo is better off with you and not him. Best wishes!      I'm also a Tricia; I just go by Trish. Are you a Tricia or a Patricia? I'm just a Tricia.   It's not really better that you left out the hash tag. Reddit isn't an advertising platform.   That was my perception of that post, too.   Hey there fellow Trish!   I think that's probably really good advice but I like food and hate exercise so I probably won't follow it lol   Construction workers.  Plumbers.  Urologist.  Since they are all gay I assume all female domestic abuse therapists, gynecologists, and daycare workers are all lesbians, since the adults they all typically interact with are women.   These signs make me really uncomfortable. My parents have been together forever and the idea of infidelity makes me literally nauseous.    Hmm... Could be a touch if each.   No! Omg I didn't even realize it could be read like that. No I wanted to discuss with her sex. Not discuss sex with her.      My brother always says that if God didn't want him to whack it he'd have put it in the middle of his back.   I didn't mean for this to sound so excited; I had just learned it and I get over enthusiastic about everything.   My wife and I have discussed hysterectomy and once I have a baby we will probably take that route; my mom and maternal first cousin both had cervical cancer that left them both infertile (I was a huge thought to be impossible surprise after 16 years). I don't want to end up risking it, and my mom (who is my best friend) and my wife are all in agreement that that is pretty much the best route.   I actually want all tissue removed. Any scar tissue is a heightened risk of breast cancer. I don't care if it isn't quite male looking. I am genderqueer and mostly just care about not wearing a bra. Regardless of the results and cost, I will eventually have a mastectomy to have all of the tissue removed.   I don't want a positive result. Despite my planning to remove affected organs, I plan to have at least one biological child and I don't want to pass it along. I just like to have as much information as I can get ahead of time and I like learning from other people's experience.   If the whole point in having a kid is to be genetically related, you're doing it for the wrong reasons.   Medicaid is for everyone. Did you even apply?   Edit: my information was apparently wrong. I learned in a social work class that it was for everyone; apparently it was meant that it *can* be for everyone. My 19 year old brother who is healthy as a horse also receives Medicaid. I wasn't aware that states could make restrictions beyond income. That's a disgusting thing.   Doing an AMA in al. :)   I appreciate that! That was very sweet of you.   Who seriously goes to a major corporate interview with green hair if the job isn't working for a cosmetic company? I love me some bright hair but I'd never go to a job interview like that.   I'm not a catiologist but that sounds like stress and it could be a blood clot.   I just hunted for the picture and damn boy! You look good!   If it's positive will they pay for top surgery? If it's negative will it be more difficult to get top surgery? I'm currently on Medicaid. I hope to have a baby before top surgery but if my wife is willing to induce lactation it's not vital that I do so; I just care that my baby is breastfed.      Some people can't and that's okay, as long as they don't adopt and subject a kid to that. It doesn't make someone a bad person not to have that ability.   Deleted   The worst part is is that the rational is that "Bruce" was her given name. Her given name was "William" and no one ever minded calling her "Bruce".   Adoption isn't faking it and not everyone has the ability to love an adopted child the same way.   NO ZOOBY IT IS THEY CANT TELL LIES ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB.  XOXOXO LOVE GRAMMA SMOOCHES!   On the other hand, why should a kid in Tennessee get a worse education than one in New Jersey? They shouldn't and standards are the way to make that happen.   Not quite. He was animated from 1994 to 2008 and a live action version was reintroduced in 2008. I was so confused for a minute there; I was born in December  1994 and have vivid memories of Kool Aid Man Kool Aid commercials.   It takes courage to be open about who you are. Regardless of her shitty political position, she was courageous. At 65, when she likely has 20 years left, she announced something the world hates; that she is a transwoman. She was open about that fact despite all of the attacks she has faced.    That's probably why you were at 0 when I saw this. Jerks...   You're seriously advertising with a hash tag on reddit? Get a life.   Check out your local PFLAG group. Mine has great resources for our area and yours may as well.   Aww! Thank you!   The thread was kind of dead when I posted so I guess only transphobes were left and used it as a chance to downvote.      Sadly the downvotes were in trollx. I avoid default subs, especially anything having to do with human rights.   I started in the middle of my last final my freshman year of college. All over my fabric chair. I was done first and had no choice but to leave it. Happily, the chairs were all being thrown out that day because the campus was moving locations.    Same here. I have obvious ovulation symptoms but my period doesn't care about all of that. It comes when it's ready.   I was sort of on your side until this comment.       That place seems like the sort of wayward troll child of fph and trp.    I have had alterations with MRAs in there, too.   I think that's why we take leg beard as a compliment over there. If being a leg beard is wrong I don't want to be right.   I was in a conversation yesterday on there with someone from fph. They were basically laughed out of the comment section.   You're right. I was speed reading and usually came right before lite and confused me. Sorry bout that.  	136
 Thank you! I wasn't sure I would look good with that bright a color, but I went for it and I'm really glad with how it turned out.   Aww, thanks!      Thanks, haha. As you can probably tell this is something I'm pretty passionate about.   Alternatively, it could just as easily be that Tysha's mother served as a servant in the Lannister household, and that's where she heard the song. And as a Lannister servant, she named her child for her liegelord, even though they were unrelated. There's nothing really strong to say your theory isn't true, but there isn't really any strong evidence for it either. But it was certainly fun to think about.   No problem. Not many people use or even know the term, even in the LGBTQ community, and lots of people who are pan will tell people they are bi because it's easier and people will immediately know what they're talking about. Unfortunately that causes a cycle of people not knowing the term, so people don't use it to avoid confusion, so people don't know the term, and so on. But as someone who knows the pain of having to explain their identity over and over I get why they don't use it.  Edit: typos (auto correct is the name of my existence)   It somewhat depends on who you ask. But yeah, for some people the distinction very much matters. The main issue is that bi implies two and only two, which ignores people who are non binary. The term pansexual was coined to be more inclusive of people who are agender, third gender, gender queer, gender fluid, etc. Some people assume bisexual means you're attracted to people regardless of gender, which is definitely true for some bisexuals. But it isn't always the case - there are many bi people who aren't attracted to and won't date non-binary people or trans people. Also, using pansexual to refer to attraction to all genders opens up bisexual for those who are only attracted to 2 other than male and female - for example, some people who identify as bi are attracted to female and androgynous persons, but not males.   I think the biggest reason why most people associate PTSD with combat is that for the longest time, that's how the medical community understood it. The phenomenon was first observed in veterans from WWI, and at the time it was referred to as shell-shock. All these early associations were reinforced by later research. Most studies I have seen (quite a few as I'm in the field of psychology) use soldiers in combat or survivors of sexual assault as their participants. And most of the current knowledge we have of the disorder came from studying Vietnam vets.   This has all been picked up by various media - countless books, movies, tv shows, comics, etc. reference PTSD from combat. And Hollywood is slow to move on, so while mental health professionals know that PTSD can be caused by any traumatic event, most laymen do not.   Fair, but I'll take "formulaic badass masculine guys turning out to be completely decent human beings" over the formulaic action hero who's a raging jackass any day.   Well, technically Iron Bull is canonically pansexual, but the distinction doesn't really matter in the comic.   That's not a bad idea. It would incorporate both my concepts nicely. I'll toy around with some sketches and see what I come up with. Thanks.      Even if the legal benefits weren't that big a deal (which there are many and they are definitely important), I would argue that it's still worth fighting for on principle. Even if you or any random LGBTQ person didn't *want* to get married, the fact that the law discriminates against them is wrong, in the same way that the Boy Scouts not accepting gay or trans leaders/members is wrong, or being fired from your job because you're transitioning is wrong.   There isn't really a "normal" for this sort of thing. It depends entirely on the person and situation. There's no definite point at which you can say you should be fine with it.   In any case, it might just be that OP needs more time to process. It took me years to resolve my anger, and it's still not completely gone. But it doesn't take the forefront anymore.   Speaking as someone who as abused by family members, I totally see your point, but you also have to consider that pushing someone to confront the person who abused them *before they are ready* can just retraumatize them and make things worse. Yes, it's true that when sexual assault goes unreported there is no possibility of justice. But seeking out that justice is also a long and difficult process, so we should try our best to be encouraging to OP without badgering her or guilting her into doing something she can't handle yet. I know that when people tried to tell me things I *had to* do when it came to dealing with my abuse it didn't really help me at all, only made me feel more anxiety and depression and all that awfulness. So just keep that in mind.   I'm pretty sure that if you go to the emergency room and report a rape, the standard procedure after a rape kit is to give you emergency contraceptives and a full std screening. Also there's a good chance (assuming OP is a minor) they would immediately remove her from living with her dad and place her under the custody of the state pending an investigation. So it would probably be a good idea to report.   That's probably part of it - the stubble stage is just so awful that I keep it short just to avoid that. But I imagine it's a lot like when you go from really short hair to longer hair with a haircut - when it's just long enough to stick to your neck it's awful. But once it grows out to your shoulders and you can wear in in a ponytail it's not so bad.   Sounds like your wife has my kind of sense of humor. I would totally do the same thing lol   I actually prefer to shave my pits because I don't like the feeling of armpit hair rubbing up against my shirts and stuff. But I totally don't judge anyone who prefers not to shave. It's just what I like.  As far as pubes and legs go, that doesn't bother me at all for some reason so I let that grow out.   I used to shave, not really often but I hated it. I prefer to use trimmers to keep it manageable and easier to clean my vulva. But otherwise I don't worry about pubic hair. Anyone who claims hairy genitals are disgusting is just being immature. Pubic hair is healthy - it's there for a fucking reason. There is nothing wrong with it.  (Not to say that people who do shave/wax/etc. should be ashamed of doing so, it's your choice so do whatever makes you feel good.)  My routine now is give it a trim about every 3 weeks or so. That way it's not too out of control, but I also don't have to worry about razor burn, cuts, etc. and it's not at all painful.   Thanks for the reassurance! This seems like a really nice and understanding sub and I'm really glad I found it.    Gotcha. Well I really don't understand why they're so against it, it makes less sense than your sister not wanting you to work there. Parents are weird sometimes though. /shrugs/   That's good. Even if someone shouldn't associate with a friend, family member, or partner anymore trying to push them into it can just make things worse. They might stubbornly refuse just because they don't want to feel like they were forced into it, or out might stress them out if they aren't ready.   Also I should probably clarify that I wasn't trying to get down in you or anything, it's just a really serious topic so I felt like I should give some weight to it.   There most likely will be a tough transition period right after your boyfriend moves out. People like his dad tend not to respect boundaries and can really freak out whenever you start enforcing them. So be ready for that. But ultimately moving out will probably make him feel a lot better so there's still something to look forward to!  All that aside, your boyfriend is lucky to have you to support him through this and I hope you guys make it through okay. Give him my well-wishes and all the best to both of you!   Well I guess I'm the type of person who really values communication and even if it didn't change his mind, I would feel like it was unresolved if I didn't confront him about it. So that's just what I would do. But I suppose not everybody would care enough to.   As someone who was also watched in the shower as a kid (though not as bad as OP's fiance's situation), I can't stand clear shower curtains or glass doors because my abuser could look through them and they still make me feel really uncomfortable. I feel much better with a completely opaque curtain. So yeah, OP should definitely ask to see what she is cooler with.   That's actually really common. A lot of straight, macho guys have secret "girly" hobbies because it's tough to constantly project a super-masculine persona.  Also, being a cross-dresser doesn't automatically make your boyfriend gay or means he wants to be a woman, but it was probably good to clarify.   I think it's understandable that you would be surprised by this sort of thing and a little freaked out. This sort of situation is one that a lot of people are aware of but don't really think will ever happen to them.  However, I don't think this has to have a negative impact on your relationship. You clearly love him very much, and it's not as if crossdressing is bad or hurts anyone. It might be one thing if he told you he was secretly a serial killer or something, but honestly, what's the harm in your boyfriend wearing women's clothes sometimes?  Our society places a lot of pressure on guys to be super macho and manly and there can be some pretty serious consequences for anyone who doesn't conform to that. Men who don't live up to the ideal are called gay or pussy or whatever other nonsense, sometimes they're bullied or even assaulted by people who are just ignorant and hateful. So it's understandable that your boyfriend was afraid to tell you about this. But coming clean means he trusts you and wants you to love all of him. That says a lot.  I think you need to do a little soul-searching about this. Does the idea of your boyfriend crossdressing really bother you? Why? Are these good reasons to feel that way or ask him not to do it around you?  Honestly, it might help to view it as just another hobby, like how he goes fishing or hunting or working on cars. You might not necessarily be interested in those things, but that doesn't mean you can't still have a solid, meaningful relationship with him. I'm sure you have some hobbies or interests that he doesn't really get or particularly care for. And that's okay. You don't have to like everything he likes, or vice versa. The important thing is that you still love each other and support each other regardless.  Who knows, after the initial shock wears off you might find that it doesn't really bother you as much and you can help him shop for outfits or whatever. It would probably mean a lot to him.   If their only concern is that you are too young to be married, I wouldn't worry too much about it.  Every person is different, every relationship is different. Sometimes you just know when something feels right. And from what you describe, you guys sound like a really good fit for each other. You've known each other for years, you've lived together for years, and you don't plan on actually getting married for years. It's not like you rushed into this. You genuinely seem to enjoy each other and your relationship, so I say go for it!  Nobody but you can decide if you're ready for that kind of commitment, so if people are giving you a hard time because you're only in your twenties, take it with a grain of salt. Engagement, while important and a big commitment on its own, is not as final as marriage. You two have plenty of time left before you leave college, so you know it's not going to be official for a while. That gives you plenty of time to reconsider if you need to. So don't stress too much about it.   I would be more comfortable giving advice directly to your boyfriend about this, but maybe he doesn't reddit or isn't comfortable talking about it. So I'll address you instead as someone who is dating a person with family problems.  I've been in your boyfriend's shoes and yours. I've had to deal with a parent who just got so toxic and abusive that I had to cut them out of my life completely. I've also had a partner who had a parent that was toxic and abusive and is still in contact with them. So I can relate to you both.  I think the first thing you need to recognize is that whatever you might think, cutting off contact with his dad is ultimately your boyfriend's decision. Whatever he chooses to do, the best possible thing that YOU can do, OP, is to support him. Give him whatever he needs, be it the courage to stand up to his dad (although it sounds like he's already making progress there), someone to vent to when his dad does awful things, or helping him through removing his dad from his life. Regardless of what he decides to do he will need your help. This isn't a decision someone makes lightly, and it can be pretty terrifying.  The important thing to keep in mind is that your boyfriend has to do what is best and healthiest for him. Obviously his dad is really making things hard on him, so he should probably limit his contact with him at the very least. If he decides not to cut out his dad completely, you should be prepared for dealing with him and the emotional impact he has on your boyfriend for the long term.  If he does cut him off completely, he will most likely get an initial backlash from his dad. Whenever I first cut my abusive step dad out of my life, I got a flood of texts and calls, all hours of the night. Next came the facebook messages and email. When I ignored all those he started manipulating other family members into contacting me for them. He would tell my little sister to say that he really misses me; once his sister got in touch with me and tried to convince me to start talking to him again. It took a long while for no contact to actually result in no contact.  Another problem is that your boyfriend will probably have to deal with a lot of harsh judgement from others. One of the problems with abusive family members is that the abuser and the abused are sometimes the only ones who know about it or know the full story. A LOT of people have criticized me for making the decision I did to stop talking to my step dad. Sometimes they mean well, but none of them really knew what I was going through or fully why I chose to stop talking to him, so I know they're wrong, but it can still be really hard having people judge you for something like that. It takes a lot of courage to remove someone like that from your life, and it hurts when people misconstrue your choices and try to guilt trip you for them.  I hope some of this insight helps you and your boyfriend figure out what you both need to do. Also, if you would like some more specific support from people who have gone through this sort of thing, you should check out some other subreddits:  * /r/parentlessbychoice  * /r/survivorsofabuse  * /r/raisedbynarcissists     He told me when we started dating that she was a lesbian. I didn't believe him because she's got a kid, come on.  Having a kid doesn't necessarily mean you aren't a lesbian. I've known people who came out as gay after years of denial and failed marriages with kids.  However, it sounds like your boyfriend told you Anne was a lesbian so that you wouldn't be jealous of him spending time with her. That's shitty and manipulative and completely unacceptable behavior.   It isn't jealous or controlling or being insecure to want your partner to be honest with you and respect your feelings. Your boyfriend is not doing that. He lied about his best friend's sexuality so that you wouldn't suspect anything. He ignores your feelings and refuses to acknowledge anything is wrong. That is not a healthy relationship.  If I were in your position, I would confront him about this. It's not wrong to still be friends with someone you have a sexual history with - my fiance still talks to some of his exes and it's no big deal. But they've also set up clear boundaries and there is no interest to get back together. He also flirts with other women from time to time, which we've talked about and have established as okay. If he had feelings for or wanted something more with an friend, I would expect him to be honest about it and tell me how he's feeling, and if he chose to pursue someone else I'd be fine with that (but I'm poly so that might not be true for you). Instead, your boyfriend isn't even giving you the chance to talk about it - he tried to cover it all up from the get-go. That is a big, fat red flag.   You need to talk to him about this. And don't let him just dismiss your concerns with "you're being insecure." It's not insecure to feel hurt whenever someone is misleading you and ignores you in favor of someone else. Ask him to explain what's really going on and why he's acting like this. And if he continues to disrespect you or you don't like his answers, dump him because he's not worth it.   I used to feel like that a lot, especially right after I got out of my abusive situation. But after a while I realized that I was spending so much energy being angry that was essentially wasted. Whether or not I am actively mad at my abuser, he's still going to be living his life completely unaware of my feelings. Being mad doesn't help me or hurt him. So instead I try to focus that energy on things that do help me. I do a lot of crafting stuff - origami, paper craft, knitting, crochet, cross stitch, etc. Whenever I get wrapped up in all the negative emotions I throw myself into something creative instead. Making things helps me feel good about myself and has even helped me make a little money, and that's much more worth my time than dwelling on anger.  I realize that setting aside those feelings is easier said than done. But you owe it to yourself to use your energy and time doing something good for yourself instead of wasting it on someone who isn't worth it.   [Indeed](http://www.reactiongifs.us/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/fist_bump_shawn_gus_psych.gif)   I feel like I probably did at one point. But my trauma wasn't a single event in adulthood or anything, I was traumatized for years during childhood, starting at around 9 or so. If I was normal before then I don't really remember it, and all of my experiences since have been altered by that trauma. It's incredibly, profoundly unnerving to realize that you will never be normal and will have to carry your trauma around with you forever. I feel you.   I'd be willing to be a pen pal. I can certainly relate to struggling to express yourself to people and dealing with mental illness while living in poverty. PM me and we can exchange email if you like.   That's basically where I'm at with it too. At some point you just have to start prioritizing your own mental health above trying to make nice with people. Some people view that as selfish, I view it as self-preservation.   That's definitely a tough problem. I had to leave some stuff behind too whenever my parents got divorced and I moved away for college (for my own sanity). The stuff with my mom is fine, and I still talk to her, so I've had access to it. But the stuff that my step dad took I've chalked up as lost forever because I'm NC with him and his family and he's probably already sold it on ebay.  There might be some sort of legal avenue you can use to get your stuff back? Hiring a lawyer is obviously expensive but you could try talking to /r/legaladvice just to get an idea about what sort of options you have there.  Otherwise, you might be better off just trying to replace it. I personally wouldn't be able to emotionally handle asking for my stuff back from my abusive family members. I guess you just have to figure out if you're willing to deal with the emotional damage to get the possibility of regaining some of your possessions (because after all, even if you contact her there's no guarantee she'll cooperate in giving it back).   I don't really see it ending either. But I don't have the energy to fight people about it. So I mostly gave up doing that and I just nod along and give noncommittal answers whenever someone starts the "you should reconnect with your family" lecture.    There's probably some truth to that. My newer, closer friends all accept my NC as I'm pretty confident about it now, but when I was still LC with my step dad, I was confused and a little unsure about it. So I guess people probably picked up on that at the time, and people who weren't as close to me and didn't know the details would certainly misconstrue things and try to convince me to talk to him again. It also took me longer to recognize that my step dad was abusive, so when I told people why I was avoiding him at first I just said we disagreed about my NC with my brother. It wasn't until I realized that what my step dad was doing was abusive too and firmly decided on NC that my friends seemed to realize I was serious about it and the problem wasn't just one disagreement. Although, I still get crap from family and acquaintances who mean well but don't know what they're talking about.   Yeah, they are. But if I didn't have sex or another orgasm for the rest of my life I wouldn't really care. I don't seek it out, but if I happen to get it then that's cool.   And it's okay, this is an AMA, I did this so people could ask questions they aren't necessarily comfortable asking someone in person. Although I've had people ask me about sex a lot so I'm also fairly used to it lol   Yes. I have an extremely low sex drive so I don't usually initiate sex. But I'm sex-neutral so I don't mind doing it. My main motivation is emotional rather than physical - I like being close to them, and making them feel good, so even though I could care less about getting off I still enjoy it.   Not all asexual people feel that way, though - some of them are sex-repulsed (also called sex-averse) and don't like sex at all. Even the thought of it grosses them out o makes them uncomfortable. My opinion is more of a resounding "meh."   Nice! Pan-ace buddies!   I've been really fortunate in that both my partners are very understanding about it. But not everyone is accepting, so it can be scary. Hopefully though you can gain more confidence and have a successful relationship in the future, of that's something you want. Also, if you haven't already you should check out /r/asexuality.  Edit: I realized I didn't really answer your question. Most people I tell have never heard of any of this stuff, so my standard coming out experience is 20-30 minutes of explaining how asexuality works. It's a difficult concept for some people to grasp, for sure. I imagine it's a lot like telling people you grew up in a foreign country very different from theirs - people tend to have a lot of questions about how it works.   Not usually. If they ask for specifics I'll tell them but usually for the sake of brevity I'll say I'm queer, or just asexual. Honestly 99% of people I've come out to haven't even heard of asexuality so I'm usually stuck just explaining that concept, let alone the romantic attraction and non-binary gender.   The simple answer is, because I love them.  I don't feel sexual attraction, but I still feel emotional attraction. And I am very much romantically attracted to both my partners. For me, sex just isn't a necessary part of those relationships.   Hello, reddit! A lot of people don't know much about polyamory, non-binary people, or asexuality in my personal experience, and lots of people are curious. So if you'd like to know anything about my experiences as a member of any of these groups, here's your chance.  If you're unfamiliar with any of those terms, here are some basic definitions so we're all on the same page:  * [Polyamory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyamory): the acknowledgement that it's okay to have more than one sexual or romantic partner simultaneously. People who are polyamorous practice ethical non-monogamy - essentially, they don't limit themselves to one partner at a time with the consent of everyone involved. * Non-binary: refers to people whose gender identity isn't strictly "male" or "female" but possibly neither or something in between. * Panromantic: attracted emotionally or romantically to all genders/sexes. * Asexual: does not experience physical or sexual attraction to any gender/sex.  So, if you have any questions about my sexuality, gender identity, or relationships, AMA!   Good luck! From what you've said about them they seem like nice people and I'm sure everything will work out okay. It might be a little awkward at first but hopefully you'll have just worried about it a lot for nothing! ;)   I'm 22 with PTSD and dysthymia. Honestly if not for the fact that my family is the reason I have PTSD I'd probably still be living at home until I got my shit sorted out too. Kudos to you for not letting people get you down.   I can definitely relate. Where I currently live I've been fairly open about being poly. I don't really bring it up with more casual acquaintances but all my friends know and most of them have met my two partners. But I haven't really told anyone from my home town except two very close friends. I really struggled on how to tell my family for a while. I opted to just tell my mom whenever I got engaged to one of my partners because she'd have to know eventually. It's really scary though.   My best advice would be to try to weigh how much you want that person in your life versus how they might react. If you think they'll be supportive, or at least not that judgmental, great, tell them regardless of how close you are. If it's someone really close to you that you suspect wouldn't like it but you don't want to lose them over it, keep it to yourself.  A good way to find out who would be good to tell is to talk about poly people in general - for instance if you know other people in a poly relationship you can say to a friend "Oh, I heard so-and-so is going to the movies with their two partners and wanted to see if anyone else wanted to come" or something like that. If they are curious, you can have a conversation about it and tell them you're poly. If they don't seem to care, you can bring up your own partners casually at some point. And if they react negatively, you can reconsider their friendship.   That's okay - you shouldn't have to do it on your own. Humans are social creatures, we need help sometimes.  It's good to hear that you've decided to seek out therapy again. Honestly, there are some amazing therapists out there but there are some terrible ones as well. But even with good ones, they all have different specializations and counseling styles. Methods or therapists that work well with one patient or disorder won't always work for another. I always say that therapists are a lot like hair stylists - you sometimes have to shop around for one that cuts your hair just right, but when you find them you stick with them.   I'm so sorry this happened to you. That's a terrible thing to go through for anyone. You aren't selfish or weak for needing help or being lost and terrified. Honestly, your reaction to what happened is totally normal. Nobody should have to go through what you did, and no one would handle that sort of thing well. Part of healing is forgiving yourself and letting go of the guilt for not doing better than you are. It's okay to have these feelings. It's okay to be an emotional wreck when something so awful happens to you. The important thing to focus on is just trying the best that you possibly can, even if you mess up sometimes or don't make much progress.   That's totally reasonable. You should definitely talk to both of them about it. Maybe get them both together at the same time to talk to them about it - after all, it shows you respect both of them and their relationship.   I agree. It's not so much an issue of asking for permission to use her boyfriend. It's making sure that going after this guy wouldn't negatively affect their friendship. Obviously the guy is his own person and he's the one who ultimately decides whether or not to accept OP's offer of being FWB, but friends should take care of each other too. It's similar to how if you find out you and your friend have a crush on the same person - you talk to them about it to make sure things are okay with you and your friend so you can freely pursue your love interest without risking the friendship.   Omg yes. Using a trimmer is sooooo much better than a razor. No more ingrown hairs and razor burn!!   I didn't say OP shouldn't work, just that they didn't *need* to right now. Obviously if they really want a job they should go for it - like I said in my first comment, I think they should definitely apply for the job they want and even a few others. Like you said, it can potentially be a good experience for them. But I've also known quite a few high schoolers that try to get jobs ASAP because they really want the money, but end up hating it because they rushed into it. The combination of just starting high school, homework, after school activities, and a job eats up all their time and they wear themselves out. They just put too much pressure on themselves when it comes to managing all that stuff, and while it's important to take on new responsibilities when you're a teen, too much too fast can just end up hurting you in the end. So I wasn't trying to discourage OP from getting a job if that's what they want to do, just trying to point out that they don't have to be in a rush.   There's definitely nothing wrong with starting early. I mostly brought it up because if for whatever reason your parents won't let you get this job, at least it's not going to hurt you too badly. I would be more worried about getting a job as a sophomore or junior, because like you said you'll probably want a car and gas costs money. But there's also no reason you shouldn't get a job now, assuming that it doesn't interfere with school and whatnot.    your brother seems to have way more problems than just Aspergers. Just putting that out there because people that have Aspergers don't usually act like your brother does.  Agreed. Diagnosis is tricky sometimes, but honestly I have my suspicions that he also has a personality disorder or something. I know plenty of people who are autistic that, while lacking certain social skills (because autism), they are also genuinely nice people who try their best and treat people well. But Asberger's or no, my brother is a straight up asshole.  Unfortunately the fact that my brother is mildly autistic is also thrown in my face a lot when I tell people I don't like him. I've gotten a lot of flack from family members who say "well you should try to be more understanding because he has problems." Meanwhile, the abuse continues. Fuck that.   When was the "but she's family!" slogan ever applied to you?  You know I'd never even thought of that, but you're totally spot on. Most of the time when people pull the whole "but they're family" crap I just respond with "yeah, but that doesn't mean they're good people for me to be around." You're right, though - it's completely illogical and unfair that other people excuse my brother or step dad and their abusive behavior because "they're family" but no one will stick up for me.  By the way, thanks for taking the time to write all this out. I really appreciate it. It feels really good to just be understood by someone. It's one thing when people aren't supportive of my decision, but even those friends and family who are supportive still seem like they don't really know how to respond when I tell them some of this stuff. I mean, they are obviously angry that I've had to deal with such awful family nonsense, but it usually just feels awkward because they've never been in that situation so they can't really empathize. But you definitely seem to get it, and your response was pretty much exactly what I needed to hear. You made me feel a lot better as I was reading it.  I also wanted to thank you for your well wishes! It really means a lot to me that despite all I've been through I'm slowly rebuilding my life and can finally achieve some happiness. And I am absolutely not budging about banning my brother from the wedding. Seriously, if he hears about it and shows up I'm calling the cops and getting him kicked out. Thankfully there are plenty of my friends who would stand up for me if he did try to crash it, so I'm not too worried about it. But if my mom hassles me about it I'll tell her she's not welcome. I don't need that drama. My wedding is supposed to be a day where I can be happy and celebrate with my loved ones, it is not a day where I want to have to deal with guilt trips and panic attacks.   Agreed. I think it really depends on the people. Yeah, sometimes dating or being friends with coworkers can make things complicated, but there are plenty of successful businesses run by couples, families, or groups of friends.   Honestly, I don't really see why a high school freshman really NEEDS a job that badly. Yeah, it's good to save money, but just for the sake of saving money? Not really necessary. I could see getting a job if you really needed the money for something but you're what, 14? 15? You could afford to wait a little while. But that's just my two cents.  However, your sister's reasoning is weak at best. You shouldn't even apply for a job because that might somehow affect her work hours? Wtf? No, that's a terrible reason for you not to apply. "No one else should work here so that I get more money" doesn't make any sense. It's selfish, and silly. You should apply to a job if you want it and if your sister has a problem with getting less hours, that isn't your fault (or anyone else's fault that they hire), that's on management. They're the ones who decide how many people to hire and how many hours each worker gets. If she doesn't like it, she can always try looking for another job - she's a few years older and with previous work experience she has a lot more job options than you do.  So I think you should go ahead and apply. Also, it might not be a bad idea to apply at a few different places if you can - you said that it's highly likely you'll get the job at the pool but nothing is ever guaranteed so best not put all your eggs in one basket.   It's hard being different, that's for sure. And I feel like the ideal partner not only loves you for who you are (including all your faults), but they also encourage you to be the best possible person you can be. I really hope you can find someone like that.   I haven't finished it yet, but I'm really enjoying it so far. I don't know if I'd say it's a better game overall than Origins, but it's definitely a much better follow up than 2 was.  Some aspects that have definitely improved are the romance options and diversity of characters. I'm really glad that there are more options for people to romance (characters that are straight, gay, bi, pan), more options for race (playing as a Qunari is awesome!), and they even included a trans character that is actually treated respectfully! It's a big step forward in gaming when AAA titles in huge franchises are so inclusive.   Poly is a really good option for a lot of ace people, I think. Assuming, of course, that all parties involved are okay with poly relationships.   I'm asexual, and I'm not on the autistic spectrum but I do have PTSD and dysthymia so I can relate to the need to find the "certain type of person" that will accept you the way you are.  I'm currently happily engaged to a straight man and we're living together. He's very accepting of both my mental illness and my orientation, and I couldn't ask for a better partner. So yeah, there are some positive stories out there. Don't give up hope, OP!   You should definitely find a rape counselor in your area as soon as possible. They can help your sister deal with the trauma and navigate the legal process if/when you decide to take any legal action against the ex-boyfriend, his friend who raped her, or the school.   You should also look into getting her a therapist ASAP. Sexual assault is one of the biggest causes of PTSD (next to combat exposure), and the best way to avoid that would be to get her treatment as soon as possible. In any case, talking to a professional will help her process what happened to her in a hopefully more healthy way than she would on her own.  I hope your sister is okay, and my thoughts to out to her and your family.   It looks good! And cozy :)   No problem. Most people probably won't even bother reading my comment, but the biggest obstacle to the asexual community is just straight-up ignorance. Lack of knowledge makes things so much more difficult, not only from others who discriminate against us but from people in the community too. A lot of aces don't realize just how little knowledge there is out there.   My best advice is just not to sugar coat it. If you say "oh that's so nice of you but..." or "I'm flattered, but..." etc. it just makes a lot of guys thing "if I try a little harder she might say yes!"  If a guy keeps asking you out and you aren't interested, be very direct about it. Don't smile and give him pleasantries, just tell him flat-out "no."   I'm asexual and used to identify as demisexual, so feel free to ask me whatever! Also you should check out /r/asexuality for more folks who identify that way :)   Hello, all. I found this sub through r/raisedbynarcissists, but I don't quite fit in there so I'll tell my story to you all instead.  Just for general background info, I [22F] am the oldest of three kids. My mom [45F] had me when she was my age (horrifying thought), but her then-boyfriend [42M] didn't want to have kids. She wanted to keep me, and they ended up splitting. I don't really know a lot of details about this, my mom didn't tell me much other than explaining how sex works (to explain how I wasn't fully related to my siblings) and that my father had wanted an abortion and things just didn't work out. I had extremely limited contact with him as a kid because my stepfather didn't want me to see him. I spent a lot of time being angry at him for not wanting me when I was a younger, but when i got older I realized that at 19 I wouldn't want a kid either and couldn't really blame him for not being ready. In any case, I still don't talk to him often, but we have lunch occasionally and see each other on holidays now.  As for the family I was raised with, other than my mom and me there was my step dad [48M] who she married when I was three, as well as my half-brother [18M] and half-sister [13F]. We were fairly poor growing up, and we had a lot of issues. The house I grew up in was always under construction; step dad is a carpenter and renovated most of it himself after coming home from work. If any of you have ever done DIY renos in your spare time, you know how long that sort of thing can take. There were several years where we didn't have a functional kitchen, and I had to share a bedroom with my brother for a few years too. Even when I finally got my own room, it never had a doorknob - just a hole where the knob should go. I couldn't lock, or even properly close my door, as a young teenager. This is highly relevant to a lot of my problems later on.  I imagine this is somewhat uncommon, but my primary abuser was actually my younger brother. I've known people who were abused by parents, uncles/aunts, grandparents, older siblings, etc., but no one I've known has told me of being abused by a younger relative. This is possibly why a lot of adults that I tried to reach out to for help didn't really take me seriously. But for as long as I can remember, I have never gotten along with my brother. Being four years older, at first this was somewhat more manageable. There's only so much a three year old can do to a seven year old. However, I am and have always been small for my age - even now I only stand at a little over 5'2" (158 cm). So as we both got older, my brother started catching up. One of my biggest fears as a kid was of when he would finally get bigger than me. In elementary school I could outrun him, and I was physically stronger so I could hold a door shut if he tried to get in. In middle school, he was only a head shorter than me. In high school, he outgrew me. It was no longer so easy.  My brother has always had mental health problems, and often acted out. He has an explosive temper, and was suspended or in detention almost every year he was in school for getting violent. He's also gone through a range of tentative diagnoses, from ADD, ADHD, ODD, to name a few. Most recently, he was officially diagnosed with Asberger's and GAD (General Anxiety Disorder, related to the autism) after being admitted to the psych ward at a children's hospital two years ago. He made things very difficult for my parents, and my sister, but most of his anger was directed at me. Because we were closer in age and interests, I went to the same school for a while, rode the bus with him, I was left alone to watch him while my parents were at work, and I had to share toys with him sometimes.  I was also the only person in our immediate family who didn't cave in to his every demand. My step dad and his family all spoiled him to keep him happy, while my overworked mother would appease him to get him to stop throwing tantrums or just ignore us. I didn't have the patience for that bullshit, so rather than feed his narcissistic ego I would stand up to him and call him out for his nonsense behavior. And he punished me for it. Every pair of glasses I had from middle school through high school was broken because he hit me in the face, threw something at my head, or once tore them off my face smashed them into the ground with his fist. He would swear and scream at me, punch me, and throw things at me if I did even the slightest thing to make him mad. After I got my own bedroom, my door was covered in dents and scratches from where I had to run and hold it shut while he tried to force it open by punching, kicking, or even using a bat or metal chair (all while I had no knob, remember?). There was also a few months right around the time that I was 13 that he would try to peek at me whenever I took a shower. That went away after a while, but later when I was in college he started to sexually harass me on purpose to make me uncomfortable.  Things only got worse and worse as we got older. When I was much younger I would sometimes get into arguments with him, and even provoke him, because I was upset. But that was when I was 9 and 10 years old, very immature. By high school I knew better, and I didn't actively seek out fights. I mostly kept to myself to avoid them. But by that point he didn't need much to set him off. Being around him was like trying to negotiate a minefield; you never knew which wrong step would cause the explosion. One tiny comment or word he didn't like, even if it wasn't to him or about him, and he would fly into a rage - sometimes for hours. This continued after I left for college. Whenever I came home to visit, one tiny thing I did wrong that would at most make a normal person mildly irritated or merely start a discussion would make him so mad that he threatened to kill me on several different occasions. Once he even actually tried to do it - he chased after me with the broken off end of a gardening steak and tried to stab me. I can't count how many times I had to call up my best friend or boyfriend to come get me so I could escape.  It was around that time that my mom and step dad got divorced. My freshman year of college she moved out and rented a new house, and they got split custody. My siblings would spend one week with mom, then one with their dad. I was already 18 at that point, so I could go wherever I wanted. That was usually with the parent who didn't have my brother and sister for the week. I really missed my sister and felt horrible about not spending more time with her but I just couldn't deal with my brother anymore.  This was also the time when I started to limit contact with my step dad. He was and still is a (barely) functioning alcoholic, and is in severe denial about his own problems, let alone my brother's. He is very emotionally/verbally abusive toward me. Where my brother would shout nasty things just to be nasty, it was my step dad who had the truly abusive mentality. Whenever I got into a fight with my brother, regardless of who started it or why, I was the one who was reprimanded and punished because "you're older and you should know better." After I cut off contact with my brother, my step dad would constantly guilt trip me about it. Whenever my brother was committed my step dad called me at 3 AM in the middle of finals week to tell me about what happened. Then he proceeded to ramble on about how I was a horrible sister, my brother just wanted me to love him, why couldn't I be more supportive, my sister misses me and doesn't understand why I don't want to see her, blah blah blah. By the end of the conversation I was in tears.  I quickly grew tired of my step dad constantly nagging me to spend more time with my abusive brother. He refused to help him get treatment or take his medications, too. He consistently denied that my brother ever did anything wrong, even when he literally had to pull my brother off of me because he went ballistic and started punching me after I disagreed with him about something. After that my step dad didn't even ask if I was okay, even though he'd just seen me get punched in the head and chest multiple times. He just yelled at me for making my brother upset. After so many times of hearing that it was my fault, that I shouldn't have made him angry, that I should be a better sister, that nothing was wrong, I had enough. I cut him out of my life and haven't looked back.  Of course, many people who I assume are well-meaning have tried to convince me to give my step dad and brother a second chance, saying that "they're you're family!" and I should repair my relationships. Thankfully, my mother has a very low opinion of my step dad and has no qualms whatsoever about me ignoring him and his awful behavior. However, even she seems to think I should reconcile with my brother, but I just don't see that happening. Because of the abuse I went through I developed PTSD (and I was also diagnosed with dysthymia). I am not about to go near the source of my trauma. Nope. I recently got engaged and told her I don't want him at the wedding, but she and her current husband [45M] don't seem to get why. I'm a little worried that my insistence on keeping away from my brother and step dad will cause problems in my relationship with my mom - it's already happened to several other family members. But hopefully I can convince her to see reason.  Well, that's my story. It's a little long, and honestly there are so many more things I could talk about, but I won't go into them here. Thank you for reading. I guess what I want more than anything is for people to stop telling me that I should make nice with my step dad or brother, and just know that I didn't cut them out of my life flippantly or for no good reason. I'm not trying to be spiteful. I had to do this for my own health and safety. I just wish people could understand that and show some sympathy rather than judging me or assuming they know my situation better than I do. I've had relatives, teachers, friends, church members, even court lawyers try to tell me that I'm wrong for not wanting toxic people in my life. And even though I know that what they say ultimately doesn't matter because I made the right choice, it's still nice to get encouragement from others. :(   It would most likely be the cartridge. Other ds games work on my 3DS just fine.   I especially like that she lists off a bunch of potentially more harmful or destructive pranks, then after thinking about it she goes for the subtle annoy-you-to-the-point-of-insanity one instead.   I was really glad they included that, too. Although they did mention some of the problems Templars face in the first game - Alistair complains about it a lot and says he's glad he ended up with the Wardens instead - it's never really done to make them appear sympathetic.   We feel bad for the mages because they can't help being born with magic, and they're locked up our hunted down regardless of what they want. So any negative feelings that mages show toward Templars are seen as justified, because their survival is on the line. But the Templars *chose* to join their order, and a lot of them are clearly biased and hateful toward mages, so it appears less justifiable. Plus, they're heavily associated with the Chantry, an organization that is problematic at best.   It's really hard for the player to identify with someone who willingly joins a corrupt religious body that starts campaigns of genocide on the flimsiest of justifications, forcibly imprisons or lobotomizes people they deem too dangerous, and controls its followers through indoctrination and chemical addiction. Considering how hard it is to separate faith in a deity from faith in a church, anyone who joins the Templars is presumably devout and also approves on some level of the Chantry's actions (and is most likely complicit in them).  But what the player knows isn't necessarily what the characters in the game world know. That's why I've really enjoyed seeing the character arcs for Cassandra and Cullen. Not only do we get to see a lot more of the dirty secrets the Chantry has kept from the public, but we start to see more of a divide between doctrine and its followers. In Origins, the Templars and the Chantry were heavily conflated. But as the series progresses, we see that the Templars were also victimized by the Chantry's policies, not just perpetrators against the mages. Indeed, if everyone had the knowledge Cassandra later discovers, or even just the knowledge most Templars like Cullen or Alistair have, the Chantry would most likely lose a lot of support and people wouldn't follow so blindly.   I actually have the DS version, but I never got around to playing it because my 3DS can't read it and I lent my DSlite to my fiance a while back so he could play Ace Attorney. I'll have to dig it out sometime though.   I'll second that. If you like Ace Attorney, odds are pretty high you'll like Dangan Ronpa. I haven't played Ghost Trick yet but it's in my to-do stack.   Unfortunately, there is no magic advice that will help you out here. You just have to do what is best for you and hope that everything works out okay.  I can definitely understand why you would be worried about gf A's feelings. You've connected with her and had a relationship for a significant period of time. It's tough to think that such a big part of your life might come to a close. And there really isn't a way to do that without hurting someone's feelings.  It sounds to me like you do know the answer. You should probably break up with A. B seems like a much better fit for you personally. I think it's important to remember that not all relationships end because you don't like someone, and you shouldn't consider a breakup as a failed relationship.  If you really feel like you aren't getting what you want out of your relationship with A, then odds are she probably isn't that satisfied either. But in any case, you should talk to her about this. Tell her the doubts you're feeling. Tell her about the exhaustion you've been going through and the hard time you've had keeping up with the different interests and schedules. And tell her that even though you do love her, you don't feel like this is a good fit. Yes, she will probably feel hurt - that's normal when a relationship doesn't work out. But if you explain your feelings to her she'll probably understand. And if you both still care for each other, it is possible that you can still have a positive relationship with her afterward. It'll just take some time.   That's awesome! I'm glad you got help and you're doing better. You deserve to be proud, that's a huge accomplishment! :D   Yep. And there are still only a few other studies that have been done to corroborate it. This is a super new field.   FYI that was one year after the first published study on asexuality. This is not at all shocking.   People who are "that way because of a low testosterone level" aren't necessarily the same as people who are asexual because that's their orientation.  As for folks who wish they were different, it's not them being asexual that's the problem - it's the way they are treated *because* of their orientation that's the problem.  To illustrate this, someone who belongs to a minority religion might have behaviors related to their particular religion that are outside the norm, or cause suffering in their daily lives (e.g. fasting). But religions minorities often face discrimination from those outside their religious group; I'm sure there are more than a few Muslims in recent years who have had a hard time dealing with Islamophobia in the post-9/11 U.S. They might even occasionally wish they weren't part of that religious minority so they wouldn't have to deal with intolerance all the time. However, we wouldn't classify these people as having a mental disorder for being part of that religion. Instead, it's fairly obvious that the only reason they feel bad is because other people treat them in a hateful manner for having that religion.   (Speaking as someone in the psychology field who is also asexual. I apologize for length.)  The short answer to your question is yeah, being asexual is a sexual orientation, not a mental disorder. However, it can be confused for a mental disorder known as HSDD (hypoactive sexual desire disorder), which is what your textbook is likely referring to. If you want to know more about all the controversy surrounding this issue, check out this link [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/18/asexual-disorder_n_3361472.html?1371562287).  A lot of the medical community's treatment of asexuality is rooted in the issue that there isn't much known about it from a scientific standpoint. Yeah, we have the X in Kinsey's studies from the 1960s, but the presence of asexual individuals in research studies were written off as a statistical anomaly for most of psychology's history. The first paper to be published on the prevalence of asexual orientation that actually recognized it as a legitimate orientation was in 2004.  That's right - asexuality research is barely a decade old. That is NOTHING to science. So it's not that surprising to have issues with misdiagnosis with a field still in its infancy.  Back to HSDD. This disorder developed out of the original diagnoses of "impotence" in men and "frigidity" in women (obviously a flawed concept). In the DSM-IV-TR (the version before the most recent DSM 5), it was defined based on three categories:  * Persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual fantasies and desire for sexual activity. The judgment of deficiency or absence is made by the clinician, taking into account factors that affect sexual functioning, such as age and the context of the person's life.  * The disturbance causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty.  * The sexual dysfunction is not better accounted for by another Axis I disorder (except another Sexual Dysfunction) and is not due exclusively to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition.   Not having much or any sexual desires or fantasy describes a lot of asexual people, so that's criteria one. And although most asexual people aren't inherently bothered by this lack of desire, it does often cause issues with interpersonal relationships, meeting the second criteria. And it's fairly safe to say the a vast majority of us aren't asexual because of medication side effects or sexual dysfunction, meaning a good number of asexual people would meet all the necessary criteria for a mental disorder.  On the other hand, many asexuals don't experience undue stress due to their orientation, nor does it necessarily serve as an obstacle to their daily life or relationships in a way that would be considered clinically significant. To put this another way, there are plenty of people who might be sticklers about organizing things in a specific way, but that doesn't mean they have OCD. In the same vein, jut because an asexual person doesn't have much interest in sex doesn't mean they have a disorder either.  After protests and reviews of the DSM-IV-TR criteria, the DSM 5 criteria were changed:   All of the DSM-5 sexual dysfunctions (except substance-/medication-induced sexual dysfunction) now require a minimum duration of approximately 6 months and more precise severity criteria. ... DSM-IV included the following subtypes for all sexual disorders: lifelong versus acquired, generalized versus situational, and due to psychological factors versus due to combined factors. DSM-5 includes only lifelong versus acquired and generalized versus situational subtypes. Sexual dysfunction due to a general medical condition and the subtype due to psychological versus combined factors have been deleted due to findings that the most frequent clinical presentation is one in which both psychological and biological factors contribute. To indicate the presence and degree of medical and other nonmedical correlates, the following associated features are described in the accompanying text: partner factors, relationship factors, individual vulnerability factors, cultural or religious factors, and medical factors.  So what does that mean excluding psychology jargon? Honestly ... not much. The "lifelong" subtype is going to probably describe a lot of aces, so we're still technically considered part of a mental disorder. BUT on the upside, we're getting more precise with these diagnoses, which means that medicine is starting to distinguish between people who have a genuine psychological problem and those who are experiencing a normal part if the diversity that is human sexuality. We're slowly starting to change people's minds about this stuff. But again, this research is only 11 years old. As more research is done and more people begin to understand asexuality, the more likely we are to see more positive changes.  TL;DR - fuck you, this is my degree. Let me blab on a bit.   I don't feel guilty, just generally bad because being triggered is not fun. My fiance feels really guilty that he triggered me, though. I probably should have been more clear on that.   And yeah, communication is super important. I couldn't talk about it right away because I was too busy freaking out but I made sure to explain what happened as soon as I calmed down, and he totally understood and was very supportive.   I don't blame myself for it, it just kind of sticks in general. He is a really good guy and he cares about me a lot, which is why he really feels bad when he triggers me (this is only the second time it's happened). I suppose it really bothered me because like I mentioned in my post this was the first time I was triggered by that particular situation and it's like "well there's one *more* thing I have to avoid."   Which ones are you confused about? Because I understood all of it and I am willing to explain various jargon   If you're looking for fluffy bl, try The Boy With Pink Ear Muffs. It's a pretty cute web comic.  Edit: duh, I'm sleep deprived. Go to /r/queercomics. It doesn't get much activity but there are plenty of posts with good recommendations   Maybe you should point out to your mom how the statistics on eating disorders show they are some of the most difficult mental disorders to treat and the most likely to result in death. Then she might take you seriously.   I think that you should absolutely look for support from somewhere else if you're not getting it at home. Maybe you should reach out to a close friend? You might have better luck there. It's a lot easier to recover if you have social support. And of course you can still try to talk to your parents again later, but you should find someone else to help you out in the mean time.   I would also highly suggest seeking out therapy. A support group might help too.   If it's a few hours before that makes sense then lol. You have plenty of time to chill after and you'd be tired by bed time. Also it's a lot healthier than other options like drinking yourself to sleep or something.   I've heard it's bad to work out before sleep because the adrenaline and endorphins actually wake you up. But then again I'm no sleep expert lol   Hello all. I recently found this sub and I can't sleep so maybe posting this will help. I know you all will likely be a sympathetic audience.   Just a warning, I'm going to talk about things of a sexual nature that triggered me and, although rather mild, might also trigger other people.  Earlier today my fiance got home from work and we took a shower together. I finished drying off and went to our bedroom to get dressed before he did. About a minute later he came in while I was still only in undies. I had the door closed, and he suddenly burst in without knocking. It startled me pretty bad.   My abuser used to do the same thing to me when I was just hitting puberty. He would try to catch me naked or shirtless after a shower, by peeking through my door (it had no knob at the time) or just bursting into my room or the bathroom suddenly so he could see my breasts.  The last time it happened was about two years ago. I was alone with him in the house, but hadn't seen him at all since he was in his own room playing video games. I figured it was relatively safe because it hadn't happened since I was 13 or so (I'm 22 now), but just in case I went to my mom's room to take a shower. Hers had its own attached bathroom, so I could change in her bedroom and not have to go in the hallway. Plus, there would be two locked doors between us.   But I was wrong. I didn't notice anything wrong when I was in the shower, but I came out to him laying on the bed, lounged in what was supposed to be a sensual position, and he was only wearing his underwear. He told me some pick up line that I don't remember (other than it being terrible). I thought that particular nightmare was over, but there I was, standing in nothing but a towel, with my abuser coming on to me.   I asked why he would do such a ridiculous thing and he openly admitted it was only to mess with me. He was doing it for a power trip, a bit of a joke. And because he enjoyed how clearly uncomfortable I was, he refused to leave. I even threatened to call the cops, but he mocked me, saying go ahead, what good would that do. He was right. I thought to myself that the cops would most likely do nothing. By the time they got there, he would leave, we could both get dressed, and there was no proof anything had even happened except my word.   I settled for calling my mom instead, who told him to leave me alone and said she'd handle it when she got back home from work. Nothing really came of it. Except my further trauma, of course.   Back in the present day, I got all flustered after my fiance came into the room unexpectedly. I could feel myself on the edge of a panic attack, so I just focused on getting dressed and then fiddled with some origami I'd been working on until I could calm down some. A little while later on the way to dinner I talked to my fiance about it and he said he would knock from now on just in case.   I feel awful now. I've never been triggered in relation to that particular trauma before - in fact, I always considered those events the least awful thing my abuser did to me. But my fiance is now feeling horribly guilty, and I'm going out of town for the weekend so my last experience with him before I leave is now tainted by my PTSD. This sucks.   I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. But you aren't alone. And now you have a name for your problems, which is a good start.  I also remember thinking "then what would happen?" So many times as a child I scraped together my pocket change and thought about running away. But what if my parents called the police? What if I ran out? Then what would happen? It is a horrible thought for a child to have to think.   I wish more of my friends were into knitting and crochet. A good portion of my friends are into crafts, which is awesome, and a few of them either knit or crochet (almost never both) but none as much as I do. Most of them don't have the time to start or only just learned but I've been knitting for 7 or so years and seriously crocheting for a little longer but started when I was a kid. If I even use a little jargon they get totally lost. It's fun to teach people but it would be nice to have one or two people who know at least as much as I do.   I'm going to respectfully disagree with you, here. Like I mentioned before, I took care of all the necessary stuff myself. I've been paying for school, rent, utilities, groceries, etc. with no help from any parent for the last two years. I haven't always been able to find work but it's not like I'm not trying or unwilling to do so - as evidenced by doing landscaping, which is definitely hard work.  Being absolutely 100% self-sufficient does not make you an adult, being able to maturely handle situations does. I've known plenty of adults who have had to ask their family for help from time to time, but that doesn't mean they still aren't respected and treated like adults by the family members who help them.   Like I said, the ONLY thing she paid for was my phone and my insurance - the insurance because it's law where I live that full-time students are covered under their parents until age 26, and the phone because that was just the last thing I ended up sharing with her since we were on a 2-year contract. She stopped paying for my phone in September and my insurance in December of last year so right now she doesn't pay for anything. Meanwhile, many of my peers still live in dorms and/or live with their parents, so having one thing paid for isn't that much in comparison. And yes, I understand that my mom is older and more experienced than me, but she and her husband treat me like I'm still 14 and have no idea how the world works, despite having lived on my own for more than two years. THAT'S what really bothers me.  Also, whether or not you consider my reasons for not being completely self-sufficient as valid doesn't make them less so. If you've never had to deal with poverty and chronic mental illness with almost zero social support, I'm happy for you, but you also can't really say that I'm not doing the best I can with what I've got.  Thanks for your congratulations, I'm really glad that pretty much everyone agrees that I should choose who I invite. That feels really validating.   I'm aware of it. I don't really consider my mom a narcissist, though - I just think we have some communication issues, mostly. Like I said, we were never that close to begin with so we just don't understand each other about a lot of stuff.  I will check it out through, just to see if there is any helpful pointers.   Well, like I said, we sorted out the whole phone issue, I just didn't go into detail about it. I eventually had a talk with her (that was honestly closer to a fight) about how much I was struggling financially and she let it go. So yeah, she hasn't paid for my phone since September, and stopped bugging me about it around October. It hasn't really come up since, I mostly mentioned it to give context to the situation.  There is a good chance she's just been spending too much money lately, but honestly that's her problem not mine. And I have no idea what her finances are like, but if she's that hard up for cash she has plenty of stuff to sell/pawn, it's not like she really NEEDS that $30 bucks from me - part of why it really got to me so much.  I do plan on having my wedding my way (within reason of course, I'm not a bridezilla or anything), and I'm not gonna cave to my mom about something that important, I'm more worried that it will start a fight because I refuse to invite my brother, which is stupid.  I have essentially done what you said - I no longer associate with him. I've also put to rest most of my animosity toward him, so it's not like I'm holding onto anger against him or trying to be petty. I'm just focusing on my own health right now, and that means staying away from him. I did seek counseling originally through the university, but my therapist moved to private practice so I saw her privately. She's the third therapist I've seen about this stuff and I would like to keep seeing her as she's helped me progress a lot and I feel like switching back to free university services would just be more hassle than it's worth. Fortunately, my fiance is able to help pay for my therapy, so I'll be going back as soon as possible.  Thanks for your advice!   Thank you! I'm glad I'm not the only one who sees that as a reasonable decision. And no, I certainly would not invite him for my mom's sake. Don't worry, I'm standing firm in that one.   As far as where she was? I know she's seen more than a few of the bad incidents between us so that's part of why I'm so at a loss as to why she doesn't get it. The only thing I can think is that she just somehow doesn't realize HOW BAD it is. That's why I asked her to read up on PTSD.   Thanks! Maybe it will help be grow taller like Merry and Pippin haha   I've been on both sides of that scenario. When I first opened up my relationship with my first partner, it was so that he could date other people. I technically could see other people too, but didn't have an interest in doing so for a long time. More recently, I'm engaged to a different partner, and while I am poly he is totally mono (but okay with me being poly obviously).  One thing I can tell you is that it's perfectly normal to not know how to deal with nonmonogamy at first. It's not something a lot of people are ever even brought up to believe is an option, so you'll probably need a little time to adjust. During that time, it might be hard to figure out what you should be feeling or how you should act, and that's okay - the important thing to remember is that there isn't one specific right way to do be in a nonmonogamous relationship, you just have to find what works for you.  I felt weird at first whenever my first partner talked about his other relationships, too. He's had about half a dozen or so more casual dating partners other than me, and it was sometimes hard for me to hear him constantly talking about all these other people. For me the issue was that whenever he got down about another date not going well and felt bad because he was feeling "unlucky in love" so to speak, it made me feel like my role was diminished. Sure, he might have struck out with someone else, but I was still there, so how was he unlucky? But at the same time I had to remember that my relationship was separate from his other relationships; the status of ours did not detract or add to the status of the others and vice-versa.  It's possible that you're just feeling a little jealous. The best thing to do in this case is to acknowledge your feelings for what they are, and talk to your partner about them. An important part of any nonmonogamous relationship is healthy communication. So talk to your partner, and see if you can both work out a way to make you feel more comfortable.   Agreed, I like to be surprised occasionally lol   To be fair, though, even if you do report there's no guarantee that anything will come of it. Speaking as someone who was abused by a family member, not everyone believes you, and even if they do there isn't always much they can do about it unless there are witnesses/solid evidence. Going through a police investigation and trial are really stressful, not to mention that doing so might push the abuser to retaliate violently. On top of all that, OP's friend is most likely a gay (possibly bi) dude, which means that he has to face double discrimination as a male abuse victim and as a queer person. I can totally understand why he wouldn't want to press charges in favor of just moving on with his life.   Hey all you beautiful people out there. I wasn't sure what sub to post this in, because it could easily to to /r/Advice or /r/relationships or somesuch, but I decided on you all since you're generally a pretty supportive bunch (and I like this sub better anyway). I wanted a little help figuring out how to deal with a predicament I'm in. I'm not sure what to do here and I'd appreciate some fresh perspective.  I've had a hard time dealing with my mom lately. We were never super close to begin with for various reasons, but our relationship had improved since I started college. Then about a year ago, there started to be friction again due to some money issues. I'm a full-time student and I have PTSD and dysthymia. The pressure from getting two degrees alone is nearly breaking me, so I don't really have the capacity for a job on top of school. Despite that, I applied to a lot of places, but to no avail. I just don't have enough experience for any of the places I've applied and my options are limited since I can't work on campus (no work study) and I don't have a car (so I have to stay close).  Despite this, my mom started to pressure me to give her money to pay for my share of the phone bill. At the time I was on her family plan, but besides insurance it was the only thing she paid for - I had to cover my own tuition, fees, books, school supplies, electronics, rent, utilities, etc. using loans, grants, and scholarships. Money was tight for me, but she constantly hounded me to pay for the phone. And the price kept going up - January she said she wanted $10, then later it was $15 a month, and by May it was suddenly $30. By the way, I never actually saw the phone bill, so I have no idea how much my line actually cost. I didn't have data, just talk and text, so it was probably a very small portion of the bill since the rest of the family all had smart phones.  Soon, every time she called the discussion ended up centered on money. I could barely make ends meet but she just HAD to have that $30 because she was apparently on a tight budget. She is a registration manager at a hospital and her husband is some kind of accountant, I think. They're not loaded, but they make decent money - enough to pay for a new 3D TV, Coach purses, a honeymoon in the Bahamas, etc. Meanwhile, I have to struggle to get bills paid and eat. I even had to stop going to therapy because I couldn't afford the $40 copay per session once a month. The only reason I made it through last summer without having to borrow money was because I got a job being paid under the table to do landscaping, and even then I only managed to scrape by and had to quit once school started again.  I should also mention that last May I started seeing someone, and we really hit it off. I was pretty much head over heels for this guy two months in, but I didn't want to talk to my mom about it because I didn't want to bring up my new boyfriend right after having a fight about money for the hundredth time. I never did pay her, and she eventually just turned off my phone. So I went on a new plan with my boyfriend. Then every conversation after that became "where's my money" AND "who's paying for your phone" which I didn't want to answer because it always felt like an interrogation. I should have told her about him, but I was too stressed out over the phone and it never felt like a good time.  Eventually we got that sorted out and last month my boyfriend proposed. I said yes. Seeing as how we were now engaged and I hadn't fought with my mom in a while (although it was still a little shaky), I decided I should probably tell her about my fiance sooner rather than later. I gave her a call, and we made plans for us to come visit her for lunch (my mom lives about 1.5 hours away).  The visit started off okay - they asked him a bunch of questions, and they seemed to really like him. But it soon turned sour when my mom and her husband started making some rather condescending or downright rude remarks. The husband doesn't like our wedding theme (Lord of the Rings), Mom doesn't like my hair (I have it cut very short and style it masculine, but so what I'm queer and I like it). The kicker, though, was when I told them I refused to allow my brother (who abused me and caused my PTSD) to my wedding. They seemed astonished I would say such a thing, and tried to tell me I needed to sort out my issues with my brother. I had to really bite my tongue to avoid starting a fight. My fiancee tried to stick up for me because he could tell a lot of the stuff they said made me upset, but they talked over him a lot. I just tried my best to change the subject to more neutral topics, and we left a few hours later.  I couldn't just let what they said go, however, so I wrote my mom an email to try and explain that she had upset me and why. I tried to be as polite as possible, while still being firm about my opinions. Basically, it boiled down to this:  * When you and your husband talk to me, I feel like you're treating me as if I'm still a child and I don't know how to take care of myself, but I'm an adult (22 years old) and I DO take care of myself, so I would like to be treated with more respect and compassion. * I like my hair the way it is because it gives me confidence and it makes me feel like I look good. I don't feel like I look good nor do I have confidence while wearing most feminine clothing or hair styles. I don't need you to tell me that having a "boy hair cut" will make it hard for me to get a job because it might leave a bad impression during an interview - I know how to dress for an interview. I deal with queer-hate on a regular basis, so I know how people see me when I wear my hair a certain way. I don't need you to tell me that, I live it. * PTSD is serious; I'd like for you to try to learn about it and understand it more. Please do not give me shit about not inviting my brother to my wedding. Why would I want my abuser at my wedding???  On Feb. 5th my mom texted to ask me about something unrelated, and mentioned she had gotten my email but was taking a while to send one back because her response was already several pages long. As of writing this, I STILL have not gotten an email back from her. Now I'm starting to worry that I said something wrong, or that she took something the wrong way, or that I'm going to end up starting a fight with her over this stuff. The longer she goes without responding the more I start to worry.  So what do you all think? Was there something better I could have done? Should I try to talk to my mom about the email? Should I just wait patiently for her response?  **TL;DR - My mom and I have been having issues lately. The last time I saw her she and her husband said some hurtful things to me, so I wrote her an email about it two weeks ago but she still hasn't responded. What do?**   I don't know if I would classify either of my parents as hoarders, but they did have some organizational issues and compound that with a constantly under construction house and you basically end up with a hoarder-esque living situation. For several years, despite technically living in a three bedroom home, we only had one bedroom (where my brother and I slept) and the bathroom free, while all the stuff that would have been put in a den, kitchen, office, laundry, and crafting room were all kept in our living room where my parents slept. Yeah ... Not ideal. So I feel you, OP.   Speaking as someone with a background in psychology, your mom most likely will not get better on her own. Hoarders aren't just messy or disorganized; their hoarding is the manifestation of a mental illness. They suffer from extreme anxiety that is triggered by getting rid of something. Sometimes it's because they're especially frugal and don't want to waste anything, or they're afraid that as soon as they throw it out they might need it later. Sometimes they keep things that remind them of loved ones or cherished memories they're afraid they'll forget about or dishonor if they dispose of the items that help them recall those things or people. We all have those feelings sometimes and hold on to things unnecessarily, but in hoarders this is taken to the extreme. And if they ever have to get rid of something, their anxiety can be overwhelming, which is why they often continue to hoard even if they know they have a problem and it's detrimental to their health or relationships.   It's good that you're supportive of your mom and want to help her, and it's also good that she realizes her behavior isn't healthy. But these two things often aren't enough. Your mom needs professional help, and sooner rather than later. You should seek out a psychologist that specializes in hoarders or anxiety disorders and have your mom see them ASAP, because this sort of problem only gets worse the longer you leave it be. Considering that hoarding can have very nasty consequences like unsafe living conditions, having adult protective services intervene, getting evicted, or having a house condemned, it is essential that she gets treatment before it gets to that point.   Best of luck, OP.   Who knows, if he is attracted to you he might be releaved to find out you're a woman. But yeah, if he is actually gay, I hope he becomes more comfortable with himself and you can have a better friendship.   Wow. Nope, that is totally abusive. I'm really glad you got out of that situation.   True. I've gotten support from expected places too. Who knows, maybe he just feels insecure about himself and you coming out to him will make him feel comfortable enough that he will act better in the future. There's always hope   That's really hard. I know how nerve-wracking it can be to come out to people, and there is a lot of hate out there toward trans women. I'm glad your other friend is supportive. I just hope you stay safe and your carpenter friend doesn't hassle you too much.   Anyone who disrespects your mental health issues is not your friend. I'm sorry she made you have a panic attack. Hopefully you feel less stressed out now that you don't have to deal with her.   Damn. What kind of friend or partner sends you hate mail? I'm so sorry, that guy sounds awful.  	106

The Smash Potato metagame has evolved to ridiculous levels due to it being the only remaining factor to decide matches.  The losers are executed, Game of Thrones style. There is no mercy in this town.    My family's been going through a rough patch lately, and I think it'd cheer my brother up if I could grab a Shulk for our personal collection. Amiibos have been helping both of us get through the worst of it by giving us something to do, like hunting stores and training them all, becoming better at Smash in the progress. Plus, it gives him figures of his favorite characters, so that's always an extra point.   Good luck to everyone in the contest.    I'm interested. Good luck to everyone, and may the odds be ever in your favor!   FUCKING R.O.B. AND HIS SMUG ASS SUMMONING KYOGRE AND THEN GRABBING A GUST BELLOWS IN CLASSIC MODE    Sonic.   My fanfics are coming true!    Does this work on 3DS too, or no?    I feel like there should definitely be some sort of presence of some small-time villains, such as Abomination and Absorbing Man teaming up or something to go steal some stuff. However, I want her to encounter the Kree in battle at some point and make Korvac the big bad of the movie.   	15

 [By all means, here are some pictures of my car](http://imgur.com/a/xBliL) I think finding a Saleen is gonna be hard. ;P, You should deff blend the NewEdge colors for the banner.   Oh gosh, the Third Brake light got shitty on you too? I just replaced it with raxiom's. I never really bothered to see how to fix it. But I've noticed it a lot of NewEdges.   I'd love to see a Saleen, Roush, Termi, and a Mach in that! And maybe my car too... ;) lmao.    [Me!](http://imgur.com/a/xs8SH)    No!   That god damn hood, man! Meanest looking car, and I would maybe possibly trade my car for one.   Fucking love the Tans Am. WS6, correct?   Anything is possible, my friend.   Correct, sir!   [Imagine this, but with your car](http://i.imgur.com/qTas1lJ.jpg)   I couldn't find it.. :( I made it all flarey and purple and blue and stuff. God damn it.   I edited this picture a long time ago, I'm gonna see if I can dig it up! (I did a shit job tho)   I love MG!    I know. I'm saying I want an 01.   I'll just take the 10th Anni off your hands, real quick.   NewEdge 4 Lyfe.   I NEED one. There was one for sale near by, but 400$, and poor 18yr old = no new bumper.   Termi hood, 01 cobra bumper, paint and invisible bra. i'd be set for life.   How much did you get, god damn.   Stangmods has them, 200$ and MrBodyKit has them for like 160$ he has regular and smoked.   Hurry, someone back into my front so I can get an 01 Cobra bumper.   It won't be stock for long ;) gonna get an exhaust set up as soon as my tax refund gets here, then lower it, CAI, Gears. Just gotta save money here and there. Things surprisingly quick. I feel like the 0-60 time has to be off, it doesn't feel like 5.4 seconds at all. I definitely am more of a "look good" type of guy. At least at this point, since I went from 145HP to 260HP and it was quick the difference. DSG is easily one of the best colors for NewEdges, or really any mustang. It hides dirt and dust pretty good, it's just rock chips that it shows like no other.  Hopefully you get your GT sometime in the near future. So much fun.   I try really hard.    Ooo. Is it Torch Red? Cause that shits my fave. And I want a gen 2 lightning so bad...  I appreciate it man!   Shucks... Thanks man!   Believe me, I didn't either! I had to ask around on IG to see where people got them.   Stop, I'm blushing.    StangMods has them, and MrBodyKit has normal and smoked. If I found the smoked ones, I would have gotten those, they look really good.   And faster ;)   DSG 4 LYFE!!!!!   Good move. :)   Thanks man, I thankfully have a friend whose a great photographer and is easy going.  DSG is the best. That, and Torch Red.. and Mysti....   Hopefully. Maybe he'll start small like the rest of us, I went from a 95 v6 to an 04 GT.   Pretty much, only changes are: Clear corner headlights (Raxiom Elite bulbs) Smoked taillights (LED bulbs and sequential) Smoked third break light (LED)  I have smoked fog lights, just no one wants to help put them in, lmao.  I'm buying a Borla ATAK catback in the next ~week or so. So, I'll post that when it comes! ;D   My friend was pretty smug, always saying he was the fastest of the group, and his girlfriend even bought him 2k$ in car parts (Exhaust and a CAI), but thats all gone now, and he has to sell the car.  I'm the fastest now. B)      If you wanna see my friends wrecked '15... I can make you feel better...   Listened to you for awhile, and now you're big enough that my work plays your music. Which is so awesome. I'm happy you've grown, you've always been an incredible artist!   Ayyyyye DSG   Really jealous of you right now.   Hey boss, I wasn't leaning. I was uhhh...   I've worked at a Sonic. This isn't a common thing. Hell, I couldn't even lean on any table. I guess it really just depends on what state you're in. The East Valley in Arizona is safe, though.   How many miles and the such? I got my 04 GT with 24k miles for 9 something. But then it was 2014 Winter. But still..    This.   This is not my car, it is my friends and I was a passenger at the time of the accident.  Story: Went to go around a [Con-Way Freight truck](https://media.glassdoor.com/o/40989/con-way-freight-office.jpg), we had just turned onto a new street and were in 2nd, max speed I feel was 50, and when he turned to go into the other lane to pass, he turned too sharp and it kicked out and we went into the curb, then bounced and hit the truck and went under it a bit (rear bumper has a huge hole in it, and the c pillar is smashed and rear glass is all gone). After hitting the truck we went back into the curb and bounced over it, down a ditch and hit a tree.  I think its going to get totaled. What do you guys think?  It only had a CAI and a Cat-back.   9 grand for an 03 v6 :O   HA.   Rest in Peace PJ. It was hard.   This car was a PAVS on saturday! Really nice car.   Awesome! :D   Edit your flair. It's on the right hang side if the page! :)   yeah, thats what bugs me the most about this.   right?   Just leave the outside completely wrecked and make it the ultimate slow sleeper stang. Sounds like a good plan. I'd love it.   Jeeeeez. Just do an entire coyote swap! Hahaha, are you going to paint it the original color, or something different?   At least you own it man, all money goes to car parts! All my money goes to paying the bank so that one day I could own him. :( And that would be sick as fuck.   probably, but it's still a drawing and I still love it.  See [this](http://i.imgur.com/lGepAOD.jpg) for the updated version I had him do.   I see! Your flair says ugly POS. But hey, my '95 v6 was a POS, but a Mustang is a Mustang!   camera trick, my friend pops light whilst the camera takes continuous photos. Do that multiple times and then put it all together and theres the result!   [Updated, final version](http://i.imgur.com/lGepAOD.jpg)      It didn't like my friends '15, lol.   @the_mustang_artist on IG or " The Mustang Artist " on Facebook.   I'm having him do mine too! Can't wait!   OH OKAY, COME OVER   BUT IS THAT A GOOD IDEA?   I KNOW. DO YOU WANT TO PURCHASE ME SPRINGS? FOR JUST 2$ A DAY, YOU COULD HELP A 4x4 MUSTANG BECOME THE MENACING LOWERED BEAST IT ALWAYS DREAM OF BEING.   That stock 4x4 status, eh? I do need to lower it.   The friendship, then the 'stangs. ;)      Yeah, DSG is the best color. My friend got a Magnetic, and I like it but I LOVE DSG. If DSG was an option, I think it'd sell like hot cakes.   If only I was in HS back then. :(   I try really hard.      199.99! :P   I'm mad now.      Right? I hate my plate. But I ordered a new one. "04DSGGT"   Hell yeah! I think DSG is a great color. And no prob man!   2004 DSG GT Coupe with the 40th anni Package. And yourself? (Car looks awesome BTW, can't wait to do a Grille Delete.)   Bought new Clear Corner headlights for my baby. Also bought new taillights, third brake light, some quarter marker tint, sequential harness, and a shit ton of LEDs and bulbs.  I did buy new foglights, but I haven't installed them yet, but I plan on doing it sometime this weekend, I bought the smoked ones from AM.      TKO! Fucking love his car man.   When your girlfriend says shes home alone.   Would need to see it in a better picture.   Thats basically the dip on it right now, it's not hulk green anymore.   Correct.   Both are dipped by the same people.   Its a Cali special, so its a v8. Its on bags, so she can change her ride height. It's not cambered.   I like her lime green more than her hulk green, tbh.   S550s and 4cyl are cool in my book man.   Oh my bad! They put nitrogen in the tires. [This](http://www.nitrofill.com/)   They added in nitrogen and tint and the stripe, so I don't know how much the stripe by its self costed, but they did charge for it all.   I think double stripes looks amazing as while. Definitely has to be black on white. Or some bright color. And the dealer put the stripe on before he bought it,  so it was included.   This is what made me love New Edges, such a phat ass. Shaved rear is the best IMO.   Check my submit history for a picture of Magnetic with stripe(s) on it. I personally think, the stripe brings the car together.   Hell yeah, if I see any mustang, I try and park next to it, or as close as I can. Even if they person doesn't car about the history and community of it.   Ill find some owners who love to park next to me, and then I find some who just don't care and park anywhere. Then there's the ones who don't care about the community behind the car, it's just another car to them. It really is just a luck of the draw. My friend gets all the mustangs parked next to him, but that's cause he's got a 15.   I love my '04 GT, its fast enough and fun enough for me.   driven the tricycle, most fun i've had.   And you killed him!? God, man..   I can't remember a lot of things either, Idk if it was the depression, or the amount of pills I've taken all at once.   Love the fog, I wish it got like that around my place! Would be sick for some photo-shoots!   I didn't make them, my friend came over and took 25-30ish shots of each car with different parts of the car lit up, some with headlights on, some not, some interior light pops, mostly outside light pops. Garage door open, and closed. And he just mashed them together.   Put yeah, probably Lightroom and PS. Lol   Thanks man! I do too. ;)   I think 47 MSRP is pretty fair. 60+ isn't though.   It is 1 of 1964 though..  But the dealer near me has one for 47k, so it's still high as fuck.      Yeah.... That's true... Lol  	109
 Presumably your friends have similar interests to you.  And chances are their girlfriends will have those interests, and you're already introduced to them which is a lot of the work already done.  I don't think it's right while they are involved, once broken up.....I can see both sides of the argument.  If you REALLY like them and want to be more than sex..... I can see doing it without your friends permission/approval if you are prepared to lose the friend.    The secret part for just sex.....some people just have a totally different outlook/value system.    They are spectacular.    More angles please.   Be my friend.  We have similar interests, I like seeing boobs, you have boobs.    Look into Guild Wars, can get it for 10 dollars often and no monthly fees, etc.     I've been trying to be more "open" to the possibility that people aren't all out to take advantage of me/you/whoever, etc.  But there are definitely people who will absolutely use that openness and trust to get what they want.  Your way of thinking will make you happier and you SHOULDNT have to worry about people hurting you, but it can happen.  So I just hope you keep that in mind and take some reasonable precautions.    Otherwise a very nice post and I appreciate it.    Depends, if you know they need to sleep a lot, it'd be REALLLLY annoying for the phone to be ringing while you are recovering.  If you know they are active/awake then sure.  Or just leave a voicemail by going straight to voicemail to avoid bugging them with the phone ringing....or other form of communication that isn't immediate and ask em to call you when they are able.    I want some.    He's helped some, but yeah I think about it often and still feel it's pretty true.  Of course thinking like that also has the qualities of a self-fulfilling prophecy.   The depressed.  Because it feels like a lot of us are "adrift" or "unattached" in some way that other people have.....shrug.    People are pretty self obsessed, and this is a prime example.  Not even malicious, but still hurts just the same.    Therapist told me today that like 70% of people's "motivation" is revenge.  I GUESS you could get revenge on your friend, but then you'd be an asshole.  But maybe you'd be a happy asshole.  Said in a joking/not joking kind of way.    Yeah when you're in the pit, it's very hard to see a way out.  Envision a circle of light surrounded by darkness, it could be the path up and out, or you could be looking up as you fall deeper in.  That little "click" in your head for thinking is ALL you have to do, and it seems pretty impossible.    There's some truth to this where the negative aspects get over emphasized, or neutral encounters become negative when seen through the depression cloud.  And yeah, I have discussed this before.  Although I haven't titled it quite so eloquently as "disposable people" to him.  I have a feeling he would disagree.   It does seem like it.  Especially in the US, people ask "What do you do?" to define you.  It's not QUITE as bad as it was with the economy destroying lives, but yeah....job is a huge part of your "worth" for most.  Kinda terrifying.   This just kind of happens normally from what I've seen.  Marriages, kids, moving away for jobs.  If they are high school friends, I don't think I stayed in touch with a single one of them past college.  But yeah these subjects are not something most people can understand.   4 and 5, 4 probably if you have frequent Poop_Attacks, the straps will help hold it on.    Yeah, I haven't had hope of alright for awhile now.   Just lately it's been way worse.  Everything seems very superficial and pointless.     Yeah, not really seeing a point in un-fucking my life lately.   You have me beat.   I am just contemplating my worthlessness.   I'm sorry to hear about your situation.   I envy that you had someone even if it didn't last.    There now can't even sleep it off.   Tomorrow is going to be horrible.    I'm laying in bed unable to sleep and that question keeps popping in my head.   I feel like I could disappear tomorrow and my "friends" wouldn't notice for months potentially years.   Trying to meet new people seems like someone is playing a joke on me.   Respond to an ad on r4r,  LITERALLY contacting someone who claims that want to talk and it must just be anyone but me.     Then you have the "professionals" who are there to help you.   It's really hard to take what they say to heart when you know it'd look pretty bad for them if you went out and offed yourself.   It's just REALLY hard to tell when someone cares even a little bit anymore.   And it's amusing to me because the only thing I want to do in response to all of this "lack" of attention is just kill any and all means of communication with people.   Stop seeing the therapist, stop taking meds,  remove contacts from Facebook, remove any and all messaging apps,  delete this account,  etc.   Stupid way to approach the lonely problem,  but seems completely logical when I'm thinking on it.   Like a punishment for "them" and they likely won't even notice.   And then you discover how disposable/replaceable you really are.   I am very disposable.    Never got into a lot of detail with him.  But the way it was described made me think he was day trading to some extent.  I don't have any personal experience with it, but figured the OP might look into it since I'm sure someone on Reddit could advise if he has disposable income and a will.  	23
 It makes too much sense that this world we inhabit is not meant for human souls. There is too much pain and suffering here.   I feel for you OP. I'm sorry you had to endure that, and I hope Tamara either forgets her hatred, or forgives you with time.   Will second. Join in, and just have some fun ;)   .....and now my eyes are dry....   Will second this statement...... What the actual fuck did I just read?   Salt the living hell out of that thing, then burn in with sage, then take the ashes, and mix them with salt. Then burn that shit too. Clowns are the creepiest things known to mankind.   But they can migrate from the couch.... Makes it sound as though they could be anywhere.....   If you can, try to get a look at it. Try and describe it for us so we may help you better. Other than that, though, if sleeping under the bed has worked so far, why fix what ain't broke?   You should find out what you can. If the police are there, then obviously the problem isn't gone. You need to know how to defend yourself against this thing.    .....How did the lady know that he had to sit down and close his eyes? How did she know he was standing? Who is she? What does she know? Who was the entity outside the window? And why are there more police patrolling the area now?   "But I love a good mystery too, my darling Lucy."  The sentence that chilled me to my core. Definitely a well written account of what is happening to you OP.  I will say, however, that if it is Lucy, she's a much better actress than you may have every thought possible. Just watch your step. Always remember, keep your friends close, but your enemies closer. See if you can get the sick bastard to bring up another box. The part that gets me is the fact that there were Lucy's hairs with the evidence.  Tread carefully, OP.  	10
 Thanks!   Turned out much better than I expected. Learned a lot from watching my mom sew when I grew up.    Thanks! It's a really cute fabric!!    Thank you! I'm thinking I took "high waisted skirt" a little too literally, but it doesn't look proportionate if I were to fold over the waistband.    Good advice! It is a Singer 6412. Will have to look online for the manual so I don't miss any moving parts. How often should I oil it?    Thanks! I got it from hobby lobby. Was just thinking I should have written down the brand. Good luck with yours! Mine was fun. PLENTY of inconsistencies because I'm a beginner, but with the help of the video, it was pretty easy.

 How is it mysogonistic though?   I gotta find something. I really don't want to turn to amphetamines.   Fixed again. But I still don't quite see how saying "bitch" is an oppressive word...  	3
 Umm... If this isn't something you're comfortable talking about I totally get that, but if you would be, any change we could get the full story?   I moved in with my best friend and his girlfriend last June, my first apartment outside of my parents house. It has not been... great. just typed the following in facebook chat:  [Tue Apr 24 2012 12:15:14 AM] Verbal27: I feel like I'm going to vomit because I just ate most of a box of penne pasta. Why did I do this? Because I wanted spaghetti but I was out and I noticed [McDouche] and [Lady McDouche] had like 9 different boxes of the same three kinds of pasta, that they clearly kept forgetting that they bought already and kept re buying. So i thought of the snide remark [McDouche] would make upon finding some of his pasta consumed "See you got into the pene there, we were uh... actually lookin at maybe using that for dinner tonight." And I thought of the glee I would feel upon pointing out the hypocrisy and falseness of that statement. So I cooked, and I ate, beyond my capacity. In short, I just hate fucked a box of my former best friends pasta with my mouth [Tue Apr 24 2012 12:21:58 AM] Verbal's friend: ... [Tue Apr 24 2012 12:22:09 AM] Verbal's friend: Hate is a wonderful thing  Thinking it may be time to find a new living situation. What are some of your best "Weeelp, time to be hittin the ole dusty trail" stories?   My first time seeing it. Get over yourself.   I guess that's a matter of perspective. I'm by no means a prude about what i watch online, but the mindset of a person who would want to do that is one of the lower forms of filth we have to offer.   Is...is... is that a thing?   If I may ask, would you mind sharing your story? If not, I understand.   To be fair I was 9 pages deep in res and still on posts from today, that's gonna take a while to get through   It's not exactly the same concept. I obviously have no intention of ever having anything to do with him again, but I have deeply emotional and personal memories with him that are all tainted now. It's not just something I kind of enjoyed, this was someone who had a profound influence on my life.   In High School, my friend, we'll call him A (I don't give a fuck about his anonymity, you'll find out why in a second, but I do want to keep within guidelines) was the one person who was there for me by my side through everything. We met pretty soon after I transferred in my sophomore year, and were best of friends since then. He was like a brother to me and it's a stupid cliche but I would have taken a bullet for him. We had a bit of a falling out after I went to college and weren't as close but I still considered him one of my closest friends and we kept in touch until about midway through senior year.   Late last year I found out why we fell out of touch, he was arrested on 16 counts of possessing and distributing child porn. He was sentenced last month to four years in jail, much to lenient in my opinion.  Reddit, I just can't reconcile this. He was a brother to me and all of a sudden he's this despicable piece of human filth. I can't stop hating him for this, when people around me are telling me he has a sickness and I should pity him. Have any of you had an experience like this where your image of someone was completely and irrevocably shattered. How did you reconcile the old experiences with the new person? Can you even?  TL;DR High school best friend turns out to be CP loving scumbad, can't figure out how to deal.    Makes sense. Thanks!   Don't most novelty accounts also have a primary account?    Anyone notice rediquette says don't complain about reposts?   I have no desire for his death, but kim jong un is a fascist with no leadership qualifications who will lead his country to oblivion.   Just playing Devils advocate a little and this probably won't even be read.  Also full disclosure, I may be biased because I had already pre ordered the special edition.  This is obviously a marketing strategy by ea and its kind of shitty but ea didn't make the game, bioware did. People who have been crafting this story through three games are the one who built these, and I trust that they wouldn't have anything taken out that was story essential, ala exiled prince or kasumi and zaed.  Just my thoughts but I could be very wrong. We'll see in 2 weeks.

Sorry you had to go through that, if you ever need anyone to talk to...   But what happened to the noodles?   Dave?   Hot glue is the devil. Especially in a public school system where science teachers don't know their subject so all of your classes are building shit.    Commenting to save the link as I dont have RES at work      Witch! Burn Him!   How about Kevin Smith? One of the most influential writers of gen x. Grew as a director from film to film ending most recently with his crowning achievement visually, Red State. Created an entire podcasting network while making a movie and touring the country.  Also seems to be a legitimately nice guy who's very passionate about his work and his fans      Absolutely. Not arguing that at all.    Afghanistan. An organization from that Country did attack us.    Gonna work through it, Thanks!   Lol. I'm just contrite when contrition is called for.    Yes passed, but I'm talking about lack of a veto.    Ok this time I legitimately am apologizing, Just had an asshole customer so was pissed off. Didn't need to come at you like that.    I can see that definitely, but support of NDAA and probable support of SOPA, which is implied by signing into law, crosses a line in the values that I voted for .    Ok, but in that same school can you take some classes in sarcasm too?   My two big ones are gay marriage and his tax plan. Allegedly he's gonna be cutting major taxes to the top 1% of earners. Can you talk about that and where he stands in his tax policy?   Sorry I didn't meet your standards. Maybe another time.   Edit: Was it the one where I talked about trying to commit suicide? Cause I'm sorry but that one kills at parties.   Romney is one of the one's I'm strongly looking at, I do have some questions about some of his more fundamentalist ideologies but I do like a lot of hist governmental stances.    Sorry, I'll be in the corner   No prob, just when you have time. Thanks!   What are you basing that on? Again, not challenging, what about these guys leads you to believe they are that fundamentally similar to the bushes etc of the past?  	43
 Oh it's okay I found it! I just typed it in wrong the last time :3 Thank you!! :)   Oh my gosh I LOVED Kimi ni Todoke!!!    I've been recommended Golden Time a few times so I'm definitely going to watch it now! I really loved My Little Monster as well! Ano Natsu de Matteru looks good as well! Thank you for your suggestions! :)   I had a look around and can't find the anime you're talking about. Do you perhaps know the Japanese title of it or a link to where I can find it?  	4
 Very true, good point!   That is a really good point. I feel as though we do need to have this conversation, so I can really test and see if she knows how much damage she has done and whether she is really sorry.    So my mom doesnt exhibit all nbehaviors, but she was definitely a toxic parent, and I am dealing with a lot of issues because of it.  I had recently (since this past Christmas) gone NC with her after she flipped out and overreacted, which resulted in her kicking me out. You can read the post [here,](http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2qd73m/hyperreligious_nmom_kicked_me_out_today_merry/) and the [update] (http://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/2qqznd/hyperreligious_nmom_kicked_me_out_today_merry/) I posted afterwards.  Anyway, this morning she called, and I had deleted her number, and didn't recognize it, so I answered. She called saying that she wanted to apologize for her actions and that what she did wasnt right, and that God wanted her to reflect and apologize to me. She told me that she would like my forgiveness, but she understands if I don't give it.   Here's the thing, though. I was ready to ignore her completely, and to not call her on Mother's Day, her birthday, or on holidays. I wasn't going to invite her to my college graduation next spring because she's done nothing but make my college experience much harder with all of the emotional abuse and manipulation. She's treated me so badly that I cannot just let her have access into my life, or an opportunity to let me down. She's beat on me and has always been much harsher to me than the other kids in my family for no reason. Its just so confusing though, because she's given me a sincere apology, and unprovoked, as far as I know.   I am starting to feel guilt already at the thought of maintaining NC/VLC after this. And I'm very suspicious. My brother just left to go to boot camp, and I keep thinking that this is a way to get one of her adult children back into her life, since she's got a 14 year old, 8 year old, and a 5 year old, along with a deadbeat husband who offers her barely any support emotionally or financially back home.  I'm just....really hesitant because I don't want to fall back into the guilting, and the manipulation, and the lack of boundaries.   Can anyone offer some insight about this?   Wow, writing a book, especially a book of poetry is something to be proud of! I'm sorry that you couldn't be proud of it the way you wanted to be :/   Yeah :/ I feel you. Thank you for the hugs   I scored an 8 and shit like this makes me wonder how I turned out so relatively normal. I should be dead or nearly dead by now   My mother is half black, and so I'm a quarter black. This matters to the story, trust me.   She was talking about how she got the best parts about being both white and black: her lips are full but not too much, her skin is a nice mocha color, she has thick hair but it can grow long, etc. Puke, I know.  I, being 11 at the time, wanting my mother's approval and a link to her obviously superior genetics, asked, "What about my lips, mama, are they nice too? I think the'yre shaped just like yours." And then i smiled at her.   She looks at me and says, "Hm, well your top lip is pretty thin." My face instantly fell.   She was always annoyed by my low self-esteem growing up, too. It was obviously because there was something wrong with me that I was just refusing to fix, it didnt come about because of constant shit like this. No, never. Baffling.   Wow...this sounds almost exactly like my situation. I was kicked out on Christmas day because my mom told me and my impressionable younger sister that women needed to cook and clean and were not allowed to rest, and the men should sit around and relax all day. When I complained, she flew off the handle. I also have younger siblings, four younger, and it's hard not being there with them to protect them, but they know I love them. It gets better.    Yeah, i thought about that one, and I'm just going to keep saying to her that I am only here for my brother and that her hugging/fake praise/whatever other bullshit she pulls is making me uncomfortable. I'm also going to send her a text the day before establishing my purposes and that we don't have a relationship to speak of so she should not pretend as if there were one.     I have a family event coming up where my mother (who i am NC with) will be as well.  My therapist told me to treat her like a yapping dog:   You don't walk into a room where a yappy dog is barking and think "oh no, the dog is barking a lot, what did I do to make it bark??" right? You realize the dog will bark because that's what it does, no matter what you do. You also don't refrain from socializing with the ones you love in a room with a little yappy dog just because it's barking. You're not afraid of it because it's just noise, and it has no power over you.   This helps me immensely when preparing to go into possible situations where my mom is going to be. At worst, when she decides to hop on the crazy train, it comes off more as an annoyance than a traumatic, emotional event. Hope this helps someone else too :)   Good advice, will definitely be doing this.   That's a good idea. He lives about four hours away from me, so I have to get a ride into town and then stay with my boyfriend's parents for the weekend. I could try and get him out to dinner with me or something beforehand    All I have to say is, I'm glad I'm not the only one. I'm generally very outgoing and love to talk to people, but I get this "vibe" from people that they don't want to hear what I have to say, or I am the "weird person" in the group after I start talking about something. I'm not sure if my social skills are off or if I have anxiety left over from when my mom would sigh and interrupt me in the middle of me talking about something and talk about something unrelated that she wanted to say, totally just ignoring every contribution I ever gave. Probably a combination of both.  It's actually converted me from being extremely willing to meet new people and have a conversation with someone I just met to me holing myself up in my room and feeling nauseous and scared to talk to people or look them in the eye while im at university. Super awesome, thank you nparentalunit   You did the right thing. But remember: he doesn't deserve *better*, he deserves something *different* that suits his needs and desires better. You also deserve that.  Just because you don't want kids does not make you lesser, it just means that there are better people suited to the lifestyle he wants, and the same goes for you.  I know that doesn't make it any easier, and it sucks that you had to give up a good relationship. Sorry that this happened to you :/   You can get yourself emancipated, like everyone else is saying, OR if you don't want to go through the legal process, and you are just worried about the FAFSA, there is an option on it saying that you cannot provide your parents' information, because they are abusive. Usually schools will help you go through a dependency override process, as long as you are no longer living with that parent. If you can live with a friend during breaks or something, I would do that.   I am going through the same situation right now. During breaks, I live with my boyfriend's parents and work, and for the school year I live off of loans and scholarships and grants. I filled out a dependency override form, and the process was fairly painless. All i had to do was write a statement, get someone not related to me (like a cop, a counselor, or such) to write a statement, and then I got my boyfriend's mom to write one. VOILA! No contact since then.      I can only imagine what that child sounds like, and it's making me cringe. That said, I think this is a pretty cute way to announce a pregnancy, unless they made her cry on purpose   Haha, I love your flair!   That's very true. I love RBN, it's how I found you guys!   It's nice to hear from someone who has a fairly "normal" life without tons of vacations. I dont think my bf and I will be able to travel as much as some either but it doesn't really matter. No kids! Thank you :)   Haha, I love this   So happy for you that you're making it! It must have been pretty hard losing all of that saved up money, but at least youre not in debt up to your eyeballs. Good for you!   Yeah, and even though there are posts that have a lot of hate in them and I don't agree with everything everyone says here (that happens when youre an adult in an adult world), I still think we should have a place where we can put those feelings. We aren't evil. Those here who hate kids don't hate them in a "KILL ALL THE CHILDREN!!" way, just in the sense that they're annoying and parents seem to encourage that behavior a lot nowadays.   I'm relatively new here, and I just found out that this subreddit actually has a really bad reputation.  I just have to say that surprises me! Even though we have a lot of people who absolutely hate kids period, we have people who are living the CF lifestyle and just wish people who are parents would stop being assholes. And it's kind of a nice little support group when we feel alone or out of touch with the childbearing population.  I have to say that I am so thankful that this sub exists. I was already not feeling the whole having children thing, but this sub helped me to realize that I was making the right choice and I wasn't alone in feeling this way. It's saved me $250,000 and maybe even more than that if I were to have more than one child because I felt as though I was "missing out" or if I would have let the bingo-ing get to me. You guys have saved my life as I know it, and I am so grateful.   Not to mention, there have been maybe a few examples of parental regret that I've heard of before this subreddit, but I went through the top posts of this subreddit, and I've found so many examples of parents who regret having their kids. I've never heard of a CF person who regrets it.   So you guys keep doing you! Thanks for being here! :)   Haha, well he's a game design major and it's sort of his mecca. I just want to be somewhere where the sun is shining, the people are diverse and weird, and I don't have to deal with these miserable winters. It'll be expensive but worth it. :)   Rock on! Aunties/Uncles who spoil their nieces/nephews unite!   This is hilarious. I would be a much better pet owner than kid owner. We plan to have furry babies of our own one day :)   Exactly!   ...between liking kids and wanting kids of your own. I'm not a child hater in any sense of the word. I see a baby at a restaurant and I freak out over how cute it is. I see toddlers running around at a park and it makes me smile. I love babysitting.  But I would never, EVER, have kids of my own. The thought of it makes me cringe so hard. If I were to get pregnant, I know that I would abort it, and not regret that decision. I've had a couple scares before where I was ready to make an appointment. All my girl friends say they couldnt fathom the idea of having a baby now, but they do want kids someday. For me, there is no someday. I don't get excited about the prospect of having kids. Rather, it makes me feel as though the day I give birth to a child is the day I give up my life and my freedom.  I may feel this way because I grew up being a mother-figure to my four younger siblings, and the fact that my own mother was a terrible parent, but it doesn't matter. The reason I feel this way does not change that I FEEL THIS WAY.   I hate it when people say "I've seen the way you are with kids, it would be such a WASTE if you weren't a mom!" or "You love kids, how could you not want any of your own??" Especially when it's people who I have expressed my child-free feelings towards.  Also, I have a serious boyfriend, and people always say to me that it would be such a shame if we didnt have kids because we are such a good couple. I'm fairly sure we are a good couple because we do things for each other that ease each other's stress as much as we can, and one of those things is that we don't have or want kids. I am 100 percent sure that bringing kids into the equation would change our relationship entirely, and I am not going to give our amazing relationship up. That does not make me a selfish person, either.  Luckily, even though I am only 20, I've met someone who also doesn't want kids, and he wants to marry me and travel the world with me and wants to get the hell out of the midwest and end up in the fabulous city of LA. I cannot say how much of a relief it is to have him. As long as we are on the same page, all the rest of that shit we put up with doesn't matter, honestly.     	29

 A runescape friend of mine sent me this list. Some people in my clan chat asked if I could post it on reddit so they could use it. My ingame name is An Idol.

 [Here is an article I wrote about good apps I use](http://thesga.org/2013/07/ten-essential-mobile-apps-for-the-archaeologist/)   They have it at Disneyworld too in Hollywood Studios.   I think anthropology is a wonderful discipline, but I got into the field knowing it was not a moneymaker and jobs were hard to come by. However, I do know a couple single moms who are badass archaeologists.   Anthropology is very complimentary with many other fields, including business and sales, because of how it teaches people to better understand other people. Perhaps you could minor in Anthro and use it to complement something else that you would enjoy if you are worried about employability.   If all else fails, many states and cities in the US have archaeology societies that welcome avocational (people without degrees) and professional archaeologists alike. These groups have regular meetings and presentations and often organize volunteer excavations. Perhaps finding a group like this in your area can even help you with your decision. If you're in the southeast, PM me for some leads on these groups.   Best of luck! It's a hard road, but if you know what you are getting into it can be a rewarding journey.   I would probably "kill them with kindness," by being really nice about it but thinking vindictive things to myself about how much money they are spending and how much extra calories I don't have to worry about. :x   Hey you Pikachu?   How do you get flaired? I'm new here.   Yes they do! :)   We mainly get 4th graders here, and yes most of them are adorable. :) Also thank you!   People don't fit into neatly defined boxes on a census form, no matter how much sociologists wish they would.   People are people.  I am a museum educator at a Mississippian site in the US, and children ask me all the time things like "Why are they dressed like that?" I usually turn it around and ask them, "Well why did you choose that shirt today?" And then their little brains go "oooooh," and we get one step closer to cultural empathy.    I called 10 days prior and then asked again when we checked in. All we wanted was a King size bed and they made it happen.   We were at WDW celebrating our anniversary last week and I wore my anniversary pin everywhere. One of the castmembers at the Fiesta de Jardin booth at the Flower and Garden festival was commenting how the 1st anniversary should be extra special and gave us an extra flan. I think it helped that we were talking in spanish! :) I loved having everyone wish us a happy anniversary. :)   I came. o_o   Why thank you :)   I'm not sure what that means, but I can say they were goooooood!   The weekends haven't gotten started yet so Darth's Mall wasn't open for us. :( They start the character meals on May 4th.   Thanks and you're welcome! It's a great pin. :D   Haaaaaah that's awesome!   Definitely!   I was kinda sad they didn't have that going last week, but it looks really great! Have fun!   That's awesome! I'm super grateful to your cousin then!   It was a really intricate costume! His helmet scanner even flipped down. No voice, but somehow that made them even more menacing.   We had an awesome time!! The character interaction was wonderful (I have to say though I think it depends on how into it the guest is- you gotta give them something to work with people!), the food was AMAZING, and the atmosphere was spectacular (Sci Fi Dine-In).  We arrived for our 8:25 reservation with a few minutes to spare, checked in, and mingled with other guests while we waited to join the rebellion. Once your rebel cell is called, you join the line to meet [Darth Vader and Boba Fett](http://i.imgur.com/1mcxNdb.jpg). As you can guess from my outfit, I was not too popular with them! Fett liked my boyfriends' shirt though of course. Boba scanned me with his helmet eyepiece and tried to collect my bounty. He was also not impressed by my ears! Darth Vader went as far as taking my Chewbacca plushie, holding it up for the crowd to see, then turning back towards me and slowly and deliberate wringing his neck before dropping him on the floor while staring directly at me. Evil!  After you get your picture taken, the cast member hands each person a mini Lightsaber that can go either red or blue depending on which side you are on. At the table, (which are little cars from the 50's) you get your menu and the server goes to get your pastry starter. A pastry tray, fruit, beverage, and entree are all included in one price. The [pastry tray](http://i.imgur.com/wBRwqgi.jpg) had chocolate muffins, puff pastry Lightsaber sticks with red or blue sugar, Darth Vader Danish things and Princess Leia sticky buns. All delicious! The fruit salad or parfait that you get next has a little melon Yoda on the top. The entrees all have cute Star Wars names, but the only one that looks special are the [Vader waffles](http://i.imgur.com/QG1TZyu.jpg) which were amazingly delicious! I washed everything down with a blue milk (kinda blue raspberry flavored). The cast member who checked us in at our hotel mentioned we could keep ordering as many entrees as we wanted, but we found that one entree was plenty of food.  The screen at Sci Fi was playing Star Wars clips the entire time and whenever the cantina band music came on, the jawas and Stormtroopers all danced. [I traded with the Jawas](http://i.imgur.com/3VKH1zS.jpg] (they swindled me!), convinced the [Storm Troopers](http://i.imgur.com/yAGUrPJ.jpg) we were not the diners they were looking for, and [apologized to Greedo](http://i.imgur.com/qBpxvVp.jpg) for the incident in Mos Eisley so he would take a picture with me. When we left, Boba Fett almost followed me out the door to make sure I left. All in all, it was an amazing experience that I am so glad we were able to do.   Lol thank you :) I had a lot of comments on my ears (which came from etsy) so lots of people liked them!   I traded a rubber Darth Vader keychain and got a pink usb cable in return. My boyfriend said mostly what he saw in the trade bag was candy.   It really was! Have a nice time.   That's right, it only goes partway through June.    We had an awesome time!!

I've been looting for about a year now. :3 Thanks!   Glad to help!    I love having the shoulder strap. I think the case looks great too. I might have to get some patches or something to brighten it up some. I just like color!   I would think so. That case looks really similar to the one I have on mine in the photos attached to my review.   [Here's my review, thank you!](http://www.amazon.com/review/R1948J6WYDGGS0/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm)   Hey if you remember [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/3474zi/10_free_new_3ds_xl_cases_in_exchange_for_honest/) post from a few days ago about the case, you might be interested in my review of the product [here](http://www.amazon.com/review/R1948J6WYDGGS0/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm)  I really recommend the case! :D   Oh snap there will be OVER 9000 pokemon to finish the dex!   Yes that is the face tracker.   /u/Trollabot test_subject9096   I have a TN screen one. It doesn't bother me. Mine is black and I got it about five weeks ago.   I think so too. IDK why neckbeards insist on downvoting. XD   Gimmefreestuffers are everywhere on the internet.   [This case perhaps?

As stated above I used metallic temporary tattoos I found on Amazon and sealed it with base coat nail polish.   I know right? I realize of course that it's fairly harmless but that doesn't mean I can't feel a lil creepy.   Yeah I should do that.   Yeah I never considered the possibility and my Mii is pretty recognizable.  	55
 I used to order the medium boneless wings....and eat most of them....that's about 15 wings at 80-100 calories a piece depending on sauce.....I knew it wasn't great, but didn't realize how bad it was...   What exactly are naked tenders?   I haven't been to Bdubs since I started 1200 calorie lifestyle.  When I used to go there, the amount of food I ate was ridiculous.  Any suggestions for menu items that are tasty and won't completely throw off my day?   Thanks!    I'm currently working as a cashier and to calculate my TDEE use sedentary.  I'm starting a new job in a bakery pretty soon though,  should I switch to lightly active to account for the extra calories burned while working?     I like lambics! I'll keep an eye out for it.   It sounds good! Do you have any specific recommendations?    I am 24F 5'5" SW: 165 pounds CW: 148. 150 was my first goal, because that's what puts me at a normal weight.  It was only 15 pounds,  but being able to say I am no longer overweight is such an amazing feeling!    I've been tracking everything on MFP and have been eating 1200-1300 calories a day. Took me 77 days to get to where I am now. And I'm hoping to continue to my next goal of 135 pounds.    Reading everyone's posts on here has been a huge help and inspiration.   I'll plan it out either right before bed or first thing in the morning. I've been learning to leave about 200 spare calories just in case I need an extra snack at some point, or when dinner comes and I want to put extra cheese or sauce on my food. If I still have that 200 calories before bed, I'll have a beer :)    They make little 80 calorie packs of Nutella. They are meant to be used on the go, but I like them because when I measure out a tablespoon,  I can't accidentally put a big round tablespoon of Nutella on my plate.    I'm trying to eat about 1200 to 1300 calories as well,  and have found that /r/1200isplenty has helped.       In Wisconsin you pick from a touch screen  what seat you want.     1/4 cup brown rice (150)  1 cup spinach (10)  3.8 oz Salmon (104)  Sauce for Salmon:  1/4 tsp cornstarch (2)  3/4 Tbs soy sauce (8)  1/2 Tbs honey (30)  1/2 tsp unsalted butter (17)  3/4 Tbs lime juice (0)  Little bit of powdered garlic  2.5 oz baby carrots (29)  Sauce for carrots:  1/4 Tbs light brown sugar (4)  1 Tbs soy sauce (10)  Little bit of garlic and ginger powder.  1/2 tsp sesame seeds on top of salmon (9)   374 Calories      Just received an email, the 7 for 27 is now. You can buy online or in stores I believe :)   I'm 5'5 and currently 151. We got this! :)    You don't want them soaking forever,  but these were fresh and crisp and seemed to hold up well.    Romaine hearts :)   You're welcome! Good luck :)   I'll have to look for them next time I go to the next town over. My tiny town has one grocery store and they don't have them.    I'm glad you still enjoy it sometimes :)   Romaine lettuce, don't try iceberg lettuce. When you buy romaine a head of it isn't round, it's long and narrow and each "boat" is a leaf. I'd post a picture but I'm on mobile and don't know how to post a pic in comments. Google romaine lettuce and look at pics if my rambling doesn't make sense :)   Bison meat is so good!   It's buffalo meat.   We used ground beef prime rib burger, cooked it, added onion, and mixed in some canned enchilada sauce. And seasoned it with whatever my SO threw in there, he is the spice man.   I mixed corn, black beans, and canned tomato  green chilis together and heated them up.  This was meant to be just a side dish, but I threw some on top of my meat as well, and mixed a little bit of shredded Mexican cheese on top.   Calories came to 509. We aim to keep dinner between 500 and 600. Without the shell it would have been 444. And the meat we used wasn't lean, so probably could have shaved a bit more calories off if we picked a different meat. But I was still under calories for the day so I was happy with the meal :)   Edit: Numbers. ...   I'm a baker....I used to eat fresh baked bread for lunch, by itself. I've cut back, but I'll never be able to ditch bread completely.     I love shells and bread and all the calorie dense carbs. I do enjoy a good taco salad, but I can't abandon my shells completely.  I ate all the lettuce boats first and saved the shell for last.    Enjoy!  	28
 Futurama is my six year old brother's favorite show to watch, which makes me happy because I've been watching it since I was around his age too  	1
 I think you need more pictures, and they need to be bigger. Hard to see much from just that.   I thought pic 3 was BY FAR your best - IMHO ditch the beard and never bring it back, and keep your hair short. Other than that, you're doing well man.   I opened the second picture and literally said "oh fuck off, he's way too good looking for this sub." Keep up with the weight loss and maybe try a more mature haircut, and you'll be beating them off with a stick.   love_scene_girls is right - with different glasses and a different haircut, you'd be amazed at the difference and the improvement. best of luck bro.  P.S. do you get told you look like Martin Freeman?   Honestly dude... you've got skills. I wish I could flip a situation like that and create so much attraction. Once you get past this, you're going to be one hell of a PUA.     Thanks man.   1) look for positives in everything that you do. The more you practice finding something good about something, the easier it will be. Get on a bus? Appreciate the air conditioning. Go into a shop? Compliment the service.  2) When you are with another person, be it friend, date or otherwise, think about things about them that you like. If something strikes you, just tell them. Straight up. All you have to do is smile and be honest.  3) Once this comes easily to you, you can start putting some more thought into what people *want* to be told. What are they like? What do they want from their life? If they're a driven career person, for example, tell them you admire their drive and dedication. In a similar vein, there's a great quote that goes "tell smart girls they are pretty, and pretty girls they are smart."   Thanks for the resources man, I'm really appreciating this other side of the PUA community that I hadn't seen before. The more I read about it, the more it helps with the rest of the stuff on /r/seduction, like filtering through TRP and 'alpha' stuff to only take in advice that I want to use.   Excellent point. If it works, it works. There can obviously be pleasure in the art of pickup for the sake of itself - developing newer, more subtle strategies for the fun of doing so - but if you're not into that and you have something that works, who cares?   I've tried getting into pickup several times, and I'm currently on my fourth attempt. What always killed it for me before is what seemed to be the cunning and manipulative aspect - get as many girls as possible to have sex with you, never tell them they're pretty because it's so beta, never listen when a girl tells you about a problem and needs emotional support because it's so AFC. I hated it, and I consciously decided every single time that I'd rather be lonely, single, and still a kind and loving person than a manipulative, selfish prick who has no time for people who won't give him sex or social proof to get sex from other people.  This post is an amazing breath of fresh air. It's exactly what I needed to hear, thank you.   sources or videos than can teach me this? I'm incredibly interested.   Dude, she's blowing up your phone. She clearly wants you. What are you worried about?   I'm attractive   I work out  She's probably texting her friends right now saying "this really attractive guy messaged me online and even asked me on a date, what am I going to do? He probably messaged five girls as attractive as I am, how can I show him I'm better?"  Stop thinking about whether you deserve her and think about whether she deserves you. 'Leagues' are only determined by the people who end up out of them. Enjoy your date, have fun, see what happens.  P.S. many of the most ridiculously attractive girls are actually quite lonely, because everyone is too intimidated to approach them. You may be one of the few who has even shown interest in her and that's why she's blowing up your phone. So to reiterate, she wants you just as much as you want her. Best case scenario.   Tell smart girls that they are pretty, and pretty girls that they are smart.   You're out on a date, it's going fine, you're getting IOIs etc, and you kiss her to show your interest (rather than tell her, as I've been informed). Then maybe you kiss her again.   What do you then do in the immediate seconds after kissing her? Continue with whatever activity the date was? Go somewhere else? Say something? Assuming the time is not right to invite her back to your place.    You've got a point, and I respect that. But at the end of the day, the whole Pascal's Wager thing isn't even why I'm there. It's to be a better person and hang out with a great group of people.  There are people who say that atheist organisations are capable of following similar morals to the bible (etc, blah blah blah) and having the same effect, and as I've said, I don't know a single atheist who is as good a person as a GOOD christian. That, also, is besides the point - I think it's a bit like gym routines, where everyone has one that works well for them and doesn't necessarily work well for others. This one works for me. What more can I ask for?   It doesn't work like that.    Now it's a huge part in her.    If you don't like small talk, then don't do it.   Steer the conversation towards something more meaningful and with more substance. This comment is hardly the place to explain that full process but there's plenty on /r/seduction about it - but basically, get them talking about something they are passionate about and that you can have an interesting dialogue about where you both learn something. Politics and religion are probably not the best topics for obvious reasons, but once you've gotten through the basics of a meeting (who are you, what do you do etc) you should be able to either find something you have in common which you can discuss, or if you have nothing in common, ask them to explain a topic for you. For example: "so you're a biochemist? I honestly know nothing about biochemistry, can you explain what makes it so interesting to you?" People love to talk about what they are interested in, and it's the best way to a) make them feel like they've had a great conversation and b) learn something new for yourself.    I find this dodgy. No field report, no conversation starters for pairs of people, no evidence at all other than "it's easier than one person."   Nope, ballet dancer.   Even the bandies have their jocks and their nerds. I was a nerd bandie for years, I felt like I was on the same social level as an amoeba.   Doing it with a big grin helps a lot. Also, be 100% confident right through the activity. If you falter or think "I'm being annoying," somehow, that's when it is annoying. But if you just keep going like it's a hilarious joke then it is for them as well.   Thinking of "pushing your belly button in" for vocal support is a terrible idea. I'm a professional singer, and I've personally suffered from using that mentality - it causes vastly too much airflow below the vocal folds and can cause you severe vocal damage in the long run. It also doesn't help you increase your volume because you are still basically shouting, and it reduces the amount of oxygen that is used by your lungs.  I can''t teach you how to breathe properly here, because that's a serious job for a face-to-face professional. But you *must* not focus on consciously contracting your abdominal muscles (or pulling in your belly button) - you are tensing the rectus abdominus muscles rather than the transverse abdominus groups, which is exactly the opposite of what needs to happen, as the rectus abdominus must stay as loose as possible in order for support to function at all. Your body will use the transverse groups to support speech automatically (this is how any air is moved over the vocal folds at all) and consciously thinking about it is the best way to interrupt this process.  There are plenty of exercises and resources on the internet that can aid you in this, but there is also a lot of bullshit. You want to look for Accent Method Breathing for singers, which is over the top for an everyday speaker, but exactly the right thing for everybody to be doing to some extent.   Have you seen a speech pathologist? I'm a professional singer and, believe me, it's so easy to think you're doing the right thing with your breathing and your vocal technique when you're really, really not.  Books and youtube videos can't help you, nor can online courses. Only getting real help from someone face to face who can listen to your sound and give you feedback will be of any benefit. It is of enormous benefit. Depending on what country you live in, this may also be covered by your health insurance.  edit: I've just read the above comment on "pulling your belly button in" - this is a horrible idea and will make your 'shouting' *much* worse rather than any better. Please don't do this.   Depending on who writes the love letter or how, it's really the same thing.    This definitely, overwhelmingly goes for men as well.    Squealing like a Japanese schoolgirl is not recommended.    Most of the ones I know still can't do it.    Side effects may include jail time   Sorry, /r/relationships needs that space   This may be just my own personal experience, but the only people I've ever encountered who believe that males cannot be raped have been female.   Oops. Well, it was one of the well respected accounts on this subreddit. But I agree with you completely.  I was about to say that the definition of whether a sexual act was rape should always be up to the victim, but that leaves the 'perpetrator' wide open to false accusations, which is a whole other problem. I really wish that people wouldn't make false accusations of rape, it really ruins the legal system for everybody else who is a genuine victim.    I thought it was 'female' that people were opposed to? Wtf?  Also, by their logic calling a man a guy, dude or bro is sexist.    There's a great statistic (well, horrible in real life, but great for the sake of the argument) that usually stops females who dismiss male rape as impossible - 50% of women orgasm when they are raped. I don't have a source for that but I read it somewhere on /r/sex and I remember there being a very reputable source, it may even have been /u/Maxxters that posted it.   It's quite obvious when you think about these things that the body's physical reactions are different to what the mind is actually feeling.    Which uni are you at? If you're in Queensland I can probably recommend some student clubs to join or places to hang out.    You've got a circular process going on here.   1) you've worked really hard and gotten a great body, haircut etc. However, you believe you have failed because girls still don't like you.  2) girls don't like you because you're not self confident, despite the great body and so on.  3) repeat step one, ad infinitum.   I think you need to spend some time acknowledging the successes you have already made - which a lot of people never achieve - and not focus on the things you haven't quite gotten yet. Give yourself some credit for making a great transformation. And I bet that as soon as you do that you'll be beating the girls off with a stick.    I'm willing to bet that he's egotistical, has a very high opinion of his own intelligence, has 'high standards' that his partners must meet - and most importantly, is not really that bright himself.    Also, don't use seduction to fix those emotional issues.    That was actually the cheesiest porno I've ever watched.   I'm not criticising you, I'm judging the guy who criticised you.    That's fascinating, why do you think that is?   You're not even writing full sentences, what right do you have to judge?   finish in her   I used to think that I dressed reasonably well. I stumbled across this subreddit completely by accident, realised in about fifteen seconds that jorts and short sleeve button downs does not constitute 'dressing well,' and quickly fell in love with male fashion as a whole.    It sounds like she has the female version of death grip.    This joke is old, tired, untrue, and not in the least funny.    If the commenter was female talking about a male, the comment would not only be accepted but probably encouraged.   And I bet you wouldn't criticise a girl for noticing an attractive member of the opposite sex.    Is a faggot by definition male? Surely there can be female faggotry?   I don't know, you said some useful things about a comment of mine yesterday.    It seems to me that you're absolutely right, so long as being 'yourself' means being a ripped, well-dressed, ruthlessly confident, socially outgoing alpha male with stacks of social proof.   *I'm 14 and have never played beer pong   I think it's less sexy if it's your only language.    Blunt honesty ahead: my penis, when unerect, is basically a carbon copy of what you described above - about three inches long, mostly squishy, and not terribly thick. That changes dramatically under certain circumstances, and I have no doubt that your guy is the same. I highly doubt that what you've seen was any kind of erection at all.    Really, shouldn't all relationships be best friends who have sex? That's how I view them.  Edit: I don't mean you have to be friends with them first, but that your SO should become your friend. I don't know how it would work otherwise.     Well, at least he's honest.    hard he sleeps  I see what you did there   You're absolutely right.    tyzorybyAGAIN is *technically* correct in that legally it's considered impossible to give your consent during sleep. But I highly doubt the male in question would be concerned.    Does anyone want the Hollywood Marshmallow?   I found this subreddit a week after I broke up with someone, nine months ago. Have been single since. Almost unsubscribed several times from sadness that I am missing out on fun things.    I last tested myself a few years ago, as a mid teens male with no muscle and enough fat to be solidly chubby. I was apparently so underweight that I should be hospitalised. Never trusted an online calculator since.    And while you're bending over backwards to make her happy, what is *she* doing to maintain your attraction to her?   This is the problem I have with the term 'natural' meaning 'not man made.'   I have depression and have recently started lifting. The gym I signed up for comes with three free sessions with a personal trainer. I met him for the first time an hour ago, and he's built like the fucking hulk.   Turns out he's had depression for most of his life and has recently started on medication.    Especially when the average penis (meaning the majority of men) is 5 to 5.5 inches long when fully erect   Anyone who claims that their actions while intoxicated don't count is to me incapable of being responsible for their own actions.    But for this exact reason - if you like him and want something to happen, don't just ask him to hang out. *this is a subtle hint that will go way over his head.*  	67
 good luck and glad you are getting help    my cousin committed suicide on thursday morning. i am going through a tough time. i suffer from depression and have borderline personality disorder. i have been in and out of hospital and doctors about 50 times this year. i had a pain attack a few days ago and screamed down the house from all pain and anger. i screamed at the top of my voice for 5 minutes and someone down the road called the police so i had to explain everything to them. also my sister and mum are abusing each other and hit each other. i have two hospital appointments coming up. one is to get a ultrasound to check my ovaries because i have polycystic ovaries. the other one is to see a psychiatrist and to get accessed. i also collapse from stress and exhaustion. i sleep more than half the time.   tell me its going to be okay and that its not the end of my world and i can get better    you are so pretty and try not to listen to your mother    okay thanks    can you still see the post?    ok thanks. ill give it a try.    thanks. i deleted the post. but I'm not sure if it worked.    i eat anything and everything and don't care.    wow so touching    i have no job and i have no money. i live with family.   	10
 LOL i barely did but thats so weird.    Big age difference, she probably sees you as her younger brother   sorry bro    Sorry, cheating is wrong and dump his ass. And your mother needs to find guys her own age.    Fresh start of a new year! You surround yourself with good friends and it will help you out through the difficult situation.    Your ex girlfriend grandmother is  generous, $300 for a birthday present. You don't owe your girlfriend anything. It's a gift, not a library book. There is no returns on gift. Once you give a gift, don't expect it back. That's the whole point of gift giving!    I'm sorry but it is not your parents responsibility to pay for your fiance's brothers schooling. It's inappropriate and if you give the money to the brother, i have a feeling they'll ask for more money since they are ''family''     AGREED   TBH i wouldn't call this relationship because you haven't even seen pictures of her or even video called her.  "He told me he catfished isn't because he's gay, but because he likes to roleplay as a girl. Because he said he wondered what it would be like to be born as a girl and stuff like that'' he's gay and theres nothing wrong with that.    50/50 way way back   Reese Witherspoon  She won an Oscar than did really shit movies until this year.   I hope you had a good new years up in heaven. I know you must be celebrating with beer and relaxing somewhere wherever you are. It only has been almost a month since you have passed away, but you are always here in my heart.   Miss you dad    I bake because it's a great distraction    My father just died. I know it's hard but you need closure and say your goodbyes    I'm currently in the washroom on the floor while writing this so im sorry if nothimg makez sense. After my dad battling cancer for four years and since September it has been downhill it's hard to know how you are going to feel when you are actually in that position.  It sucks big time being in a room surrounded with people crying. I hate it and I feel so overwhelmed because it happened in a snap of fingers. It sucks and I have exams starting tomorrow. I'm going to stay strong because my dad would want that for me.   I believe in this saying with every curse there is a blessing.   Because of the decline of my dad's health I matured and now I can cook and be more independent.    I needed to vent   Thanks   I might of misread the post but didn't the gf and the friend talk about having sex together    I'm a girl and I do not spoon with my other friends that are girls. If they are talked about sex obviously there's something your gf isn't telling you- they may be attracted to  each other    It's unfornate but you need to surround yourself with people who will be there for you and support you. Your mom is in denial and your step dad is a smuck.  You don't deserve it I mean no one does. Your daughter sounds lovely!   The title makes it seem like your the victim when it's really your boyfriend or shall I saw should be your ex. You are young 17 years old. But, you made the choice to cheat and you should have to pay with the consequences.     Frozen    It took me a while to feel confident enough to go on the road. It worked out that I had the car every day and it boosted my confidence.  Drive a little each day   If your dad can't respect your sexuality then that his loss.    I'm hearing impaired and I get so many complaints that I talk too loud. I wish there was a device to hear how loud I am. I also hate it that people do not know the difference between hearing impairment and deaf.    I found baking to be very therapeutic. It's great to find a way to something like focusing on your loved ones. Depression isn't easy, but its great you found a way to not let it get to you   Thank you!   Hi, I'm new at this subreddit. I just started cooking recently and I'm making a meal for my mom tomorrow. I was wondering if anyone could give me a easy recipe to follow! THANKS :)   My dad has a rare form of pancreatic cancer (Steve Jobs had it) since Sept 2010. My dad still worked and was able to live his life besides the one set back.  Before my dad went to the hospital, I couldn't bake and cook for my life. I relied a lot on my mothers cooking. Things went for a turn for the worst when he went to the hospital Canadian Thanksgiving weekend and has been ever since. We found out the cancer is terminal since there is no cure. The radiation is just to slow it down so its a matter of when.   Since my mom is rarely home for dinner I found a new passion for baking/cooking. It is so therapeutic for me. Now I can bake from cookies to apple cakes as well as cook chicken  fish. I don't know how I cope with everything but I'm so thankful I found baking. I love seeing the smiles of peoples faces when I give to to them. I don't eat a lot of my baked goods because I want to give it to others and make their day because I know it would make mine. I'm writing this because these past few months have been difficult and not easy with keeping up with school but if you or anyone is in a similar situtation. Finding something to distract you for a bit and make you happy even for a minute can make a difference and make things a tad bit easier! Plus Taylor Swift since her album came at a perfect time. Going in the car and blasting her music (been a fan since 06) is one of my favourite things about my day.  FYI: do have depression and last year was VERY difficult for me because I started to have suicidal thoughts. But baking/movies help me! I do have friends I don't have many but I got a good group of people.    I don't know about you, but him saying this sort of shit would make me want to dump him. I mean hey, why keep them there if they aren't going to be there for you if this happens.    It's great to have an online community where you can express how you feel    He is clearly has eyes on another girl and using ''poly'' as an excuse.    No No no, I noticed that something was off. My sister told me she was engaged and I didn't feel anything. I told my social worker and she said I should go to the doctor to talk about my feelings. Social workers cannot diagnose.    It takes time to be comfortable to open up. I'm with a social worker for a year now. It took me 8 months to finally tell her what I'm feeling which led to me being diagonsed with depresison.    Your not alone and sadly its more common than you think. I know two people that had their fathers die suddenly. It's really hard for them to cope. I may not know what its like, but I'm facing a similar situation. My father has cancer- the one Steve Jobs has. He's at the hospital and theres no cure. Find something to  help you through this difficult time- I bake, watch movies and I cook. I also like to humour people so all those help me through it. You are not alone. I'm so sorry.    I know what you are going through currently. I am going through the same thing. My sister spent her birthday at the hospital as well while my father is in the hostipal. You should treat yourself to something, maybe there is something that you want like maybe a massage or something. Keep your head up high! PM if you need to vent!   I did it, it was the right thing to do thank you   I did it, it was the right thing to do thank you   This is me and his first relationship! Me and Bob (fake name) were dating for 4 months. My father is in the hospital and my dad cancer is not treatable. He has a rare form of pancreatic cancer the one that Steve Jobs had. I went to a hospital 2 hours away from home because my dad has a good relationship with them for the past four years and they specialize in his type of cancer.  My friends have been texting more than my then boyfriend and for 3 days he did not text me. He did say if I need to talk to him, he's there but i was pissed because for 3 days I didn't get a single message from him so after thinking about it because I know it must be hard but I warned him on the first date about my dad. I know its hard, but how long does it take to send a text? 2 seconds! So I dumped him because he wasn't being there for me. I wanted closure so a few days after I texted him, he got confused on the texting part if it was after the breakup or when he was in the hospital. So I told him 3 days i was in the hospital, he just send a text how he wants to meet in person to try and work this out. I'm conflicted and I really do not need anymore stress than I do now.   ---    **tl;dr**: Should I hear my then boyfriends ''reasons''?    My dad has a rare form of pancreatic cancer for four years (since Sept 2010). Recently a tumour in the liver exploded about a month ago and that's when things got downhill. I found out yesterday the radation is to slow things down and to keep the few healthy liver cells alive. We do not know if it's going to work. He hasn't had a appiette in a week and today he had one as well as very alert. He told me that he is going to die but he wants to die with dignity. It just sucks knowing that your father won't be here. I just want the waiting game to be over.   It's not a healthy relationship if you both see eachother all the time and whenever you don't see her she guilts you by saying something stupid. You should go on the trip. You want to go, you should go.     When my dad cancer got worse I felt like my whole world turned grey. I didn't enjoy past hobbies like I used to and when my sister told me she was engaged I felt empty. Luckily I realized being open about depression helps me a lot.   	39
 I started at 20, they increased to 30 about 6 weeks ago and now I'm at 40.    I forgot to mention, yes, I am taking medication: Citalopram. I've been taking it since the end of January, my doctor just upped my dosage last week.   It seemed to be helping by the time that I left the hospital (at that point I had been on it about 5 weeks) but I've sorta crashed since then.    It won't make a difference. Whether I want it or not, she can divorce me for whatever reason (or no reason at all) in this state.   Furthermore, I no longer have any interest in being with her. She totally abandoned me while I was in the hospital and started her relationship with her boyfriend behind my back after telling me that she wanted to be separated for awhile to 'get some space' and that we could work on things between us after some time had passed. Oh, and also repeatedly saying that she had no intention or interest in seeing other people; that was definitely NOT the reason she wanted a divorce.  Honestly I was done when she told me while I was in the hospital that she 'couldn't support me'.  And while I don't think I ever would have been happy with her seeing someone else she could have at least been an adult and upfront about it but that was apparently too much to ask.  The best part was when I confronted her about it, she continued to deny she was seeing someone (and tried to convince that I was being paranoid/crazy) until I presented her with proof. And then she told me that as far as she was concerned we were separated as of the day I checked myself into the hospital so she didn't owe me anything after that point.    Yeah. Her actions since about January have been really selfish. When she declared she wanted a divorce I wanted to try counseling but she refused.   Basically she had made a decision and I was just supposed to accept it.    I don't really know what happened between me and my wife either which is the part my problem.   We had our issues, both together and separate but I'm general I thought we were pretty happy. Or at least OK. So, I was pretty blindsided by her announcement that she wanted a divorce.   There wasn't anything drastic that happened before her decision either. No big fights, no infidelity (at least on my part) and she refuses to discuss with me what made her decide.   So, yeah. I don't know. It might be easier to focus on something obvious that went wrong (or maybe not, I don't know) but I don't have that so I keep ending up at 'I'm the something wrong'  Right now my kids are about the only reason I haven't killed myself. But I have to wonder how good of a parent I am and can continue to be feeling the way I do.   I used to have good times and bad times but since about December it's been all bad. Even when I was feeling a little better after my discharge I still wasn't happy. Wouldn't they be better off without growing up with a super depressed father?  I just can't find any hope that things will improve and that sucks.    I would say you're not doing anything wrong, you just haven't found the right guy yet.   Everyone has different sex drives and preferences, these two guys sound like they just don't fit with yours and that is OK.   Dating sucks, I know.  I'm recently single in my 30s as well. I think the only thing you can do is keep meeting people and you can find someone who clicks with you both in and out of the bedroom.   Don't think there is something wrong with you and don't change. You'll be happier as yourself.    No. You should still be able to open the chest as long as it's your quest (obviously if you're tagging along you can't)  I've made 4 artifact chests and still get the chests at the end of the daily lairs.   I would suggest putting in a support ticket, you're losing out on your sigils and pages by not having access to the chests.    They should figure it out because this is an out of character response for him. According to OP anyway, her info is all we have to go on here.   And also because people need to be as self aware as possible. Figuring out why he feels the way he feels will benefit him as a person and both of them as a couple.   If he were a more jealous person then maybe I'd feel better writing it off to just that by according to her this is an odd response.   Like I said, it is reasonable for him to be upset but that's not the reaction everyone would have. It's not an automatic assumed response to the situation.  Some people would react this way all the time but the fact that she feels it's odd means it should be explored. At least in my opinion, which is all I'm giving here.    I didn't say it was unreasonable for him to get upset. I said it was a silly thing to get upset over. There is a difference. Obviously, in his mind, it is perfectly reasonable.   I also said that his feelings need to be acknowledged because, silly or not, he IS upset.   His feelings are acceptable just as OP's are. He is upset, she feels it's a silly thing to be upset over; I happen to agree on that part. BUT, that doesn't invalidate how he is feeling.   I think the important thing here is to figure out why he got upset. Because it is a silly little thing I believe there is something else going on.    You had just seen a movie with this guy in it, so of course he was on your mind when you had to come up with a name.   Is it a silly thing for your BF to get upset about? Yes!  But, I guarantee you that hearing you say that it is silly is the last thing he needs.   He is upset about it (for whatever reason) and he needs you to acknowledge that he is upset, not dismiss it.  He (or the both of you) need to figure out why he's so upset. Is he jealous of this guy for some reason? Is he feeling distant in your relationship and a little insecure?  Tell him you'll discuss things with him calmly (if he wants). Let him know that you love him and that you're happy with him (provided that you actually are, don't lie to him) and that its unlike him to act like this.   If he starts getting angry at you again, at any point, try not to get defensive; just tell him that you would like to help him figure this out but you're not going to accept anger towards yourself and end the conversation. Go to another room, give him time to cool down.   Hopefully you guys can figure this out.   Good luck.    Sorry that your boy's father is such a jerk.   The good news is you have your parents support, that's more than a lot of people get.   Focus on your pregnancy, have a happy, healthy baby. Take whatever steps you need to get his father to pay child support (he owes you that). Go back to school when you can. Your dating prospects may be a little bleak for the near future but that's ok, your son needs your focus now anyway.   You'll be ok.    You've been with him for years, you know him, he knows you, you guys are relatively happy.   Sure, he has flaws, everybody does. The good news is that you know a lot of his already. So use what you know and ask yourself some questions.   Do you want a future with him? Are his flaws something you can live with over time? The ones you think you can't live with (if any), do you have a realistic hope of him changing them?  The children thing is a non-issue I think, and here is why.  It's not your problem. You have made it clear that you don't want children.  He is aware. Don't take it on yourself to decide not to be with him because of this. Let him be an adult and decide for himself.   If you decide you want a future with him, let him know. 'Hey, BF, I love you and I think we are good together. I want a future for us and I think these things need to change for us to be happy long term (insert appropriate action items). Do you feel the same? Are there things that you feel should change to ensure our happiness?'  Go from there. If he doesn't want a future or the things he wants to change are unacceptable (ie having children) then you both should move on.   It's ok to be unsure in a relationship, it doesn't mean you're destined to fail. The one sure way to fail is to not communicate. Talk things out with him, either on your own or with a therapist. Just don't jump to conclusions and assume anything.   You've been with him for a long time but you can't read his mind, nor can he read yours. Remember that.    First, spending time alone together outside of the house is a great idea. Call it date night or whatever you want but you need to do it. You and your husband need to be able to stay connected as a couple, not just get stuck into your roles as parents. If you guys feel silly calling it 'dating' because you're 'too old' then don't call it that. Call it 'quality time' or 'adult night' or 'We still love our daughter but need time to build our relationship or we're going to end up disconnected and hate each when she goes to college'  As for finding a babysitter you have a few options. There's a few websites out there that offer services either directly or through referral to get a babysitter. Sittercity.com is one I have used. They do background checks on all the babysitters/nannies on their site so you don't have to and you can conduct your own interview process before having a trial run. Also, I would suggest having a trial run, invite the sitter over to spend time with your daughter while you or your husband (or both) are around so you can see their interaction and decide if you're comfortable with that person. Maybe an afternoon where they can do homework together and then an activity or something.   Another option is to get to know the parents of your daughter's friends. Have play dates and work your way up to having overnights with one or two friends. I'm sure you can find some parents willing to trade off sleepovers so each of you can have a date night (or whatever you end up calling it).   Tell your husband that you feel stuck in a rut and something needs to change. You guys need alone time to renew your relationship. It may sound all stupid and new-agey but it is important.    This is a tricky subject because, of course he gets to have a private life and you don't have the right to dictate who he sees and doesn't see.   On the other hand, as you stated, this part of his life is spilling over and affecting your relationship and that's a problem.   If this was an ex that he had split with and remained friends or become friends with after it would be an easy answer: you back off.  But that's not what has happened here. They had a nasty breakup and she doesn't respect the relationship he has now (or you, as his gf). Add on the fact that his leftover issues from that relationship were causing problems before she even resurfaced.   I agree that he should cut contact with her. Don't answer any calls or texts, block her on every option available (email, Facebook, etc). But you should also find out why he wants to talk to her in the first place. What need or fantasy is being met by having her constantly around and trying to get back together?  If he really had gotten closure when they met up I feel like he wouldn't still need anything from her.    Correct. The unlock cost is one time. After it is unlocked you can find it in the Queues menu and run it as many times as you like.   	15
 Yes because only MEN know math.    Pete Wentz?    fuck you mean "younger"    what a small world... that's my picture...    Mamrie Hart !!!    it was actually my information she was giving out... this is so good to hear. oh my god. (at least I think, a while back I got into an argument on tumblr with a SJW and they started giving out my info and it lead to a whole thing, police and everything)   Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard surfbort, surfbort   She's also just made a movie, which came out yesterday called Camp Takota :)      All hail the glow cloud   Self respect isnt about rather or not you show your breasts, its about being comfortable with your choices. If you want to pose topless, thats okay. If you dont, thats okay too. Whats not okay is saying youre better than someone else because you choose one way and they chose another. Telling women that they should be ashamed for choosing something that doesnt hurt them or others (and by hurt them, I mean like choosing to do drugs or something like that), you are contributing to the patriarchy and oppression   "To be fair, I think canned tuna is unsafe for cats unless you wash it thoroughly." - Chreiya   Such bullshit OP go fuck yourself   [F]emale   As a gay woman, I feel your pain   TIL "rigged" means voted according to the rules.    Lil Bub !    If I only I didn't have so much shit to wrap :(       I love the way your eyes pop out! Beautiful :)   Who the fuck upvotes this garbage?   It's been a year and I still don't get this meme   It's a fucking baby what did you expect.    I can so see this becoming a children's book.   	24
 I don't know why but when I saw this happen I distinctly remember not caring either way. I think I am now apathetic to people's transport woes.   But now I've had a chance to think about it, I suppose I think they're stupid trying to take on a bus - I mean what if the driver doesn't see them? Why is their time frame more important than people on the bus?   On the other hand, why are bus drivers assholes sometimes and why do they go out of their way not to pick up passengers? Why are buses so damn unreliable and instead of just working to a schedule, why do 3 buses come at once? Why is it when I submitted complaint forms about the buses all coming at once they tell me that it's because of traffic, but how could they all arrive at once in traffic? Wouldn't they have to have still left the same time to be at the same point in the traffic to arrive at the exact same time?   I don't even know where to direct my frustration anymore, I'm so frustrated with the whole bus system and all the passengers have gone crazy including me!!!    I thought this was from /r/gaming because it was too perfect!   I'm glad to hear you had a good time! :)   I'm not too sure about weekdays as I don't often go out mid-week. I suppose if we were going out we'd go somewhere that was convenient (for a few after-work drinks), has food, or somewhere that was scenic/special (for a special occasion).   For you I'd check out the scenic/special stuff. If it's nice weather try out Opera Bar. Palmer   Co is busy most days it's open, so you could definitely try that out - it's down a little alley in a basement near the Establishment Hotel so you'll need to search it out. There is also [Tank Stream Bar](http://merivale.com.au/tankstreambar) nearby that which has a small bar feel in a back alley, which I like. Tank Stream Bar is probably nothing too special but I like it.   There is another place which is pretty popular for food (southern American feel) but damn it's hard to find unless you have a guide taking you there. It sits on the top of an office building, so when you enter it's like you're going into some offices. It's called [The Rook](http://therook.com.au/).  The bankers I have worked with are often pretty good drinkers, so anywhere around Martin Place. We sometimes go to [Eden Bar](http://edenbarandrestaurant.com.au/) but I imagine that'll get empty pretty quickly as people wind up their after works drinks.  Also Newtown will have some students there mid-week because they don't have to wake up in the morning ;) So check out some of the places I've mentioned there.  I have to head out now but I'll have a think about some more locations.  For the football if you're going to the game then the only places where those fans will be is near Parramatta. There are a few food places in Church Street in Parramatta (depending on which team you're going for), but to be honest I never go out there so I may not be the best person to ask. I also think you'll find most football fans will head home straight after the game, and only a small handful will stay out.    I am the same... I think it's good to have a diverse set of skills. My hope is that it means you can adapt quicker to changes in your industry and you get to be continually learning and improving. My problem early on was getting a job in some of the roles which needed dedicated experience in one thing. But I've personally found more job satisfaction in learning new and different things all the time, and if anything I am more in demand now than I would have been otherwise, due to my wide range of experience.  Good luck with your decision! Go with your gut. I've found mine to be leading me in the right direction most of the time. :)   I actually asked for a pay increase in the interview once before I'd even gotten the job. I'm not sure if I'd ever do it again but sometimes I wonder if it helped being confident enough to ask.  I said "I wanted to ask if you have room to move on the salary?"   I got the job and a higher salary. It helps that it actually was very low... but it was risky! I didn't have another option if I didn't get that job... but I had a pretty good vibe from the interviewer.    I've noticed some companies I've applied for can have a lot of job openings. It makes me wonder if there is a high turnover or if they are rapidly expanding for a particular piece of work.   The former bothers me because it might not be a good place to work if turnover is high.   The latter concerns me but only if they are hiring for a short term role and the position is a permanent full time role... because I'll wonder if they can keep me on once the project finishes. It's not a deal breaker as I might be OK with another job after the project is over but I'd prefer to go in with eyes open than not to know. Also if a new project has just started and they're rushing to hire and/or trouble getting enough qualified staff, that tells me I might be in for some long hours. Again I might be OK with that, but I have never met an interviewer who has been up front about working until 11pm every night and on weekends, so I try to suss it out. Better to go in with eyes open!  Also I find questions about how I'd fit into the organization useful. It gets them to visualize me there for starters. Second it gives me an idea of the career development opportunities and advancement options.  I also try to get them to describe their culture. This tells me about the type of people who work there. And who my colleagues are is one of the most important factors as to whether I will enjoy my job.    Just to clarify I'm not saying it's not possible to get opportunities and build skills in stable jobs... it was that way with mine though. It was difficult to be "given a chance" as the culture was a very risk averse old school government culture. I went as far as I could through sheer determination and then realized I'd reached their limit of what they could offer me for my career development.    Not sure if this will make you feel better but I left a very stable reasonably well paid job for something less stable. I did it to get more opportunities and experience. I don't regret it at all. Having the ability and the skills has provided me with more "stability" by being in demand by the market than any "safe" job would have.   I have friends that are in those safe jobs with few options to move to another company as their skills and experiences are fewer than peers who took the chance and built their skills faster. For me it meant working harder but I think in the long run it has paid off.   This is pretty accurate.  There is more variation in Sydney than in say for example Cairns where they just have wet and dry. I prefer it though because in Sydney in summer when you get a really hot day usually it's rare to have a lot in a row. They will often be followed by thunderstorms or sometimes continue but rarely for more than say 5 days.  The other thing is that in Sydney 'rainy' is affected heavily by the ENSO cycle. So if it's an El Nino then little rain and of there's a La Nina then lots of rain. When it's not clearly one of either... you can get anything.    The basics of how their own body works. I know lots of people know this but lots don't.   A basic understanding of the immune system. For example knowing how antibiotics and vaccines work.   Also, knowing about personal hygiene and how simple hand washing, not spitting, etc. can prevent the spread of diseases and germs.  Edit: elaborated.   Oh wow. I was told if they sting you around the neck it's possible to suffocate... is that true? Lucky you made it!   I drive past [King's Costumes](http://www.kingscostumes.com.au/) sometimes - looks alright.   Ferry to Manly   walk around the beach there. There is a [market there on the weekend](http://www.manlymarketplace.com.au/).  If it's raining, the [Powerhouse museum](http://maas.museum/powerhouse-museum/). It's being relocated at some point out of the city so see it while you can.  Also some others have mentioned the art galleries if it's raining, but I also like the [Australian Museum](http://australianmuseum.net.au/).  If you want to see Australian animals and don't want to leave the city try [Wildlife Sydney](http://www.wildlifesydney.com.au/) next to the [Sydney Aquarium](http://www.sydneyaquarium.com.au/) in Darling Harbour.    Rhodes Phoenix gets packed. Make sure you get there by 11am otherwise there is usually quite a long wait :(   Aw yeah, I'd be flattered if someone thought I was their best friend!   I think she'd just appreciate the effort. :) I'm not much of a cook either but my mum likes it anyway... at least she says she does.    What about organizing something at your house with your family? Everyone make a special dish and bring it along. Dress up in some nice clothes, and get her to as well so she feels special and treat her to a massage or hairdo while you set it all up with a pretty table cloth and a bunch of flowers on the table. Be sure to make some nice desserts.    Sorry to hear about your cat :( My cat died years ago but I still miss her sooo much. There will never be another cat like her, but I am glad I got to have her in my life.    Didnt she swim away from the nearest land mass? The pic shows it. Maybe the currents carried her... Some of the currents out there are really strong. Either way I think she was incredibly lucky.   If you are going to take a pomeranian on a boat, you can get it a life jacket to counter the weight of the hair! It probably saved the life of [this fuzzball](http://www.globalanimal.org/2012/06/08/dog-overboard-canine-safety-on-boats/)   I would say this is part of the reason why maths is hard but not the full answer.  It's true, I wasn't that interested in maths in high school or uni because it wasn't applied. For the most part it was pretty dry. I only really liked Matrix Applications because I already understood why it was useful for me, but other subjects like Differential Calculus I had a really hard time relating to. It wasn't until I was trying to solve a few different problems a few years later that I gained an interest.   One reason I say that I don't think lack of an interesting problem is the whole answer, is that I think the foundations are important (like someone said in another post). For example, I was trying to figure out how far galaxies are from the Earth. This is a terribly complex problem because things in space move around, and if you also imagine the things we are seeing are light years away, they are also an image from the past. Anyway it involves some complex mathematics and physics, which was quite interesting. However it was still hard for me because I don't have a physics background to understand some of the concepts that the math for this problem was built on, and so the learning curve was huge for me.  I also think there is a level of patience required. If you don't get past that initial learning curve (which may be unpleasant), then you never get to feel the sense of achievement having conquered it, and the next time you face a difficult problem, you might not be so keen to persevere, and especially if this has happened a few times, you probably have lost confidence in your ability to do it. Hence the 'hard' comes from lack of motivation... the task is more arduous now that you don't want to do it.   My celebrant would non-legally marry you. She told me it just wouldn't be "official" without the paperwork - so the date would be different - no big deal really. You can have the ceremony but the paperwork would come later. It shouldn't be a problem. Try talking to a celebrant about it. They should know.    I like the Royal Botanical Gardens [eg1](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0013/102316/Image-2-EL-600.jpg), [eg2](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0010/102304/Photo-Gallery-4-RG-600.jpg), [eg3](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0007/112768/Herb_Gdn_Pavilion_05.jpg), [eg4](https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/image/0019/112771/Herb_Gdn_Pavilion_21.jpg), tho there are permits specifically for weddings and professional photography. If you don't have a permit you may get kicked out.   If you look at the wedding pack guides on this page you will see the pricing down on about the 3rd page. https://www.rbgsyd.nsw.gov.au/welcome/royal_botanic_garden/venues_and_weddings/weddings/Wedding_Ceremony_and_Photography_Locations  For under 10 people you can book a lawn for $275 on weekdays and $330 on weekends (before June 2014, so prices have probably changed - but will be around that price).   You also need to apply to take photographs in the QVB. You need to make a donation. I can't remember the fee exactly. I don't think it was much - maybe $50 or something like that. Anyway you can apply [here](https://www.qvb.com.au/about-qvb/wedding-photography) and there is a number on that page too you can call to discuss with them.   Another place which is nice is the [Chinese Gardens](http://www.easyweddings.com.au/locations/chinese-garden-of-friendship/) in Darling Harbour, but there is a lot of construction happening over that way at the moment :(  You could also do a wedding over near Manly way (north side of the harbour). There are council fees for beach weddings. There's a list of places [here](http://www.manly.nsw.gov.au/community-services/weddings/) and the fees are listed at the bottom of the page.    Celebrants aren't too hard to find if you're not picky. Easiest way to meet some is to go to a [Wedding Expo](http://www.easyweddings.com.au/expos/#/new-south-wales), but if you don't have time to do that you can just search online or try going through the ones on [EasyWeddings](http://www.easyweddings.com.au/MarriageCelebrant/Sydney/) or on the [Marriage Celebrants of Australia Website](http://www.marriagecelebrants.org.au/).   Photographers vary in price and quality. Be careful of their offerings - there are a lot of dodgy photographers out there. We used [Xtraordinary](http://www.xtraordinarysydney.com.au/) and they were great - honest and up-front with their pricing - no dodgy stuff. Not top of the line artsy style photos but good wedding photos that I love and will be able to keep forever.   We got married in 2013 and our celebrant cost $598.   This is either some weird kind of problem solving, or he has a strange fetish.    The price guide was $1m. The RP data report valued the house at mid $900s.  I should really expect this by now, but sometimes we look at similar houses in the same suburb or street even and the price guide is actually quite close (within 10%), but this time we just got outbid.   That sounds great! Maybe you could PM me some contact info - I would love to see how much it's valued at. We have some interesting things in there! I never get to show them to anyone because I don't think many people are that interested, so it would be fun to show someone else. :)   I am kind of interested in finding coins in the 'Southern Sky' series at the moment - they're colourful domed coins. I think the only coin available through the RA Mint now is the 2014 Orion coin, but there were two previous coins I would love to get my hands on - one is Pavo (2013) which I have found for $200 and the other one is the Southern Cross. Got any ideas where I could source it for a decent price? I've seen it online for $800, but I question whether I am that avid a collector... :/    Oh! I'm going to check that out! Thanks!   Ohhh, I have a big coin collection, but I don't know if it's worth that much. What coins do you think are worth collecting? I know a lot of them are produced in 10,000 batches, but you can get some gold ones that are only 1,500 batch size. Do they increase in value more? Are there are lot of people who collect and trade coins? I only really collect them, I don't trade them. I just like looking at them. My parents started the collection so we have a lot of old pre-decimal coins, and I think we even have some paper value documents - though I only heard about those from my mum the other day and have yet to check them out.    Sure! That's a great idea! I would call my frog "coffee" and confuse everyone by explaining how I found coffee in the creek.   Cups are very versatile vessels though! You can use them for all sorts of things... storing your spare water, as a coin holder, for collecting hail in a hailstorm, in case of motion sickness, for holding a candle, for protecting your hands from sparklers, to listen to conversations on the other side of walls, for keeping spare cup sized cupcakes, for entertaining children by using it as a nose, etc. etc.    They own their debt.    Yeah! He was honest!    Yeah this real estate agent saved me some money. The property has been taken down now and the auction cancelled. So I'm actually pretty thankful. He could have led me on to hedge his bets and I would have wasted my time and money getting it checked out only to find out very soon after that I never had a chance.  The people I really dislike are auctioneers. I saw one son trying to buy a place for his mum in Annandale and he'd hit his limit and she was trying to convince him to keep going. He said he couldn't to his mum several times, but the auctioneer wouldn't leave him   his mum alone, trying to convince them to up their bid. The auctioneer was saying things like "You'll have to face your mum later!" and trying to convince the mum to convince her son, saying it's a "once in a lifetime opportunity" etc. etc.  The poor guy had to yell out "No mum! I don't have that much money!" in front of a huge audience of about 100 people. It was a small townhouse/unit that went for over $1.2m.   I know it's their job and all but their tactics suck.   In the inner city, we have generally found it to be between 30% over the price guide. I'm talking about a year ago when $1m houses were going for $1.3m - a bit more than $50-100K, we were budgeting for at least $200K over the price guide.  However, in the Sydney suburbs it can vary greatly. Sometimes they go for right near the price guide, so it's a bit hit and miss, and depends on who is interested. I've found them generally go for 0-20% over the price guide.    There are some agents who arrange the building   pest inspection and you only pay the $40 or whatever it was if you end up being a registered bidder at the auction. I like that approach, though it is subject to abuse.   You know how some shirts have that handkerchief pocket at the front? Well if you get a little plastic cup then you can put it in your pocket and carry it around wherever you go! It's the best invention ever, amiright? :D   How about this one which has "Australian Citizenship" written on it http://www.perthmint.com.au/catalogue/2014-australian-citizenship-1-dollar-coin-in-card.aspx It's more affordable too :)   Actually one birthday I did something like this for my husband. I bought a range of between 12 and 24 craft beers (can't remember the exact number) from NSW. Maybe OP could do a selection of one or two from each state?    XXXX isn't that bad! It may not be a 1664 but it's on tap and it goes down nicely in the hot rainy weather.    Haha I love this. I am right there... almost at "reject your belief in property as a concept".   We were looking to bid on a property at auction this coming weekend - not that close to the CBD but that's what we can afford. The price guide was within our budget. So I rang the agent. Apparently someone has put in a pre-auction offer for $200,000 more than the guide, when the price guide was already 10% higher than similar properties in the area sold this month. A very similar property **just sold** for below the guided price.  He told me not to waste my money on the pest inspection unless I could put in a bid higher than that. At least I didn't waste my money, but dammit! It's soul crushing.   There are a list of fees for NSW Ambulances [here](http://www.ambulance.nsw.gov.au/Accounts--Fees/Frequently-Asked-Questions.html).

I don't know but while I was looking it up I learnt that otters can hold their breath for 8 minutes and hippos can't actually swim or float due to their density.   A cup!  I know this question wasn't for me but I had to. Sorry. I'll go back to sleep now.    Haha.   I was working on a big data project... or trying... and I was generating a base file that was 3GB and it took 12 hours from home to upload. If I went to the office it took 20 mins. Downloading it on the other end in SF took 8 minutes. I had to generate this file and upload it a couple of times during development. I feel like I am living in Internet poverty having had to drive to the office in the early hours of the morning to upload a file.    Yeah that makes sense. Plus parkland to make it a nice place to live. I don't think Green Square has much parkland at all.   Leichhardt used to be renowned for their slow development approvals. Then the NSW government stepped in and took approval rights away from them and [approved this]( http://m.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/inner-west/controversial-leichhardt-development-given-green-light-despite-community-outcry/story-fngr8h4f-1226847080770).   I agree with keeping some heritage buildings though. Would you really want to just rip it all up? There are cases when they've done this in the UK and it has culturally ruined areas that were vibrant and turned them into places where people don't want to live.    Flatulence is pretty important! If you couldn't let it out you'd get an almighty belly ache, and could possibly explode! (I don't really know this but it sounds plausible right? )   Well they redevelop what they can. What about the old children's hospital in Camperdown where [Trio](http://www.triosydney.com.au/trio/default.asp?cID=2) is and the current developments at [Harold Park]( http://haroldparkbymirvac.com/)? Sydney Uni did a big [student accommodation development]( http://www.sydneyuv.com.au/) near Newtown about 10 years ago too. And around a lot of the inner west there have been factories redeveloped into units, tho not high rises. [Central Park]( http://www.centralparksydney.com/) across from UTS is a new one too and I think there are still buildings going up. I don't know if you remember but Broadway used to be mostly squatters living in falling down terrace shops and that's all been redone to high rises - don't know the building names. I know it's not really inner west but Pyrmont has the highest density population in Sydney.  I don't think the city areas aren't taking whatever they can hold. The one place I do think is taking more than its fair share of high rise buildings is probably Mascot and Green Square. I mean... have you seen it lately? It's jam packed with residential high rises now. If you went there ten years ago and back now you wouldn't recognize it.   The fried tofu there is really yummy, and I'm not even a vegetarian and would never think of tofu as something yummy.   I like this place too. Yum :)   Thanks! I didn't know about the phasing out and eligibility.    That makes sense. I have found public hospitals to be quite good also, so not bagging them at all.   My experience was slightly different because my scans were considered to be 'probably' not urgent, so I rolled the dice. I had short term vision loss, so I was told I should get an MRI of my brain. I had a choice to go private and have the appointment in approx. 3 weeks or go to the public system and have the appointment in approx. 2 months. The doctor said it's unlikely it's serious, but we needed to do the scan in case it was a tumour, so I decided to wait. Total cost for me was $0 too. Turned out pretty good - and my brain is fine (for now!). Had it been some kind of brain tumour though, I may have regretted my decision.   I was also told by the GP who referred me to the Neurologist, that the medicare cover for the brain MRI would have been lower from the GP compared to if the neurologist referred me, even after paying the neurologist appointment fee.   [Reading this](http://www.nps.org.au/medical-tests/medical-imaging/for-individuals/types-of-imaging/mri-magnetic-resonance-imaging/for-individuals/costs-and-reimbursements) - it sounds like if I went to the private hospital I would have had to pay the full amount myself. And there is some other option I didn't know about - going to a public hospital as a private patient - which I've never done.    Ah I checked and you're right. It doesn't cover all specialists. I was thinking of the time I went to the podiatrist, and some of it was paid for with my extras cover.   I remember that I later went to the foot surgeon though, and had to fork out the whole $180 with no rebate.   I'll fix it! Thanks.   My personal experience is that this has been the case when going to specialists under my health insurer.   Edit: Yep, made a mistake. Fixed in original post.   Ah I didn't know that! I should get my dental work done then!   Good luck! Don't worry - tech interviews suck for everyone!   I love doing this. I don't mind a pre-packed box of roast beef and potatoes for $4 or whatever it is!   Aw thanks! :) So much reddit love.   Apparently some of the City Supermarket stores have Canadian   American sweets - [this review](http://www.yelp.com.au/biz/city-supermarket-sydney?hrid=1jHrKkjPztckhlR5rTzFrg) mentions Canada Dry.   You can also get it online from USAFoods (in Melbourne).    There's a few aspects to this. But let me break it down into a few parts. I'll talk about hospital cover first.   **Tax - Medicare Levy Surcharge** (relates to hospital cover)  If you earn over a certain income ($88K in FY2013-2014) and you don't have private health insurance (hospital cover), you need to pay the Medicare Levy Surcharge - this can be between 1-1.5% of your income. For me this would actually work out to be more than paying for private health insurance (hospital cover only). See the [ATO Website](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Medicare-levy/Medicare-levy-surcharge/). Or see [this](http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/mls.htm) - also a good page on the medicare levy.   **Lifetime Health Cover Loading** (relates to hospital cover)  If you don't get private health insurance before you turn 30, and you want to get it at a later stage, then you'll pay a surcharge for your insurance (it starts at 2% and is added to each year you don't get it). This can be up to 70% more than what other people pay depending on how long you leave it for. There's some good information [here](http://www.privatehealth.gov.au/healthinsurance/incentivessurcharges/lifetimehealthcover.htm) about it.    **Value** (in regards to hospital cover)  In terms of hospital cover, what's included depends on the insurer - you should look at each of the offerings. They each offer different brackets - you can get basic, medium, pregnancy, etc. cover depending on the insurance company.  The main benefit is the reduced waiting periods and some of the extra benefits that you can get while being in hospital such as a private room and being able to choose your own doctor.  If I had a baby for example, I might want a private room (in public hospitals they usually put you in a room with other women   their babies who've just given birth - my sister was in a room with 4 women and it was noisy so hard to sleep). I'm a light sleeper so this would be important to me. I might also want a particular doctor to be present during the birth. In public hospitals they often make heavy use of midwives. That is okay for a non complicated birth but if you run into trouble, you might want your own gynecologist there who has been treating you for the duration of your pregnancy.   Generally I treat hospital insurance as useful for a "just in case" scenario. For example let's say you injure your knee, and you need a replacement knee. In a public hospital you might have to serve a waiting period and you may not get a choice of which doctor performs the surgery. Another example is if you accidentally got pregnant. There is a waiting period for pregnancies meaning that you can't take out private health insurance *after* you get pregnant - well I mean you can, but you have to serve a waiting period until you can claim on it. It's like having a car crash and trying to get insurance after the car crash to cover it - generally not possible. So if you don't have it prior you would probably have to go through the public hospital system.   **Extras**  Edit: I made some mistakes here. I've corrected it. Sorry for the confusion!  ~~Extras cover includes things like regular visits to specialists. The operation the specialist performs might be covered under private *hospital* health insurance but generally I've found visits to the specialist are not unless you have extras cover - and then there is a gap. So if you pay $100 for a service, maybe $60 is paid to you from the private health insurer, so you have to foot the remaining $40 yourself.~~  Extras cover includes things like regular visits to the dentist, optometrist, physio, chiro, etc. One example of something you might use in your 25-30 year range might be [wisdom teeth removal](http://www.phio.org.au/facts-and-advice/dental-and-oral-surgery.aspx). I had mine removed in the chair so I just paid at the counter and got a percentage of that back from my health insurer using my extras cover. There are limits as to what you can claim, so for example on a service that is $100 you would maybe get $60 back from your extras cover, and then pay the $40 yourself. This is the 'gap' payment. You can often do this up to another limit, say $500 in a single year for dental. However if you get your wisdom teeth removed under a general anaesthetic then you may be covered under your private hospital cover (e.g. see under 'Major Dental' on the [nib page](http://www.nib.com.au/health-insurance/compare-hospital)).   If you are likely to use physiotherapists, remedial massage, general dental, optical etc. then it might be worth it for you. You have to do the sums for your situation.   However I had extras cover for quite a few years and I didn't find extras cover to be worth it. It has ended up costing me more for the premium than what I claim on it. There is a gap with most ~~specialists~~ covered services - so I'd rather just pay the full cost myself. Maybe later in life when I need to go to ~~specialists~~ these service providers more I will get it again, but right now I don't benefit from it.   Another example why I think it's not worth it right now is I recently got some dental work done. A small percentage of the cost of fillings was covered. But I had to get in-lays which are similar to crowns. They are very expensive. In some way they are cosmetic but my filling was falling out due to the lack of original tooth structure so it was the best option for me. This was not covered by my extras cover from my health insurer and I paid thousands of dollars for it out of my own pocket. This is really what convinced me that extras cover wasn't worth it.   **Medical Expenses Tax Rebates**  This is not an reason for/against private health insurance. Just a tax-time tip if you have a few large health bills.  If you do end up spending a significant amount on medical expenses then you might be able to claim tax offsets - i.e. pay less tax (provided you keep the receipts).  See [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Income-and-deductions/Offsets-you-can-claim/Medical-expenses/). If you earn under $88K then you can claim 20% of expenses where they are over $2,162. If you earn over $88K then you can claim 10% of expenses where they are over $5,100.  The types of medical expenses covered are listed out [here](https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Tax-Return/2013/Supplementary-tax-return/Tax-offset-questions-T4-T11/T6---Total-net-medical-expenses/).   Medical expenses include payments:   * to dentists, orthodontists or registered dental mechanics  * to opticians or optometrists, including for the cost of prescription spectacles or contact lenses  * to a carer who looks after a person who is blind or permanently confined to a bed or wheelchair  * for therapeutic treatment under the direction of a doctor  * for medical aids prescribed by a doctor  * for artificial limbs or eyes and hearing aids  * for maintaining a properly trained dog for guiding or assisting people with a disability (but not for social therapy)  * for laser eye surgery, and  * for treatment under an in-vitro fertilisation program.  *See comments below - this is being phased out.*    Edit: I also know it is possible to get a Chronic Disease Management Plan if you are seriously unwell, and there are also Mental Health Care plans for psychiatric care. This enables related services to be covered (to a limit) under medicare.    No probs! I hope you have a great time here. :)   I've heard this same thing too. To me they smell like talcum powder.    I know people that do this and aren't even a little embarassed about it. Like when people bring their babies into the office and the girl I'm talking about runs over and wants to sniff it.   She says the baby smell makes you feel happy. I held the baby, the smell does nothing for me. Maybe I don't have the baby smell receptors.    Who the hell tricks someone into having kids?!?!?! Do they even care about their partner and what their life goals are? Clearly if the husband wanted kids, then a conversation would have happened and an agreement occurred, but if she had to go about it this way then it sounds like he didn't want them at all. :/   I love blue heelers :) She's a lucky dog to have a caring owner like you.   I used to practice my conversational (small talk) skills with taxi drivers. I only live a short distance from my work so I'd try to work out what would be most likely to make them happy by the end of the trip. Taxi driving can be such a lonely job.   For different people different topics worked. I usually tried to talk to them about what they do outside of taxi driving. Asking lots of questions, and asking how they got into it. etc. I couldn't relate well with everyone but it was great practice at small talk.   I got to a point where I've gotten free taxi rides (they just chose not to charge me even after I insisted paying!) and a couple of times when I got out of the cab they thanked me for talking.   At first I wasn't good at it but I got better over time. You can do this with anyone you talk to each day. Think of people who wouldn't mind having a conversation. Even newsagents don't mind if it's not a busy time of day. It's easy with taxis because they are trapped in the car with me ... muahahaha.  :)   As for being a good friend, well a friendship is a mutually beneficial thing. You give a little, they give a little and it's a mutual care for each other that makes it work. It doesn't always have to be balanced, but the knowledge that it's not a one sided affair matters. And being able to make time for them is important too. There's no point in having 100 friends who you can see each of one week in the year (which is the way it is when you are working). Having a couple of friends who you can invest time into being around and caring about is more fulfilling. You need to remember things about them that matter to them. For example, remember their birthday if that's important to them, or remember they told you about a vacation they were taking. You can ask about it, and be interested in their answer. An open and caring ear is often more valuable to people than many people realise.   Good on you for taking the time to improve yourself! There are so many things outside of work/study that can make your life better, and it's great that you have been able to spend the time working on it.   I also need to learn to cook more food. I'm renovating the kitchen at the moment so when I get a new stove (my current stove is really crap - from the 60's), I am going to get a pressure cooker and try to prepare a few meals in advance so I'm not cooking every night like I am now.    Thanks. I really appreciate the encouragement. It means a lot to me. It was a huge decision to take the time off - one I wasn't sure about at first - but now nearing the end, I don't regret it one iota. :)    Thanks. I really appreciate your comment. It took me a while to give myself permission to take leave. At first I felt so guilty about taking unpaid leave, but I knew I needed the break. Quite a lot of people were supportive but a few others were quite critical of my decision.    I think it's all too easy to focus a lot on getting good results from our activities at work, but a lot of the personal improvements in our skills and in our own lives come from investments into other activities outside of work. If your work takes over that other part of your life then it's only fair the other part of your life should get to take over for a while too. :)   I use it only as an online resume really.    Sure, send it through.    I never understood bagels until I recently had some really nice ones over in the states. They are so dense and much more moist than bread rolls. I have a craving for them now thinking about it.  If you're not interested in going and buying them I was reading about how to make them yourself. It is apparently not that difficult... if you like cooking and have the time and patience that is. I would probably try to buy them first too. :)    Well it was rude - the cousin probably should have written "of course you don't have to give a gift, and none is expected, but if you do want to there is a list available... blah". They clearly have a lack of manners, and at 16 they are probably still learning what is socially acceptable. But you're right, the response was a bit of an over the top reaction as well.  That said, I understand the response in a way because I know how often it can be hard as an outsider where you are able to have very little influence on the person compared to their immediate relatives who provide them with all the wrong role models and allow or even encourage bad habits and choices. You can grow frustrated with them and maybe even reduce your emotional investment. It would be frustrating if you'd tried to help and provide non-financial assistance and that fell on deaf ears and led to the situation, but now since they are pregnant at 16 they suddenly want your help (via your wallet).      I've heard colleagues at work say similar things - "Having a daughter/son changed my priorities in life". Basically they're telling me they don't give as much of a crap about work anymore because there's more important things (i.e. their child) in their life now. I mean that's great, and I agree that you should care about your kid, but like do you really want to be telling everyone at work that now work doesn't matter to you as much? To me it is still a pretty big part of my life, seeing as I work a minimum of 40 hours a week. So I feel almost like that statement is unintentionally diminishing my values.    I am actually doing exactly that right now.   The first 2 weeks I spent recovering from the stress of my job   four major life events. At my job I was working in a high-stress role and the hours were generally 7 days a week, 12-18 hour days for about 4 months. So I was constantly stressed. Four people close to me in life passed away within the space of a couple of months. I got high blood pressure and I also ended up very very sick with a high fever for about 5 days. But... after two weeks into my leave my blood pressure dropped to high but within normal blood pressure range (still too high for my age though).  The next 6 weeks I spent travelling with my husband. It had always been my dream to go snowboarding in Canada - for about 16 years. One of the people who passed away was a close friend of mine at work - he was very young and healthy - so it was very unexpected. I decided I needed to do the things I had always wanted to do, and refused to put it off anymore. So we did it. It's something my husband wanted to do too so that was perfect. After I got back my blood pressure was within normal range (and healthy again yay!).  I've been back 2 months, and I have spent a lot of that time planning out the next steps. When I was working the long hours I never had a moment to myself to really think about what I wanted and to plan it out, I was just in survival mode only. I put everything else but work on hold, which meant everything else suffered. So now having spent some time processing everything, I have a plan. It took a lot of self reflection and investigation into opportunities but I have finally arrived. Before I was taking one day at a time and was following whatever path I was on, rather than deciding my own goals. Now I have a few goals in mind that I want to achieve. Some of those include technical certifications, looking at other job opportunities, buying a house, possibly considering moving overseas to work if the house thing falls through, prioritising my relationship and my health, learning about different investment options, deciding on our future. A lot of those I have started, but this is just the beggining, and it's something I plan to continue doing when I return to work.  I have one more month before going back to work. It's been an expensive exercise in taking the leave and travelling, but to me it has definitely been worthwhile and I consider it a personal investment. Now that I have goals I can take actions to help achieve them. I'm not too fussed if things don't turn out as planned, but without goals I feel as though it is too easy to stagnate and not improve your situation.     I have had problems with my nerves before presentations. I just build up a crazy amount of nervous energy. The same thing used to happen to me right before interviews for jobs I cared a lot about.  So things have improved drastically over the years.  A few years ago I used to get so nervous I would physically shake. So it took me a while but I worked out something to help me overcome it. One day before an interview I was so nervous that I felt like I needed to run, so I did about 5-10 minutes of intervals (sprinting). I know it's a bit unconventional but it worked for me. I think nerves are an outward expression of a fight or flight response, so if you can exert some of the nervous energy out of your body, then it could help. I felt like sprinting increased my heart rate, so then my heart could calm down and it had flow on effects over my body and mind. When I went to the interview, I didn't shake and I could control my body which made me feel more confident. I haven't heard of anyone else doing this but for me it works absolutely brilliantly.   When doing presentations these days I only get nervous if I have to stand up at a podium. I'm fine sitting down and presenting to a boardroom, but standing at a podium sets me off. I think it's because if I'm sitting then I see people as my peers, but if I'm standing at a podium it's like I'm trying to be better than people and I'm really not comfortable with that. I find in this situation the best thing I can do is spend a lot of time preparing, and not the night before, in advance. If I can go to the venue before hand and stand up the front this helps too - because then it's not such a huge shock to my system when I am first stand up there. Recording and playing back my voice can help sometimes, but actually sometimes it just puts me off. If I can present my presentation there then that's even better - I've got less new things to focus on. So basically I try to eliminate as many new variables as possible so it's not as big a surprise to my senses.   I also don't use slides with a lot of words. I use enough words to jog my memory but I try to present in a conversational tone. I try to talk to people as if they are my equals, even when I'm talking to students. I gave a lecture at university recently and the only difference between me and the students is different experiences, so if I think about them as my peers I find it a lot easier.  I hope that helps. I know people deal with things differently but the biggest change for me was the sprinting. If you can find some way to rid yourself of some of your nervous energy I think it helps.   For me the key has been to to actively forgive myself.   For me I find it useful to talk to myself in my head as if I'm talking to a stranger.   For example, let's say I had an awkward conversation today and I didn't respond to the other person properly and I got a weird look and also stunted the conversation. I might go home and think about how stupid I am not to be able to converse properly and make a fool out of myself.   Then I say as if talking to myself "Ok yeah that wasn't the best response. But it's okay. In the grand scheme of their day it is probably really minor and they probably aren't even thinking about it anymore. I forgive you (talking to yourself) for making that mistake. It's okay, you're human and everyone has silly moments."  Even just saying to yourself "I forgive you" encompasses a lot. It's first about acknowledging the error, but accepting that it's happened and can't be undone. And second it's about absolving you of the guilt of the error, and removing the burden of self punishment.    Of course if it's something major this probably isn't relevant. But I'm talking about those every day things that I beat myself up about.   I'm in IT and I'd be happy to look at your CV. Shoot it over.    Have you thought about getting a casual job? Maybe it would be good to get out of the house a bit.   I guess I should spend time making myself more presentable. I don't know exactly when I stopped caring as much, but I only do what needs to be done and don't take pride in my appearance anymore.   I also need to do things other people said - eat healthier, exercise more, go to bed at reasonable hours (oh yeah it's 1am... go me!), learn things outside of work, have motivation to do these things...   I dunno... I mean it's Parramatta Park - it gets pretty dark in there. And Parramatta.   "Well, your sperm served a purpose, so I guess I can't hate you 100% of the time."  "[Oh :(](http://www.wikiart.org/en/vasily-perov/sad-father-1874)"   The thing I'm looking forward to is walking down George Street and it actually being a pleasant place to be, rather than having to get off the main street as quickly as possible and yelling to talk to your friends, because you have to compete with the bus noise.   I get the bus most days and would be okay to get light rail (I used to get the light rail sometimes), except I hope they don't put those shitty old carriages on the new light rail. They really suck, and give me motion sickness. The old carriages are so much better.    We have a lot of expats at my work and they all send most of their stuff by shipping. I guess they have a lot of stuff. Usually they do it in advance before leaving here. I think you can get insurance too.   There is some good advice on this Whirlpool thread: http://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/2292660   I can read stuff for you and record it. I reckon you should also get an Australian to listen to a recording of yourself doing an Australian accent, and give you feedback on any particular words that sound odd.   Try looking for screen printing shops. They should be able to print on t-shirts and hoodies.  e.g. http://arcadescreenprinting.com.au/   It might have! I have pretty good eyesight. Better than most people, so that old wives tale might very well be true! :)   I think it's not often that really big storms hit the city center. It's the first time since I've been living in the city since 2007 that I've had a really bad storm here. We had hail once but this time trees and powerlines fell down around here.   My parents own a house on the riverfront down there in Picnic Point. The last one we really remember was 1986. But our house is built to flood standards so it doesn't affect us that much plus we're further downstream than Milperra.   [Here's a paper from 2001 on the Georges River flooding](http://floods.org.au/wp-content/uploads/Have-We-Forgotten-About-Flooding-on-the-Georges-River.pdf)   Cooked fish eyeballs. When I was a kid I'd swallow them whole to annoy/freak out my sisters and cause a stir. They don't actually taste like anything, so it's ok. Been a long time since I've eaten one though. Not that keen nowadays.    Ohhh, yes, that's just cruel and unusual punishment otherwise. My tummy is rumbling thinking about all those things.    Why is that evil? Maybe they are really old and not as fresh now so require toasting, I mean Easter was a while ago. Or are you more just jealous of not having some for yourself?   And the air is cleaner!  	95
 examples of these are:  -that feminist will brand men as rapists and that includes asexual males -makes assumptions that male asexuals are white knights or doing nice things for 'rewards' -a lot of women have attacked me for both of these things -asexuals are misogynists for not necessarily liking a woman (extended from men who don't date women are misogynists, as if gay doesn't exist) - and many more examples  here, feminists doxx an ASEXUAL VICTIM OF RAPE: http://dontneedfeminism.com/post/78589971327/abbeyxmae-serebrii   she doesn't have to ult to get a kill   Both marry, be respectful to one another, basic things?, know the basic life skills like cook or fix things      I thought you mean trophies (like heads of animals over a fireplace)  but yea, it is somewhat bothering.
