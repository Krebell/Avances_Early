 you sir have hair on your peaches. thats for sure. good for you. one more question. what's the most common question you get from a confused guy?   but does it actually work? also how did you exactly apply for this job?   do you hit on girls who are buying lingerie. it just seems to easy. i mean they cant say no...because of the implication.    I just want to know how you don't know anybody named chris?   thank you so much!   I'm writing my college essay on why I love my home town so much, and I'm running out of ideas. If you guys could help me out because clearly you love it too, that would be great.   Does anybody know where I can buy a Jack Daniels Shirt in person. I don't want to order it because it's for my German foreign exchange student and I need it before he leaves! thanks!   thanks so much!   I've been looking for the video game "Earth Defense Force: Insect Armageddon" for sometime now. Will buy and pay for shipping at a reasonable cost.     	10
 I've been on the medication about a month.  I mean, I wasn't expecting happy daisies and roses and unicorns out my butt soon after taking it, but I can't tell if the way I feel is because the medicine isn't the right medicine, or if it really is everything else. :/  Definitely a really awkward place to be.  Especially because if I break up with my boyfriend, he'd have to move back in with his parents across the country (U.S.) and that would be it for us.  No real chance of reconciliation.    Hi everybody.  I've been a lurker on reddit for a little while, but I need somebody, anybody to talk to.   I was diagnosed with depression about a month ago, and was put on Wellbutrin.  That's all fine, but I feel like nothing will change unless I change what is going on in my life, but I feel like I can't. I'm currently in my 2nd year of a 2 year Master's program, and honestly?  I don't want the degree. I have realized that science research is not my thing, at all.  I don't even slightly enjoy it.  The only thing I enjoy about it is that i can be a TA. However, I am in debt a little bit from it.  Everyone tells me "the hard part is over!  You only have a few more months!"  but those months include smashing out a long thesis over a subject I absolutely do not enjoy.  I don't enjoy any of the program at all.  It is not what I want to do.  I'm not sure what career path is for me, but this is not it.  Also, I live with my boyfriend of 2.5 years.  And... I've been considering breaking up with him.  A lot.  I just don't feel the same way about him, plus I don't want to be tied down to the same person since I was 21 (I'm 24).  It's hard to describe, but it hurts.  I've voiced it to him, but we live 3000 miles from any family, so we're stuck in this position.  So, I'm not sure what to do.  Or if anybody has ever had anything like this feeling before.  That you are stuck in the life you are in, and there's nothing you can do to change it.  To top it off, I'm not sure if the depression is causing all these feelings about school/boyfriend, or if the school/boyfriend is causing the depression.  I just don't know.  If anybody has any advice, I would really appreciate it.  I am new to depression, and very scared.   TL;DR--have depression, hate current life and feel stuck, I feel like I can't escape without causing big problems.  	2
 Clearly they don't.   I'm surprised my gf doesn't do that, honestly.   Same kind of thing on Jenova. Bots are kinda creepy, IMO.   I played a few months before my SO, and she just got into the game about a month or so ago. She enjoys playing it, which surprised me. Since we are just getting into a long-distance relationship since she moved for University, she decided to play it so that we have something to do together; and now she's obsessed with Moogles. Go figure.  I think that if you can, you should tell her to at least try it. I agree with some of the things that people said in here, at least in terms of trying it. As the saying goes, "don't knock it 'til you try it."   Forever haunting your dreams...   What's up, BTBAM! Been listening to you guys for the last couple years or so when a friend of mine introduced me to Colors! I was amazed that I hadn't listened to you guys beforehand, and now I'm a huge fan!   When you guys write, do you write everything out in a music notation program? And if you do, how much of it is already completed by the time you start writing all of it out?    Waiting on my blu-ray! This sounds so good!   Boss as fuck.  	8
 Watched a doc of a family using a pot with an iron upside down, with a pot of water on top of the iron to heat bath water (along with 2 coffee pots and misc other things).    Gel medium? I thought they used mod podge for this, can I use hair gel?   If it means a lot to you - adtr Stay out - hit the lights Siren - the dangerous summer Just stay - strange bacation The space between, and probably a lot of other songs by Valencia A lot of Brighten songs Thing left to lose - transit   Hell yeah. Used to love this band but forgot about them.   Not my type but you'll do fine on a dating site. Pictures are fine. GO FOR IT   Yes! Saving this post. I know they'll say omega 3 and vitamin b rich food but curious for further input.  Side note: gluten makes me very depressed.   This is so intriguing and scary. Does he sound smart or like he knows algorithms? Heard he had an IQ of 110. Handwritting?   seriously, is it really that hard to just fuck Amanda ahhaha   Gonna start using this instead of Go Fuck Yourself.   I didn't pick up on her intentionally wanting a baby. The scene with Derek's sister is made me think she wanted to leave her family and move in with another family, like Derek's or something. But the theory here makes more sense for the show. Fuck, I hope not though.   So much always happens in an episode, I feel I have to comment while watching the episode to actually convey everything I want to say... But that's not going to happen.  Love Lip's stuff still, I really don't think they're going to get him caught in some way like the others... Unless this is the last season - interesting way to end the show for good is if they put everyone in jail or suicide. I think it's becoming more clear that his storyline will be to enter the professional world and succeed, even if his luck pisses viewers off  Definitely want to kill Sammi. At the same time, I thought she was going to kill herself after she told Ian he was great and going to be okay. Her, Ian, and Charlie could all be in the running for a suicide ending, hopefully not. I think there's going to be a crazy season finale of a very smart death brought upon by Mickey and Fiona, maybe the rest of the Gallagher squad as well.... BUT at the same time, like Lip said last episode, Carl going to jail was inevitable at some point, and Ian getting caught is as well. It was something they were responsible for, Sammi just bridged the gaps I guess.  Don't get Debbie pregnant. Don't. Urghh. Still, I do like the relationship and don't think having sex was wrong for her. Yes, she'd still young, but at least it's in a caring, healthy relationship, plus they seem to be best friends which is most important (i think) during teen sex.  Fucking Fiona, okay, the kiss was in a specific context but just... be a prude for an episode or something.  Hate commenting on Frank but he's so in love, even if it's a friend kinda love. This makes me upset, but happy at the same time. I think the doctor dies at the end of the season, showing that Frank can experience heartbreak and sadness -- I don't think she'll be cured or they'll call her with a fake positive or anything like that.   No question she's going to die. I bet it'll be in the finale, a long, smart plan by Mickey, Fiona, maybe even Frank and Lip. It's gonna be good.   a guy putting his dick in your vagina and thrusting, then cumming. then you both leave.   still have it?    aside from pills, eating right, exercise, melatonin, not laying around in bed or the room where you sleep, keeping TV and the phone away for a couple hours before bed, and try youtube meditation or night time sleep videos with soothing sounds.  This is easier said than done, I tend to just take various pills (ambien, a benzo, otc sleep aids, melatonin, and tylonel pm/nyquil).   Lol really cheap. Like $0.25/milligram.   Broke and friendless.   Don't really have a favorite band anymore. I mean, there are a few bands I like but I know they're nothing groundbreaking and their music isn't anything to move mountains. Haven't been to a show in forever either....   Walls. So they could talk and move and kill people.   and assembly line.   and cotton gin.   Yes. The light bulb.   Well that's no good.   Why! I feel that'd be perfect   Okay I'll probably take the adderal tomorrow and hit the gym then write my paper ;)   What is your normal day like? How do you handle weather and physical strain/lethargy?   Really interesting thread, the comments completely show the opinions of the males and the feelings of the females. Emotionally, as a girl that's been through this, i would be upset too because I tend to have the "I need it all" mentality with guys and friends, and I can't always get over a hook up if it's not someone I met that night, and have to face as a friend/acquaintance. I know it's bad and not right to do it to him, but it's just my emotions.  Now on the practical side, I would love to say I can move forward and he should not feel bad about my interpretation and doesn't need to apologize.   I think it's best to both remain practical and show hints of remorse for not being on the same page, as well as learning that girls are weird and emotional.   My goal is half bakery half community room--music, art classes, craft shows, etc. Midwest is a little far though   amen   Well, I don't know really. I think that's you're part, you have to get creative. Services don't really require much capital versus producing goods. Haven't you ever heard of the red paperclip trade? Maybe get certified in a trade, like software, design, etc and begin in that way. Good luck. I really say this because I fee the same way and really don't think working for someone is right for me and can't seem to find a company and position that I will work well with. I want to live my life combining all the things I love and be my own leader, I don't know how far working for a company will take me as far as natural fulfillment. I plan on (hopefully) opening my own food business, then expanding to greater things.  Where do you live? I could use a partner...   Be your own boss. Create a business, create things, help create. Travel.   It depends. Sometimes I'm in the room I grew up in for 15ish years or in a wide open area like a barn without any furniture. I never seem to be in multiple locations in the dream though, it doesn't change settings. Usually I'm alone or with one other person, although I have had a couple where I was with strangers.. When I say strangers I literally mean people I cannot recognize, have no idea what there name is and feel like I have never even met them in passing in my life.   No. They feel like they last FOREVER which is terrible because most of them really scare me and I feel I'm trapped. ill fall asleep and then wake up after and see my clock only said 1/2 hour has passed. Feels more like 12 hours in the dream.   do you have any ties to St. Pete, Florida?    So do you like... Wanna be friends.. Or... Uh..    Both sound right up my alley. Much appreciated.   I think i read this but will try again, thank your   Thank you. A lot of titles listed are books I've heard but never seemed to get around to.   Really? I've heard of it but figured it's script only. I'll search it.  You use it?   I just don't understand or believe in meditation. Isn't meditation just relaxing and trying to clear the mind for a while. I've tried that, I've done some YouTube videos, just doesn't seem like something that could change my life for more than half an hour. I don't know.   Yes! Just reserved both. Should be good.   If you're not covered in flour, you're not a real chef.  Or may it's the opposite.   Well well well, this is a great question and discussion. I have my popcorn ready.   Judging an animal competition for Legos.   See you there   You can't take out a loan? What about shadowing someone?  Seems like you're doing well and happy (to an extent). Good for you. Waiting wouldn't be terrible...   Yeah I love that little area in Snyder   I'd talk with them and learn if they have the same mannerisms and emotions as we do.   A weird feeling when you have what you think is a great idea and there are already a few similarities within the area. It's like discovering America only to find it was already discovered.   a tomato because i'm controversial and kinda sweet.   Just create a station on Spotify and you'll get all the related bands that are popular in the genre right now. I also really like Major League.   Probably french fries with mayo and ketchup. I could eat them for every meal, every day. Plus, there are so many different varieties and cuts of potato!   I love fiber one cereal so I understand what you're talking about. I think bars or those cookies would be the death of me so I don't eat them. I'd keep them out of your cupboard because they might end up harming you. Drink a lot of water though. I also know that if you always eat a lot of fiber, your body gets used to it and you stop shitting so much.  are you eating less and feel more full in general? if so, it's probably good that you're getting extra fiber. just cut back a little bit.  I love chips like corn chips or tortilla chips with salsa. I also have a very unhealthy obsession with bagels and french fries! Gotta cut those out completely.   Grab generic food from aldis or save a lot of something like that. Maybe a bag of chips for every 2 people. Cook something, like a homemade dip or brownies. Invite people to bring something if they'd like or plan on making smores in the microwave or something silly... like a taco party, or a nacho party.  games like cards against humanity, charades, apples to apples are cool. and of course drinking games like have you ever, truth or dare, etc. are fun (even if you're not drinking).   if you like pop punk: transit, the story so far, state champs   I don't mean to be offensive or anything when I say this, but it feels like you're mentally retarded. At the same time, it makes me feel like I'm the world's biggest philosopher. You have short trains of thought. You will go through a phase of intense laughter and feel your eyes squish together.  Then I usually nap.   I'venever heard of that in my life.  I make amazing stromboli though.   Intriguing! Can you do a quick run down of what Ayahuasca is and what it's able to do? I feel I read about this once and someone posted it was the worst thing they're ever done but holds great power.   Stop trying to force something that isn't there. He's not the one, but a significant person in your life you should keep around.   Okay, I get what youre saying. I wouldn't market it as "art therapy" and i doubt we would get to the point with real therapists and correct procedure, etc. Art classes, yes, that is more correct.   I feel a lot of people have mixed feelings on indian dishes, which tend to be mostly vegetarian. Not sure about that. I want to stay away from pasta because I feel it's so hard to get right. The sauces are something I take very seriously as an Italian-American.   Yes and no. Maybe I should say Art AS therapy in this case. I was thinking more out loud and probably should have tweeked my wording before posting. My idea is simply to make art, do artistic things, get people engaged, give them something to do, maybe learn a new skill. I'm an art therapy minor and have friends within the program that teach classes that do not call it art therapy but hold the general idea over the classes they offer -- like shrines, mandala work, etc.  Writing this quickly on almost a dead battery so apologies for grammar and what not!   I haven't had this account for 2 months, yet I've gotten 2 months of Reddit Gold so far. I see no perks about it. If there was a better tradeoff, I probably would do it. It'd just me a symbol for our connection, this time and place, who I am and who you are.   whoa, that one is firey! Thanks for the knowledge!   Checked briefly his history and did a search that didn't show up with anything. Wasn't until now that I checked the universal block page and even though i scrolled down alphabetically, I did not scroll down ALL the way and see his name. Also now found more dirt on him. Filed a claim with Paypal and hope to get my money back.   Sports hold more meaning than... I don't even have an example what girls talk about because all I hear is blah blah blah.   I'm a female btw.  	65
 try to sound enthusiastic and upbeat when talking when i have watched fm videos the person always sounds dull and bored   there essentially actors    looks like you're one of those assholes    no what i ment is i dont like signing players that are really popular sorry about that    hey guys i try not to sign players that are really popular fierro etc beacause i try to find the gems and quality players myself and i try to stay away from the players everyone signs any of you guys feel the same ( bit of a Fm hipster i know )   i agree !   right now i play mostly every day and a few weeks ago i just wasnt enjoying it anymore so im taking a break untill my parents go away hopeful i will enjoy it a little more. so like 2-3 weeks   didnt think of that thanks !

  yeah i thought of ward-prowse aswell   hey guys really like chatting with all of you on here much prefer here to any forums. anyway i was wondering if any of you guys have tried like an all British team challenge because i was thinking of doing a save where i must have at least 7 English players in my starting 11. if so any must sign players you recommend    it sucks from 15-18 i loved life skating everyday always had something to do  met tons of great people through it. but went to uni :( now im sad   thanks for the advice might try the academy challenge. i sometimes have trouble committing to them. any teams you think would be good to use for the academy challenge    hey guys dont know if anyone else has experienced this but i think i have been playing the game to much because i use to be really excited about playing and use to be really excited to try new formations and clubs and buy new players but now i just dont have the motivation. any tips because i wanna get to the excited stage again    skating as in skateboarding dont have the time energy of the athletic ability anymore. shame because some of the best times of my life have been while skating   thanks for the tip i find myself carrying so many wepons and armor because of the value   40 grand jeeeez !   woah i think we have a winner !   someone once took a shit the size of a baby seal     hey guys just got skyrim a few weeks ago and im trying to get into it. any advice hints or tips when just starting off the game   dodgeball best comedy of all time in my view and people like it but i dont think i have ever watched it without crying from laughter    im pretty impressed he managed to do that. thats very impressive    how is that even possible haha   have a chat. dont have many friends because i think im a dick so a nice chat with someone new would be nice   ham and cheese for sure   seeing the bad in people rather that the good. its a quality i have and i hate it   so we have all seen your amazeing regens but have you had players that you had big hopes for that completely flopped   I think its great you have come here asking for help. But if i was you i would just learn by playing its a lot more satisfying identifying your own mistakes and learning from them and when you create successful tactics without any help or guides is very rewarding not to mention when you find that hidden gem that scores you 30 goals a season. trust me no guides and you will have a lot more fun. p.s enjoy the summer you're going to have a great time getting use to fm :)      glasses and witty remarks and im out man    definitely agree    i agree hugs are the best thing in the world after dogs and the mighty ducks movies that is   watch the 'mighty ducks' all of them. then watch the movie 'jack'   being from london i wish it seemed not weird to go up to strangers and talk to them, i spend so much time in london and i dont have a lot of friends i wish i could just go up to someone and go 'hey cool jacket' or something without it seeming like im a creep. i mean i love london its the greatest city in the world in my view(settle down new york) but very hostile towards eachother  	75
 Unfortunately, he is the inexperienced one in our relationship...he is not taking advantage lol.   It isn't just about a threesome! It's about the whole situation, the threesome Was one example. Obviously I'm not asking for advice on how to say no to a threesome,.I'm asking how to maintain such a dominant relationship! p.s. please don't patronise me due to my age!   I want to make him happy without making myself unhappy...I don't want a threesome, and he does. I want a negotiable solution.   We've been together for 6 months, nearly 7 and he is the most dominant man I've ever met. I find this hard, because I'm extremely opinionated and won't back down without a debate...it causes issues to say the least.   He likes to be dominant in the bedroom, which I'm fine with but now is slightly pushing too much at the idea of having a threesome. It's feeling a little to pressuring and I'm not sure what to do. How to I give him what he wants, without degrading myself or ruining the relationship. Also, how do I maintain a relationship with a guy who is obsessed with threesomes!!!        **tl;dr**: How do I make my guy see that I'm not going to back down to his every need? He is too dominant and I'm not submissive enough.    She only has a single bed, whereas I have a king size. Literally the only reason   I'm not lol! I'm Italian heritage...   I stay out every weekend at my boyfriends house, and whilst I do my sibling uses my bed as her shag pad...and then I sleep in the filth without knowing.   What are your opinions on how to stop this, or how to make it known known that it is not ok!!!!!  	7
 My name is Anna Smith and I always get Anna Nicole Smith jokes. "Is your middle name Nicole???" No. It's not.      "In My Life" has been one of my favorite songs my whole life because I grew up on Beatles. Then my dad passed away when I was 13 and they played that at his funeral and it was the sweetest thing ever. Especially because he got me into The Beatles. It still makes me think of him to this day and that's why I still love the song so much.   My dad used to send me these for the few birthdays of mine that he spent in prison. They were all really cute, my favorite was a Super Mario Brothers one. The artwork was exactly the same too, I would think it was made by the same guy.   I didn't tell my dad he loved him a week before he OD'd and the last time I talked to him. That's the only time I didn't after a phone call. I was with my friends and thought I was too cool to talk to him.      In 8th grade I went all winter without wearing an actual winter coat once. I just wore hoodies. And I walked a mile and a half home from school everyday. AND I live in Michigan.   I'm like 3 minutes in to it right now. What am I watching.   My high school marching band is playing How Far We've Come for our halftime show and we came up with this really funny dance to it. Not really a question just though I would tell you. I LOVE your music.   Well yeah. Our reputation is crap too, I'm sure. :P   Yeah I live in Waterford if you know where that is so our reputation isn't much better   I live really close to Bloomfield Hills and you guys are known as being really stuck up and pretentious. Not that it's anything near as bad as what Mitt Romney is. Where I live is probably considered really ghetto and/or redneck so.   Heh. I get it. I'm gonna message you now. Yeah.   Little bit, little bit. This is why we can't have nice things.   I actually had a suspicion that you were MY friend Jimmy. But I wasn't sure.  http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/200/296/Waht%20a%20twist.jpg   I'm sorry bro *virtual hugs* That's gotta suck. We both kinda sound like we're in the same boat. This guy asked out a girl about 2 or 3 weeks ago and she dumped him after twelve hours and to my knowledge, he's still single. The fact that she dumped him so fast kinda made me smile. Karma, ya know? I'd be a lot less upset with him if he didn't completely cut me off after he promised he didn't want to hurt me but he had to do it because he felt he would have ended up hurting me by the time even worse if we had kept dating. Which sounded like bull to me. and we could be friends. Really, whenever I tried to make things right or talk to him he ignored me and recently deleted me off Facebook. He also kissed another girl near the end of our relationship because they were both going through hard times but he said it didn't mean anything and I didn't find out til about 2 days after our breakup. Sorry I didn't mean to turn that into a rant. But message me sometime dude.3 Feel better.   I like to put my iPod on shuffle, recline my seat a little bit, and lay there with my eyes closed and listen to my iPod for hours, or until I fall asleep. I make this rule for myself where I can't skip any songs and I have to listen really hard to the music that is playing.   Mr. Blue Sky - Electric Light Orchestra  Drive - Incubus  With a Little Help From My Friends - The Beatles   You sound like the coolest guy ever though omfg marry me right here, right now.   I wish I knew this going into my last relationship. Really. My SO and I broke up well over a month ago and I'm still so upset about it, and he already moved on.   Oh god...   I just saw him Wednesday near Detroit and it was great. He's touring with Christina Perri and she is great as well. They're both awesome live and have great stage presence. Jason is very friendly. You'll have a great time. Any questions just ask (:   I actually still braid my hair before bed in two braids so it looks kinda of crimped to be honest   Haha, I'll drop you a message sometime! :)   No. But we did go extremely far on multiple occasions. I'm not gonna say details but it's not much better .-.   Thanks! Every week I'm better than I was the week before. So I'm definitely feeling so much better than I did to begin with and I've moved on quite a bit. And yeah you shouldn't pressure anyone for sex. It just ruins things. Wait until you're ready. c:   Crappy music in general. I have a "Disney channel stars" station on my Pandora Radio that I listen to regularly...   One of my teachers had a big piece of wood shaped like a bass and painted really nicely and it said "Bathroom bass" on it, like "Bathroom Pass" I thought it was kinda cute   Yeah I know. I'm not proud. I know it's not an excuse but I was pressured. And the thing is he promised we'd still be friends and that he didn't want to hurt me. Yet he ignores all communication I try to make with him and deleted me off facebook the other day. ;-;   How physically far I went with my ex boyfriend. He was my first real relationship and I thought it would last but he dumped me out of he blue one day and moved on while I was still at home crying and listening to Taylor Swift. If I could go back to that day I would have stopped right when it started getting out of hand.   I have never liked a guy that wasn't a huge nerd. Really, like I could never date a guy that wasn't nerdy. I have a thing for glasses and curly hair too. And not the "hot nerd" the "nerd nerd"   This reminds me of a time me, my mom, and my grandmother were at Disney World. I was about 11 at the time and we were on one of the Disney busses and we were sitting across from two twin boys who were maybe about six or seven years old. They were being obnoxious and screaming and acting like idiots, and at the exact same time me and my grandmother went "SHHH!!!" The kids were dead silent the rest of the ride.   My school's marching band is doing How Far We've Come, Yesterday, and Thnks fr the mmrs for the half time show   Reversing roles for me. Trying to be friends with ex-BF. Not going well for me.   That's exactly what I said. He kissed another girl. They were both having rough times. It was an impulse. I can forgive him. But I'm never gonna forget what he did and how much it hurt me.   Wow. Thank you. Really. I'll definitely try that. I guess that's all I need. Some time away, just to act a little reckless. Again, thank you bro. Really helpful. c:   My favorite member is probably Paul, because he's extremely talented and I think he has an amazing personality. My favorite album is a hard one, but I have to say Rubber Soul. My favorite Song is In My Life because it brings back a lot of fond memories of my father who passed away last year. My favorite singer is John. I love the Beatles because their music is incredible and they had a huge impact on music history. The Beatles are who I turn to when there's no one else. They're just unbelievable.   Why? Just why? Who honestly thought this would be a good idea?   I actually really like the smell of skunk. I also love the smell of gasoline and smoke though, so people think I'm weird for that.   Thank you c: This is really nice and some of the best advice I've gotten. I have a best friend that has been there through the whole thing but I'm sure she's getting tired of hearing about it. Lol :P   I'm 14 years old and one month ago Saturday, my boyfriend (also 14) broke up with me. He said that he was under a lot of stress and was having family issues and that he didn't want to break up with me but he had to because he didn't want to end up hurting me. When he broke up with me, the both of us were just sobbing. Then fast forward about 3 days. I found out he kissed another girl who was raped recently while he was still with me. When I asked him about it, he said that I deserved to know the truth and he did but they were talking about what happened to her and they kissed without thinking, and he has no feelings for her and isn't dating her. I haven't tried talking to him since then and he hasn't tried talking to me, but today I broke and sent him a message on Facebook. It said "Hey, I know you're probably not really wanting to hear from me and idk if you're upset with me or anything but I've been kinda worried about you because of how you were last time we talked, and I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Are things going any better for you at all? /:" He didn't reply yet, but he hasn't been online and I just sent it about 5 hours ago. I was in tears for about the first week of our breakup, then the next two I was fine, and now I'm in pieces again. I saw a picture of him on facebook and legitimately started crying. This boy was my first kiss and my first real boyfriend. We went extremely far physically which is something I'm not proud of, but it's the past. We are going to different high schools this year as well, so I won't be able to see him during school either. I just miss him so much. I keep having dreams that I see him somewhere, and we make up, and everything is back to how it used to be. I just feel like I'm never going to get better. The only thing I want right now is to be able to see him and talk about things. I just need so much closure right now and I just want us to get back together and I want things to be how they used to be. I miss his smile, I miss cuddling with him while we listened to music, I miss Facetiming with him every single day for hours and hours. Reddit, how do I get over it? And should I keep trying to talk to him or should I back off? Thanks.  EDIT: Yeah. He didn't reply to my facebook message. It said that he saw it, but no reply.   DFW he says you can still be friends yet makes no effort to talk to you.    The reason my ex boyfriend kissed another girl during our relationship is because I was an OAG and even though he insists it wasn't my fault I will always know it was because I wouldn't give him space and assumed the whole relationship would be very long-term.   I actually love this. You have a pretty unique and cool sound. Keep it up.   Bill, I'm 14 years old and you are the reason I have so much passion for science. I want to major in physics some day. Thank you, you have made such a difference in my life. I probably never would have cared about science otherwise and never would have realized how cool it is. But my question is, what were you like as a teenager?   http://seanterrencebest.p1r8.net/ they made a mirror of the site. You're welcome.   I heard this song at the Apple store a while ago. I was trying the headphones on an iPod and this happened to be the song I chose. Been into it ever since.   This freaking song. Definitely my favorite on the album, kind of hard to listen to right now though because I just went through a rough breakup and he and I used to listen to this song together all the time.   I still read it as Jared until you pointed it out and was really creeped out as to why they would name it.   My username is relevant to this post. :'(      Oh my gosh, me too. I thought I was the only one. Mine don't sound nearly as strong as yours, but the word "fluffy" I'll think of a little retriever. For verbs I get a still image of someone doing the verb. For whatever reason, a lot of these images are cartoony and look a lot like clip-art.   Yes. But it depends on where I'm at and what's going on in my life. At the moment I gotta say it's Always Be My Baby (The David Cook version, I'm not a fan of Mariah Carey). I know that my boyfriend and I are more than likely going to end soon and I can't accept it. That song is describing my feelings down to every last word.      My cat was originally Mr. Kitty then we figured out it was a girl and it turned into Ms. Kitty and now it's just Kitty. :3   How is Qdoba actually pronounced? I know it's a dumb question but my mom and I were arguing about it.   I know that feel. My dog will run up and down the hallway and growl and bark at my grandfather's urn. And this is normally and extremely quiet dog.      I don't spend my 4th of July downstate but I'm in Waterford and I heard we have a pretty good fireworks show, but Lake Orion has a very nice one as well. If you're willing to travel I always go to one in East Tawas, it's about a 2 and a half hour drive. It's very nice, bright fireworks on Lake Huron.   I have glasses because I'm farsighted. I'm supposed to wear them all the time but I wear them occasionally during the evening while I'm reading or on the internet. I want contacts but I have to wait a little while to get the money. I just don't wear them all the time because I think they make me look extremely nerdy and I don't like them, so I know it's my fault. But my question is, how much worse can my vision get from not wearing them? Scare me into wearing them more often because I know I need to and would if I knew the risks of not wearing them.   15, female   I actually like writing essays. Too bad I live in Michigan. I write essays in my spare time, come on Tigers.   Wow. This is gorgeous. I need to visit here sometime.   They can't be comprehended by the human mind.   "INTO THE DOME MOTHERFUCKER!"  Jesus Christ I have tears.      I actually should have called it Lake Huron, Ontario. I said Michigan because that's where I live and I'm used to it I guess. XD Sorry, broski   It is. I don't know why I put Michigan in the title. Probably because I live in Michigan. My bad, brethren.      I read "Found this baby" and I was instantly concerned.     	71
 Funny ~~re~~post bro   Sad to see the comments section has devolved into a java rocks vs java sucks war. As an intermediate level programmer using Android, I got something out of it. He makes some valid points regarding for each loops which require the use of iterator() and Iterators, which can necessitate more GC when used for long lists. The use of static methods also helps when you don't need to access any instance variables. Google's Developer section also points these things out and more in their documentation article about increasing performance: [Link](http://developer.android.com/guide/practices/performance.html)      the build up was what made it so good too haha.   sick flow and very lyrical for his age. the thing is he has room for improvement too  a newer track from OF with him in it (his verse starts at 7:05): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzi24Nssiow   Are you referring to Android's "Dalvik" JVM?   ah yes. Handles!   freakin upvote people!   Extreme chunk error is extreme... am I wrong or can people reproduce this with the same seed? Just curious.   You can't help but facepalm.jpg   Is this a Nas instrumental? (hope I'm not embarrassing myself lol)   great mix man make #3 i will listen!   Here's the release schedule for those who don't feel like searching:  M7  Friday, May 11 RC1 Friday, May 25 RC2 Friday, June 01 RC3 Friday, June 08 RC4 Friday, June 15 Quiet time, June 16 to June 27  (no builds during "quiet time", assumed all code is done by end of RC4) Release Wednesday, June 27, 2012   All pretty valid points, thanks for clearing that up.   I'm a fan of Hopsin. I think he's pretty lyrical. However, the verse about Obama on Nocturnal Rainbows is extremely ignorant if that's what he actually believes. He mentions the Illuminati as if they actually exist...   8/10 i like your breasts and your smile   ill   yeahhhhh 9/10 i like ur hair :D   7/10 I suggest changing your hair color to something other than red and growing your hair out. you will look really good that way.

 Was completing a History exam at uni last year. Had finished my first essay question and was taking a little rest before starting the next one.  I looked down and there's a fucking wasp crawling up my top! I had a silent freakout as any noise would have had me kicked out. I swiped the bastard off my top only for it to land on my leg. I then knocked it onto the floor and stomped the shit out of it.  My history tutor happened to walk past at this point and gave me the weirdest look. Really wanted to write an explanation on the exam paper.   Jean Grey.    "I know what you mean. We'll be all down from early evening so if you decide to pop down I'll see you there, you can give me goss from Blackpool lol"    Aged 3/4 I was out at a pub with my family for Sunday lunch. A larger gentleman came in and proceeded to use the fruit machine. His size must have offended me as I immediately turned to my mum and yelled* "MUMMY HE'S FAT!"  My poor mother had to apologise to the man in question and I happily went back to devouring my meal.   Vanity Fair - I studied it for my advanced higher dissertation and I struggled to read the book critically as I enjoyed it so much. I still count it as one of my favourites.

 This is some excellent advice. My intelligence has made me bitter and jaded, I'm unfortunately a bit of an idealist so when the world doesn't live up to my ideals I become bitter about it. It's something I've really come to terms with, that it is better to be humble and kind than intelligent and cold. I hope it is something that I only get better at as I get older. That being said I really need to work on myself socially as I still see social interaction as a mechanical thing that other people find organic.   I have a ridiculously high standard for myself too, perfectionism is something that often leads me to depression. I have similar mechanical thinking when it comes to social interaction. What comes easy to other people, simply talking, small talk I guess, is a painful thing for me. I have to try to perform small talk. I remember being maybe 12, and attempting to analyze the way the "popular kids" spoke to each other so I could maybe mimic it.  I just can't function it seems.   Yeah it brought up a lot of problems in my last romantic relationship when I started experiencing depression again. I have it twofold people like me when I have my shallow mask put up, this fake person who likes what everyone else likes and goes with the flow, but as soon as I ever open up and talk about something "deep" with a person they usually remove themselves from my life. So I just expect people to leave now.   I should be in my third year, but I've dropped out because of depression. I was undiagnosed until July this year, which is miserable considering how long I've been suffering from it. At least I'm on the road to getting better now.   This is exactly my school experience. I was always beaten down for being ahead of my classmates. It was pretty miserable being a ten year old and having no one else around me understand what I was talking about.   Yeah, my family moved at very key developmental stages where I lost all my friends and any kind of social circle I may have been building. I'm more of a failed extrovert than a true introvert. My social life is screwed up.   Yeah I know how that feels. I mentioned in another comment how I have a numbing existential pain that follows me around no matter how happy or content I am.   I like it a lot, it's very underrated. It's all about the characters in the story, not so much the campy scifi that surrounds it.   So far all it has caused me is absolute pain. I'd say I'm socially stunted as a result of intelligence, which has lead me to not trust people. I've dropped out of college not due to lack of success, but because I don't trust myself. I would gladly trade my intelligence for happiness.   I relate with everything you just mentioned. Even before I was diagnosed with depression I had this subtle knowledge that felt like I wasn't meant to be happy. I really appreciate the quote at the bottom too, thanks.   I like Kurt Vonnegut, he has a sad, uplifting, and absurd way of looking at the world and why people do things. I'd recommend Slaughterhouse-Five. Anything by Mark Twain too, especially his short stories and novellas.    I've never been tested, though based on my performance I'd guess I'm considered well above average intelligence. I sympathize with what you're saying at the end. I've ruined a lot of close relationships, I'm isolating myself, and I've dropped out of university (not because I was underperforming just because I can't take life anymore.) I feel like I'm either going to beat this and be the person I've always wanted to be, or I lose and kill myself.    It's always at the back of my mind, it's like a numbing anxiety that just leads me back to depression.   I was like that through highschool, I grew up in a rural town quite literally in the middle of nowhere. All my teachers always thought I was the smartest kid in the school, and I showed it in the last year, came second highest g.p.a. in my grad class. I spent most of my grad year not depressed, so that may have helped.   That's very interesting! thanks for sharing.   I like a lot of art films. Andrei Tarkovsky, and Wim Wenders are two of my favorites directors. I think there's a lot in their works that speaks to the INFJ mindset. I especially like the movies Stalker, and Wings of Desire. In mainstream films I really like Bladerunner and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless mind.     Recently my therapist brought up the possibility that I may be gifted. I suffered from depression during my childhood and apart from periods where I was too apathetic to care I did excellent in school. I've heard it said that depression is common amongst people with high intelligence. I just wanted to ask amongst this community and get some perspective.    Due to some recent circumstances I've started seeking counselling. I've gone to see a psychiatrist and have been diagnosed with depression and some obsessive compulsive tendencies. From what I've read I think I may have BPD.  I'm a 20 year old male. Since I was little I can remember having serious mood swings. I feel very needy when it comes to other people, I'm also very afraid of them leaving me. I've had attacks of anger or crying when someone leaves me or when big plans change at the last minute. I've lied about random things because I feel insecure. Stupid things like going to a certain concert or something like that. During worse parts of my life I've had suicidal ideation and mixed with feelings of abandonment I have almost self harmed. I have threatened suicide, and have a dramatic streak when I feel I can no longer cope. I have had paranoid thoughts about almost anything you can imagine. I drink to self medicate. I always think that people close to me are just looking for an excuse to bail out of my life, and if they do leave I have major panic attacks. There's has been a pattern of people walking out on me so I'm always ready to drop someone else first, this causes problems in my relationships. I always feel a compulsion to impress people that I meet for the first time. I have fairly idealistic or black and white world views and will devalue people who disagree with me. I've been physically violent with people close to me in the past, and sometimes throw things when I'm angry. When I was younger I had a bad habit of acting out in an attempt to get others to accept me. I was bullied a lot from 8-14, partly because I believe I was already depressed at that age.     I can remember from a young age having spells of crying, or on the verge of crying. I can remember having spells of this even up to around the age of 17 or so. I've always just felt overwhelmed by negative emotions at times, and have gotten inappropriately weepy at times. I'm new to my diagnosis so I'm still trying to find out what fits into my description or not. I can say with confidence that I've suffered from depression and anxiety before this most recent spell, but is this not being able to control negative emotions during circumstantial events fall within the realm of my depression?   This entirely, it's such a viscous cycle. All I can think about is how I've been weak and failed in the past. How am I supposed to build confidence when I have such an awful track record; then it just feeds into the next bought of depression.    Yeah I get that way too. That's when I can take a lot of work load, it's kind of like "buckle down, weather the storm, you should be in a good place when the feeling comes back just do these things in the mean time." Then it doesn't work out and I end up angry and frustrated.    Thanks a lot for the response. I'm not holding any illusions as to continuing this relationship. The thing that bothers me the most about the whole situation is how out of character this was for me. I've never done things like this before and it makes me sick to think that I ever even got angry at her for anything. I'm just trying to get back to who I was before this year with the added experience. I want to be stable longer before I date anyone else let alone her. She does matter a lot to me and if I've lost her for ever than so be it, but I think that things might be better for the both of us if she knows what's happening with me.  P.S. Thanks a lot, it's been really difficult so far, but at the same time it's good to know where those emotions came from in the first place. I've got a long road ahead of me, but I'm taking off time to make sure that I never act like this again.   The people who are suggesting counselling are correct, if you have not yet tried counselling than that is a good direction to go. Anger is not a good way to communicate in a relationship and there needs to be healthier ways to go about it. Anger is generally a sign of other issues, it is not okay that he takes this out on you but both of you should seek counselling. If he doesn't seek counselling or seem to make any improvement than you should start thinking of ways to leave.   I've been there before, just many years ago now. I'd say this time was a bit different being out on my own though. University can do a number on you.   already did, looking for wider feedback.    When I wasn't actively being depressed it would come out as anger in general. I was overly judgemental to a lot of people and was generally dissatisfied with everything around me.      I'm a 20 year old male. I've been suffering from major depression for years and only over the past few months have I actually been diagnosed. I've found with my depression I have periods of anxiety that lead to depression, which I eventually push down so I can actually function. So I'm severely depressed at the same time as being able to maintain a fairly substantial work load. That being said I can only focus on my work load anything else is too much. Eventually my depression starts coming out again and the facade that I put up cracks. It usually starts to break down after a few months with angry outbursts, crying randomly and then suicidal ideation until I'm full on depressed again.    So has anyone else felt this way before. That you can push down your depression for a period of time but it ends up coming out again as anger, anxiety or frustration?   Thanks a lot for this. I'm not looking to get her back, I'd be lying if I said that's not what I would like, but I'm not expecting anything and I need to get healthy before I can date anyone again. I just want her to know that I'm sorry and that nothing that happened was her fault. She didn't mention any of this stuff when we broke up, even though I asked. I guess she didn't feel it was needed. Anyway, I'm sure she knows something is up with me, it was pretty obvious looking back, but for me it wasn't at the time. I just don't know how to talk to her about it. I mean calling her up and being like "Hey haven't talked in a while, I've been diagnosed with a mental illness, sorry for all the garbage I put you through" seems a little forward. Thanks for the response.   Me and my ex dated for 2.5 years we broke up in april; before we started dating we'd been friends for 3 years I'm 20, she's 21. I didn't take care of myself and I treated her like garbage. She has so many completely valid reasons to never want to speak to me again. I became completely focused on school without any regard to anything else, it was all I could handle. I had what I would call an existential crisis that triggered clinical depression. I went to a counsellor early on when i was feeling a lot of anxiety, they told me I should speak with a philosopher. I wasn't sleeping at night, wasn't eating, was missing showering every other day, and falling asleep in the afternoon or in class. Lost interest in everything I enjoy, was a snob to my friends, and walked around with a chip on my shoulder.   I did so many things that were absolutely crazy, and obviously signs that something was seriously wrong with me, but I didn't do anything about it at the time. I became a complete misanthrope, I hated everybody and criticized everyone including her parents. I became dependent on her. In the last few months we ended up fighting a lot and I almost hit her, like raised my hand and said I wanted to, but didn't. I did end up shoving her once. I'm so ashamed about what happened. But wait there's more. I became kind of semi-controlling and I was jealous of one of her guy friends, who I probably was right about but I let how I felt affect me too much. I definitely crossed the line with that too, I just felt like I wasn't good enough at all. I didn't do enough for her birthday and valentine's day. It was just dinner, flowers, and a gift but I felt I should have done more. During all of this I was spending a lot of time playing video games because without realizing it I couldn't deal with my own life.  During a panic attack I had I almost cut myself, I've never done something like that before it was crazy, she stopped me from doing that. I was off handedly mentioning killing myself like an "maybe I should just kill myself then I wouldn't have to deal with" ____ whatever problem I was having.   After she broke up with me at the end of the school year, I didn't leave my apartment for 2 weeks, I just cried. I couldn't piece things together, I didn't talk to anyone I was just dead. It took me a month to realize how messed up I had been. I've since gone in and had pscyhiatric assessment done. I've been diagnosed with severe major depression. I'm seeing a therapist and am on medication.  I've never been like this before, I've always been a patient, caring and loving person. I was the one who could take the pressure in our relationship, but I lost it. This past year has been so out of character it's difficult to describe. Apparently my friend's and family has been very worried about me but didn't say anything.  Me and my ex haven't been speaking very often since the break up. She wanted to stay friends (for some reason I don't understand) but I told her that we both needed space. She said that she'd be there if I needed anything. I told her I wouldn't. Anyway, now I've dropped out of college for this year while I get my head back together.   Do you think that I should tell this girl why I acted the way I did? I'm feel so ashamed about what's happened, I have a hard time believing it myself.  She was my best friend for five years and the last 9 months have completely ruined that.   TL;DR: I've been diagnosed with severe depression. I've acted like a monster for almost a year, my ex left me with good reason. I feel like I should talk to my ex and at least give her an explanation for why I acted the way I did.  	30

 Have you looked in the settings for the messages app? For some reason it isn't enabled by default.    If you're planning to root and ROM, I'd go the GS2 because its a little cheaper and has better almost everything except screen. If you're going to stay stock then it's definitely Nexus, no comparison.   Probably running a custom rom. Guessing from the "swagger" toggle, it looks like AOKP with a themechooser theme.   In all honesty, if you want to get your hands on new updates as soon as they come out and you don't have a nexus device, you better be prepared to root. It's either root, or wait.   Custom shortcuts in the nav bar? Nope, it's [AOKP!](http://justreboot.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/jt_aokp1.jpg)   The new notification shade looks... amazing.      Galaxy S2.   What about people with unsupported devices but are using unofficial builds? :(   No. You cannot uninstall system apps without root, regardless of what launcher you use.   Incorrect, this will only allow you to uninstall userspace apps. Many bloatware apps are put on the system partition of the phone and cannot be removed without root access (eg try to remove stock messaging or contacts - even though they are not bloatware they are system apps and you will see what I mean)   There are plenty of ports on the SGS xda forums, it only takes a few hours for some of the devs to port over new builds once they've been posted. [Here's what I'm using.](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1712185)   Juice defender or tasker?   It can handle up to 32gb, just not moving or copying anything over that's larger than 4gb at any given time.    A cat meowing?   Calendar  menu  calendars to display    I think you're forgetting the important fact that Google voice is nowhere near being internationally available. They can't merge functionality on an os that reaches all over the world, when that functionality is only available in a few select places. Until voice is universal it has to be a separate app.    Yay, this post again! Seriously, if you don't like an app then why have it installed?    Yes right now CM7 has way more features than 9, but that is because of the CM team's choice to focus on stability and clean code before features - there were posts saying that some features in CM7 were "dirty hacks", and they're doing everything a much cleaner way this time round, so features will be slow. In the meantime I suggest an AOKP-based rom, as they have more features atm.   Fyi cm9 nightlies are pretty damn stable.    I read somewhere that once the battery drops below 5% you have to boot into webos to get it to charge.    The development scene for the i9100 is more at xda.    Reddit news is awesome, but its not flawless. (I'm using it now) Alien Blue just feels so nice to use.    But none of them have the polish that Alien Blue does.    Strangely enough this actually never happened to me. The worst its done is refuse to load content and a force-kill and reopen usually fixes that.   And if you don't like a piece of software, nobody is forcing you to use it.    Flash a stock rom with Odin.    Well it certainly seems that way haha. Tell me, how is Verizon's new data plans relevant to Android? Sure, you use Android to access the internet but posting about it here makes about as much sense as posting about new cable infrastructure in r/windows.   In a single country. Everywhere else it doesn't apply.   Oh, we're still doing this joke?   I watched The Shawshank Redemption for the first time ever a few days ago.   While we're at it, can we lose the carrier posts that have NOTHING to do with android?   Not defending the people that do suggest it, just giving some insight on why they do. :)   Come and join us on the dark side, [AOKP](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/20526467/Screenshot_2012-06-12-20-56-54.png). (its only green because its currently charging, is otherwise blue.)   While valid for Nexus devices, which come with vanilla Android out-of-the-box, I think a lot of the root/rom suggestions stems from the fact that fans of the platform don't want a users view of Android poisoned by a shitty manufacturer UI - I know a lot of people that have HTC phones and they complain about bug X and not being able to do feature Y, which, upon further inspection turns out to be because of shitty, bloated sense.   Its a feature that a lot of custom roms have, namely CM9 and AOKP.   Solid explorer has all this. You don't even need to install the app to know that, its right there in the description... don't simply dismiss things immediately, investigate.    To build a home - cinematic orchestra   What features does Solid explorer lack in comparison to your current one? I find it suits all my needs, its very functional.    Slim ics is available for the Gnex also.    Its simply because the devs didn't code it into the app.    Hey look everyone, this guy doesn't have **Facebook!**    Also comes with some pretty sweet wallpapers.

S2e   How do you do it though? I'm trying to place one on top of the other and it just moves to the nearest available space. I'm using the free version.    Uninstall the CF3D binary, and then remove the app completely.    As long as custom roms exist, the android phone will always be dependent on the computer.    The only thing stopping me from completely swapping over to Reddit Sync is comment editing/deleting!   https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.smart.swkey   Thank you so much! I've been experiencing this issue for a while now!   What's the benefit of using this over an ad-hoc network which can be done with your laptop/computer already?   As a person currently suffering from depression, fuck you. Do you mean to say that the fighting it has taken me to still be alive to type this out is meaningless? Depression is a cancer of the mind and soul, and there have been studies that show *physical manifestations* of depression in the brain. What gives you the authority to dismiss scientific studies on this *life altering disease*?    I think that per-app DPI requires some serious hacks and modifications to the android framework itself. I don't think its possible without a custom rom, unfortunately.    Ah that makes more sense. Thank you for explaining. :)   Why don't you just have it utilize the Share function instead? That way you can simply hand over the information to wherever they want to share it (ie if they want to share it via some other messaging service).?   Only thing I'm waiting on for this app is comment editing/deleting.    I enjoyed the remade multiplayer. But I wish they kept both versions. And the Xbox version was more censored. :(   Not until reading this thread did I realize that this company is responsible for my childhood...   I know that, but just letting people know its a feature of AOSP, not CM.       Tell me what its like to look in the mirror and hate everything that you see. Tell me how it feels to know that for every second of happiness you are going to have an hour of suffering. What does it feel like to look around yourself, see the people that care for you, but theyre so far away. You scream and yell and cry but they cant hear you. Theyre looking, looking for you. Where did you go? What happened to the happy little boy that lived life to the fullest? Why am I so tired, tired of this world and this life? Every snide remark and ignorant comment feels like a punch to the gut. Im being eaten alive by a disease whose first mission is to knock out your communications. You cant tell anyone about the dark cocoon youre wrapped in. Wave after wave it crashes down on you, youre drowning, gasping for air. In between the waves you might be lucky enough to see a bit of sunshine, but only for an instant before your sight is robbed from you once more. What is a life without true happiness? Where the best feeling is no feeling at all, and sleep is the only real escape? Can a person really be blamed for wanting to escape such a hopeless place? What is living if it is simply out of guilt for the pain you would cause loved ones? If only I had gotten help sooner.     Not sure how to start these things. I'm 16 years old and I was diagnosed with depression about eight months ago, but the effects of depression and suicidal thinking I've been experiencing for much longer, I'd say about 2 and a half years.   I've had suicide "attempts" but I view these only as testing the waters, seeing just how close I can get to death before I back out. The most recent one was the most frightening. When I do this stuff to myself an intense clarity comes over me. It is quite literally a calm before the storm: everything is crystal clear and in those moments I swear I knew the answers to the universe. I was ready to die that night, but again I backed out. Each time I get ever closer.   Right now I'm the happiest I've been in a long time; just gotten out of hospital and I'm on new medication, making huge strides in therapy. Yet I cannot shake this feeling of utter dread. This feeling of knowledge - the simple plain fact that my time is limited and when I die, it will be by my own hand. I am my own worst enemy. It feels like trying to hold up the sky - I can fight as hard as I can but eventually, the time will come when I break and the sky crushes me. I am loved. I can see it, feel it and experience the joy that it brings. But it feels worthless. I am unable to dredge up any meaning from life. I know I should try harder in school, but I just don't - I don't see the point in it. I want to make it clear that I am very happy, content with my life how it is at the moment. But similarly to how a terminal cancer patient is enjoying their last days, I enjoy my last days with those that I love. I know that people will be hurt - my family, friends, girlfriend will be absolutely crushed. But I feel like its not up for me to decide - the darkness within me is too powerful. It is relentless and I am its prisoner.       My plan allows me to use unlimited Facebook with 200mb of data/month for everything else. I'm currently using Onavo Count to manage my data usage but it's inaccurate as Facebook usage isn't metered by my carrier. Does anyone know of any data-watching apps that would allow me to add an exception to any connections going to facebook.com?            depression is  turning your phone off because you think nobody will try to text or call you anyway  having to deactivate your facebook so you arent tempted to impulsively post depressing and attention seeking statuses  being paranoid to the point where you ruin your friendships with people before they have the chance to hurt you  walking into your room and collapsing onto the floor and into tears as soon as youre out of everyones sight  having to say what? all the time because you cant seem to focus on what anyone is saying  looking at your school books and being unable to read or write anything because you just cant seem to think at all  getting angry at people when they touch you  not being hungry or feeling sick when you try to eat  the feeling of a constant weight on your shoulders  always being tired, no matter how much sleep you get  staying up all night because you dont want the next day to come  lying to your friends, psychologist and parents, telling them that youre getting better because you dont want to stress or worry them anymore  feeling like youd be better off dead  seeing the worst in people at all times  being unable to take a compliment or accept anything nice towards you  testing people to see if they actually care about you  overthinking things to the point where a kind gesture can become a hateful insult  spilling your whole story to people again and again in the hopes that maybe someone will save you  not being able to take a joke  having to fake a smile all day  hurting the people that you care about the most  asking yourself why cant you just be happy? on a daily basis  being constantly judged by people who have no clue what youre going through            16, depression for 2+ years. something tipped me over tonight, tried to hang myself in my closet but clothes rack/metal bar thing broke from my weight... i blacked out for a few seconds and woke up on the floor. i don't know what to do. i'm such a fuck up, i can't even get suicide right.   My Facebook app refuses to load the newsfeed or anything for that matter. Instead of posts it just says "no content" in the newsfeed, and trying to load any other page just throws me an error "no content" or "connection timed out".  I can connect to the mobile site fine and everything works.  Rocking a Galaxy Gio, running CM7.2 (as seen in my flair), done all the usual things, rebooted, logging in and out, cleared data/caches of the app, uninstalling and reinstalling and I'm still at the same place. Anyone had this problem before?   Why? Just why? I hate myself. It's like I'm just too used to being depressed and sometimes it just feels more... comfortable. Like being happy and normal is an effort for me. I don't want to feel like that. Why does happiness come so easily to everyone else? Why do I have to try? Why do I have to lean on this stupid green pill like a crutch? What happens if I just stop taking it every morning? Do I just go back? All the "progress" I've made, does it just disappear? I'm so angry and frustrated because I can see myself hurting people that are important to me. I just want someone to understand. I hate this. I want to be better.         Would like a few people to squad up with on the weekends. c:         I know there's plenty of guides in the sidebar but the thing that I find myself having most trouble with is simply the vocabulary and lingo that is used in this game - I'm trying to read guides and posts on reddit and I end up coming away more confused than I already was! If someone could point me in the right direction, that would be great, because I've totally enjoyed the few games that I've played.               I know that there is already a reddit group on flickr, but would anyone be interested if I decided to create a flickr group purely for people to post their photos for the assignments into?  Edit: Due to all the positive feedback, I went ahead and created [reddit photoclass2012a](http://www.flickr.com/groups/1828866@N24/) on flickr. :)                  There's an online sketching/drawing site, based on Flash I think. When you draw it automatically draws lines in between your lines, sort of like a spider web. It's hard to describe.                            Hey there /r/photography. I've got a bit of a problem with my camera.  I recently bought a second-hand Canon 300D (the first Digital Rebel) from eBay for $350. I've been using it for about a month now, no problems. The camera came with two CF cards; one 512mb and a 128mb.  When I first got the camera, I put the 512mb card into it and hadn't taken it out until last night (I don't have a CF card reader so I simply plug my camera into my laptop and transfer the images that way, so there is almost no reason for me to take the CF card out.) I was planning to take more pictures than usual today, as I was going out with a couple of friends and I tend to take quite a few shots when I do; so I decided to make sure the 128mb card worked, since I'd never tried it before.  This is where the problems started. I replaced the 512mb card with the 128mb card and turned the camera on. When I do this, it takes much longer to turn on then usual ("EOS" is displayed on the screen for about fifteen seconds, as opposed to the normal one or two before I can start taking pictures). The screen then starts flashing with an "Error 02".   I googled around a bit, and apparently Error 02 has something to do with the card and not the camera, and it suggests to format the card and try again. I tried to format the card on the camera, but the error wouldn't let me access the menu to do so. I simply wrote off the card, deciding that I'd pick up a 1GB card from an electronics store as soon as I could to use instead.  No problems, the 512mb card had done me good so far. I'd just have to be scarce with my picture taking.  So then I go to swap the 512mb card back in. The camera turns on as normal but the CF reading LED (which usually flashes for about ~1 second before I can save pictures to the card) only flashes once, and then I get a message on the screen saying "Full CF". Which is weird because I know for a fact that it's not. So I went into the menu, and tried to format the card. Before I format the card, it gives me information on the space - "2.7mb used of 3.8mb" - which obviously can't be right because it's a 512mb card.  So I go ahead and press format and then I get an "Error 99" on the screen. A google search of the error brings up mostly results about cleaning the lens connection on something similar; which I know is not the problem because the shutter works just fine when there isn't a CF card in there.  So has anyone experienced this before or know of a place I can take the camera? I'm not sure where I'd go to get it fixed, given that it's quite old.   Hey there, /r/Android. I just recently got my first Android phone (yay!) but I've been a long time android researcher and /r/Android lurker.  Anyway, I'm looking for an app that makes the backlights for the touch sensitive buttons on the Galaxy Gio flash or pulsate when I have a missed call/unread message/other notification - basically emulating a notification LED. Does such an app exist?                     Australia has had metered internet usage ever since I can remember (I'm only young, so that doesn't really mean much - but we've had capped usage for *at least* five or six years). I fail to see why it's such an issue in Canada - if your cap doesn't have as much data as you would like, then doesn't it just make sense to upgrade your broadband plan? Or am I missing something important here?   I just bought this phone online, and I can't seem to find **any** custom ROMs for the Backflip - my Google-Fu must be weak tonight.  The reason I want a custom ROM is because - frankly, Motorola's custom UI **sucks**.  *"If you knew you didn't like MotoBlur, then why did you buy the Backflip in the first place?"* - It's currently the only Android phone available to me through the carrier I want   the price I am willing to pay. Besides, I know I can just install LauncherPro and be done with BlurHome, which is my prime concern anyway.  	110
    I've never really thought about that, but that's very possible. I will try bringing it up to them, hopefully they take me seriously    That a good idea, I just want to go see someone I trust. I'm trying to work up the courage to, last night I had a horrible night and I hope she will take me seriously   Internet hugs to you too, I'm glad someone's on my side!   Thank you for the advice, good luck to you too. I tried talking to the school counselor once after my mom and I had this big fight over nothing (she threatened to leave the family) and that was around the time I started getting overworked about things. She was okay to talk to, but its hard for me to open up to people and I couldn't find the strength to to her. I hope you find help too!    Thanks, I will try that!    	6
 Thanks for reminding me! I forgot to put my NYX eyeliner in my product list haha. i have tried filling my brows in countless times, but the brow pencil I get is either too light or too dark :-/   I will look into the eyebrow pomade you suggested in hopes that my eyebrows will look more even. Thank you so much!   Products used-  Primer: TwoFaced Primed and Poreless  Foundation: iT Cosmetics Celebration Foundation  Lips: Burts Bees lip crayon in Hawaiian Smoulder  Eyeliner: NYX liquid liner      Urban Decay Vice palette please   iT cosmetics celebration foundation! How well does it conceal blemishes and dark circles? I've watched various YouTube reviews but none of the reviewers have bad skin like mine. Is it worth the buy?    I seem to look "too washed out" at school every day. I usually do just a winged liner and a slightly tinted lip balm. I've noticed that when I wear red lipstick I pop out more, but still I look very plain. Are there any suggestions anyone can give me to stand out more? Any criticism is welcome!   If we do adhere to the banshee theory, in certain cultures banshees are know as harbringers of death. Meaning: Their screams tell you when someone is going to die. I would be very careful, they might be trying to warn you, and since you happened to have a warped engine you could have gotten into a serious accident. Watch out OP!   I'm from Cary and I remember hearing this!! I was only about 11 or 12 but it scared me so bad I didnt go to sleepovers. I'm sorry for your loss though :(   He showed up at school on valentines day with a 6ft stuffed rabbit, sang me a song asking me to prom and offered to pay for my ticket, dress and any accessories I wanted. I thought he was just trying to be kind, and at prom I introduced him to my friends as "just a friend". Little did I know he harbors a ginormous crush on me and I was too oblivious to realize it until the summer when he moved away    My dad told me this story as I left for a summer camp that would be held in UNC Chapel Hill's dorms. He told me when he attended university he had three suitemates. One of them was never around as he took night classes. The other was my dads close friend and the fourth guy (Mike) was an ROTC nut. So the say the suites are set up is that there's French doors separating each suite and the French doors had giant windows which people usually covered with curtains or posters. So mike was OBSESSED with pushing the red button on a nuclear submarine so he could start a war, and he constantly told his suitemates this. He also got drunk every Friday night and went out to fight with black people, and this made my dad and his suitemates to never want to talk to the guy. One night Mike comes home wasted and bloody after a night of fighting and my dads like "k cool whatever". My dad goes to his room to study and out of nowhere Mike's hands punch through the window and grab my dad. He takes his lamp and throws it at mike and runs out into the hallway where a VERY intoxicated Mike then calls my (hispanic) dad a "filthy nigger" and tell him how he's going to "gut him like a fish". My dad bangs on the RA's door and begs him to let him in. The RA then calls campus police, and I shit you not, it took FOUR cops to hold him down. My dad said mike went to a mental institution the rest of the semester and when he came back he had totally forgotten (or pretended to forget) that he tried to kill my dad. What a great way to start off freshman year!      Die Antwoord   It legit made me cry and shake with anger. I feel so bad for the fathers friend.   Also, in Japan everyone is Japanese. I have been here as an exchange student for 5 months and the only foreigners besides my fellow classmates are the occasional tourist.   Kyoto, Japan   That people with eating disorders are "tragically thin" and will remain beautiful throughout their disease. Thats not true at all. You won't be beautiful when your skin, nails and teeth turn yellow from malnutrition and you wont be pretty when you lose clumps of hair and basically shrivel up into a brittle shell of the person you used to be. Oh, and eating disorders do not only affect women, but men as well. Awareness is the only way to end the cycle. Love yourself and your body.    When will you know what you want to do as a profession? I have to apply for college in a few months and I dont know what I want to major in and what field of work I want to work in and the uncertainty makes me so anxious   Snapbacks, sagging backs, air jordans and a vocabulary that consists of "swag!" and "YOLO!"   Danny Phantom for 3 years three loooong years   My city is the home of the KKK, isn't that just lovely   I was so relieved that someone told me, and in English no less. Its been weird not seeing many foreigners in Kyoto except in the touristy areas. So far my stay has been amazing despite the incident but my host program not requires every participant to go sightseeing with an adult (before we could do whatever we want as long as it followed our families rules and the counties rules). Needless to say although my classmates were spooked by this, they're a little peeved as well, but are glad I am safe. Thanks for the wishes though!   Yeah I brushed it off initially because it was at Kinkaku-ji temple, and if you look it up you will see it is visually striking. So I thought to myself "ah, I'm standing in a good area, he just wants good pictures like me!" I was very very wrong.   Oh yeah, I've gotten SO many high school students asking to take pictures with me and I find it quite funny. But this just...this creeps me the hell out.   To give some background information let me first start off by saying this has left me constantly looking over my shoulder.   This June i travelled abroad with an exchange program in Japan where i would be a host student and study at a local highschool for 8 weeks. My host family had taken me to the sights in Kyoto and Osaka but there were a few places we hadn't gone yet. On Saturday we decided to go to a famous temple in the area and only me and my host father went since my host sister was at volleyball practice. My host fathers hobby is photography so he brought his DSLR camera and a bunch of lenses so we could get the best shots possible. We arrived at the temple and there was a good mix of Japanese and gaijins (for those of you who dont know, a gaijin is a foreigner). We proceeded to buy our tickets and enter the temple and my host father whipped out his camera and started to take pictures of the landscape and candids of me as well.   Pretty soon i realized people were staring at me and i paid no attention to it since it looked a bit strange for an American girl to be walking with a Japanese man. I brushed off the weird glances as i was captured by the temples beauty! As i was taking pictures on my phone, an english man next to me taps my shoulder discreetly and says "there is a man following you taking pictures of you miss, be careful" I laugh and tell the man that it is only my host father who is taking pictures and the man turns ashen in the face and says "no, not him, the man is BEHIND your host father. He has been taking pictures of you the whole time while neither of you are looking!"   At this point m heart begins to race and as i turn around i see none other than a short, chubby, asian man holding a digital camera- thats pointed right at me! I act nonchalant and walk to my host father and try to explain the situation but my japanese is not advanced enough to give him the full story. The only thing i can muster out is "chikan" (pervert in japanese) and point discreetly to the man following me. My host dad, who is a whopping 6'2 man, walks over to the creepy guy and converses with him in japanese and gets him to hand over the camera then runs for his life to the temple exit. Much to my surprise the SD card is full of pictures of ONLY me, and they progressively get more creepy. There was even a picture that he somehow snuck from under my skirt which i didnt even notice.   We contacted the temple's security and the local police and they are investigating and promise to return with more information. Although there was no harm done to me i feel constantly paranoid that now everyone is taking pictures of me or that i will somehow see this man again on the train or bus and that this time he won't settle for pictures up my skirt...  	24
    From a design perspective, the 'For your home, business, family' and Get Started button need to be moved upwards a little. I'm not too into the photograph you used at the top of the page either, the edges look a bit scruffy. Other than that, not a bad design.    Can't tell if troll..  	3

I was baptised a second time (first as baby) last year and this thread is making me really regret it and hold some animosity towards that church that let me go through with it. They knew I was baptized once but insisted on doing it again when I came back to God.   I was baptised as a baby in an Anglican church then again last year when I came back to Christ. The church I attended at the time inisted I get re-baptized. I am going through this thread and see a second baptism is unnecessary - what should I do? Was a second baptism a sin or...what?

Well now that you've met Matlock, swiped his pills....""Take one every hour to prevent spastic heart convulsions."   Throne of Thunder is considered a Legacy Raid and uses the old loot system. You can run each boss, regardless of difficulty, once per week for a chance to get a Secret. Once you kill a Throne boss, your chance is used up for that week.  Siege of Orgrimmar uses the new loot system. You can repeatedly kill the first 8 bosses in LFR/normal for 1 secret per boss, for a total of 8 secrets.  Additionally, Lei Shen and Sha of Pride have a 100% drop rate on your first kill.  So if you're really unlucky, you can still get 9 per week. 1 Lei Shen, 8 from Siege of Orgimmar if you grind it out until each boss from Immerseus to Nazgrim drops one.  After that, you need 12 Runestones, which only drop from ToT Wings 3  4 and SoO Wings 1  2. Me and a guildie grinded out the Runestones in a single day, as we were very lucky with the drops from Throne of Thunder. After that you need the Heart of Lei Shen, which you can run Pinnacle of Storms again the same week as Runestones and he will drop it guaranteed.  If you have 0 Secrets, you can earn 9 guaranteed this week if you grind SoO 1/2 and kill Lei Shen. Say you are unlucky again and only earn another 9 next week: you will be unable to get the Cloak. You need to get at least 11 Secrets this week to even have a shot at getting the Cloak.  You have 2.5 weeks, as Warlords launches on a Thursday. Good luck.   1. Don't go to Wal-Mart.  2.

I read a while back that the government had this big tax break program for students to get their own laptops or something. Of course most ended up using their computers for free games like LoL, causing a Brazilian [Eternal September.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September)  Most Brazilians don't listen (or understand) to instruction, heed raid warnings or even know how to play their class. [In free games like LoL or Dota 2, they are notoriously worse, as the barrier for entry is access to a computer with Internet.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1eluep/brazilians_need_their_own_server/ca1qkmp)  I think it has to do with language and cultural differences. Firstly, they cannot read nor speak English and therefore, are inable to read English class guides, communicate with English-speaking players or learn to play their class effectively. Secondly, South Americans, Brazilians in particular, are extremely proud (some would say arrogant) people - look at the World Cup for proof. If you try to offer criticism and help in a game, you either get Portuguese in return (hue), insulted or ignored.  So you have language barriers + cultural differences (e.g. patriotism/pride) + an Eternal September because of the supposed "free laptops" thing + lag = [a recipe for disaster.](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensive/comments/1eluep/brazilians_need_their_own_server/ca1hsmt)   I'm going to say $300-400, around the price of the Aquila, maybe a bit more. It's less of a combat-capable ship than the Aquila, but serves in a similar role.   My tears stained not one, but both of my mini-racing ships in my private hangar.   Back in those days we called turkeys flying birds   Oh bitch bitch bitch   Homer! Are you really giving up your faith?   I don't like you kids watching that show. That back-talking boat sets a bad example.   I had a Malibu Stacy and I turned out all right. Now let's forget our troubles with a big bowl of strawberry ice cream.   We need a "I wash myself with a rag on a stick" fat Bart.   Aw, you can come up with statistics to prove anything. Forfty percent of all people know that.    I did answer.   Would a truly good person expect praise or simply work with what is given to them?    Says who?  As a Christian, God only knows. I believe Jesus lived the perfect life and Christians should try to follow him, although we will always fail.   I don't know if you're being funny or not, but the story was told to a Jewish Pharisee. There are many layers to the parable, but one of the subjects of the story is the "good" son, who envied the prodigal son. Jesus was making the point of not being "holier-than-thou" and instead, act in humility and give thanks that your brother has returned from the depths of sin.   I am ilvl 558 and primarily raid Heroic (old normal) while occasionally playing Unholy with the same gear. Should I optimize for a DPS build, or stay survivability?   I am never in joking, as joking leads to dancing.   OMG I have to get an actual job now??   What? I am saying that Jesus is uncreated - he was there in the beginning as John writes.  The poll indicates Evangelicals believe Adam + Eve, or whatever, came before Jesus, as if Jesus was created.   I am only on the first page but the thing that struck me was most DISAGREE Jesus was the firs thing God created. Have none of these people read John 1:1?   I would recommend Goblin for a new starting zone. Blood Elves and Draenei still use their old 1-15 zones from TBC, while the vanilla races use revamped vanilla zones.   No. The Shark was originally intended to eat hard nuts, shells and plants with tough exteriors, thus the sharp teeth.    How can I better understand inflation?  The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and, subsequently, purchasing power is falling.   As inflation rises, every dollar will buy a smaller percentage of a good. For example, if the inflation rate is 2%, then a $1 pack of gum will cost $1.02 in a year.  http://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/inflation.asp  In World of Warcraft, currency devaluation happens due to a number of factors: an increase in quest reward gold, lower barriers to entry for new producers/extractors, 6.0 currency conversion and gold buying.   The biggest contributor is the increase in level cap and subsequently, increase in quest reward gold. In Cataclysm, the average daily quest would grant about 7.5 gold. In Mists of Pandaria, daily quests would grant about 11-25 gold.   Resources have also become more widely available to farm, specifically Ghost Iron Ore. Previously, we had to level mining to max to farm the highest tier of ore. This is no longer the case, as Ghost Iron Ore is available for mining at mining level 1, making the barrier to market entry much lower. As more people sell and buy the ore, more money is exchanging hands and in turn, re-distributing wealth.  Furthermore, with the low bar to entry comes new ways to earn profit by means of production. If I farm all the materials I need for a Sky Golem, an engineering-produced mount, the materials will likely cost around 10-12,000 gold at average market value. But I farmed those materials myself, therefore the cost is significantly reduced. I then sell that Sky Golem for a whopping 15,000 gold or so. Not only did I make a profit of 3-5,000 gold on baseline market value, but I likely made much more as I produced the materials. Those materials I farmed netted me a healthy profit and introduced more gold into the market.  Additionally, the recent 6.0 patch had converted Valor and Justice Points into gold, which will be used as the go-to currency. The average player received about 1000 gold from this conversion, substantially increasing the amount of gold in the economy.  Then there are "intangibles," or things we have no data on as players - namely gold buying/selling for real world currency. Right now, the average gold buyer sells 10,000 gold for $7-10. Let's assume $1/1000 gold for simplicity's sake. There are two kinds of gold sellers - those who manually earn their gold through farming (be it mobs or materials), or those who sell gold from stolen accounts. The former are doing the same thing our Sky Golem manufacturer does; they are converting raw material into hard currency. While buying gold from these people is still illegal, their method of producing gold is technically not illegal. On the other hand, stolen accounts end up hindering the economy by not introducing new gold; they simply redistribute stagnant wealth.  I hope this helps.  TL;DR Greater quest rewards. Lower market entry for new extractors and producers. Currency conversions. Gold buying.   You can run Siege of Orgrimmar normal/heroic/mythic repeatedly until you get a Secret from all 8 bosses that drop one (Immerseus - Nazgrim). Throne of Thunder has 12 bosses that will drop one, but you only get one chance per boss a week due to the different legacy raid loot system it uses.  In theory, you can get 8+12, for 20 Secrets if every Throne of Thunder boss drops one (but that is highly unlikely). Lei Shen and Sha of Pride are guaranteed to drop Secrets, so if you do not have time to run SoO constantly to get 8, you can get at least 2 for sure.  After you finish Secrets, you need to collect the 12 Runestones. You will have 1.5 weeks next Tuesday, as WoD drops on a Thursday the 13th, two days after reset.   If you finish Secrets this week, you can very easily get Runestones done by running SoO repeatedly for 8+1 (Lei Shen), then again on Tuesday/Wednesday the final week.   [Frost](http://www.noxxic.com/wow/dps-rankings)   Have you played through the revamped Cataclysm 1-60 leveling? If not, I highly recommend.   Free food. Any university student will thank you for it.   What else is there?    celigaycy  Love it, though no homo. It's less bad for me to have sex than it is for you.   My advice: ignore schooling, job obligations (if you have one) and nearby friendships - focus on your girlfriend first, since she is the most important thing in your life as I can tell. Is her timezone ahead or behind you? If ahead, skip school to get extra Skyping time when she is at home. If behind, vice versa. As a mature young adult, this relationship will likely last for many years to come and you should do your best to help foster that growth. School, job...these came come later (night school for example). Don't waste this opportunity for romance that some people never have.   The female is scared easily by males approaching out of the blue, without any prior relationship. Don't bother - you will come off creepy and weird, especially when you cannot speak Spanish (I presume).   My girlfriend of two years found a box of ~~lewd~~ old videos and photos from ex-girlfriends. All of these are several years old and predate my current girlfriend. She was really upset and wants me to throw all of them away, but they have ~~masturbatory~~ sentimental value to me. Should I get rid of them? It's causing a lot of conflict. Never mind that we're a couple - my happiness is paramount to everything.   You do have the right to happiness; that's why I said you should kick her out. She can sell all those "pointless" things that she bought you for Christmas like a Game Boy or TV or whatever to pay for her first month's rent.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6H1M0KTfQxU   [Reddit can't possibly be wrong.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWq_MVBJk_0)   While you could try to keep in contact via Facebook or other social media, the best option would be to move and cut off all contact with them. If they don't want to hang out in person, they won't make the effort to do it online.  If they were your real friends they would stick by you, since they should worry about your happiness - that is the most important thing.   She raised you for 20~ years, fed you, bathed you, housed you, free of charge. But now that she is a minor inconvenience to your happiness, that woman has got to go.  You did the right thing by coming here, rather than not discussing this with her or your sister.   She is a useless bloodsucker; dump her.   You cannot get to Perendi in a Sidewinder - the jump range is too short.   Yes. Keep track of what bosses drop secrets, so you know which ones to repeat again. Up to Nazgrim, each has the chance to drop 1 per week, regardless of difficulty. Keep running SoO until all 8 have dropped one.   Because in-engine replay systems are very difficult to make, not because developers are lazy.   Only the SoO bosses allow you to get repeat kills. ToT is a one-kill-a-week chance, regardless of difficulty.   I would like to get a whole branding package if possible. [Here is my current organization](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/orgs/HOLST), but I think it could look a lot better.  What do you guys think?   But Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet, and you know it's going to be good.   I would assume the animations are change server-side to be shown to you as proper third person animations. Think of it like this:  Your friend performs a melee. It looks good to them in first-person, but would look like shit, as seen in the video, in third person. The developer creates another set of third person animations that only other players see when you perform certain actions. When your friend performs a melee, that action is sent to the server client, which feeds it back to you, so you get the proper third person set of animations.   If you played the game with the proper multiplayer third person animations, in first person, it would probably not play properly, if not look entirely fucked up to begin with (e.g. eyeball height, weapon size, field of view are all different when playing in first person).    no marketing building expectations.  What the hell do you call all the trailers and cinematics then?   In the same boat, my friend. Depression sucks.   The sidebar has our subreddit poll with our favourite books. Every book on there is authentic - not realistic, as we don't have their levels of technology yet - but authentic in that they feel realistic and gritty.

You're trying to find your faith but reject any Christian-based teaching people here try to give you. One of the tenants of Christianity is about humility - it's about admitting your wrong and don't have all the answers. I pray that you will gain at least a piecemeal sliver of Christ's humility.    does the bible say this is wrong?  Yes it does, many, many times.   However we would rather have a "traditional" ceremony and have a house waiting for us.  You don't always get what you want. If you want to get married to her, do it. Have the ceremony later. You sound like a flake to me from your OP.   Yeah, compared to other old school MMOs maybe. But look at what people are suggesting - FFXIV and ArcheAge. Are you joking? FFXIV has what...3 raid tiers and about a dozen dungeons? ArcheAge maybe, since its emergent PvP content will provide some hundreds of hours.  But WoW has 16 tiers of raiding AND PvP content + professions + dungeons + questing + achievements + pet battles....I could go on. On my one account alone I have sunk over 2,000 hours. My old account (before it was banned for buying gold) had about the same.

 Maybe 3-4 yrs old. Could've been Christmas. Eve. Parents let siblings and I open a present. I got a Looney Tunes puzzles cos I distinctly remember porky pig.   Religion. And real country music.   Led Zeppelin.   My dad gave me his belt too from when he was in his early 20s. It doesn't fit me since I'm a girl but I still have it. It has his initials engraved into the leather.   Failing my first year of college. If I could just go back and do it all over, I would. I wouldn't lie to my parents about how well college is going. I wouldn't spend the next years depressed, unmotivated, and feeling lost in life.   It can happen. I have native cousins who have blonde ish hair, pale skin, and I saw a native baby with blue eyes. My mom made me to over to look at the baby just for his eyes. I also have cousins who are pretty brown.   Pistol Annies - Annie Up   Electromagnetism. I just can't... understand. What is this witchcraft?   Not sure if it's a sixth sense and not sure if it's at all impressive since it requires close proximity but I can sense when someone is close to me. When I was a kid my siblings found it amusing though. They would stand behind me and then let their hands hover over my back and I would feel this weird tingling feeling over the exact spot. It's come in handy though. My family is all fairly close and relatives are often visiting each other at all hours of the day/night. When I was in my early teens, I went to bed early because it was a school night. I left my door open because I was terrified of evil spirits and ghosts and felt safer with the door open. I fell asleep. Then I woke up. My right thigh was tingling. I shot up and there was my male cousin crouched beside my bed with his hand hovering over my leg. He told me he just wanted to ask if I had any CD-Rs. I told him I didn't and he left. Turns out, he'd been groping female relatives while they slept. He grew out of it but the family has kind of ... ostracized him since.   When I was living with my sister, we had our first fire drill in our apartment. I ran out the door and went downstairs to the lobby. My sister followed right behind me with her wallet, our cat, and her cell phone. Nowadays I'd probably just grab the kids and dogs and leave. I can't remember where I ever leave my wallet or cellphone so screw looking for it.   Family recommended the show to me because it was funny. I watched an episode and couldn't watch anymore. It came off scripted.   I watched Glee for awhile so I can say the only episode I liked was the very first one. It all went downhill from there.   Homemaker. I'm single with no kids. But that won't stop me.   I sent a text message to the wrong number. I inverted the last two digits. I thought I was texting my brother in law. He was with my sister when her phone died so I joked that I was stalking her. The text receiver didn't appreciate the joke. Turns out a girl he knew shared the same name as my sister. I explained myself and apologized.   For me, the most useful info is that drowning is silent and isn't the flailing around and shouting you see in movies/TV. My nieces and nephews love swimming and our beach doesn't have a lifeguard. Someone drowned there recently.   That sucks. My mom forgot her iPhone in a public restroom. Mine was stolen when I forgot it in a bookstore, so my mom was happy a cleaning lady found hers. Since those things cost about $700, my mom gave her $40 for finding it.   US Netflix, Spotify, and Hulu.   Had one drink at 18. Didn't drink alcohol for years afterwards. Family has a few recovering alcoholics so I just didn't see a point to drinking. First time I got drunk was on my sisters birthday. Made sure to drink a lot of water. Stopped drinking when I felt myself losing my ability to walk straight. Growing up shy and self aware has only made me very aware of how drunk I am. Tipped the waitress alot but I do that sober too.   Punched myself in the face too except i was trying to stuff a sleeping bag into its sack.   "We should get a mini freezer and just fill it up with TV dinners."   Jack from Lost. I hated that guy.  	21
 I could have even made weakness potions, but time and the game were not on my side...    I could have even made weakness potions, but time and the game were not on my side...    lol, Ice, there is no July 32nd :D    Does it close and reopen 20 minutes before?     Well, tbh, if he said not to use the command, then don't use it, and don't be that guy...   Actually at the time I am typing this, it is 17:35.   It will be quite a treat seeing all the new faces we may see during and after this event! Just remember, always be respectful to the host, and never cheat!   Make sure you don't have ./nick enabled, that allows people to change their name and causes problems.   :(    Be there once more, hopefully better this time!     Be there again, and no babies!   I only had like 9 :D   Although I didn't win, I'll have you know I also had a power 3, and died because you didn't have more arrows! :(   }:)   I've trucked through the only matches I've played of it, but through all of them, I have learned that baby zombies need to hit less as hard and have less health. Right now they are basically small, fast zombies, and any health I lose is to them.   Ice, have I ever told you how much I love your games? Because I do! Although, if this is the last 1.5.2 match, I may lose my always going to meetup and dieing streak, because baby zombies.   Maybe Ice will host? That be awesome! :D    That doesn't seem right though, it says the 21st for blackie's?    mwahahahahaha   I'll (try to) be there!   Your not alone, I did too :'(    Or not :(   :D    I'll be there again!   I thank him too, I wonder when there will be a game without us in it, or one with Jacob in it.   Earlier today huh, I'll still be there though!    I'll get you this time!   Yeah, I had similar gear as shadowlego, and 5 golden apples (+ full health) and was against the wall, but then someone attacked with what I assumed was a strength potion or a really good sword, while 3 others were   charging at me, and died in one hit. I didn't even get to heal due to as many people as there were.   I would recommend next time, just ban him. Don't make a long lengthy deal over it, it makes the game worse. Better luck next time!   To those who would want to play in these matches, I would recommend not to. The OPs were spawning mobs to get rid of particular players, and down right annoy others. I had about 20 bats spawned on me on one occasion. Other players (regardless of who they were) had creepers spawned on them. I would not recommend playing these matches until their games are fair, and tolerant.   I am sorry, but that seems like the, "If it doesn't impact me, then i don't care about it." or basically, you don't care about anyone but yourself. I'm sorry if I offended you, but its my opinion.   okay, sure i see, but how many people dont use that chat, or want to organize all their information? It gets a bit hectic to do it in chat. There are also many that arnt in that chat that want to play games, and get their games from the subreddit. Believe it or not, but a lot of people DON'T use the skype chat.   Not to be rude, but, where else is there?   Those who are trusted by the host, not all, I understand you, but there are those who would not play fairly, however, I don't see them often or at all. Many on the UBL though do play fairly. I personally want to stay out of this one, but just clearing that up.   I assume that he meant 22:30 UTC or 6:30 EDT because PDT is strange to use without EDT unless you live there. (Also, JOHNNY, UTC from PDT is +7)   You didnt put the IP in the post guy, whata doin!?    Wanting me to "shut the fuck up" when i am asking a question just shows that you cant take criticism, and i was merely asking a question for why you would say something that was not a sign of good hosting. You dont have to tell me what i already know.   I would love to play again, your guys server was all right with 15 people, so you shouldnt have a problem with 25. (Also, I like endurance ffa's, the ones with no time limit, hint hint nudge nudge.)   Was fun! Started as the first one to take damage, and went on to win!   It didn't matter who said it, i was merely asking why it said that, when that obviously is not a sign of good hosting. Replying "shut the fuck up" also is not, and was completely uncalled for, I replied back as narrow minded as you did. I'm not the only one that had a problem with your matches, or this being the first, and I'm sure, not the last, you may want to learn to respect people before they will respect you, and don't go "you swore at me, nyanya" While it may not have been one of the most mature things I've done, you swore at me first, and I don't "bow down" to hosts, I play with them mutually, and respect them. You, I have no respect for whatsoever.    Sounds like wdornbach to me, his hosting is very similar.    That doesn't give much context, why did he deserve to be banned?    Apparently you could have logged back in, and I had asked the host (who, contrary to what it says here, was t4t4t4t4, not actually_yes) why he had not replied, and he said he was afk. I then complained that he had said "this is an impromptu, do not complain about lag and bad hosting" and i said that gave no right to not host correctly. To that, actually_yes replied with "shut the f*ck up" and i replied back as narrow minded as he did. He then banned me for: faggot.   He is a very clever man, but apparently not enough, you sir brought this to light, so that we know to avoid this name too, thank you.    Hopefully you will do better than he did with it. :)    No no, -10/10    However, curious why people were still on, I logged onto the server, to see if this was still going on, it appears that wdornbach said he had lost the server, and no longer owns it, so hopefully we wont see him anymore.   I would have claimed that before the point of wdornbach killing people, that he was just making honest mistakes, but at the point he just went and killed people, he was being incompetent, especially because he never replied at anything ever said in chat. He is a horrible host, no because he didn't know what he was doing, but because of the things he did know what he was doing.   were you still in game? can you not get on either?    I am not whitelisted D:    I personally think you could do well, but here is some feedback:  -Don't make PvP instantaneous, turn it off until first night or second day. -Make the spawn box bigger and within the borders, the constant teleporting was quite annoying.  I do however, like your endgame of a re-scatter, and I would appreciate you trying again :)   it will be interesting to see who eats their apple at the start and who doesn't ':l.    I get DCed too, and now its white-listed! D:    Skype and IGN: test_subject5099    Scenario?    As it says feel free to apply again, may I do that here? IGN: test_subject5099   IGN: test_subject5099    IGN: test_subject5099    I know I'm a bit late, but it would be awesome to play, IGN: test_subject5099   I have been planning to be in everyone of your FFA's, and thwarted every time!   Twice and your out if a great idea, and if the person has tried to alternate account their way to play, the time should be extended as if it was a totally different person (A reset, if it were.).   	61
 I know it's stupid, but [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Licked_Hand) has changed the way I live my life (albeit in a very small way).         At night, my cat always props up on the side of the bed to bump his head against/lick my hand before jumping on the bed.  Ever since I became aware of this stupid legend, I have to turn on my phone's flashlight and shine it in his face before I am at ease.           Not the way a 33-year-old, grown-ass man should be...but we all have our things, right?  Right?!   I've read a version of that before somewhere and let me tell you...I fucking hate it!      Whenever my wife calls me from downstairs and I'm halfway down, that little thought pops into my head for some reason.  If I went towards her voice in the kitchen and then I heard her calling me from one of the upstairs rooms...I would probably shit myself right there.   There they are.   I think I have an idea of why it didn't work out.   Is your name Jake?      "...and I jizzed in my pants".   He choked himself on a chicken parm sandwich trying to imitate his idol, Peyton Manning.         It's being ruled a suicide.  Insurance will not pay for that.  Sorry for your loss.   If I had that particular set of skills, I would have Butler pulling the Super Bowl trophy out of Sherman's chest.      Sadly, I do not possess that ability and can only imagine it in my head.

Wow, I've never been that lucky.  Depending on the arresting officer, you could've been hauled away.   That first ticket would've been the property of the guy beside me, if I didn't have the stupid need to outrun everyone else on the road.    "Oh you want to be faster than me?  I DON'T THINK SO!"   Yeah, I was a little shocked that he would say something about my back window.  I obviously need to bone up on my tint laws in my area.      I can see emergency lights just fine through all of my windows.   Just rear and side windows.  Nothing on the front.   I watched that loop for an uncomfortable amount of time...until I was comfortable with it.   Yeah. I think I would've been fine if I wasn't speeding. I've never been pulled over before just for dark windows and apparently I've been driving around with an expired tag for two months now with no issues.   15%.  I think the lowest it can be legally here is 25%. Not really sure.   ...within a ten minute window.  First one was 70 in a 45 on a highway. Got a ticket for that. In the same stop, I got a written warning about my expired tag and a verbal warning about my tinted windows. Gave him a "Thank you sir." and I was on my way home.  Second one was 83 in a 60 on the interstate. Got a verbal warning for that. Here's the kick...I also got a ticket for my expired tag and one for my tinted windows. I was contemplating on saying "Thank you sir, may I have another?", but I realized that would not end well for me.

Make two character profiles. 2. Have one be like an "off shore" bank account. 3. Whatever money you earn with your main character, put into the bank. 4. Switch to the other character and have him withdraw it all into pocket cash. 5.

That's actually the first time in my entire life that I've used that term to say "vehicle"...and it will not be staying in my vocabulary. Didn't feel right.    After a survival mission, I got placed into a random session. With only me and another person in this session, I felt somewhat safe to go about my business (robbing stores, shooting random NPCs, taking pictures of bikini clad women on the beach).  Out of the blue, this guy sends me a text saying that we should team up. Being the paranoid person that this game has turned me into...I accept, but have my pistol out just in case. He rumbles up to my location in a fully modded Z Type. Seeing as I barely have $9K in the bank and haven't seen that car in game anywhere before...I was impressed.  He then proceeds to friend me, let me in his car, and then takes me to his $400K apartment. I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman...only, you know...if Julia Roberts was a dude. Anyway, we get to his apartment and go into the garage, where he proceeds to show me his impressive array of whips, all modded out as well. We then spend the next 10-20 minutes, standing there just talking money strategies and general gameplay tactics. He told me a bunch of things that I didn't know and even offered to give me cash, but couldn't because the option was grayed out at the time being.  At the end of our rendezvous, he says he's going to go play CoD and to hit him up later for some general GTA fun. Right before he leaves he says, "Most people with a bounty on their head wouldn't be as trusting as you were.". At that point, I just remembered that I jacked an NPCs ride before the previous survival mission and he put a $5K bounty on my head. I had totally forgotten about it.  That was the absolute coolest experience that I've had with a random person in GTA:O! This game is awesome!   In the first part, after sinking the bit into the wall...why does she start making kissy faces towards the drill?   And she's using the same spoon to stir everything.     	82

I don't see any evidence of how vaporizers are marketed to those underage. Flavors can be argued, but 74.4% of 10,000 adult vapers on ECF prefer non tobacco flavors. We can also take a glance at the flavors within the alcohol industry.   Tobacco marketed to the underage and lied about it under oath in a congressional hearing.   Also it just goes without saying that Eliquid is not water, and what the fuck is a hefty dose.    Formaldehyde comes from dry hits. The largest amounts of formaldehyde are going to be seen in a cheap tank with inefficient wicking speed when paired with too powerful of a battery.

Formaldehyde is even less of an issue now that the DNA40 is out with temperature control, but they won't cover that.   They also wouldn't cover that in a study, propylene glycol mist had a 100% success rate of killing the influenza virus. But no, focus on MRSA. Who the fuck has that anymore.

Dumbest comment I've seen on reddit   Golden ohms requested here ^   They won't regulate liquid nicotine just because it's suspended in pg or vg. They're both, mostly pg, solvents for a lot of medications, and this pure nicotine is used for the creation of nicotine replacement therapies.    Diacetyl is commonly not listed.

Yes, I was advised that memes were against the rules. I corrected and reposted.    If the FDA is able to regulate E-cigs because they're considered to Tobacco Products under the Tobacco Control Act of 2009, Couldn't we make electronic cigarettes for the purpose of vaporizing nicotine-free e-liquid only, and just have the user add their own nicotine into the e-liquid?  The Tobacco Control Act defines Tobacco Products to be "any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product."  This reaches us only because our nicotine is extracted from tobacco.  However, a nicotine-free e-liquid and a vaporizer for such contains no parts derived from tobacco. The FDA would not be able to regulate that, and we will still be able to purchase nicotine from Wizardlabs and mix it in.

I was super tight on cash, but I was able to sort therapists by the amount of money they require each session, and I found one for only $35 a session. All you have to do is send them an email introducing yourself.   Before that, I was in the behavioral health section of the hospital for 3 weeks. While it was a very different experience, it's the best thing I've ever had happen to me in my life. It might be something you could consider.   Getting help is an amazing step. Depression acts like a cloud on our brains, in a way that we often only see things in one light and struggle to see different points of view - we find reasons to bash ourselves and lower our self esteem when in the eyes of a therapist our thought processes are easily seen as false. Talking with someone is a long process. It will take months. However, I found having therapy each week gave me a huge sense of security and control over my life, not including all of the progress I've been able to make with major depressive disorder and severe anxiety (I've graduated therapy - I no longer go).   NAMI is an organization that meets for free group therapy all over the US, if you are stateside.   Is there anything you'd like to talk about here?    Congratulations, friend.   It's very strong of you to reach out. That takes pure motivation.    Hi friend.   I've attempted when I was your age.   I'm now 19. I did not succeed. What I can tell you is this - I've finally come to the point in my life where I am happy to be alive. My entire life in that age was plagued by constant thoughts of suicide. It is now not that way any more.   If you have school tomorrow, go and do one thing. Tell your best friend that you weren't supposed to be here today. Explain to him or her. It is that point where your life will start to turn around.   You have a future that you haven't seen yet, and that is the only reason that you feel as if you don't have one. There are so many moments you're going to experience outside of high school that will cause you to reflect for a moment and think, "If I'd have died, I'd never been able to be here right now, and see this."   Speak to someone, and anyone. If you're making a really big decision like this, learn both sides. Search for ways that you might be able to continue living - to fix your problems.   High school grades are not permanent by any means. They are highly fixable. If you do care so much about the grades your getting, then you already have the motivation it will take to fix them.   Think of who you will leave behind. Talk to them, tell them. Be very straightforward. I've lost two best friends to suicide, and I'd just wished they'd have told me straight up that they were thinking of committing.   You can do this. Contact me here if you need guidance.

This goes for celebration too - remember to celebrate when you've made an accomplishment. My favorite hobby is within electronic cigarettes, so I'll order a new toy to play with every once in a while.   I'll go for a long drive.

I rooted via Towelroot, I'm running SafeStrap Recovery, I have SuperSU v2.16, ES File Explorer 3.2.3.1, and Busybox v1.22.1-Stericson  No matter how I try to achieve read/write through adb shell, nothing has been successful.

This both doesn't enable me to push files into the /ui folder, and while ES Explorer can try to copy files into it, they end up corrupting. When I say corrupting, I mean that before copying a .ogg file, it will play via the sound player, but after copying/pasting into /ui, it will not play. Trying to "cp" or "busybox cp" the file from the sdcard into /system/media/audio/ui produces the same corrupted result.

Things have just been building up in my head and I've been trying to find a friend to sit down at talk with for weeks, but no one wants to listen. I don't expect anyone to read this to the end, but I just need to get this shit out of my head.  I've been dreading the coming of this weekend, because it marks one year since I last attempted, and then was brought in to the hospital. I stayed in the lockup for four days, and then stayed in the partial hospitalization program for an additional three weeks. It's been a year, but still I feel that I cannot stop thinking about the time that I spent in there. At night when I'm trying to sleep, I try hard to stop, but I can't stop reliving events that happened when I was in the hospital. I was just so incredibly alone and stripped off all my coping mechanisms that I've never been so broken at any point in my life. For four days I was forced to confront my depression every minute of every day, and the experience was just horrifying for me. I hadn't hurt myself for years before the hospital, but I started again just to be able to cope with being so completely alone.  I remember every sight, smell, every person I grew so attached to that I haven't seen since, every breakdown, every room, doctors, nurses, everything.  I remember my best friend entering my room that night and having her friend carry me into their vehicle, throwing up before I got to the car,  being rushed into the ER, but I don't remember what I was thinking or feeling before I attempted due to what I had taken - which is just scary.   I remember the first night I got out, I couldn't sleep no matter what I took. I ended up walking out in the blistering cold at 2:30 in the morning just trying so desperately to do anything to get sleep. I took my friend up on an offer for a place to sleep at about 4am, but when I tried to sleep on his couch, I could literally hear the voice of my best friend as if she was standing over me - I heard her asking me why I did this, why I was doing this to myself.   When I went in to the hospital, it brought an abrupt stop to college that I still haven't recovered from. I was able to fix one grade, but I still have two F's and one C- on my transcript from being in the hospital. This fall is my second semester ever (I took a semester off) and I'm just so absolutely scared that I'm going to repeat my mistakes and never be able to finish college, and that I will never go anywhere with my life.  I lost my job back in July because I was faced with the most horrible anxiety that I've ever felt in my life. I spent so many hours away from my desk locked in the bathroom on the floor losing my mind - completely detached from reality. A lot of it was thanks to the experimental high dosage my medication was increased to - I developed severe paranoia and delusions, thinking everyone at work was out to get me, and I began to hear things that weren't there. A few times I convinced myself falsely that I had forgotten to take my medication, so I took it again, causing me to overdose at work. 600mg of anything is NOT okay. I took so many medications to just get rid of my problem and be able to keep my job, which worked for over a year, but I ended up being in the worst mental and emotional condition of my life.   Over time I counted out something like 8 different medications I've tried to take, starting at some point during my senior year of highschool, but no matter what I took, I had averse reactions. SSRIs caused me multiple different times to give up every stable thing in my life and attempt suicide. Other types of anti-depressants would cause an increase in anxiety. Benzos caused addiction, even after they caused severe memory loss. Thanks to benzos, I have a decently large chunk of my life that is gone, I just can't remember where I was or what I did. The SNRI I was given in the hospital and took for over half a year was the most addicting drug I've ever put in my body, thanks to its lightning fast half-life.  Fast forwarding to last month, I graduated therapy in a way, because my therapist told me that after I got back into college, all of my conditions improved so much. I had taken the free time between losing my job and starting college to come off of all of my horrible medications, which was the worst withdrawal experience of my life. I was just so happy to be back and I finally felt that I was making something out of my life, and I was doing it without having to give credit to any drug.   Fast forward to today, I'm completely horrified of falling back into my footsteps of last year and wasting a whole 'nother year of my life by fucking up school. I can feel the depression coming back, and for almost no reason I just have the urge to end my life. I'm broke. I can't make rent, and as of today my bank account is into the negative. I'm applying various places, but I'm so afraid of falling back into the state of severe anxiety. I haven't paid tuition all semester, and I'm afraid that because of this I won't be able to take classes next semester.   A few months ago, my parents left me, and shortly after that, my best friend - my one and only rock, moved across the country as well. I had been moved out of my parents house for over half a year at that point, and hadn't bothered to go back and spend any time with them until my dog began to pass away. This was due to a lot of relationship problems between me and them - I had a really shitty childhood and teenage years in that house, with a lot of experiences of verbal abuse, neglect, and a couple instances of physical abuse. I didn't expect them to stay around the state just to be ignored by me anyway, but I am still just upset that while everyone I know is still living with their parents and fully supported by them, mine are across the country and I'm all on my own. Tomorrow, my father is having surgery, and I'm horrified of the idea of possibly losing him before I have the chance to amend the problems we've had over the years.   I just don't know what to do. As soon as I saw the test results from my therapist showing that I had improved, I KNEW things wouldn't stay that way, that I'd just fall down in this hole again and struggle to get out. I didn't really even acknowledge the improvement. I just don't want to be alone at night, get drunk and try to commit again. I'm so scared of going back to the hospital, and I'm so scared of fucking up my grades. I'm so scared that this is the end.  I don't want to follow the path that my friends have. The first friend I ever had as a child committed suicide, less than a year after a close friend of mine was taken over by his disease and committed suicide as well. I know damn well what it does to a family, friends, and a community, but I just can't shake this horrible low I'm feeling. No one around me seems to give a fuck about me anymore, because no matter who I contact to hang out I'm still left sitting alone at home with my thoughts. I feel like I've been surrounded by death and so many horrible relationships.  I don't know what to do to get this shit out of my head. I just want to get through this semester, and return next semester, and keep my life on track. I just want money. I want to be emotionally stable, and I want the full motivation to get there.       **TL;DR AT BOTTOM**  On 10/28, I placed an order for an EHPRO Veritas from [Eciggity](http://www.eciggity.com). On 11/1, when I received my Veritas, I discovered that there was moisture inside the plastic packaging it was in, and that the Veritas was [covered in rust](http://imgur.com/a/UAb9N), [as shown in this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2kzt7q/what_do_you_do_when_you_unbox_your_vape_and_its/) which did not name the vendor.   I sent the following message to Eciggity at 8:31am (Hawaii Time, where they are located) on Saturday, 11/1: Hi, I just received my EHPRO Veritas today, order #30021, and the whole RDA has rust on it. This IMGUR link is an album containing four pictures of the rust: http://imgur.com/a/UAb9N . This is a first for me, because I've never gotten a vape product this bad before. I would like to return this product.   At 11:35 Hawaii Time on the same day, I received an email from Eciggity with a pre-paid return label, and another email stating:  Hello test_subject5880, we apologize about that. Please check your e-mail for your return label and send us back your Veritas clone by EHPRO as soon as possible with a brief note of what is wrong with it. We will send you a replacement once we receive confirmation that you have sent it back to us so please let us know when you do so.   Wednesday Morning, 11/5, I dropped off the Veritas at the post office and at that time Eciggity immediately sent out a new Veritas to me.   When I unboxed the new Veritas, [it was just as rusty as the one I had first received and sent back to them.](http://imgur.com/a/IdXGb)  The Veritas is contained in a sealed clear plastic bag inside of a paper box. You cannot see from the outside of the bag that there is rust on the RDA, however, after having sent back a Veritas full of rust, I would have expected them to break open the bag and check the RDA. After having seen the EHPRO Veritas, I would be able to distinct it from a Tobeco Veritas, and would not fall victim to them swapping out the product, so why not open the bag? Had it not been in a bag at all and the rust was in more of plain sight, I would have been mad that they weren't checking the products they were sending out to their customers, and would've asked for a refund and purchased from another vendor. Because the rust wasn't in plain sight, I worded my reply email in this way, on Saturday Nov. 8th, 11:58 Hawaii time:  Eciggity,  I contacted you on 11/1 when I got my EHPRO Veritas in the mail, order #30021 (https://eciggity.zendesk.com/requests/30021), saying that it was shipped full of rust. You processed the return and we exchanged the Veritas, but the replacement I just received today is STILL wet inside the plastic packaging, and full of rust under the top cap. Please take a look at the images and see that it is, in fact, the product I received today, and that it is not usable: http://imgur.com/a/IdXGb  I would appreciate it if you could determine whether or not every EHPRO Veritas you guys have is full of rust, and if so I will want a full refund. If you can find a product that is rust-free, Im willing to try one more exchange.   Although I received an email after I contacted them last Saturday, they did not contact me back. I was expecting a reply on Monday, however all of Monday went by and I received nothing. On Tuesday, I received this email:  Hi test_subject5880,  We apologize for this mishap once again and are unsure of why this has been happened. We will send you another Veritas for exchange. Please use the return label to ship that one back and we will send you another one. This time we will check the product before sending it out, so the product will have already been opened upon arrival. Please include a note indicating reason for return.  Thank you.   After sending the second Veritas back to Eciggity today, Wednesday, I received the following email from a different rep.   Hello test_subject5880, we have received your return for the first Veritas clone by EHPRO that had rust/machine oil built up on the inside of the atomizer. We noticed that the RDA has been used after being cleaned with no rust/machine oil residue traces at all. Our return/exchange policy clearly states that the item being returned/exchanged must be in unused condition to be eligible for any type of return/exchange. However, we went ahead and sent you a replacement Veritas clone by EHPRO anyways assuming that you did not use the RDA due to the rust/machine oil build up inside of it. This is going against our policy and we would like to know if you cleaned and have been using the second replacement Veritas clone by EHPRO we sent you.   Absolutely enraged, and feeling that they were trying to use semantics to screw me out of my money, but holding back, I responded:  I did not clean or alter the second RDA in any way. All of the components in the box remained in their plastic packaging except for the RDA itself. I removed the top cap, saw rust, and I immediately repackaged the RDA. When it arrives at your shop, it will be in the same condition as I received it in.  .  Thank you for letting us know. We will be waiting for your return.   .  Will I be receiving a replacement product?   .  We are currently out of Veritas Clones by EHPRO, but we are expecting to receive more some time next week. We can send you a replacement once we receive them.   .  That is absolutely NOT okay. I ordered my Veritas on 10/28 and I still have yet to receive a clean product.  In response to your comment about your return policy, Yes, I did attempt to clean the first EHPRO Veritas, however there absolutely was still rust under the deck's O-Rings that no elbow grease could get out. You can also see, at the bottom of the box, the original O-rings for the RDA, which still have rust on them: http://i.imgur.com/fWlV2qs.jpg . While the RDA was cleaned, I still supplied picture evidence in my first message that the product had rust on it, before cleaning it. I know this wasn't my determination to make, as shown by your return policy, but I don't believe that first product or the second RDA I received could be rightfully sold to any consumer no matter how much rust was scraped off of it. If you want to get into the details, the description for the RDA also clearly states that it is "made of all stainless steel." As a consumer, I should be able to expect that stainless steel will arrive to me free of rust. I will absolutely not wait until next week to have you ship out a product to me that could still be full of rust. I did not receive a working product and I deserve a full refund.   .  Your card has been refunded the amount of $19.79 ($21.99 with the 10% discount) as we see that your return is on its way back to us. You should expect to see the refund back to your card in about 3-5 business days.   This is absolutely the most frustrating experience I've had with any vendor. **The purpose of this post is not** to convince people to stop using Eciggity as a vendor. This is to document a super-shitty customer experience. I think it is important to document this because, while all companies make mistakes, and this one happened to make about 5, if we start to see another bad experience with the vendor, and then another, we can start to determine as a group that maybe the vendor is not reliable.  ###TL;DR  I got a rusty Veritas from Eciggity. They paid for return   second shipping. I sent it back, got another rusty Veritas. I had no response for a couple days. I received another paid shipping label and a promise that they'd check the product this time. After I shipped the second Veritas, I received a rude email from the company saying that I violated the return policy. When asked if I would still receive a replacement, they told me they were fresh out, and I had to wait a week.      I've had this friend since my Sophomore year of high school, and I feel differently about her than I've ever felt for any one person in my life.   She is the only shoulder I've ever had to cry on, and the only person I've ever really been able to always confide in. I have trust issues due to a lot of really bad relationships and losing two of my friends to suicide - I just really don't know who is going to stick around anymore. However, she always has. Whenever I've been at my absolute worst in life, she has always been there to help pick me up. Back in the days of highschool, when I was still living with my parents, when fights would break out in the family, she would ALWAYS show up just to help me escape from the situation. There have been multiple occasions where I've driven to her house and just broke into tears, and she'd be there at any time of night to hold me and calm me down.   Last year, right before the end of the college semester, things got horribly rough. On a bad night, she came into my room with a friend to carry me to the car and into the ER, and comforted me through the process of being admitted to the behavioral medicine inpatient ward, and she was the first to come and visit.  Now, approximately a year after that experience, she left tonight - moving across the country. I just don't know what to do, because I feel a whole new level of insecurity knowing that if I fall down again, she isn't going to be able to be there. My three weeks in the hospital made me such more of an independent person, but I still **need** that one person in my life to confide in. My parents aren't around anymore, and I don't have family, and while I have other friends, there is just such a level of understanding that is missing, as well as trust that I'm not ready to give.  I just don't know what to do. I was just told by my therapist a couple weeks ago that I made such drastic improvements that I don't have to come to therapy anymore, but I still feel as if I'm falling back into that hole. I'm so scared that I'm going to end up in the hospital again and screw up college again because of it. I would feel like a failure if I wasn't able to complete a semester of college.  What do I do? How do I handle this? My other half is gone and moved on, and I'm so scared.   Nicotine Replacement Therapies(NRT's) are products such as nicotine patches, gums, nasal sprays, inhalers, and lozenges.  This is how the FDA defines a tobacco product:  The term "tobacco product" means any product made or derived from tobacco that is intended for human consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a tobacco product. This includes, among other products, cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless tobacco.  It is my understanding that the nicotine in NRTs is extracted from tobacco plants.  However, I cannot find any information that suggests NRTs are tobacco products.  Electronic Cigarettes contain nicotine extracted from tobacco plants, and by this definition, however, are tobacco products.  What is the difference?  ###**TL;DR Does anyone know, preferably with a source included, whether or not NRTs are tobacco products?**   Hello again, all!  My first essay posting went way better than expected - [it reached the top three postings on the front page!](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2gq8w4/i_wrote_an_essay_against_rjreynolds_119page/)  I'm now asking for some help finding a topic for my third paper. The paper will be in the format of an "extended definition." **This will take a closer look at defining a term that is ambiguous.**  The paper asks for a closer look at a word, term, phrase, or idea relative to personal vaporizers/electronic cigarettes/vaping that is important for a reader to understand well in order to understand why I support vaping.  **TL;DR**: What is a word relative to vaping that can have more than one meaning, that I could spend a paper prying open the definition for?  **THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH!**      Hi all!  [Here is the essay I've just finished!](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wq0wrgLyXIkcJ7kXr_DkU4oVPWRZ7Ip1WgtxBCn2-Gw/edit?usp=sharing) It is only 5 pages double spaced, so a light read.  It is in reply to [this article.](http://www.journalnow.com/business/business_news/local/big-tobacco-makers-want-fda-to-ban-vapor-e-cigs/article_77b131f5-540d-5f02-927c-733bac751529.html)  A similar article is also featured in [this reddit post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2ftb1k/rj_reynolds_sends_119page_submission_to_fda/)  I used YOUR guys' and gals' feedback to help construct part of my essay that I was unsure of how to write! Thank you, [the thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2gii7h/has_anyone_ever_seen_a_bottle_of_eliquid_that_is/) went incredibly well! Much love!  I am going to turn this in for credit to my college english class tomorrow, so if anyone would like to read through it and recommend any changes, I would very, VERY much appreciate it!  If not, feel free to read, this is also here for informational purposes!   ^*Edit: ^"recommend ^and ^changes" ^to ^"recommend ^any ^changes"      Hi all,  I'm writing an essay to counter-act parts of RJ Reynold's 119-page submission for banning electronic cigarettes.  RJ Reynold's says, These systems are highly subject to adulteration and tampering, they are manufactured largely overseas in facilities that would, as proposed, fall outside regulatory inspection and oversight, **and many nicotine liquids are sold in non-child-resistant packaging** in flavors that may be appealing to youth.  However, I've never seen a bottle of e-liquid that does not have a childproof cap.   Hi all!  I've read bunches of studies on the safety of the four ingredients in e-liquid, but a close friend of mine who I just set up with a starter kit brought a point to my attention that I had never before considered.  I absolutely love menthol flavors, always have. I always remember hearing, however, that menthol cigarettes can cause the crystallization of menthol in the lungs, so while I treated myself to the occasional menthol pack, I always stayed away from camel crush and other super-menthols.  Is this the same with vaping, or even true at all? I believe that the FDA acknowledges menthol mist as safe in throat sprays, and that it's obviously safe to ingest with it being in so many pain relief lozenges, but has anyone seen studies relative to vaping menthol over longer periods of time than one would use a throat spray for? Can this cause harm?   Any knowledge sharing is much appreciated, and I'd very much appreciate to be pointed in the direction of any studies or experiments that people are aware of.   Hello again, all!  While rebuilding my Fogger v4, I've managed to lose two of the screws for the positive and negative posts. Luckily, the Fogger itself came with two extra screws, but should I lose these (I will), I'd like to have a backup so I do not have to punch holes through walls and shake babies.  It was hard enough for me to find replacement glass when I broke mine, and I'm having no luck in finding these tiny little screws. Would anyone care to please help me in my search, and save the lives of children everywhere?   Hi again, all!  I'm absolutely in love with my Fogger, but I need some out of the ordinary builds to happen. I'm bored.  The problem is, I don't know how to build a quad coil setup with only two posts. [Here is my last attempt.](http://imgur.com/a/c8WDJ)  The point where the wires cross over in the dead middle of the deck... literally exploded. I measured the resistance and all seemed perfectly well, but when I loaded 'er up onto my Panzer... Boom - the legs glowed white and burst at the contact points.  How do I build a quad coil setup with two posts?   Hi, all. Post here if you are an interested seller, and we can PM about the pricing!     Is this legal to do?  http://imgur.com/a/euyuP  http://www.mtbakervapor.com/nicotine-juice/rainbow-roundies-e-juice-baker-vapor/  Tagging /u/MtBakerVapor ; Advise if necessary.   I've seen a couple people's juice orders bounce back and forth around here. I was just hoping it wouldn't happen to me.  http://i.imgur.com/yJlsk5v.png   http://imgur.com/a/rHjH4  What would cause this to happen to our TV, and what would the process be like for fixing this issue?  Thank you for any input.      I'm sorry to hear that. [I did as well.](http://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt206/DrewbtheNewb/Vaping/IMAG0503_zpspvvgiglj.jpg) I searched around on the internet for a replacement only to find that a great amount of vendors are sold out. I did however find two replacement tanks for the Fogger v4 at http://froginfog.com/.  A new glass tank is currently $5.95, while they also sell a metal tank for $8.70. I placed my order for both items on Friday - 6/27/2014, and they arrived at my door on Monday, 7/7/14 (Keep in mind there was a holiday weekend). FrogInFog does offer free shipping. Because I was in a rush, I did request expedited shipping (Domestic Expedited Registered Mail (USPS, UK Royal, Australia Post, etc)) for $4.28.  I was worried that the tanks would be the incorrect dimensions, but I made this post just to reassure buyers that both tanks DO fit and match the original tank exactly.  Here is an image of [all three tanks.](http://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt206/DrewbtheNewb/Vaping/IMAG0502_zpsxpp2llcp.jpg)  The original is leftmost, the FrogInFog replacement glass in the center, and the FrogInFog replacement metal tank on the right.  I was also amazed that the metal tank fits flawlessly. [Here is an image.](http://i612.photobucket.com/albums/tt206/DrewbtheNewb/Vaping/IMAG0500_zpscgh9eqw3.jpg)  That's all for today, folks! If you have cracked your glass, there is still hope!   I had a new vaper come over to my place tonight so I could show him how to rebuild and run him through all the basics. He hopped right into a hybrid Spyrax mod, so needless to say there were a lot of things to run through.  After building with my usual supplies and his juice, we vaped. In the first exhale I took, I could taste something like rubbing alcohol fumes, and I could feel it in my nose. He bought his juice from a new local shop, and it was a 15ml bottle of ~~Mount Baker Vapors Rainbow Roundies~~ (SEE EDIT).  Is this anything to worry about?  EDIT!: The Local vape shop created a label that looks exactly like MBV's labels, but it is instead for their own produced juice, called "Rainbow Candies." I am now concerned that the juice is diluted or dangerous.   Every tank I have used so far has had flooding issues. My hands are always sticky, my new Panzer is always sticky, puddles leak out in my pocket and I don't notice until I'm too nicotine buzzed to understand what is going on. My EVOD leaked, my Aerotank leaked, and right now my Fogger V4 is leaking horribly, and I'm just more than put up with it.  The Fogger v4 is an amazing device. It really throws clouds, it was built well, has amazing airflow, and I love it. I just can't get any of my builds to not leak or have bad dry hits. I use organic cotton, and I have tried more cotton, less cotton, cutting all my wicks at 45 degree angles, inserting them into the juice channels and keeping them out of the juice channels, and I just cannot seem to figure it out and master this art.  ###What I'm looking for  is for my much loved fellow brother and sister ECR members to advise me of any device that will never flood, or they have at least had extremely minimal floods on. At this point, my next purchase will be anything that is guaranteed to not flood out of the air holes.  I'm also looking for any tips for RBA building, whether they are on the Fogger V4 or not, that would help me minimize my flooding issues and still be able to chain-vape (or at least take long draws) with no dry hits.  Please advise, I am very frustrated.   In my time on ECR, I have seen a lot of people with problems relative to their Kanger Aerotanks. I bought the Kanger Aerotank in January of this year shortly after it was released. It is in my opinion the most frustrating and horribly designed piece of metal I have ever bought.   The culprit of the issue is the [three piece airflow base for the Aerotank](http://imgur.com/a/R00zT). It is not made of the same stainless steel, it is instead a cheaper, bendable metal. The three pieces are as follows: The rotating airflow control ring, and the two metal pieces that hold it - one of which screws into the tank, one which holds the floating terminal and screws onto the battery.  The two bendable metal pieces which contain the rotating airflow do not have threads to hold them together. They are instead pressed together. The problem this causes is the slow but constant gap that forms between these two pieces - which causes the coil terminal to be unable to contact the battery terminal.  If you are really confused as to why your Aerotank is not vaping, and you keep throwing new coils into the tank, and keep screwing it onto different batteries, this is why this is happening.   Along with the fact that the Kangertech dual coil designs flood like hurricanes without rewicking, in my time of owning the Aerotank and it being my only upgrade tank back then, I spent 75% of my time trying to get my Aerotank to work and 25% of the time getting as good of a vape as I did on my EVOD. It came to the point where I had to press down on my tank and get it to bend just at the right angle every drag in order to be able to vape out of it. When that didn't work (it commonly didn't), I had to take apart the tank completely and press the coil towards the battery in order to get it to contact for a good 15 minutes. While vaping and driving, whenever I shifted with the tank in my hand, the tank flew across the car, and the airflow control ring went missing.  I have since then given up on the Aerotank and I'm not even able to use it as a backup tank, but I really want to get this out there so people don't have to have the same struggles as I did. Kanger has a great product line, and the EVOD is the best way to start vaping, but if you are going to go Aerotank, at least try the Aerotank Megas.   I'm trying to get the max potential I possibly can out of my MVP 2.0 and my Fogger v4. The problem is that while rebuilding dual coils on any device with the MVP, is that they heat up HORRIBLY slow - my 10 second limiter kicks in right when they finally get heated.  When talking about the best resistance range for the MVP due to the limits it has, /u/Fortinbraz said  anywhere between 1.2 (where you would hit the device's amp limit) and 2.3 (where you would hit the devices voltage limit), you are good to go up to 11W.  The problem is that when I get even close to dual coils at 1.2 ohms with 30 gauge kanthal, I'm running two coils with 2.4 ohms resistance and they heat horribly slow.  What is the highest power build I can run on my MVP 2.0?   I just got the Fogger V4 in today! I built a couple of coils, and now I'm just trying to figure out how to secure them to the posts. This is my first official RBA build, although I've been rebuilding non-stop for the Kanger Aerotank for some weeks now.  I'm looking for any easy way or tips as to how to get these coils secured to the two posts! Thank you!   I wanted to buy the version from [Eciggity](http://www.eciggity.com/fogger-v4/), but to me they appear to be sold out?  I understand that there are three different versions of the Fogger V4, and I'm looking for the latest. Where is the best place to find this? Can I purchase an authentic or are they all clones?   http://imgur.com/pE6aEmr  I spilled a few drops of Mountain Dew in my eye yesterday, and it burned like hell, but I was able to wick it away with my t-shirt. It didn't hurt too much until last night while I was drinking, lights became quite a bit of an eyesore. In the shower this morning it felt like I had an eyelash sticking into my eye, so I twisted my eyelashes in a towel and everything felt fine. Now it's just sore as all hell, and I pulled my eyelid back just to investigate, and I was like OMFG what the hell is that. Any assistance on this topic would be greatly appreciated.       Age - 20     Sex - M     Location USA     Current medications:     Venlafaxine 150mg Extended Release     Trazodone 25mg    I've been recently rebuilding my Kanger Aerotank coils, and I'm looking to move to the next step with my MVP 2.  I've been lurking for quite some time, and I see that the Kayfun is highly recommended for starting rebuilding. It is also made obvious that I want to go the route of purchasing a clone of the Kayfun. I have my eyes on the following by ehpro: http://101vape.com/rebuildable-atomizers-tanks/295-kayfun-lite-plus-clone-v2-by-ehpro.html  I have seen that the top recommended Kayfun clone is by tobeco, however?  OVERALL, I'd really appreciate some guidance as to what and where I should purchase to get into the art of rebuilding and achieve a heavy vape. Thank you, ECR3   I've made this mistake about four or five times now.  I go into the work bathroom to clean a flood out of my vape, or I'm simply near/on the toilet vaping and I take apart my vape to add e-liquid, when my whole world comes to an end. I drop one of the four items I am juggling, and I hear a horid splash followed by a solid CLINK. A piece of my vape has now entered the toilet realm.  I try and I try again to not let pieces of my vaporizers fall into the toilet. I even took everything apart in a cabinet in the stall not above the toilet, but that wasn't enough. I knocked over my tank, it bounced off the floor twice, and committed suic1de with the help of some angry devilish force giving it enough inertia to fling itself into the toilet.  The worst is when this happens in the morning at work, and I absolutely know I will be fucked for the rest of the day.  Does this happen to anyone else? Why does this have to happen to anyone to begin with. What a cruel, cruel world we live in.      I've been vaping for about 7 and a half months. Moreso recently, juices have been really making it hard to breathe, and even harder to enjoy vaping. My nose isn't congested, it's just impossible to breathe through, and my airway in my throat tightens a bit at times. A 50/50 and 60/40 blend both cause the problems equally. These juices are both created by Vape Dojo. I bought juices elsewhere, and the problem seems to be a lot easier to deal with, but it's still there. I've heard about PG intolerance, but I don't know if this is a regular symptom of that or not. The main culprit is a juice called Zen Juice (fruity menthol), which was my first juice ever and I used to LOVE it, but now I can't vape it. Wtf?   I'm looking to automate the creation of sticker labels that will be on the bottom of files. This link is a prototype created in photoshop. http://i.imgur.com/kMlrNEY.png  These labels are 8" long and 1 7/16(1.438)" high, and will fold in half over the bottom of the file. On the left in separate images are the first three letters of the last name (I have created a library of letter images using photoshop). These letters are 3/4" wide. On the right is another imported photo, the type of file (1/2" wide). I will create a library of these images as well.  I have created a class in java that uses GUI to solicit data from the user (Prefix, First name, last name, Suffix, Account number, loan type).  What would be the best way to automate the creation of these labels using the user-inputted data? I will then need to print these created images using a regular color printer on label paper (I'm not too worried about the printing process). This project is time sensitive, so I very very much appreciate any help! Thank you  much love!     	104
 I do. I was commenting on the fact that most people seem to not like how their characters were being handled, this season, as opposed to the last two. To me, they seemed to come out on top a lot, the last two seasons. My apologies, I should have been more clear.     Yeah, I didn't care too much for that subplot, either. But I was surprised by the ending of it, though.    Man, I really dislike all of the hate Claire is getting, this season, too. I really don't think it's hard for people to change, like Claire has been doing. She was ruthless the first two seasons, but not a psychopath like Frank. Which is why I think the writers has been showing more of her humanity, this season, despite how many mishaps she's been having. People make mistakes. I don't think she  has what it took to be an ambassador( which was clear, throughout the season) and she obviously knew that. All the pressure just got to her, you know? If any of you were in her situation, the same would happen to you.  Besides, I think it's incredibly bad writing to just have the main characters come out on top, all of the time. That gets boring. A great example of this is the character Superman. He's completely overpowered. Yes, he has kryptonite to slow him down, but he's a very boring character because he's practically unstoppable. So, I think it's great that Claire and Francis hasn't been succeeding, this entire season. Otherwise it would just get predictable.    Oh my gosh. I did not know that was a thing. Thank you!!    Oh, and Robin Wright. I've never seen her in anything before HoC, so I was taken by surprise of her acting ability and how gorgeous that woman is. Good Lord.    Pretty neat, show.  Well, that's an understatement.  It's a gorgeous looking show; well written and well acted. I see in the title credits that David Fincher is an executive producer. Makes sense. His movies seem to have somewhat of the same aesthetic as this show. Meaning, his movie and the show seem to have the same color pallet. The mutes blues, yellows and oranges, which I love. This show is gorgeously lit. I'm not sure if Fincher has some of his film crew working on the show or not, but I feel like I'm watching a Fincher movie, with every episode.  I know it's too late in the game for this, seeing as the show has established a feel, but I would honestly love for Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross to score the show. Their work for Gone Girl is my favorite body of work.  House of Cards is good television.   	6
 How the hell, first i tried easy stuff like Soul Eater and Deadman Wonderland, but even Shaman King. Woah amazing and creepy at same time :D   yeah that one about Empire was hard lesson for me. I started betting with about 5 value and made it up to my first arcana and then Empire vs Denial came. RIP arcana :(   I ve began watching anime cuz of amv - Soul Eater - Becoming Insane    Well most people who talk about Boku no Pico probably never heard of Bondage Game: Shinsou no Reijoutachi - this one is really,ehhhh....well its probably only one of its kind to say at least.    Well it wasnt really cancelled but i think Soul Eater would really deserve the ending it got in manga and not that city fighting bullshit.   yeah you totaly have to read the manga after the anime coz when the anime is rushed to end manga s just begging   Well i would probably say Soul Eater  or Noragami  also Black Bullet (curently airing)   Thanks for so long and insightful answer. So first about Akira - i watched and i liked it even trough it was kinda mindfuck. FLCL - i ve seen like 3 ep and i was like WTF?! im planning to watch more but i cant force myself to DTB - amazing one, just watchin it Samurai Champloo is on the list same goes for Baccano. I know i will have to watch Cowboy Bebop and Trigun at some point :) and for the Hunter x Hunter im gonna give it another shot - i watched few first episodes and it just didnt pull me in, but maybe i just wasnt far enough. Guess im gonna try the Black Lagoon then go for Samurai Champloo and as for manga i will give a Berserk a shot.   God bless you i tried to do it but i didnt know how :) (new to this whole reddit thing :))     	10
 Thank you. I'm supposed to take the Oxazepam everyday for three to four days and then when I feel like I need to.    We have two small children (1 and 3 yo). The older one have been sick for some weeks so last weekend they slept at my husbands parents house so that we could catch up on our sleep. Other then that I can't remember us going on a date for some time. This saturday we are invited to a party for my brother-in-law. Maybe we can leave the kids to their grandparents a little early and go out for dinner before the party.   My husband is home on parental leave with our youngest now. Maybe that sounds strange but in Sweden where we live it's normal. I have been thinking about going away to visit a friend but it feels like I'm trying to run away from my problems if I do that.    I hope I will be able to feel like this some day. Right now I have trouble seeing a future at all. How are you supposed to live if you can't handle being alive? I just don't understand how people do it.   I work out occasionally. We actually have a gym in our home. But I just don't feel like even getting started because I know that I will fail again. Sorry for the pessimistic answer. :/   Thank you. It really helps to hear this from someone who has been through this. I can really relate to apologizing. I just want tell everybody how sorry I am for being such a disappointment.    I took my first pill this morning (it's called Citalopram, maybe the name is different in different countries). They told me that the anxiety gets worse in the beginning so I also take pills called Sobril or Oxascand (I think the name in english is Oxazepam maybe). The anxiety was worse before I took them but now I just feel kind of empty. Like I'm not able to feel or think at all. I guess that means it's doing what it's supposed to?   	5
 I can see why haha For me, any kind of tile is awesome to look at. Plus movie theater carpets. The ones in AMC with the stars and planets and shit!   That's the thing about it, always hard to meet new people! But hopefully I can connect more with this subreddit. It'd be way cooler to have a meeting of the minds or something and just trip out and share experiences though haha   Yes! I'm a heavy gamer too and I have very different tastes when it comes to me and my friends. Gaming and tripping go together like PB   J for me and when nobody else is enjoying it it's like "Ugghhh really?". I completely agree with the 60's culture thing. I think I've gotten a much better understanding of the whole mindset of that culture and it's really great. I might even go as far as saying I'm turning into a little bit of a hippie myself haha Also taking into account that Death Metal is scary for me to listen to when I'm tripping and that's a lot of what I enjoy sober D:   Yeah that's another reason why I'm really liking this subreddit. Lots of like minded people here, I've seen plenty of titles that look like they've just been extracted from my mind written by trippers. In regard to babysitting them, yeah, old real quick. It's a waste of a trip sometimes and I value that time since I never know when I can experience it again. Solo tripping is fantastic but at the same time I want to tell people my thoughts haha It's a cruel irony, it's the one time I like telling people what I think.   Ahh the first time. Everything is a wonderful surprise.   Chance The Rapper (I recommend Windows or Smoke Again). Kendrick Lamar, of course. Some Earl Sweatshirt is nice too.   http://imgur.com/i9oUC2a  There you go, man. Highest resolution there is ;D   "I take this pharmaceutical and that anti-depressant and also I have a disorder, so how much should I take?"   ^This   DUDE, I was heading into the theater with my ex when this came out. I had four tabs in my pocket... This chick... said "No, not in public."  As soon as the opening credits rolled, I was like "Yup, I should be tripping."  That's what you get for being whipped I guess...   It's just nature, man. Relax haha I'd recommend going outside instead of being cramped in a room but that's just me. He shouldn't bother you if you don't bother him, he's just chillaxin'.    So I've always been the type of person to keep to myself. Don't talk (usually) unless spoken to, stay in my room alone, etc. Now don't get me wrong; I have plenty of good friends that I love shooting the shit with and we talk plenty. I guess it's a comfort zone thing but I digress. I've tripped with people on plenty of occasions and I've gotten lost on what to say 70% of the time. Throughout my trips, I began realizing how redundant conversation is. A series of words in a specific sequence to only partly convey your thoughts and feelings... Might be one of those things where I'd have to be tripping to explain it better but that's kinda the gist of it. But not only that, sometimes I'll say the wrong things and just look like an ass. Not like, my words are coming out wrong. I mean I'll say something that might come off as rude or not factual. There is no filter on my mouth. It's annoying cause I have to go on a though loop just to make the right conversation with people. Then, I'm a constant worrier. Not to the point where I'm freaking out. I just want to make sure everyone I'm with is okay and happy. But it's too much, every ten minutes I'm worried someone is gonna go into a bad trip because I said something wrong. Well, my friends all have pretty dark pasts and I have too but, not to toot my own horn, I handle it well. I love dark things usually and I can just talk about things like that when tripping and I'll be fine. But when you factor in the "No filter" thing and worrying about people you can see where it's a problem. Now this is the last piece of this loner puzzle: Nobody I know wants to trip like I do. They want to look at goofy pictures and all that crap. Don't get me wrong, I loooove the visuals. But I'm always the only one reaching for something more than my friends. I want to go on a nature walk and look at the starts and talk about trip theories. I want to watch an in depth movie to get a better understanding of it. I want to dissect everything. Sometimes I even want to chill in silence and just think. That's complete happiness for me. This has all lead me to only being able to trip by myself. Nobody shares my interests, they don't want to enjoy the trippy things that I enjoy. It's a bummer but what are your opinions? Any loners out there?   I'm sure there's tons of these posts every day so I'm gonna try as hard as possible to get through this smoothly. I'd like to order SHIT, I only have a Windows 7 desktop right now. I was thinking about purchasing a netbook but I'm weighing the costs on that decision. I looked at the start up guide and I've also read things that say it's a little overkill in terms of safety. I'm ready to learn so if anyone can guide me it'd be extremely appreciated!  -Edited because it was removed for some reason, but yeah.-   You know, I've been curious about that. I'd just be afraid to do something wrong with keeping discreet somehow.   Hotline Miami, definitely. Also, any RTS games!   Always a bummer when some dealer gives you bunk tabs. Had this happen to me the other day. I look very forward to my trips, so getting let down is just blegh. What do you guys do instead when you get beat for tabs?   Dude, I know EXACTLY what you mean with fractals. Sometimes I like to think about the universe as just a bunch of different things bouncing into each other at random. It's so fascinating.   I would absolutely buy this, I love physical copies.  	18
 Thanks, that was really clear and easily understood. The video also helped a lot.      I met him as well. I was really young, 5 or 6 maybe and he was shooting a movie near where I lived so my dad brought me over there and told me  "That's the Genii from Aladdin!!". I, being a 5 year old, immediately ran over to meet him. As I was running over, a van with some sort of film equipment was coming by and was going to hit me. Robin yelled at the same time as my dad for me to stop. Robin Williams saved my life, then afterward, we had a little conversation about watching for cars. Meanwhile, my stupid older brother sat in the car and listened to music.  	3
 that's a good point too particular event or people.   So a connection to some particular event? yeah i can see that, thanks!   Yeah, uniqueness and power level of the game, i guess if everyone has it it become common. that's a good point   When i said no "story" answer i mean a comment that is just literally written "story"  yes stakes and hassle to get it.   Yes, thank you this is what i meant when i asked the question, characteristics that legendary things have  I think a "price" to pay for a legendary weapon is a must.  Also as you said the power level of the campaign matters too that's something to keep in mind too.   To you guys aside from stats what characteristics makes something considered epic or legendary and plz no answer like "story" please give an answer with some dept, if you want to use something you made as example i'm all for it.  As of now the characteristics i got are  Uniqueness  Means and stakes of obtaining it  Background story  The better, the worst, as in it's good but it's power comes at a price.  A connection to a certain event or people   I'm a Mage: the awakening player and alot of people recommend Ars magica to me, me being somewhat tired of Mage listened to some suggestions and Ars magica popped out more than a couple of time as some call it the predecessor to mage.  Are the more conceptual Arcana equivalent such as Fate, Time and so on still there or accessible in some way? or are the mages "weaker" in comparison to Mages from Awakening?  It seems a much more detailed system such as the labs and such which Awakening refuses to put in more detail about alot of things, which i understand but it takes me out of it somewhat.  Also a problem i had with Awakening such that mages seemed too alike magic wise by that i mean you had no reason to be "creative" in most situations and even then it was hard to set mage apart from one another as the player  has almost no way to go about being "creative" i'm having trouble explaining it so i don't except help here.   It looks really sleek, i like colored sheets,dude i would advise making a black and white one and a colored one i fucking love this design! keep it up!   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobilis  I haven't played Nobilis yet (can't find groups accepting people) so i'm reading the core, 3rd ed btw, is the one i'm reading, yh the one with cancerous art...but it's the newest so i went with that, don't know any better  I have general problems understanding the game but the attributes just pin me to the ground how do they work?!  Please explain them to me.   So i have been trying to make a magic system for fate core and this is by no means finished it's just an idea and i'm trying to get the idea of it before the mechanics, here's what i have in mind.  i thought of magic working like the materia from FF7 as in switch them and make them stronger through use, i have taken the habit to go to the super power wiki and taking a look at the powers and checking them out  Let me give you an example let's say the gm gives a player the following Materias:  Fire manipulation.  Then he chooses the applications  Applications would be the uses of the power you start with two of those and with milestones in game you would give the Materia (i'l get to that) access to more application, of course the gm dictates what is "legal" as an application because some of them have applications that could ruin a game.  So the players chooses these as he would choose aspects of sorts:  Create/Generate/increase,shape. (this counts as one, the gm might think otherwise tough)  Flame Solidification.  and he would choose stunts called techniques if he wants for ways to use these powers with greater mastery such as Pyrokinetic Constructs for flame solidification.  that's what i got for this step, it's not very well translated from what i have in mind but it's an approximation  Now i thought this stuff is way too op and it is ,so i decided that using Materia recklessly would make you go insane instead of using a mana sort of thing.  When a player fails to cast a Materia properly he rolls a skill that the gm finds appropriate, the player is encouraged to give suggestions to the gm as in what skill he should roll, to circumvent a disaster.  the gm says what could happen as in what the calamity would be either bad for the caster or for people around him.  Example: The Player with the fire Materia tries to fling a fireball at someone,he rolls, he fails , so the gm says "well, you have a big fireball in your hand and it's about to blow up in your face and burn everyone around you, you lost control of the flames."  The player might suggest "i want to use my WILL to stop the flame from blowing up by concentrating to appease the flames "   The gm agrees, next time this happens he might choose another way the spell could go wrong always withing the powers of the Materia tough. the player rolls he succeeds but what if he had failed? well the player could use a fate point to negate any negative implications or endure the consequences, this might seem way to cruel but with the appearance of more powerful Materias this is a must.  But of course the gm is expected to offer worse implications to botching a power of greater magnitude as in things getting way way worse for having greater power means greater possible destruction.  Botching a spell completely makes everything go bat-shit crazy and that includes you for a while it scales with level of failure.  I have more but what do you guys think as of now?  	10
       I have lived there a year and paid a lot of late fees because my job keeps witholding and fucking with my pay. I couldn't save at all because I was paying sometimes 40 a month extra in late fees because of my job. I have also recieved three 10 day eviction notices. The first was for being 10 days late, the second for seven, the third for 2. I had never missed a payment, only paid late. My landlord recently broke my car window and has done nothing toward paying for it. I only have until 10/15 left in the lease and last rent is due 9/15. The entire length of my tenancy the management company has been shady and rude and I don't believe I will see a dime of ny security despite making no damage. I am not worried about future tenancy as I will be living with my parents for some time from then on and can use them to get a new apartment down the road if need be.   What will happen if I don't pay?                     I'm new here and don't know a whole lot. My girlfriend recently took up MK and I like a lot of the products, but are they actually good for skin? I like microdermabrasion and botanical effects.   What do you guys like and dislike? Our anniversary is coming up, and my girlfriend and I want some new toys. We have been looking at RodeoH for me and Velvetnest for her. Anyone know anything about them or any other preferences?      We have been together just shy of four years. She has PCOS and has yet to find a perfect birth control to treat it. The current one has her extremely nasty and she claims depressed but I don't know.   Last night, I got stuck late at work and therefore late to pick her up. She knows I am working on getting a raise. She called my mother and they each called me several times trying to find me. The exact situation happened a week ago. I told her that she is mauling me and she got pissed at me for worrying her.  She will not get her driver's license, leaving me responsible for transportation of both of us.  My mom is disabled and doesn't socialize much except with me and my girlfriend. My girlfriend often ignores her in favor of reading books despite the fact that my mom has bent over backwards for her. (Buying work uniforms, letting her move in at 17, etc).  I wake up early in the morning for work and she works second shift. I spend free time with my mom as I only get one and her poor health means I need to treasure the time I get. She always complains about being tired and wanting to go home when she gets far more sleep than I.   We used to be very sexual. We would have sex twice a day everyday the whole first summer we were dating. We haven't had sex in a month. I ask and get either maybe or we'll see or I'm tired. I hate being rejected. Mostly I hate when she spends the day trying to grope me and make out with me AT MY MOMS HOUSE and then sleeps when we get home.  We are going away in October for our 4th anniversary. I took a day and a half off work for it already. She has yet to request it. I don't even know if I want to go. We were going to announce our engagement after this trip. I don't know if I want to promise another week never mind the rest of my life.  She promised we wouldn't go to her abusive father's wedding. (He abused us both when we lived with him briefly.) Then she told them we would. Now we aren't because it's the weekend before our anniversary and she can't get two weekends in a row off. She still hasn't told him she isn't going to attend.   I really do love this girl. We have been together since high school. I just don't know where to go from here.  TL;DR girlfriend is being unusually psycho and I don't want to stay but I don't want to leave either.               Theu played hockey with the poor little guy amd cleaned him thoroughly. He was fine. Theu were ashamed. It was very adorable in the end after a horrifying beginning.      My Moxie, who is probably around 2, has had labored breathing and been barely moving since at least 8 this morning. She is hanging on and her cage mate Roxie keeps checking on her. I have accepted that she is likely dying, but is there something I can do to help her?      One who saves you personally.         On /r/parenting, people talk about cosleeping in a positive way. We know cosleeping is dangerous. Babies get rolled on, and babies roll or fall of beds. Having a baby in bed also destroys intimacy in the parents' relationship. It is hard to get a kid to stay out of your bed anyway. If you let them for a long time then stop them, it'll be thay much harder later, further destroying intimacy. Basinets are not a huge inconvenience. Keep it by your bed to make feeding easy. They are small enough that they fit nearly anywhere. There are also basinets that get attached to the bed. Cosleeping should always be discouraged and absolutely never encouraged. CMV.         On October 10th we will be together for four years. Their wedding is October 4th.   They got married already and are now having a big wedding. They waited two months before accidentally telling my partner that they got married.   They have out right stated that they dislike me and that our relationship is invalid. We aren't sure if it is because I am female or if it is personal.  It is a semi themed wedding. My partner is to dress for the theme while I am not.  Despite the fact that we have been together two years longer than them, our invitation was addressed to my partner and guest. They know my name.  Are we being petty or is this just icing on the rude cake that is her parents?    ---    **tl;dr**: Father in laws. Girlfriend wouldn't exist without him, and he won't go away.                You guys are really turned on by WBC.      I am overweight, hefty, whatever you prefer. I got an exercise trampoline to help change that. After having been swimming a lot lately and generally eating better, I decided to jump on it today, not for the first time. I jumped twice and metal flew from the side and scared the hell out of my cats.   TL DR too fat to work out, not fat enough to be confined to a bed.  Edit: Thank you all so much for being encouraging! I start my next semester of college on August 25th and since we have a new campus, I get access to a great gym facility that I plan to use. I'm going to keep at it and maybe be able to show you guys some before and after in a few months.             Half a case of Lager in my fridge and I can't stand the taste.         Ask whatever.   I work for an agency to transport a developmentally delayed man to and from work and to take him to activities. Currently, my car is unsafe due to the lack of these parts. My brother and father are willing to install the parts, I just can't afford them right now. I am on food stamps and extremely hard up.

The reason for not wanting them to be there in the first place is people who choose to expose their non female genitals in what is supposed to be a female space. Take Mich Fest for example. Many women there are victims of violent sexual assault. They are choosing to be in a space they feel is safer. As a women only space they should not have to worry about seeing male genitals. Pre op stealth women would not want to be outed and so would be extremely unlikely to even accidentally expose themselves. Post op transwomen have no.male genitals to show. In order to keep people more comfortable, a female space should be just that. People who are male do not belong their if they risk hurting female women even emotionally.   Disclaimer: I am not debating whether or not trans women are women. They without a doubt are regardless of stage of transition. The issue is whether or not out transwomen who are pre op or non op belong in a space meant for females to feel safe.   TL DR a penis free zone is a penis free zone. Cmv.

What would you guys be interested to see in a youtube vlogging channel from me? If you post specific questions, I will answer them in the video.         Hosted my brother's graduation party last night. My uncle in his 60s buys a case of lager to split between him, my other uncle, and my cousin. They only get through half so he leaves instructing my older brother to inform me that it's mine and to put it in the fridge. I don't like beer from my limited Rolling Rock experience and I don't have friends to drink with.   There is a reason you aren't legally allowed in Central Park after dark. If you choose to go in anyway and are raped/mugged/attacked/murdered, you knew the risk of going into the Park.  We all know that date rapes happen. If you leave your drink completely unattended and then choose to drink from it again, you are partially responsible as you are the one who chose to put something rather unknown into your body.  Bullies currently heavily target out gay kids. If you "pass" for straight and choose to be out in school, in part, you brought on the harassment. You knew the risks.  I know that breaking the law doesn't give others a right to harm you nor does making any other potentially poor choice, but if you know the risks and follow through anyway, you aren't totally innocent.   TL;DR: choices have consequences. CMV.                  Has anyone done this before? I've never even been to the city. Any advice you could offer would be great.      I have been with my girlfriend and out as a lesbian for almost four years. A friend of ours invited us (well actually she told us we were going not asked) to a picnic with her family this weekend. We were happy to go until she informed me and my girlfriend we can "be out just don't hug or kiss or touch and don't act like you are dating". She askef my gf if she is okay wiyh it and my gf is a bit of pushover and was like oh yeah sure. However I am pissed. I went through a shit ton of crap for the right to be out. Like I had food thrown at me and was slammed into lockers and walls and just about pushed down the damn stairs. This girl knows all of this and yet she had basically told me to hide it. I cannot believe it. I have been nothing but supportive of her (she is a lesbian) and my girlfriend and I know how to behave. But for us to not be allowed to hold hands or anything is insulting. Now we are stuck going to this picnic and I don't know what to do. Am I overreacting? Should I still go?  TL DR: been out for 4 years. Friend wants my gf and me to hide us being a couple and gay for a picnic. Advice?   I work split shift for between five and eight hours Tuesday through Friday and tutor a kid when it fits with my work schedule. My partner works around 15 hours a week at a restaurant on weekends with extra shifts sprinkled in. Since the semester is over, we have a lot more free time. I desire to get things done. We need to be finding ways to make more money so we can get out of our really shitty financial situation (a near eviction, no car insurance, power over 1000 dollars late and due to be shut off, no food, etc.). I work from 8 to 830 every morning. She usually comes with me. Lately, she has been either staying in bed, or, like right now, going back to bed. She went to bed at about 1 this morning so it isn't like she should be exhausted. She knows I don't want to mess up my extremely sensitive sleep schedule. She insists I lay in bed next to her until she gets up at some point between 10 and 11. She gets mad at me if I go to the bathroom. I really love her and want to marry this girl. I just hate spending my days in bed not even asleep. I either read or go on reddit and facebook all morning.  TL;DR: Life ain't nothin but sleeping girls and no money.                              In Cultural Anthropology just now, I was reading the AskReddit thread about kids' lies. I laughed, audibly, at one of the stories. Incidentally, I laughed just after my teacher was talking about slaves. Now my class thinks I find slavery funny.                        Can provide a spare bed in my living room. Lesbian couple, ages 19 and 20, pm me if needed.   There is a person in one of my classes that is a transwoman, however, at least in that class, she is not out. I know she is trans in part because of her presentation and in part because I was told such by a mutual friend when I asked. I only asked because she is very feminine and is referred to by other classmates with male pronouns. We have only interacted once and I avoided pronouns. What should I use?   If it pertains, I live in Monroe county.  My girlfriend and I have lived in our apartment for 5 months as of March 15th. In that time, we have been late with payment because of waiting on paychecks but have always paid the 5 dollars per day charge.   I work as a companion to a man with Down Syndrome. He had been in the hospital, so I couldn't get papers signed, so I couldn't get paid. My pay will be in on April 5th. I will be getting about 700 dollars. Our rent is 675. I made a partial payment the day after the rent was due this month of 150 dollars. My girlfriend lost her job and got a new one and had been waiting on new pay checks to come. Today, March 25, we came home to a 10 day eviction notice. Our lease does state that habitual late payment can result in eviction. When we made the partial payment at the real estate agency the lease is through, we explained the scenario and asked to be notofoed if there would be an issue. No one notified us until now. Any and all advice is of help.   Edit: My girlfriend and I started datibg at fifteen and sixteen. Now that we are 19 and 20, seeing one is important. We both liked her's so I have an appointment with him next month. Just wondering if this was common.   Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but you girls always answer stuff well.  Back ground on us: I am 19, she will be 20 in early April. We have been together 3.5 years.   Background on Dad: He has been married to 4 different women. He married my girlfriend's mom, divorced her after about two years, ran away to Vegas to marry wife number 2, then had a big Catholic wedding a year later. Divorced wife 2, married wife 3. Married wife number 2 AGAIN in a secret wedding, and is now having another big wedding to her.  Background on my girlfriend and her dad's relationship: he left when she was 2. He saw her maybe once a year until she was 16. Then, like 2 or 3 times a year. She and I lived with him for 7 months until he threw us out to move in with wife #2 in her state, 2 hours away. He has since tried to force her to leave me and move im with him and force them to only spend time together despite her refusal since he is verbally abusive and controlling.   He hates me. We are both expected to attend this wedding, and the wife wants my girlfriend to be a bridesmaid, despite only having seen her 4 times since she was 4. My girlfriend doesn't want to go. I really don't want to go. Do you guys think we are obligated?               As a gq lesbian, I don't quite get it as it is. How does it work in general and is it different for transgirls?   I know this is pretty insignificant, but today I was on /r/AdviceAnimals and I eealized something really shitty. Every Scum Bag Steve post was ahout general douchey stuff. Every Good Guy Greg post is about general nice thing. However, every Scum Bag Stacy post is about either a girl being a "slut" or a bad mom, and every Good Girl Gina meme seems to be about her sleeping with the guy or being a good homemaker. Does anyone else see this?         I am FAAB genderqueer leaning male. For as long as I can remember, I have "felt" a penis, just been unable to see it. I'm just trying to figure stuff out.                                          Generally, guys aren't all that clean. And lack of sensitivity is a good thing because you last longer. And, while minimal, it does protect against some STIs.  Edit: thank you all for realizing I was serious and not trolling. Much more to think about for when I eventually have children.                   NSFW      What were some of your rules, who suggested it, would you do it again?      I'm FAAB. I have identified as genderqueer leaning male for almost 5 years now.   From when I was a kid, I have distinct what I call "trans memories". For one thing, I remember trying to make an STP out of a toilet paper roll. I also remember trying to always have a reason to use the men's room. When I first saw the SVU Episode "Transitions", I cried because I thought that my parents had gotten me a sex change when I was a baby and wondering why they couldn't just love me as the baby boy I assumed I had been born as.   I'm fairly certain that I am FtM. My family would not accept it. We've already discussed it. My girlfriend says that she would be very much okay with, but I don't think she would be okay with any bodily changes.  I'm wondering if, if I use Androgel, I can gain all of the effects besides facial hair. My family history is very limited body hair growth. My mom's brother's didn't grow facial hair until their thirties and it was then still very limited. My legs only need shaving once a month or less, as it grows so sparingly. Also, how much would my voice change most likely?   Added discussion, defend your choices, argue other people's.   Feel free to provide screen caps and such for examples. Also, do you frequen it and if so why?      Card games like Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity count, as do games like Kerplunk, Hedbanz, etc.         When I last left you guys, all was going rather swell. Sadly, since then, everything as fallen apart. Moxie, one of the girls, ate through most of the cardboard I used to make the split. I tried, since it had been a while with no fighting, to introduce them directly, and fighting immediately ensued. I haven't had the time since to work on making them a better divider, but once I do get some time, I'll be sure to let you all know.      So, I posted yesterday about introducing my kids with a homemade split cage. They initially fought (or tried) through the screen, but have since gone to seeming to almost ignore eachother. I am switching their sides periodically so they learn the scents, but I want to wait until they are sleeping side by side for a week before I put them all the way together since my boy is so young.    I want to breed some gerbils. I love mine, but I know that they will eventually die, so I want a little piece of them left. Also, some friends have said that they want gerbils, and would be good gerbil parents. I have homes lined up, and I am willing to keep any that don't get homed.   I recently got a baby gerbil, I think about 1-2 months old. He is a little boy, he is solid very dark grey. I also have a pair of girls. One is blonde and and the other is grey and white. They are each in half of a split cage I made.  I used heavy cardboard wrapping paper tubes and window screen materials to make a divider. They can't seem to get through it.   Wish me luck on this bonding!         [I was 17 and drunk for the first time when this happened. My girlfriend's father kept filling my cup with more cider, and I had never even had a sip before this. His girlfriend's six year old beat the living hell out of me.](/spoiler)   Also, did you ever get caught? What happened?      I am "blessed" with a 40HH chest. I have checked websites like Double Diva's and Casique, but no one seems to carry a bra in my size, particularly one with padding. I prefer padded bras as they hide my nipples more so. If anyone has a website that carries that size and they know it to be reliable, please let me know.   I have two female gerbils named Moxie and Roxie that I've had for about 9 months. I also have a little guy named Remy. I've had him for about a month. So far, he has bit me to the point of leaving a scar once, he has made Roxie bleed, and he has bit me hard a second time. They live in separate cages, but I want to breed them, so in a completely open cage without bedding, I was introducing him to Roxie. He doesn't seem to fight with Moxie as much. I got them from separate pet stores, no chance of relation.  I have tried placing their cages side by side, since Moxie is an escape artist, I don't want to risk her getting into his half if I were to split cage them. I have bought Remy special presents, including his own ball, a track to run it on, special treats, and various types of chew toys. He is still very shy and very nasty.   How can I get him to be nicer?    First ever post on reddit.   When I was about 3 or 4, (I don't remember the first time) a neighbor kid of mine who was two years older, used to coerce me into doing inappropriate things with him. These started out just as him getting me to kiss him, and then lead to French-kissing, and further to eventually kissing and licking his genitals. He would tell me that if I told he would never talk to me again, and we were best friends. He also would say that if I didn't do what he wanted, he would tell his mom I started it or that I wasn't allowed in his rec room anymore. He had a captains bed, and, in my strongest memory, we were "hiding" in the part that goes near the wall while my brother played Nintendo 64 in the rest of the room.  I have always been aware of what happened to me as a kid. It was just the other day though that someone actually told me that it was abuse. I always pretty much just thought that it was just "kids being kids" or that I was willing.   I must have been pretty young when it started, because I remember, very vaguely, my dad telling me that if anyone touched me or made me touch them, to tell him. I can remember at that moment wondering if the other kid counted, but I knew the other kid said not to tell.  Later in my life, when I was 13, there was a girl who I had been friends with for my entire life. She was 12. We knew we weren't supposed to, but we put on a DVD, I think it was American Pie, and she decided that we should try "stuff". The next day, for her birthday party, she told me that she told her other friend about all of it, and that her friend then wanted to join because they had done it before. I was pretty much terrified from the previous night, and I certainly didn't want her friend to know, never mind join. However, a few months later, I willingly fooled around with her, (the girl, not her friend), so I don't know if this can really count for anything, since I went back for more.   I also recently realized that I have a large majority of "symptoms" per se of abused people. I have severe depression, despite the fact that I have a pretty good life. I am incredibly anxious all the time. I have been to the point of suicide more than once.   What I want to know is, now that I am 18, can I get therapy without insurance? I live in PA. Also, does the second thing count for anything other than stupidity?   	136
 Okay, look, if you are suffering from depression and you used to cut I feel for you. Depression sucks, I know it. But there is absolutely no reason for you to bash other people who are suffering by calling them slurs used against women and queer people. That is not acceptable behavior. I don't care if you don't like other people "whining" about their problems, but you have issues and hate speech is not going to help you out any.   A lot of bisexual people I know don't like men and women completely equally or in the same way. Some of them are bisexual but only homoromantic or heteroromantic (emotionally attracted to those of the same sex/gender or opposite sex/gender). This is not uncommon at all, and totally normal and okay.  As to whether or not you should come out, that's up to you. Everybody has to make their own decision about whether or not they want to come out and who they should come out to. If you're afraid of coming out because people won't believe you or you don't think your identity is "legitimate" don't worry about that. But if you have reservations for other reasons, I can't really help you there. Just do what you think will work best for your.  As far as counselors and therapists, you should do some research online and see if you can find any in your local area that are LGBTQ-friendly. Not all therapists have the best views, but the ones who are friendly usually advertise it. You could also potentially ask around if you know anyone else that sees a good one - word of mouth is usually a pretty good indicator. Whenever you talk to them about it, just talk. They're there to listen - it's their job.  Hopefully all goes well, I wish you all the best!   Well, it would be somewhat concerning for me. If you don't have any friends, that's somewhat of a red flag. Are you too busy for friendships? If so, how do I know you'll have time for a romantic relationship? Or perhaps your personality isn't that great, so people don't really want to be your friend. Or maybe you just don't like people, in which case I would wonder what sorts of things we can do together that don't involve lots of other people. Or maybe you just moved into town and haven't met a lot of people yet.  If we were in a relationship, I would expect you to hang out with my friends on occasion. If you don't like people, that would be a problem for you, and if people don't like you, that would be a problem for everyone else. It could potentially put a lot of strain on our relationship.  That said, I'm sure I could potentially make it work with someone in this sort of situation. However, it would be a cause for concern. This sort of thing really depends on why it is exactly that you don't have any other friends. But keeping up with conversation/not being clingy definitely helps.   Wow! You're looking great! Keep being fabulous :D   I got a very similar feeling, although I don't smoke and it would be tequila instead of scotch.   One of the more common conditions was actually syphilis. In the late 18th century syphilis patients made up about 20% of those in asylums. By 1818, the Royal Asylum for the Insane at Charenton recorded that up to one third of their male patients had GPI, or general paresis of the insane - the underlying cause of which was syphilis. The numbers of syphilitic patients increased greatly throughout Europe in the last few decades of the 19th century. (Source: Syphilis, sex and psychiatry,  17891925: Part 1 by Robert M Kaplan)  Symptoms included and abnormal gait, blindness, confusion, dementia, depression, headache, incontinence, inability to walk, irritability, numbness in the extremities, poor concentration, seizures, stiff neck, tremors, visual disturbances, and weakness, according to the [NY Times](http://www.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/neurosyphilis/). Of course, this disease was no longer an issue after the advent of penicillin during WWII, as syphilis is a bacterial disease and antibiotics made it easily treatable, so it rarely gets to the later stages that doctors used to see in psychiatric patients.  I can't tell you that much about other conditions as (unfortunately) they don't teach a lot of the history of psychiatry whenever you're an undergrad, but what I do know I mostly remember from reading things here or there in my spare time, so I'm not really comfortable discussing other stuff I don't know as much about.   I was doing okay until the person draining the abscess started digging their finger around in it. That's when I noped out.   That sounds like a really awesome project. I hope they get all the funding they need. :D   I'm so glad that I don't have any more school obligations until next semester. I turned in my last paper today.  I'm glad that I live with two incredibly wonderful people who have been really supportive of me throughout this very hectic year.  I'm also thankful that my mom, who divorced my abusive stepdad a few years back, just recently got married again to a really great guy and my sister now has another awesome parent she can look up to as she gets older.  Finally, I'm really thankful that I decided to join a group therapy session for LGBTQ people, everyone in my group was really great and they all made me feel a lot more confident of myself and forgiving of my flaws. They were super inspiring people and I will miss all of them.   Well when I came out to my dad I didn't get the best response. To most of the other people I know I merely posted a link to the Huff Post series on asexuality with the comment that anyone who was interested could read more about my identity. It did get a few responses, mostly from friends who were curious, and also one friend who told me that she was ace too! That was kind of neat.  I think that this approach certainly helped. Have information ready. Coming out as gay is different, because at least when you tell someone "I'm gay" they know what that means - you like people of the same sex/gender. But most people have never even heard of asexuality, while even those that have don't usually understand it that well. Plus, if you come prepared with research or articles or FAQs or whatever it shows that you've really put thought into this and your identity isn't just low self-esteem or a phase you'll get over or something equally stupid. Asexuality is a thing that exists, and it is a definitely a part of who you are.  Hope that helps, and good luck!   That he was the weird guy with the long hair and all the calendars.  Fyi: I knew my SO through mutual friends in high school before we started dating. Back then he had hair almost to his shoulder blades. Also, he kept a calendar print-out each month with all sorts of random pseudo-holidays on it - talk like a pirate day, pi day, etc.   Like, 95% of the time. I dunno if it's just because the shelf we keep our condoms on is on my side of the bed, or if it's merely habit, but my SO almost never puts on his own condom.   Nope, not overreacting at all. If a guy did that to me I'd be pissed. This dude sounds like a class-A douche. Slut-shaming, anti-abortion, yet he thinks it's totally okay to have sex with you while not using protection, cum inside you anyway knowing that you're not using any form of birth control, and laughs at you for being upset? I don't know why you were every with this guy in the first place, to be honest.  I would seriously advise you to cut this guy out of your life. Clearly he doesn't respect your body, your consent, or women in general. NOT boyfriend material, at least imho.   That's the cost for an electronic transfer to any account that's outside their system. You can get checks but they highly discourage you from doing this and I have no idea how they work.   That's exactly the kind of account I was talking about. But our university automatically disperses your financial aid to these accounts. I'm not sure if there's an option to get it sent to a private bank account instead.   That's tough. It's really hard for people to come out to others, especially when they're that young, and then have those few people completely phase out of their lives. It sucks, because you feel like you lose the only support you had.  I would definitely suggest you talk to your friend. Just call him up or send him a text asking what's up, and if there was some particular reason you haven't been hanging out as much lately. It's possible he's just been really busy lately.  If that isn't the case and he's actually uncomfortable with you being gay, you'll be able to address that as well, although it might be a lot more complicated. Hopefully it goes well, though.  Good luck!   I think the 80-90% communication thing is definitely true. OP and OP's boyfriend really just need to sort out the communication issue, and then the rest will be rather manageable.   Feasibly? No. It is possible, but the ATMs on those accounts limit us to a rather low withdrawal amount per day. So we would have to make several bank trips across multiple days to transfer all the money. It's super annoying. So we're all basically forced to use the accounts the university gives us unless we want to spend a whole lot of time withdrawing and depositing cash, or paying a $25 transaction fee if we want to send the money to another bank account.   I graduated high school in 2010, so still fairly recently.   If you're going to combine finances, you need to actually combine them.  This might not actually be possible for the OP. I'm actually in a similar boat, where I'm living with my partner and another roommate and we all depend on financial aid. My SO has a full scholarship that pays for residence and meal plans, while I only have partial scholarships and grants that cover my tuition while I have to take out loans to pay for everything else.  Although it might not be the same situation for OP, my university automatically disperses financial aid funds to special accounts set up individually for each student. It is also nigh-impossible to transfer this money to other accounts, as it's much more headache than it's worth with the processing times and fees accrued. So we don't really have a choice - all of us are automatically working from separate accounts. The only way we can budget properly is by communicating to each other how much we are spending.   No, it's totally reasonable for you to be upset about this. Mishandling money that should have gone toward rent could have ended with you being evicted if you hadn't had someone willing to give you money to make up the rest. And speaking as someone who also has to live frugally off of residual funds from school, I know how every dollar counts. Being flat broke at the end of the semester is a common occurance for me.  You should tell your bf that financial decisions (especially when they effect both of you) should be made together. The fact that he went and made decisions without you shows that he doesn't trust you fully. He should be less worried about you getting mad at him (like it seems he was, leading him to not tell you about your money problems) and more upfront about what's going on. Otherwise, how can you help when things like this happen?  Also, what if for whatever reason an unexpected expense came up and you were even more strapped for cash than you are now? What if your car broke down or one of you ended up sick or in the E.R. and had medical bills to pay? You both need to be aware of how much money you have so that you can respond appropriately in these sorts of situations.   I know mine all did. And due to budget issues, a lot of them were incredibly old ... and incredibly racist, just like *Lies* talks about.   I would say that you should do whatever makes you happy. If you want to date someone, do it. If not, don't. You shouldn't have to because you feel like someone your age "should be" doing anything.  As far as not being out to everyone, though, I think you shouldn't worry about that either. Not a whole lot of GSRM people are out to every single person in their life. Sometimes that just isn't practical, or it would put them in danger. So no, you shouldn't have to be out to everyone in order to try to find a partner.  Of course, if you do end up finding someone and dating long-term, it will be harder to keep in the closet as that person becomes a bigger and bigger part of your life. However, at that point it will be up to you and your partner to decide if/when you should reveal your relationship to other people.   I'm asexual, so this basically describes all my relationships. I'm not attracted to people physically, I'm with them because I enjoy their company.   No, I'd say you're correct. Of course you choose whether or not to ask someone else out on a date, or to have relationships with certain people. However, you cannot control who you have feelings for. It's just a part of who we are.  I've actually used food analogies several times to help explain sexuality to people. For instance, some people might really like ice cream or cake but they're on a diet so they can't eat sweets (celibacy). Some people really like certain foods, but over time get sick of eating them a lot so they start eating other things. Or perhaps they might not think they like a certain kind of food but after trying it they realize it's not so bad (sexual preferences sometimes change). Other people are convinced they won't like a food, try it, and end up hating it (sometimes they don't change). And some people really crave things like spicy food, while other people have almost no tolerance; some people only want to eat spicy food occasionally while others will eat particular spicy dishes they're used to but not all spicy foods (asexuality/gray-a/demi spectrum).   I have problems recognizing when someone likes me sometimes too. I'll be going along, minding my own business, thinking I'm just good friends with somebody, and suddenly out of nowhere they confess their love to me. This has happened to me like three times. And then I look back and go, "wait, so those times they were saying this or that they were actually flirting..."  It's a bit annoying.   Wow, what a difference! Congratulations, I hope you continue to be happy and healthy!   Yeah I went for generic descriptor here, but on /r/outhere it's Oh So Squishy, which has gotten a few fans apparently   That is an awesome story. Also I love your flair, btw.   I think a card saying something like "your bravery is an inspiration" or "I hope your transition goes well and that you have a happy future" would be really sweet to get, especially from someone who they might not know that well. I bet it would make her pretty happy, and who knows, maybe you'll end up being friends?   I would love to see a Misty with full sleeves. Just sayin'.   That sounds like asexual to me. You should probably look around on the AVEN website or wiki (links in the sidebar) and read up on some things. Then just explore and see what works for you.   To be fair though, Tom Bombadil was a pretty unnecessary character, at least in the first book. I'm really glad he got cut out from the trilogy movies, tbh.   I too was disappointed by a distinct lack of Strong Belwas.   Now that I think about it, book and TV Littlefinger are pretty different. In the books everyone is constantly writing him off as not that big a deal. He's really useful, but no one really seems to understand the extent to which he is manipulating others or how far he is willing to go to get what he wants.  Meanwhile in the show, everyone seems to be relatively well aware that Littlefinger is a backstabbing asshole but he's still really necessary so they can't get rid of him.   I know what you're going through. This sort of thing is really rough. It feels terrible whenever the person that you've committed to and want to build a relationship with turns out to not be trustworthy. Whenever I found out, I felt hurt, and betrayed. But I also felt shitty because it felt like I wasn't *good enough*. Or that I was an idiot and should have seen it coming. That sort of reaction is perfectly normal.  You really shouldn't worry about what your friends and family think. It will probably suck for a little while whenever someone asks you about how your SO is doing and you have to tell them you aren't together anymore. But I'm sure most of them will be supportive, and try to be there for you rather than make fun of you or anything.  You aren't naive or silly for liking him. You can't really control your feelings for other people or pick who you fall in love with. And everyone falls in love with someone at some point who turns out to be less spectacular than what they thought. You shouldn't feel guilty or insecure for being a human being who has human emotions and makes human mistakes. Don't beat yourself up about it. You didn't do anything wrong, he did.  Honestly, I know that hearing the "you'll get over it line" sucks but it is somewhat true. In time, your feelings will start to fade a little bit. I think now would probably be a good time for you to do some introspection. Focus on the things you like about yourself and what you want from life. Reflect on what you'll do differently in the future. That sort of thing. Just take time to sort through your emotions and thoughts. The trip you mentioned might be a good time for that.  If you need anything please let me know! We're all here for you. :  Also, it just so happens that my first name starts with an "M" and I would love a tie clip ~~   Sounds like you're asexual to me. You can still get checked out by a doctor if you want, but there is nothing inherently wrong with not being attracted to other people or desiring sex. So don't stress too much. :   Speaking as someone who has depression, it sounds to me like you're depressed. I would suggest going to see a therapist. They might be able to suggest therapy or medication that could help you start to feel better. I know it helped me a little.  That said, I know what you're going through is rough. It can be so difficult to find the energy to just keep existing. But you just have to do it. Because eventually, things might get better. I really hope things do get better for you. But in the mean time, we're all here for you.   As far as your sexuality goes, to me it sounds like you're somewhere between demi and gray (both?). That's not really anything to stress out about, though. And honestly, you shouldn't have to feel guilty about not wanting sex. You're different from most people, but that's okay, and as long as your partner is happy and love you there shouldn't be a problem.  However, the painful sex is definitely an issue. Sex should never be painful (unless it's intentional because you're kinky like that). I would suggest talking to a gyno about that.   Of course it is. I still plan on getting married. Although if I do have kids, I'll adopt.   Well if that's your only regret in transitioning, I'd say you're doing pretty okay. ;   Daaaaaaaaaaaaamn.   Yes, because I consider the community to be more than just strictly for lesbians, gay people, bisexual people, or transgender people. The acronym isn't really that inclusive, but is usually shorthand for the community of all people who aren't strictly heterosexual and cisgender. Some people are now using GSRM, which is more inclusive of those who fall outside the traditional four categories.  I have, however, gotten some resistance from other members, especially cisgender gay people. Of course, these are the same sort of people who usually say that bisexuality isn't a thing and that trans* people don't belong either, so I don't really listen to them.   I actually had to read some of Jared Diamond's work and watch a documentary featuring him and his ideas for an intro anthropology course. I remember sitting there the whole time thinking, "this is stupid. This guy is racist, he has quite possibly the biggest white savior complex I've ever seen, and his theory is so simplistic." I'm glad I'm not the only one who recognized that this guy has some problems.   Thanks for the help. I will report them for sure if they try to send me anything.  Thank you for your apology, although from what I've seen this person is in a very tiny minority of users in /r/asoiaf. Nearly everyone else has been really welcoming and awesome, so I won't let them scare me off!   Seriously, I don't understand you. All I wanted to do was talk about something I like with other people who like it too. Instead, I get an outcry about why I don't belong here because I haven't finished the books *even though the rules of the subreddit state this is perfectly okay.* When people try to tell me that I might get spoiled I respond by saying it shouldn't be an issue as long as everyone follows the rules, and that I'll take my chances because I came here to have fun and participate in discussion.  So instead of letting it go, you insist that I'm a dick for wanting to be here and now you're going to do the EXACT THING that you and everyone else has been warning me about? Self-fulfilling prophecy much? But apparently I'm still the dick. Whatever dude, seems like you're the one with the problem here, not me - I've had plenty of good discussion and pleasant exchanges with other people on this thread and in this sub in general. Right now you're the only one who is acting like a stubborn dick, really.   Well, I thought I was being pretty reasonable. Just asking people to follow the rules and not worry about me doesn't qualify as being a dick, at least in my opinion. And telling me to get out is not helping me, fyi.  Also, I find it hard to believe that you perceiving my tone as hostile is proof of me being a dick while you and other people constantly telling me to get out isn't being a dick.   Of course it would get rid of the "you shouldn't be here" argument, hypothetically, but I don't know if it would make the situation any less threatening for trans* folks, since they would then potentially have to contend with two groups of cis people who might not want them there instead of just one. Sharing bathrooms won't take away the prejudices that a lot of people have, at least not right away. So it might get better in the long run, but I imagine it might get worse in the short term.  It would be really great though if this sort of thing were no longer an issue.   Ok, I laughed. ngl   It depends on the person, I think.   I don't normally post pics online, but what the hey.  https://scontent-a-iad.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/969507_10151240118682255_928045531_n.jpg  I'm on the left, with my SO on the right.   Honestly, I feel like people don't give kids enough credit. The whole "how do we explain it to the children?" argument is used a lot when discussing sexuality or gender identity or any of that stuff. Adults tend to assume that explaining that someone is any form of LGBTQ will confuse children, or even potentially harm them. But in reality, children are often far more understanding about that sort of thing. You explain to them that Uncle Bob is gay because he loves other guys and they usually say something like "okay. Let's go play now." They really don't care.  I would say the same thing applies to polyamory. "Sometimes Mommy and Daddy like to have other partners." "Oh, okay. Can I watch Spongebob?" Really not that hard. And if they have questions, just answer them the best you can and don't act ashamed about it.   Honestly, no, I wouldn't be that comfortable, because we live in a terrible world where violence against women is an unfortunate reality. Also, a lot of trans* people have bathroom issues, and I'm not sure lumping everyone together in one big one would help matters much.  Theoretically, though, if we lived in a society where none of the above was an issue, I wouldn't really mind. Of course, I would agree with the other comments though about having proper stalls. No huge gaps underneath the doors or walls, and no cracks in the doors that let you see people. Those are terrible enough in our current bathrooms, ugh.   Your parents were definitely abusing you, and sounds like they are either in denial or are trying to [gaslight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting) you about it. That is not okay. None of the things you described are in any way okay.  I am so glad to hear that you are going to get away from them soon. Please take care of yourself. Also, I don't know how the laws work where you live, but I know that in the U.S. where I am if someone files a missing person's report on you and you are an adult they can't force you to come back if the authorities find you. In fact, this is often used as justification to abandon a case if there isn't any evidence of foul play. So I wouldn't worry about that too much.   Arousal and attraction are not the same, although they can overlap. While it is possible that you are demi, the fact that you experience physical arousal doesn't necessarily mean you aren't asexual either. Honestly, female bodies are prone to lubrication even if they definitely don't want sex (even during sexual assault), so it's pretty safe to say that if physiological response isn't always linked to a willingness to have sex or an attraction to someone.  Not all asexual people have no sex drive. Ultimately the decision is up to you, but identifying as asexual doesn't mean you can't want to or enjoy having sex with your partner. It just means you aren't physically attracted to people.   Like previous commenters have said, follow through is really important. It takes time but you have to walk the walk. Don't just try to tell her that she can trust you, but SHOW her you are trustworthy, again and again. Eventually this will help her feel safer with you.  Also, it would certainly help if you just ask her if you can help and how. Not only will it give you some actually effective ideas, but it will demonstrate to her that you care about her needs and feelings.  And don't be afraid to mess up sometimes. Not everyone is perfect. But if you make a conscious and willing effort to fix your mistakes, that says a lot about your character and the lengths you will go to in order to have a healthy relationship with this girl.   I really don't get along well with women who thrive on drama. I am very much anti-drama, so women who are really gossipy or in any way double-faced really don't work for me. But then, the same goes for people in general, not just women.   When I first started dating my SO we were monogamous, and we tried to open up and it worked out terribly the first time. The main issues we had were a lack of communication, as well as the fact that I really wasn't ready for it at the time, and then the other person he was dating (and one of her other partners I had contact with) all treated me like some afterthought. All in all it was just not a very good situation. Our relationship was seriously rocky for a while. But eventually he stopped seeing the other partner, we worked everything out, and for a while we went back to being mono.  It's been nearly two years since then, and we're in a much healthier place now. A few months ago, I brought up the idea of having an open relationship with my SO. This time around we were both frank about our feelings, and what we wanted. He still had the desire to date other people, and I had developed a crush on someone else as well. So now we're open again. This time things have worked out much better because we're more open and honest with each other, and we approached the situation with mutual respect. Now he is freely looking for other partners, I can freely pursue my crush, but our relationship with each other is even stronger. We're a lot happier now.  So I would say that yes, going from closed to open can certainly work, but it can also go wrong if you go about it the wrong way. You need to maintain open communication, respect for everyone involved, honesty, and adherence to whatever boundaries all of you decide upon.   "I'm not racist, but..."   Smart kid. xD   If you ever find yourself saying the words "but I didn't mean it to be offensive," odds are you really need to re-examine what you're saying.   This might also be good for /r/pettyrevenge - that is some petty revenge if I ever saw it.   I'm suddenly really glad that I'm allergic to rabbit and have therefore never bought angora yarn.   That's the sort of thing I was talking about! Of course OP might not have had their wrist broken so maybe they don't need as long of a break. They can probably experiment and see what works for them. Still, though, the idea is that you need to avoid constant strain, so short breaks and stretches are probably a really good idea.   No, sorry - I haven't used one.   Making my own patterns for items that are fitted. Right now I'm working on a long-sleeved shirt and tunic for a Link cosplay. It will be quite the adventure.   Fantastic! I'm jelly. :   So jealous. I need a ball winder really bad :/  I've got one on my Christmas wish list, though, so hopefully I might get one too :D   I've done a little of my own pattern work, as well as freehanding. The one thing to keep in mind, I think, is to be aware that YOU WILL MAKE MISTAKES. This is inevitable, and part of the learning process. Even if you've made dozens of your own patterns before you will still make things that end up looking wonky sometimes. So don't be afraid to frog it and try again!  Something that might help would be to take existing patterns that are a bit simpler and making alterations to them. It will help you understand how shapes work, and how you can manipulate them.   I've had problems with my wrist getting my sore and my hand cramping up while trying to crochet too fast for too long.  A wrist brace will probably help, and also try to take regular breaks. Like, crochet for 50 min. of an hour, and take a break for the last 10 minutes or something. That way you aren't getting a constant strain.   That's adorable! I've actually been thinking about making a cowl to look like the Traveler. I bought the yarn and everything, just haven't started yet. I'll be making my own pattern so I've been procrastinating because it will involve a lot of swatching and I hate swatching.   Well usually when people ask me to make stuff for them I just start explaining all the work that goes into it. They'll ask me for a Dr. Who scarf and I'll say, well I need 7 colors of yarn at approximately $5 or so a skein, plus a set of straight needles which will be around $10 or so, so you've already spent about $45. Now it will take me at least a month to make it since I'll be working on it in my spare time between classes and other projects. So if you paid me per hour at minimum wage that scarf would be hundreds of dollars. Sound good?  Of course I never actually charge an hourly rate, just enough to make it worth my time and get a little profit. Perhaps the best way to show people how much time, effort, and money this sort of thing takes is to just hang out with them while you make something. You can physically show them how much work you can get done within the few hours you're together. Then you can estimate how much longer it would take to finish the entire project. Usually when people see me working on something and I tell them how long I've already been at it they gain a lot more respect for what I do.   I'm making this a text post because I don't really need karma for this, I just wanted to gush a little bit.  Recently I had an artist's table at a local convention. It was only the second time I've done this and the first time I had to do it by myself. Also, nearly all of the stuff I made this time around was from my own patterns and designs, rather than using other people's patterns (with permission, of course) like I did last time.  This is kind of a big deal for me, as I've had a lot of trouble trying to get a "real job" while also being in school and dealing with anxiety and depression issues. However, starting my tiny crafting business has really helped me, not only because I got to destress while making things (isn't knitting so relaxing?) but also because it's given me a lot of self confidence. So many people came by my booth. Some of them bought my stuff, but even those who didn't had a lot of compliments about how cute all my stuff was or how impressed they were with the time and effort I put into it.  Also, a guy from a group called The Dish Out, which promotes underground artists, happened to come by and asked me for an interview. [Here's the link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_ZoItG6IBw), if you're interested.  I know that this post might be a little off-topic compared to the usual  fare here, but I wanted to share my experience with you because I hope that some of you will be encouraged by it. I have spent many hours across the years being frustrated, starting and restarting projects, giving up and then coming back to it. But knitting is such a great hobby, and if you stick with it I hope that when the day comes where someone recognizes your skill you'll feel it was incredibly rewarding, just like I did.  So to all you new knitters out there, keep going! You have a lot of great stuff waiting for you down the road. And for all of you more experienced stitchers, I hope you've enjoyed it as much as I have! Hopefully we can all continue to have such positive experiences in the future.   So after many weeks of reading a few chapters here and there between classes and before bed, I finally finished A Storm of Swords. I only started reading after I saw all of the HBO series that's been released so far, so I really enjoyed seeing the incredible amount of detail that was left out of the show. But JEEZ is this book long or what? I haven't been as big a reader as I used to be since I started college, so this one felt like running a marathon after I hadn't done much besides walking around the block for the last four years.  So a few things I've noticed so far are that Season 3 ends at right about the 50% mark of the third book. However, the last scene of Daenerys liberating the slaves is put at the end of the show, while there are several chapters after that point which were also in the show but put in earlier. I have to wonder if the producers of the show did that because they thought Dany's scene was more dramatic, or if there was maybe some other reason influencing the decision.  Speaking of Daenerys, I'm also curious to see the direction they're taking in the show with her advisors, particularly Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy. In the books, Barristan knows that Jorah was spying on Daenerys for Varys and King Robert, but this isn't revealed until just before the battle for Meereen, after Barristan's true identity is revealed. In the show, however, Barristan tells Daenerys who he is right away, and if I recall correctly he doesn't seem to be aware of Jorah's disloyalty because he was banned from small council meetings (even though this is exactly how he knew in the books). I'm wondering how the betrayal will play out because of these alterations.  Another topic I've been pondering is the fate of the remaining Starks. It seems to me like as soon as they start getting separated bad things happen, and the thought process seems to be that if only they could reunite everything would work out. Nearly everyone thinks that Arya has been dead the whole time, Sansa is being shuttled along from man to man and has no contact with the rest of her family, Jon is stuck doing his duty around the Wall, and Bran and Rickon have to remain unseen so that no one knows they're still alive. It's really terrible to see how cut off they are from one another, and how lonely each of them feels because of it, especially once they all hear about Robb and Catelyn dying at the Red Wedding. But at this point I'm not sure that getting them all back together would help anything. Sure, it would be nice to see them happy again, at least for a little while, but odds are something else would go wrong and they all really would get wiped out.  Well I've been rambling long enough. Does anyone else have any theories about some of the changes we'll see from the books as we start Season 4? Or perhaps some thoughts about the ending of ASOS? Because that one really threw me for a loop.   A recurring topic I've seen lately, both here on this subreddit and in other places, is how identifying as asexual fits in with sexual relationships, masturbation, or finding people's bodies aesthetically pleasing. There seems to be some general confusion, not only from people who are outside or new to the community, but also from some people who apparently have been with us for a while. So I wanted to bring this up for discussion.  Many people I've talked to, as well as those who come to the subreddit looking for advice on identity, have issues with these subjects. Most people define asexuality simply as "not being sexually attracted to any sex or gender." But then some people will say, "I don't want to have sex, although I still find some people cute." Or perhaps, "I masturbate, but it's mostly just a routine or chore." Or, if you're like me, you might have a sexual partner and regularly engage in sex with them.  I just wanted to emphasize the idea that *none of these things* negates your asexual identity. Not all asexual people are the same. Some aces enjoy sex or masturbating, but that sex drive isn't really directed at a certain person or group of people. Some ace people can look at a person and think, "they're an attractive person," but they don't want to have sex with them or anyone else who looks attractive.  To me, as long as you aren't sexually attracted to any sex or gender, like the definition above, it doesn't matter if you find people aesthetically pleasing or if you masturbate or watch porn or have sex. Because all of those things aren't necessarily related to your sexuality or how your identify.  How about the rest of /r/asexuality? What do you all think? And how do you all feel about these sorts of things?      Background: I'm 21f and asexual, dating a 21m straight guy. We've been together now for over 5 years.  Just a few months ago, my SO and I decided to try having an open relationship. I developed a crush on a close friend and he's expressed polyamorous inclinations for a long time now. So we mutually agreed that we wanted to date other people, but still keep our current relationship.  For the last few weeks, my SO has been trying to date various women he's found attractive, knowing that he has my blessing - after all, if he is able to get sex from multiple sources it really takes some pressure off of me, considering my orientation. However, he's been pretty much unsuccessful. Nearly every person he's talked to has said they are too busy for a relationship, already like someone else, or think he's really great but just "not their type." He is very understanding of their needs and reasons, of course, but it also sucks for him because he is a little disappointed. He's gotten somewhat depressed and frustrated lately with the whole situation.  I'm sort of in a dilemma over this, because I don't really know how to comfort him (or if I even should). It's a little weird for me, because I want him to be happy, but at the same time I feel like saying "well at least you have me, right? So you aren't totally lonely!" That doesn't really help, though. I know he's disappointed because he's trying his best but not getting anywhere, and he probably feels like he's not that attractive if no one really wants to date him. But on the other hand, I feel like the whole "woe is me" thing is a little bit sore for me since it's making me feel like I don't count for anything. Of course I know he loves me and appreciates me, it's just that there's this tiny little part of me that wants to be upset about the fact that he's acting as if he's foreveralone when I'm still here.  Am I weird for feeling that way? I'm trying really hard here to be mature and understanding, as he is certainly much more poly than I am (the crush I mentioned earlier is the first crush I've had - ever - and I'm not terribly into relationships in general). I guess I'm just a little confused about what to do here and I could use some advice.  Thanks for reading.   After watching all three seasons in the span of a week during this past summer, I soon started reading the books and I've really enjoyed seeing the differences between the two - especially the elaborations that the books give.  Right now I'm partway through A Storm of Swords, and I just recently read the section where Tyrion is attending a small council meeting after Tywin arrives at King's Landing and assumes his position as the Hand. As the council members were all discussing the war, the subject of the Vale came up. At this point, Lysa Arryn is still insisting on doing nothing except keeping her son bottled up in their castle where the nasty Lannisters can't get them, but of course this could change at any time and they need assurance she won't later decide to join Robb's (or any other potential king's) cause.  Littlefinger suggested that, since he is now a lord, he can marry Lysa and bring up her young son to be a loyal subject of King Joffrey. And he should leave right away - after all, it is autumn and the seas will soon be stormy, and he can't exactly marry Lysa if he drowns before he can get there. Everyone agrees, except Tyrion, who points out that they will no longer have a master of coin. So the others suggest Tyrion can do it, and Tywin agrees, as Tyrion had recently complained to him that his father never let him do anything important.  The clever part? Littlefinger leaves before Joffrey's wedding to Margaery Tyrell, and this wedding is going to be SUPER expensive. Oh, and the treasury is empty. Oh, and Tywin won't forgive the crown's debts to the Lannisters because if Tyrion can't make this work he wasn't worth much anyway. Oh, and on top of this there is still a war going on. Oh, and it was Littlefinger's suggestion that Tyrion take is job in the first place.  Of course Littlefinger's suggestion to marry Lysa and then essentially become Lord of the Eyrie (in practice if not in name, as the title technically belongs to Lysa's son) is yet another example of him being very ambitious. But I'm also pretty sure that he felt just as much satisfaction dumping Tyrion with the mess that was the royal wedding and laughing to himself while someone else, especially someone he doesn't seem to particularly like, has to deal with the headache.  Edit: I find it interesting how most of the comments have been about how I should be careful of spoilers rather than actually discussing anything in this post. They way I saw it, this post contains spoilers for ASOS so I had to label it that way regardless of what sorts of spoilers I was expecting ... Anyway, I get that I need to finish the books (and I will) but until then let's get back on topic maybe?  Edit 2: Names are hard. I have new appreciation for Robert Baratheon's impatience with titles.   I made a post last week [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/outhere/comments/1ovmxf/its_asexual_awareness_week_and_i_think_im_ready/) about my decision to come out to everyone I knew on facebook as asexual. A few people expressed interest and gave me well wishes, so I figured I'd post an update in case anyone is curious.  Strangely enough, most of the week went without much fanfare. The first posts I made, which were changing my profile picture and cover photo, got a few likes, even from family members. But I hadn't actually said explicitly that I was asexual at that point so for all anyone knew I was just being an ally like all those people who changed their prof pics to the HRC equals sign logo.  Next I posted the link to the Huff Post series on asexuality (which I also posted already on this subreddit), mentioning that people should read it if "you're curious about my identity." Suddenly, a few of the likes on my earlier pics disappeared, most notably the ones from my family members. As I live in a different city about an hour and a half away from my hometown I haven't seen or talked to any of these relatives so I have no idea what they think. The silence is deafening.  In better news, though, a few of my friends liked my posts, including articles, diagrams, and videos. One friend liked and commented on almost everything throughout the week and asked a few questions, and was completely cool with it. Another said he was a little confused because he was raised in a conservative religious household but he genuinely wanted to learn more so we'll skype together sometime soon and I can answer his questions. But the best part of the week was getting a message from an old high school friend I hadn't seen in years. Apparently she is also asexual and had come out to a few LGBT friends in the past, but they didn't respond well so she'd remained completely in the closet ever since then. After seeing all my articles, it gave her hope and joy to see that she wasn't the only person who shared this identity. I was really excited that I could do something positive for her, even if she wasn't ready to come out yet!  Although I'm still somewhat anxious about the people's reactions I haven't seen in person yet, I'm relieved that I came out. I feel like being in the closet is so anxiety producing because of all the uncertainties - how will people react? What if something bad happens? But now even if bad things happen I can actually do something about it instead of worrying all the time.  Well, enough about me! I know how difficult and scary it is to be open with people about your sexuality, so I just wanted to say that I will continue to encourage everyone else on here until they are ready to take that step themselves. Coming out is a long, hard, exhausting process, and you all have been here for me, so I hope I can do the same for others. :      For a long time I've been out to close friends but I've never discussed my orientation with family or with acquaintances or more casual friends before college. I've been on the fence for a long time about telling more people, especially my mom, but I kept finding excuses not to bring it up. "It's not relevant to the conversation right now." "I don't want to make them stressed out or worried about me." "I don't know if they'll accept me."  Well, I'm tired of excuses. Lately I've been coming out to more and more people, because I'm sick and tired of asexuality being a fringe group that no one knows about. I want recognition. I want people to see me for who I am. I don't want to be ignored any longer, in queer or straight spaces.  So this week, which is Asexuality Awareness Week, I have changed my facebook profile picture and banner to ace-related pictures. I'll be posting videos and articles that I find. If someone asks me about my identity, I will proudly say, "yes! I am asexual. It's just one factor in all the things that make me awesome." I don't want to hide because I'm afraid of judgement anymore.  I hope you all wish me luck, and I'll continue to support all of you as well :D   I've been following /r/knitting for a while now, and I love all the awesome stuff that's posted here! Especially some of the really cool socks. Often whenever I find a cool pattern I'm inspired to try it out and make it myself!  The only problem is, most sock yarns use wool. Like, at least 50% wool. And I'm terribly allergic to wool - I will break out in hives that don't go away for almost a week. It's painful and itchy and generally miserable. As I have yet to find a sock yarn at any of my local craft stores, I am kept from knitting awesome socks unless I want to turn into a giant rash.  Have any of you knitters out there found good sock yarns that don't use wool? I'm used to working with acrylic and other synthetics as they're usually pretty cheap, but I don't mind spending a little bit of extra money here - after all, socks are usually a pretty small project so I won't need to buy much. Please help me out of you find something you think would work! Thanks in advance :D  Edit: Thanks for all the helpful suggestions you guys! I'm really excited to try some of these out and finally be able to make some really awesome knitted socks.   I like to browse this subreddit for discussions about various VNs, but something that seems to pop up a lot would be posts that say something like this:  "I just finished [insert game here], and I really liked it. Can you guys recommend more games without nudity/H-scenes/sex scenes?"  It seems like it would make things a lot easier for everyone if we had a master post that was linked to in the sidebar which had a list of VNs that either didn't have H-scenes or had the option to turn them off. Or at the very least, it would be nice if we had a place to link them to whenever someone posted yet another thread like this.   So, yesterday I went out with my SO and our roommate. We're all 21, I'm a woman, SO is a man, roommate is a trans man (although he's been doing HRT for half a year now so he usually passes really well). We were out running errands and then had dinner, and last thing we did was run by our local Gamestore (not real name). All of us are really into video games and I think between the three of us we currently have half a dozen pre-orders for things, lol.  Anyway, we were in Gamestore and browsing around. We met another customer there who seemed pretty nice, roommate and I chatted him up about RPGs. SO was checking out controllers. And then roommate and I decided to ask for applications since we knew they'd be looking for temps for the holiday rush. Gamestore employee went to give us applications, and told us about a job fair coming up. We both took an application, I bought a game, and we all left.  After we got home roommate asked me, "Did you get a weird vibe from Gamestore employee or was it just me?" I replied, "Yes, totally!" Even though Gamestore employee didn't say anything to the effect, his body language and attitude made us both really wary. We had both gotten a feeling from him that he didn't like either of us. Roommate commented on how whenever I went to ask for an application too the employee seemed to look at me like, "what do *you* want an application for, you're a girl."  Again, none of this was ever explicitly stated, it was just the feelings we both happen to get. But whenever we asked my SO about it, he said he had no idea what we were talking about - he was totally oblivious to the exchange. Roommate and I chalked it up to "woman senses" - as he was also brought up as a woman, we were both conditioned to pick up on these sorts of things while my SO, a cis man, had never been made to.  Do you TwoX ladies know what I'm talking about? Do you ever get vibes like this? If so, share some of your stories! I'd like to hear them.   For those of you who aren't aware, asexuality is a thing. And a lot of aces (asexual people), like myself, have had many discussions about the community initialisms like QUILT-BAG or LGBTQIA (or any other variant) and what the A should stand for. Depending on who you ask, the A stands for Ally, or Asexual, or both. But a lot of ace people have a problem with this. Someone [recently posted something](http://www.reddit.com/r/asexuality/comments/1mep6a/reasons_why_i_need_the_a_in_lgbtiaq_to_stand_for/) to the effect in /r/asexuality.  I for one agree with the sentiment the OP expressed in that thread. Often, aces are completely ignored or dismissed, not just by straight cis people but also by the queer community. We just aren't acknowledged in most cases. But setting that aside, I wanted to address why I believe that having a special initial for allies is somewhat problematic. The most straightforward way to go about it is just to say that allies are not members of the LGBTQ community.  So, I realize that this sentiment is not held by all LGBTQ people and I will most likely offend some allies by saying this. But hear me out. I'd like to illustrate why I believe this with another example.  Say you are a Christian. And say that you have a friend who lives down the street who is Jewish. You hang out together a lot, and their family really likes you, so you often participate in some of their culture. Maybe you went to temple services with your friend a few times. Maybe you visited them at Hanukkah and exchanged gifts. You probably went to their Bar/Bat Mitzvah. You have different faiths, but you've always been supportive of your friend and try to stand up for them whenever someone else acts in a way that is anti-Semitic. Does this make you Jewish? Does this make you part of the Jewish community?  I would say no. At the end of the day, you go home to your family and you are still a Christian. You associate with them and you certainly aren't hostile, but you are not one of them.  I think the same sentiment applies to the LGBTQ community. Allies are great. They can be excellent friends, and they are certainly helpful when it comes to accomplishing positive change for our community. But they are not members of our community. They don't face our same struggles. They don't have the same experiences. At the end of the day, they go home and get back to their lives outside of helping us. So I really don't think they should be considered part of the community or get an initial.  Of course, this is not to say that I am not thankful for the help of allies or that they shouldn't be acknowledged for their own struggles. I just don't think they should be prioritized in such a way that they are considered full members of our community, especially since there are other GSM groups that still aren't fully acknowledged such as aces, or people who are agender or otherwise genderqueer.  Edit: Since there seems to be some confusion on the matter, the way I view things, allies are not a part of the LGBTQ community, but rather a separate group that works with us in order to promote change, especially against those straight/cis people who try to actively oppress us.  Edit 2: I am also of the philosophy that differences should be acknowledged and celebrated rather than ignored. I think it's much more meaningful when two people come together and say "You and I are different, but that's okay, let's be friends and work together," than when someone says "You and I are exactly the same because we're both human and that's all that matters." Not that the sentiment of the second statement isn't nice, it's just that it ignores the reality of most people's situations in the real world.      I apologize in advance for long text.  So, I'm a 21F panromantic ace, and for a long time now I've been developing feelings for a while now toward an old friend of mine (22F bisexual); we'll call her Lilly. I want to tell her about how I feel but things are kinda complicated so I'm not sure how to approach the situation.  It's important to note that I'm already in a relationship with a 21M (straight). We've been together for over five years now so this is a thing that will not end anytime soon. I really love him and I don't want to end my relationship with him at all. Also, he is completely aware of my feelings for Lilly, and we're in an open relationship, so this does not bother him.  But back to Lilly. Basically, we've known each other for the past seven or eight years; we were really good friends all throughout high school, and although we went to different colleges we've kept in touch. I still try to visit her whenever I can, although we don't spend nearly enough time together she's always happy to see me and it hasn't diminished our friendship at all.  Last year, Lilly came out to me as bi. She'd already known I was queer for some time, so she knew I'd be okay with it, but it was still a really big step for her. We both grew up in a pretty conservative religious community. She still isn't out to most of the people we know from our hometown because she's afraid of judgement from them. In fact, when she came out to me it was the first time she'd ever admitted she was bisexual out loud. As important as that moment was for her, I think it was really a turning point for me too. I don't know when I started to like her as more than a friend, and I wasn't always aware of these feelings, but when she came out to me I feel like suddenly something clicked in my brain. She wasn't completely unavailable to me, so I started entertaining thoughts of her beyond the purely platonic.  Since we've been friends for a long time we naturally talk about each other's relationships. She comes to me for advice all the time on how to deal with various people she's dated. And I've noticed that whenever she tells me about how she wants certain things from the person she dates, such as someone who can carry on long intellectual conversations but at the same time be silly with her, I find my self thinking "I could be that for you." And whenever she tells me about cute girls she hangs out with, I think "I wish you would go on picnics or get coffee with me instead." I'm not normally a jealous person, but I can't help but envy the people she tells me about a little because they get to experience things with her I've never been able to.  I've been reflecting on this a lot lately, and I want to tell her how I feel. But at the same time I'm conflicted about it, because she lives in a different city and I'm already in a relationship with something else. Although my current SO is okay with me seeing someone else, I don't know if Lilly would be okay with that arrangement. Not to mention that it would be hard to see her regardless, since she lives an hour and a half away. Plus I'm ace and she's sexual. I know that she's never had a serious sexual relationship with someone before (she's still a virgin, I'm pretty sure) but that doesn't mean she won't want to later on. I'm not opposed to sex (I'm relatively neutral about it) but since neither of us has had a lesbian relationship before it's a bit daunting.  If any of you have advice on what might be a good way to tell her how I feel or how to handle the logistics of a relationship (if it gets that far) I would really appreciate it. I've been really anxious about this for the past few months and I just needed to get this off my chest.  **TL;DR - I need advice on how to tell my crush how I feel about her. I've never had a crush before and my situation is complicated. Help, please!**         I always get a small burst of glee whenever I vote on something and it ends up being the 100th, 2000th, 550th etc. vote. I really like having even numbers for some reason. Not just multiples of tens or hundreds, either - I also like fives. Or repeating numbers like "3333" etc.         I just finished reading A Game of Thrones, and have read a few chapters into A Clash of Kings. I watched the series before I began reading, and while watching the show I thought that the whole story arc with Ned discovering that Joffrey was actually Cersei's bastard and not Robert's son was pretty believable. After all, there weren't exactly paternity tests back in medieval times, and unless it was entirely obvious that a kid didn't belong to one parent (i.e. the affair was discovered, or the child clearly resembled its true parent rather than the one who supposedly contributed) you stood a pretty good chance at nobody finding out about it. Cersei could easily claim that all her children just take after their mother - after all, their father was her twin brother, not some other random knight that they might resemble, so they just REALLY look like her. And in the show, there aren't really many other hints about the fact that Joffrey isn't Robert's kid outside of Ned Stark's investigations.  The book, however, was a completely different story. There are hints dropped everywhere - for instance, in the lineage book that Jon Arryn and Ned both looked at, it talked about two previous marriages between a Baratheon and a Lannister where the kids all took after the Baratheon side. There was also Sansa's comment about how Joff was not at all like his father, which made Ned finally realize the truth. At Joffrey's birthday tourney, his younger brother Tommen wears Lannister colors instead of Baratheon ones when he goes to fence. Plus, nearly every other time Joffrey or his siblings are mentioned by an outside party, they lump them in with the Lannisters by habit.  So my question is, if it was this incredibly obvious in the book that Cersei's kids aren't related at all to Robert, why aren't more people discovering this much earlier on? I know it gets revealed at large eventually, but really ... Joff is 12 years old at the beginning of the series. This seems like an AWFUL long time to keep a secret that seems so poorly hidden.  Anyone else have an opinion on this?            Trigger warning for descriptions of abuse.  Okay, so, I recently went to a therapy session where I talked about some stuff from my childhood. So here's some background info - I am the oldest of three children. My mom had me when she was single, but when I was about three she married my stepdad. They then had a boy when I was five and another girl when I was nine.  We were never a totally functional family; most of this had to do with money issues, and I know my parents' marriage was terrible, as my mom was pretty much miserable all the time. Whenever I was little I assumed it was because of me (like a lot of kids do) and this caused a lot of conflict between me and my mother. Add that to the fact that my stepdad was working most of the day and then whenever he was home he was too busy drinking to ever really have much to do with us kids, and I basically ended up in an environment where I had no one to talk to about my problems.  The biggest of these problems was my younger brother. He has always been mentally unstable, and went through a wide range of possible diagnoses as a kid until about a year and a half ago when he was officially diagnosed with Asperger's and Generalized Anxiety. He not only has problems with social interaction, but he also has an extremely volatile temper; he would completely freak out at people over the littlest things that everyone else didn't really care about. I might me talking about something completely unrelated and he would take it as a personal attack against him.  And with that temper came a lot of violence. He would often get upset at me and then hit me, or break my toys, or throw whatever was closest to him at my head. As we both got bigger I retained a physical advantage for a while - I was four years older, so I was stronger and could run faster, making it relatively easy for me to run away and hide in my room whenever he started exploding. I would have to hold the door shut, though, because he would grab chairs or other large objects and literally try to break my door down in an attempt to get at me.  It only got worse once I got into high school, as he hit puberty and started catching up to me in size. I'm only 5'2" (about 159 cm). Pretty soon he was nearly as tall as I was, and about as fast. We would get in fights and I couldn't escape completely unscathed anymore. I started getting defensive wounds - welts, bruises, scrapes, pulled hair, bloody lips. And once I got to college he was actually bigger than me. I remember the first time I came back home to visit he got upset in the car whenever we went through a drivethru and I told him he shouldn't order [Vault](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vault_\(soft_drink\)) (a drink that was basically a hybrid soda and energy drink) partly because he wasn't supposed to have any caffeine, and partly because as soon as he said he wanted it my little sister immediately wanted some too. That didn't go over too well. On the ride home he reached up from the back seat to punch me multiple times, tried to smother me with a pillow, and screamed and swore at me almost constantly. I was silent the whole time, as I didn't want to provoke him any further. My mom tried to calm him down but she was limited as to what she could do since she was driving.  Whenever we finally got home, I walked with my little sister up to the front door, and mom went to get some stuff out of the trunk. My brother screamed at me again for a little while and then took off around the side of the house into the back yard. I thought good riddance, maybe now he'll leave me alone. He didn't. While he was back there he grabbed a gardening stake from our vegetable patch and then came out to the front of the house again. I was still waiting by the door, since my mom was the only one who had keys. My brother started yelling at me again, and then swung the stake at my head. I threw my arm up in defense and he hit me there, leaving a huge swollen bruise. My sister jumped out in front of me and shouted at him to stop hurting me, and he nearly swung and hit her as well, but decided to just smash the stake against the house instead, which promptly shattered it and sprayed us with splinters. At this point my mom came up and let us in the house, and told my brother he was grounded and to go to his room. I was livid because I was tired of taking this shit from him and told my mom I was calling my friend and going to her house for the night. She tried to get me to stay as I started packing but at that point I was sobbing and nearly hysterical so I told her no, I couldn't, I was leaving.  On my next visit home a few weeks later I said something my brother didn't like and he ran outside, then came back in with one of the broken off pieces of that same gardening stake and tried to stab me with it. I barely managed to run into the laundry room in time to get the door between us.  After describing this story and several others to my therapist, as well as two different instances in the past year or so where I was suddenly triggered by something and started having mild panic attacks, she said I show symptoms of PTSD (although it's not full blown - I don't have enough symptoms for an actual diagnosis). At this point in my life my mother is now divorced from my stepdad and we have a good relationship. She's started to see more of my brother's temper now that I'm not there anymore to take the brunt of his anger, and she now knows what my life has been like this whole time. She's been committed to getting my brother treatment.  But I've fallen out with my stepdad over this issue. He's in complete denial about anything at all being mentally wrong with my brother, refuses to take him to therapy appointments or even regular doctors visits, and won't give him his meds for days at a time. For those of you who don't know what happens when you suddenly stop taking your antidepressants, imagine someone who goes from smoking more than a pack of cigarettes a day to quitting cold turkey. It messes you up. He's making my brother worse, and he won't acknowledge I've been abused. Every time I talk to him, he tries to guilt trip me, saying that if we get in a fight it's my fault because I'm the oldest and should know better, or that I should be more loving and supportive of my brother. He's basically facilitating the abuse, saying that I somehow deserve it while simultaneously dismissing my suffering. I couldn't handle it anymore so I stopped visiting him, and the last time I spoke to him voluntarily was two Christmases ago.  Part of the goal of my therapy is to help me deal with the trauma of the abuse, but I also want a better relationship with my dad. The problem is, the only way for us to work on our relationship is if he acknowledges the problem with my brother first, and he refuses to do that. I have really mixed feelings about my stepdad, and I don't know what I can do or say to make him understand where I'm coming from. I don't want him to apologize or make up for anything that happened in the past, I just want him to admit that it happened so we can make things better. But I don't know if that will ever happen or if I'll just end up never speaking to him again. Any advice?  **TL;DR: My brother frequently abused me from childhood up until college and it's left me with some symptoms of PTSD. But my stepdad won't acknowledge that there's anything wrong with my brother, and blames me for the abuse whenever it does occur. Now I'm not speaking to him and I don't know how to fix our relationship.**                So, there's a convention this summer in my city called [Fandomfest](http://fandomfest.com/en/), and I'll be doing four hours of panels for it. One of these will be called "Bat-Girls!" - a mostly lecture-style panel about all of the women of the Batman universe.  This will be the first time that I've ever done panels for a convention let alone a Batman related one, so I figured I'd go to you all at /r/batman for any helpful suggestions you'd have for the following:  1. Which heroines should I feature/focus on? I was thinking of doing a rundown of the female Robins and Batgirls (obviously, I mean it's in the title) but are there any other noteworthy heroines I should discuss? 2. Which villains should I highlight? I think Ivy and Harley are definitely noteworthy, but what about some lesser-known ones? 3. Also, I would like any recommended readings you could suggest for each character that would show off the best aspects of each woman/girl (e.g., read issue such and such to see Barbara doing blah blah).  Thanks in advance for all of your help! I recognize that I need to do the bulk of the work, but I want this to be a really good panel for everyone in attendance and not just "watch test_subject6794 talk about all her favorite Batman moments for an hour," so some different perspectives will be greatly appreciated!  **TL;DR:** I'm doing a panel at a convention about female characters in Batman comics, movies, and shows. Thoughts?      Ok, so I'm a short woman (even below the "short" threshold for this subreddit) and as I was browsing through some of the comments /r/short a thought occurred to me.  For pretty much my entire life I've been made to feel insecure about my height. I was one of the tiniest kids in every class in school and I got picked on a lot because I was too small to fight back. Even close friends constantly poked fun at my size, knowing that I was insecure about it. I am also constantly mistaken for being younger than my actual age - commonly four to five years younger.  Ultimately, a lot of the teasing also affected my self-esteem; among other reasons, I felt as if I was unattractive because my physical size made me appear less mature. I was never described by anyone as "hot" - the most I would occasionally get was "you look cute." I hate that word. I constantly feel as if I am being treated like a child. It doesn't help that I also have a very young-looking face and practically no boobs. Whenever I first started dating my SO (who is 6'0"/183 cm) people would make jokes about how I was so young-looking it made him seem like a pedophile or cradle robber. Now I am approaching my 21st birthday; I applied to get a library card about two weeks ago, but the person at the desk assumed I was still in high school and needed a parent to get the card for me.  So my question to men on this subreddit would be, have you also felt that your shorter stature has made people talk down to you or patronize you as if you were still a juvenile? Or does it affect you in other ways? Do you feel like people still treat you like a boy, or is it something else?  **Edit: If your first instinct after seeing this post is to make a comment about how short people just need to suck it up or how tall people have issues too, don't. That's not the point of this thread. The point is to see if there are any differences across gender in how height discrimination affects short people.**   I know most people on this subreddit have questions about issues that pertain specifically to themselves, but this one is about someone else I know - I hope that's okay.  Basically, I've been dating the same guy for almost 5 years now. I love him a lot and I've gotten closer to his family over the years, including his older brother.  Now, the brother (we'll call him T) is a generally nice guy; a little nerdy, average-looking, but funny and intelligent. I'm sure he could get along well with just about anyone. But he has a problem. Whenever we spend a significant length of time hanging out, T inevitably brings up the fact that he doesn't have a girlfriend (he is a straight, cis male btw). Most people have had the single blues at one point or another, but T is severely inexperienced. He's a virgin, he's never kissed anyone, he's never been on a date, and I'm pretty sure he's never even held hands with someone. And he won't stop complaining about it. Most recently, I went with him, my SO, and their parents to one of their other relative's wedding and he skipped half the reception because he was overwhelmed with all the lovey-dovey stuff I suppose, and I had to go and console him about it for half an hour.  Now, I don't mean to be selfish - it's not just that his complaining annoys me (although it does, to some extent). I'm also really frustrated about it because I know how he feels. My current SO is the only boyfriend I've ever had, the only person I've been intimate with, and until I met him I was just as lonely and hopeless about my dating prospects as T is now. I get where he's coming from. But every time I try to talk about it he just gets really angry and upset and won't listen to anything I try to say to make him feel better. I really care about him and I know for a fact that there is at least one girl in his life who would be willing to date him, so I want to make him feel better. But I really don't know how to approach the subject since he never talks about it unless he's feeling really upset about it at the moment.  If any of you have been in his situation, or in mine, and have some helpful advice about how I should approach the situation or things I could tell him, that would be fantastic. I want to be sensitive to his feelings and I know that me hanging out with his brother all the time probably feels like we're rubbing the fact he's single in his face sometimes. But on the other hand, he's really starting to frustrate me as he constantly asks if anyone I know is single or if I'll set him up with one of my friends, and he complains A LOT about how "forever alone" he is. I just want to help him so that we'll all be happier.  **TL;DR:** My SO's brother is single and has no experience with girls. He's really depressed about it and he's starting to bum everyone else out about it too. What should I tell him?   Ok, so I know this is a little late since ME3 came out quite some time ago. Forgive me. I started playing the first game on a friend's xbox, but then he moved and I had no way to finish it on my ps3 until the box set came out more recently (huzzah!). It took me a while because I was kept busy by school and whatnot, but I finally finished off ME3 and now I'd like to enter the discussion about it that I've been avoiding in order to keep from getting spoilers on everything. So without further ado, here are my opinions about ME3 (note: all the following spoilers are ME3 specific).  I have several complaints about this game. First, the way it tracks your progress for galactic readiness. I can't think of any good reason to keep it fixed at 50% from the very beginning to the very end of the single player campaign. At first I thought maybe this was the developers attempt at impressing upon us the idea that everything Shepard does is ultimately futile. But then I played a round of the multiplayer, and suddenly my progress shot up by 6% and that theory went out the window. This makes absolutely no sense to me. They put a big progress bar in your campaign, but it's only affected by online matches, and otherwise has pretty much no discernable impact on your campaign? Then why the hell is it there?? It just makes me feel completely impotent every time I look at it, and I played through the entire campaign before starting a multiplayer match so I know for a fact that this thing is completely useless to the actual story.  Second, I felt like everything I was doing was ultimately futile. I'm no stranger to doing the most inane things in a game purely to fulfill sidequests or get achievements for the sake of being a completionist. But I really felt like there was no point to doing any of the sidequests in ME3. Probably because no matter how many extra resources I gained my "galactic readiness" never budged. But perhaps also because this game felt like one huge, drawn-out ending to me. Because it's the final piece of the trilogy, everything is wrapping up and whittling down to one final conclusion, so it basically made all my choices pointless since I'd still end up in the same place. There was all this work but all the payoff was delayed until the very end, with the final choice of the game, and no individual choice before that really mattered - your outcome only changes after doing huge chunks of side missions. So why do I bother?  And that payoff was lousy. I know understand why so many people had a disliking for the ending to this game. Oh, guess what, Shepard? [No matter what you do, you're boned. Choice A: you die along with most of the galaxy. Choice B: you die so you can tell the reapers to fuck off. Choice C: you die so that your DNA can somehow be used to make everyone into cyborg ... things.] (/spoiler) Wow. Such a broad variety, how can I ever choose? It honestly felt like they were taking the heavily polarized moral system and applying that to your endings as well - you get your your renegade ending, your neutral ending, and your paragon ending. And none of those is really worth all the effort, if you ask me. Your only reward for hours of your life dedicated to this thing is [how many crew members will pop out of the Normandy in the final cut scene.] (/spoiler) There is so little difference between any of these endings that it makes me wonder why I didn't just play eenie-meenie-minie-mo to pick one.  Don't get me wrong, I love this series, and for the most part ME3 was a pretty solid game. But their management of the multiplayer features and the ending they seemed to pull out of the developer's asses really killed this last game for me. It felt like a major disruption in an otherwise interesting and seemingly well-thought out series.  All that said, what are some of your guys' thoughts? Did you enjoy the ending or no? What did you like or not like about ME3? I'm curious to find out!  	106
 I can tell you right now that there aren't any anime characters on the roster currently. The rule for third-parties (and, by extension, fourth parties) is that they must have had an appearance on a Nintendo console, their games are well-remembered, and made an impact on the console they appeared on, or gaming in general. An example is Sonic, Mega Man, etc.   I'm definitely thinking options to change things like airdodges and such, but I kind of see what you mean. I think that I may keep one general speed, but customization on a character before you select a stage would be interesting, kind of like choosing a kart in Mario Kart.    Yes, this means that we'll be implementing techniques from both. For instance, pivot grabs from Brawl will be added, and we're contemplating a lot of different techniques from Melee, such as moonwalking.   For characters, a lot of moves are taking more reference to the character's origins. While this does spice up characters a little bit, characters like Dr. Mario (assuming we add him in later) will likely take more scrapped parts from their original counterparts to make them more unique. A example off the top of my head would be that Mario gets the F.L.U.D.D. while Dr. Mario keeps the Mario Tornado.    Hi, I'm test_subject6948 and I'm developing a game currently titled "Super Smash Bros. Affinity". It's main goal is to take the best from Smash 64, Melee, Brawl and SSB4, and put it into a free online game that people can pick up and play. Currently, a very basic demo is expected by July, but I need some fan input. Here's what I can tell you so far:  -The game is sprited, similarily to that of Smash Bros. Crusade and Smash Flash 2. We're currently using sprites from other sources in the demo, but custom sprites will be added soon.   -The game's main goal is to focus on improving veterans and mechanics first, but we can promise you that many newcomers will appear eventually.   -The game will attempt to reach the speed of Melee, but appeal to Brawl players as well.   -We're mainly keeping it to Nintendo and some of it's third-party affiliates.   -A variety of Nintendo characters will appear, such as Mario, Link, Samus and Ness, alongside newcomers such as the Balloon Fighter, who's main focus is stage control and lightning-fast aerial combos, as long as you avoid getting your balloons popped.  -Stages include iconic locations from previous games, such as PictoChat, Mario Galaxy and Onett, as well as new stages like Mt. Dedede and Kokiri Forest.   I'd truly appreciate the input on ideas or suggestions, and a link to some in-development pictures is below. Thank you for your assistance.  http://smashboards.com/threads/super-smash-bros-affinity.342020/page-9#post-16846227   I've got the Tale of Desperaux for the Wii.   That ought to be a funny video.    MEGA MANS EVERYWHERE.  IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY RAIDED CAPCOM'S DUMPSTER.      I get to live out my dream of fighting boxers, plumbers, gorillas, princesses, monsters, knights, demons, aliens, spies and bounty hunters as a small blue robot.   My life's complete.    I have very basic coding skills (small webpage basic in HTML, to be exact), but I'm always trying to learn more.    I was thinking to myself a few nights ago, and with all the Classic Mega Man stuff happening lately, I thought up two ideas for Mega Man fan games:  1. Mega Man: Worlds Collide. Basically, it's the Mega Man Archie crossover with Sonic, but in game form! Play as Mega Man or Sonic, and fight the 8 Roboticized Masters (Shadow, Knuckles, Amy, Vector, Charmy, Espio, Blaze, Silver) and summon in Tails or Rush for assistance.   2. Mega Man Smash. Mega Man vs. the 8 original fighters from Smash Bros: Mario, Link, Samus, Kirby, Pikachu, DK, Fox and Yoshi.   They're kind of stupid, but I'd like to know if anybody else would be interested in doing this before I scrap 'em.    Let's see:  Super Mario 3D World (5/5) Pikmin 3 (5/5) Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD (5/5, only get if you don't own it on GameCube) Nintendo Land (4/5) New Super Mario Bros. U (4/5) Sonic Lost World (4/5) New Super Luigi U (4/5) Pac-Man and the Ghostly Adventures (3/5) Scribblenauts Unmasked (3/5)  I highly recommend 3D World and Pikmin 3, as well as Lost World and Nintendo Land. Also, try out Rayman or Donkey Kong, and definitely get Mario Kart and Smash when they come out.    I'd personally keep Pika, Puff, Lucario and Red (with Squirtle, Ivysaur and Charizard) snd add Mewtwo. But a standalone Red, Meowth or Zoroark would be kind of cool too.          Looks like this leak is officially debunked. You said that Rosalina was an AT, yet now she's a playable character. Don't fret, Shulk and Little Mac supporters!  	15
 Can neither confirm or debunk what you said, but the table in [this article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_Chinese_surnames) might be useful...  	1
          Is there any websites that you can buy dogecoin from? I'm pretty new to the cryptocurrencies thing    so I have my wallet and cgminer downloaded. What do I do now? I have no idea what to do in cgminer and i feel like all the videos and tutorials are above my head. Help me mine like i was your grandmother.   I don't know anything about processors at all. Here is my laptops specs http://www.cnet.com/laptops/hp-pavilion-dv7-3165dx/4507-3121_7-33970190.html  I have CPUminer downloaded already. I understand I wont make anything but I'm cool with that.      I'MMA MAKE IT RAYNE!  EDIT: OOOO IMMA BUY ME A PADDED TOILET SEAT COVER!  EDIT2: HOW DO I MAKE MOAR DOGECOIN?!?   How and where do I get started?   OOOOOO MAMA here's my address 1KGA1tmajhZV4kHyxrk1WPSuYTwBGL79YM   So I downlooaded electrum earlier today after heaqring some of my friends talk about bitcoins. I googled websites that payout small amounts of coins and tried those. I just copied one of my recieving addresses and pasted it in the website. Does it take time to show a transaction?               Found out my local bookshop has a magic section yesterday. Bought a book called mastering witchcraft. I've never been into witches and magic but the bible mentions them and if god is real and the bible is his word would witchcraft not also be real? If it is real how do I summon things and get super rich?   My friends and I have been wanting to play dungeons and dragons but none of us have played before. I bought a dungeon master book today but understand I need a lot more. I can ring beer to a group if you're willing to teach me how to play.    I've brought her over twice now. The first time they avoided and hissed. This time they are still hissing but they don't seem to be avoiding each other as much. I've lived with dogs before and other people would bring their dogs over all the time. I know dogs are pack animals but will my cat ever get along with other cats if they only ever meet sporadically?    This is probably like the third semester I'm gonna fail. I just don't care about school. I know I need a degree for a good future or whatever but I just for want to do it. I'm totally happy just working. I love my job. I just can't do school right now. I've already told my mom I'm taking time off I'm just nervous to tell my dad. When I graduated high school I never thought this would happen. I've gone from an a student with scholarships to a college dropout and I don't care. I've been in meds for about a year but I've stopped going to therapy because I didn't feel that I needed it anymore. I'm happy but I hate school. I guess there's no point to this post I just wanted to talk to some people who have been through something similar maybe.          I'm in my fourth year of college. I haven't had a good semester yet. I just have no desire to go to school. I'm a biology major and have no idea what I would do with it when and if I graduate. All I really want to do is take some time off and discover myself, but that sounds so cliched and pathetic. I haven't seen my therapist in about a month but I've been keeping up with my meds. There isn't really a question I just wondered if anyone else has been down this path before.       I was debating this with a friend earlier. Does the butane in a lighter not completely turn into CO2 and H2O when it's lit? Or does some butane not combust?      I have a drumset with hardware and cymbals that I would like to sell and was wondering where I could most likely get the most money.    I know one day I'll move and I don't know what I'll do with my self if I can't buy family packs.    So I'm in my 4th year of college and I hate it. I'm a bio major and really don't want to do bio related stuff. I'm thinking of taking a semester off and trying to find a hobby or something I want to go to school for. I feel like I can major in anything I want to because I'm still just gonna be working shit jobs when I get out and anything that requires a degree needs just that. A degree. I don't think it matters what kind they just want to see a degree.          And more importantly who would win? What would the major consequences be?   I've struggled with depression for years and have been on medication for the last year. Subsequently my school work has suffered. I'm entering my fourth year of college and I'm still about a year and a half to two years away from a degree. I've bounced between several majors with my current being biology. I feel like my depression is under control now and I'm really happy with my life, but I have no idea why I'm going to school. I don't care about biology and don't plan to do anything with a degree. I just feel like I'm pissing money away for a stupid piece of paper. I also feel like I'm pretty close and might as well just get a bio degree just to have a degree.             It's probably just over thinking, but what do y'all think.    I wanted I write something about an average twenty something living in the time the first space elevator is completed. How it would affect his life and the resulting explosion of space travel.    So I've been waiting for about 8 months and I'm looking for tips on how to increase sales. Luckily I work at a Mexican place so most everyone wants to start off with a $5 queso. But I was just looking for other general tips.       hopefully close to UNT   So I've been in lexapro for about seven months now. It's done an incredible job for me. I feel like a new person, except for one thing. It takes me forever to ejaculate now. It makes sex really tiring and frustrating. I can feel the build up but it vanishes several times. Has anyone had a similar experience and what did you do?      My rabbit doesn't seem to like people that much. He doesn't mind if you pet him but he generally likes to be left alone. Is this just his personality or can I encourage him to come up to us while he is out for some love?      Actors and anchors wear makeup. Men have worn makeup for centuries. Why do men no longer wear make up?   I like klonopin and Xanax but a friend f mine is selling lorazepam. Anyone have any experience? I've found kpins are more smooth than Xanax. Xanax makes me feel a little drunk almost. Edit: got em. Took em. Now playing sims 3. Much fun.       In just looking for games that are fun to play when your altered. Basically no consequences games or apps that are fun to just chillax two man      I live in the mesquite ridge townhouses and I see this cat all the time. Super friendly but it has no tags. I was wondering if anyone knew anything about it. I can't afford to help it if its stray but it's such a nice cat      My therapist recently suggested a family group therapy session. Has anyone had an experience like this? Ideally I would like it to be me my mom my dad and my sister. My moms and dad only talk when necessary. I have no idea why they split and I think finding out like that would be very beneficial. I'm worried about tempers flaring and feelings get hurt and irreprebale emotional damage.       Sometimes I can't find all my subreddits on the sidebar. Any fixes?   Has anyone else had nightmares about their jeans? It sounds so strange but last night i dreamed it was time to clean my jeans, so I got in my car and started cleaning them with a sponge and water and turned on the heater so they would dry. I had horrible horrible dream fades. I also dreamed I put mine in the washing machine and the came out baby blue.   So i've been on lexapro for a few months and in the past couple weeks i got real lazy on taking it at the same time, which led to me missing days and eventually just not taking it when I ran out. I started skipping or cancelling my therapy sessions during this time as well. I think it's because of this that I let my school work slip and now I am failing all my classes. IT all culminated in a breakdown on thursday where i really wasnt sure what I was going to do. Suicide kept racing through my mind so instead I went on a long drive to try and gather my thoughts. In my car I found some papers from my therapy sessions and i read "Is the way you're thinking now going to help your situation"? Suddenly a light went off and I realized I needed to be an adult. So i've been back on the meds for a week and feel so much better. My only problem now is school, which my parents paid for. I plan to tell them very soon that I messed up school because I got off my meds. I'm going to offer to pay them back for this semester and pay for all subsequent schooling my self. I'm also prepared to give my car back to them. I work and pay for my own housing in a city where I dont need a car, so i think i can make it without the car and on my own if i have too. I might have to take a year off school for academic probation which is really scary to me. Has anyone been in a similar situation? I'm just wondering if what im doing is the right and responsible thing. I feel like it is since i was doing well on the meds and I screwed myself over by getting off.   I want text from the feminist perspective and men's rights perspective.   I stopped smoking a month after a mental breakdown of sorts. I've started going to therapy, was diagnosed with depression and have started antidepressants. I'm really excited for 2013. I feel like this will finally be the year I get my life together.      I got some cdbs for Christmas and was wondering if anyone had put  orthotics in theirs. they don't have a removable insole and I usually only put mine in shoes that do.      I don't care what the stupid people you know think. This subreddit is for serious discussion and if you want to be taken seriously use serious sources. /rant   Today I finally told my dad about all the mental problems I've had my whole life. I get stressed and depressed super easily, always feel anxious and have panic attacks and I know I've gotten more withdrawn as years go by. I can't keep up with school and work because I get overwhelmed and give up. I've been sent to therapy twice, once after my parents divorce and after I was kicked out of my universitys housing for paraphernalia charges. I never talked to the therapy either time and i'm really nervous about it. I've never opened up emotionally to anyone before and i'm scared I won't be able to. And what if I do and they tell me i'm just lazy and everything is my fault. Sorry if this is long and doesn't make sense. I would just like to heat from someone who has been in this situation.   I got caught in an unexpected light shower today. I've taken really good care of my denim and I don't want them to randomly be ruined.   Most wikka or pollen boxes I see online are 100-200 dollars. I don't have that kinda money, but I really want one. Has anyone built their own?      My job is cutting hours so I need to find a new one soon. I know this isn't the best time of year to be looking, but any leads would help.    Jebbit hardly has campaigns now, and superpoints is just a logo.   The title basically says it all. I have curly hair and need a hair cut.      How do they fit sleeve length  wise? I'm a tall skinny guy, and I ordered a large. I'm worried it will swamp me, but if I go down a size the sleeves will be too short.   I've heard they are payed decently well and it sounds like easy money.   A lot of the winter and fall clothes I see look too heavy for texas. We get maybe one week of really cold weather. Most of the styles here seem like they would work better in a northeastern climate. I was just looking for some examples of clothing that would work in our climate.            I understand that it's strictly theoretical at this point, but why all the recent buzz? if it was proven at a small scale what applications could we expect. I'm assuming actual warp drives are still years away, but could this research lead to energy or weapons breakthroughs?   I'm open to any suggestions. I like my hair long, but its so thick and curly I don't know how to style it. Any product or haircut suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   I was kicked out of kerr for paraphernalia my freshman year and I would like to offer incoming freshman some tips.  1 Never, ever, ever leave anything in your car. That's how I got caught. Dogs can smell a one hitter in your car.   2 Never leave anything in your dorm.   3 Make friends off campus and stash your pieces there. This is the easiest and best thing to do.   4 Avoid campus when you're riding dirty, especially north Texas avenue. Campus police love pulling people over.   5 If you are caught you will be kicked out of  the dorms, so be prepared. You will also have to go through substance abuse counseling.  6 smoke joints. They leave no evidence.  7 Avoid bike cops. They are the worst.  Feel free to post your advice here or ask questions. I want to help as many people as I can avoid what I went through.   I've always lived stand up and decided that I would like to try it sometime. Any good places in Denton or will I have to go to Dallas?   What's the best way to clean a rats tail? My boys have dirty tails and I never notice them cleaning their tails.   I really really like deep penetration, the only problem is I bottom out and it hurts my gf. Is there any positions or angles we can use to help with this, or is this something we're just gonna have to deal with?   It seems to me that if we could limit term limits we could stop career politicians and possibly lessen the impact of lobbyist.            It works the same way a crop or gizzard does. Big pharma just wants your money   I don't know anything about cabling and I definitely dont understand what anyone is taking about. I just like looking at pictures of messy cables I guess. Anyone else like that on this sub?      My roommate laid this one on me the other day. "Science doesn't tell you the truth, only facts and data".   I noticed last night that one of my little guys has an eye problem. His eye is red and cloudy. Has anyone had a similar experience? I can't afford a vet at the moment, but I'll have a new job soon hopefully.   Automatic weapons exist only to kill people. You don't hunt with them. So why should we be allowed to have them?   After reading about the denver massacre I would like to know how to increase my survival odds during this situation.   My GF and I bought handcuffs earlier today. We've never done any sort of bondage before and have no idea how to incorporate them into our sexy times.   I'm a male and I really don't like the hair around my poop shoot. I've tried shaving before, but it always comes out like a mangy animal.   My roommate has gotten in to eastern spirituality lately and told me yesterday that philosophy was shit. Obviously I'm not going to win a debate with someone who believes in chakra.systems and martians, but.i was wondering if anyone had done reading I could recommend to him. plato meets a platypus got me into philosophy but he thinks it's a childish book that shows how dumb philosophy is.   Edit: I suppose I should mention that he takes acid every two weeks so he.might be fried.         Something similar to HEALTH or Wavves      I have given my rats plenty of comfy spots to sleep, but every time I walk in they are sleeping on the ground. anyone else have rats like this?   So I've smoked dmt a handful of times but only broke through three times. Of those three times, twice I found myself in a large room made of colors/patterns where I watched this woman made of the same colors dance. has anyone had a similar experience?   Currently i am on a oral prescription for ketaaconazle and For the past week or so, every time I smoke weed I get a strange visual distortion in the center of my vision. Its reminiscent of a migraine but it doesn't grow the way migraine visuals do and there's no headache. Has anyone else experienced this and should I be worried?   So I'm over a foot taller than my girlfriend and I also have an above average penis and it seems like not every position works, particularly rear entry. I was just who seeing if anyone else had similar problems and what we could do.         So I have a roommate who seriously believes in crystal healing. There are  rocks all over our place arranged in "energy grids". I was wondering if anyone had any super effective counter arguments. I've already told him that if quartz crystal is magic then all technology would be magic since quartz is silica and I've pointed out the complete lack of scientific proof. He just claims its my masculine energy and western biases that are clouding my mind.   I'm currently a business marketing major, but I find it dull and unfulfilling. I've always loved science and nature and I believe I can do something good with a biology degree. I was just wondering if anyone has been in a similar situation and what you decided.               Does anyone have any advice or links on how to train your rats? I have three and would like to teach them their name and to climb up to my shoulders. Any trick really would be awesome.           Is it an actual scent or is it a pressure thing?   How old were you when you volunteered? Where did you serve? What was the most rewarding and challenging experience you had? What would you recommend for someone interested in volunteering?   Let's just bounce around some ideas here. I just don't understand why you would drop teenage and mutant from the title? Is it supposed to make the concept more believable?   Do you let your rats and cats play? I have two rats and two cats and one rat seems to enjoy playing with the cats. He will chase them around my house and they will wrestle with him. The cats ignore my other rat though and he ignores them. I was just wondering what anyone elses experience is with cats and rats.  	116
 During school I am perfectly fine, I laugh (Well... giggle), smile, and am generally a positive person. I get all my work done in class, I never have homework, I help out people when asked. I try my best to just help. But when I get home I am instantly having suicidal thoughts, I fight with my girlfriend, and I just overall hate everything.  I feel like I'm just a horrible person, I believe I have let my father down. He wanted a smart child who likes what he is into, But I'm not smart in my eyes, and I don't like sports and NASCAR and all of that stuff, I tried to play sports to please him but after I cracked my head I said "I don't want to play sports again" and I haven't. I like games, and girls... I've never heard my parents say "I love you." I know its hard to believe but I just haven't. They don't go out on dates, or kiss or anything. I feel like its my fault. People think, "Oh Travis, You have it was easy you get what you want and can do whatever." But getting what I want isn't fine. My parents do not have a college savings account for me, nor my brother. My brother (who is smart) got a little bit of a scholarship and it makes it easy for him to go. I, however will not get a scholarship, I don't get 100% on tests and I don't do the best work. So, I don't know what I'll do for college. I don't want my family to take out another loan. I would like my parents to just go out on dates, and act like a married couple. I take medicine but the dosage seems to be too small, if I take 2 I'm happy all day and everything is fine. I noticed myself getting depressed after a break-up, I tried so hard to make everything up and talk to her, I wrote a 6 page letter to her, and she just ignored it. Awhile later I had tried to search our home for a pistol we keep for safety. I searched often when no one was home and could never find it, and I'd usually end up sitting on the bed and crying. On my birthday, sadly, I had tried to OD. My birthday wasn't good.  I don't want to die, and I don't want to have these thoughts, but they won't leave me alone. I just want to have my parents be a couple, I want my my father to say hes proud of me, And I want to be happy.  Help?   Ah, thank you. And one last thing, do you know how much a Gold Botkiller Rocket Launcher is?   Thank you, so its 20keys or a bud?   Thank you!   What are the prices on these?            :o I'll pay   For the love of all the is tasty, I need a box or two. D: I miss them!   But... But... I want some too..   I'm from Arizona, we don't have much but if you like any Arizonian snack and you happen to have some Oreo O's, I will gladly try my best to get the snack you want!   Can/Will/Does anyone have Oreo O's that they can ship to Arizona, USA? I miss that sweet cereal...            http://i.imgur.com/g14IF.jpg  Life on mars.      I like this. Very much.   One apple per every 4 chests.   For the love of that is notch, can you put animals in. The real DayZ has Cows and Boars, so why can MineZ have Cows and Pigs?  I was way out in x 800 z -3000, in giant open fields and no town near, and I starved.. so please put animals in.   Shit Tyrone, get it together.   From English: Big ass titties.

I was wondering if any of you fine non-zombie people would actually donate to make a DayZ Lingor Island server in the US. I know a person who is whitelisted for a spot by the Lingor Hive. The only problem is we'd need money to host it. It'd be the only US server.  So, would anyone actually donate?      Ah, didn't see. Thanks :D   Except for sex.      I think this would be an amazing map to play DayZ on.      Honestly, its all good. You can keep trying to kill us, like the [NC] Clan. We're waiting.   Come at me bro.   Thank you for the hour long fire fight, deaths, and walk backs to the hill. I'm sorry a hacker had to come in a ruin the fun, hopefully we can fight again. But why would you have a camp up there in the hill?   Back when you spawned with a Mak, I shot a kid for lols.   I jumped...   Well, you gave me a good impression of the game which led me to buy it. :D   When you spawn in it'll say "Day x" (x being the day you've been alive)   This is what you get if you upload the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXIpPORrOKo   Uploading the video to YouTube at the moment.   lol its alpha   It was my first character ever made in Day Z, I spawned in Cherno (Though I didn't know that was its name). I had somehow found a friend, who was new as well and thought me how to use voice comm. We went around the building and found the hospital. I stumbled upon some Anti-Biotics and headed up the roof. I called for my friend to come look at the view and I made a dash for the ladder to see if he was coming, I ran off the roof and died instantly.   Oh, you fancy huh?   LOL   Yes. Yes. Yes.   wow, we're all in Chandler!!   A girl who likes me sent this to me, it always makes me smile.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0Ohl3MMq0o  Shes an amazing girl.   http://bit.ly/rDo49S  I mean really.   lol dont join unless you like to get raped by the AI      ART! D:   Russian server, very peaceful.   Welcome to the dark side, we've been expecting you.         I'm sorry, I don't have enough money to gift you it. Hopefully someone else will help you! I'm sorry. Have faith! The reddit community is full of good, friendly, and kind people! Hope to see you around DayZ sometime, hopefully soon ;)!   I know what I'm going to do now...  I keep reading this, its just so good..   It'd be amazing getting a free copy, I could play with my friend who I literally do everything with, It'd just be nice to finally play a survival game with her and not play WoW all the time. Thank you for being super generous. Have a wonderful day.   I feel like I've killed you before...   Most of the day.   I did this today as well. TX20, It's very fun.   Contact me here or VIA steam. (test_subject7776)   Amazing shot.   fags.   LOL Oh god, Olive, you, you're a funny man.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVvxCdNv2vc      Ah, thank you both very much! :D   I was wondering what Add-on you need in order to have high quality skins and such? Any help would be appreciated!   Must have.   T'is a big bitch.   We're not mad. :P   So we were playing Day Z (7 of us) and we were in an open field checking a deer stand (of course it had nothing), we heard a shot and one of us died, we all proned down and DC'd. (Yes wussy move, wanna fight about it?) We reconnected to a new server and messed around in the field recollecting ourselves and healing our injured. The moment we were all ready to go we heard another shot and again, another friend got shot and died. We all hit the deck and now we're just waiting it all out.  Now I'm scared.   AHHHH THIS GUY!   You lead our group through the thick and thin, but in the end you just couldn't get to the ladders fast enough...      It's pretty sexy :3   I tried to get a real screenshot, but eh it takes pictures of my wallpaper instead.   lmao.   So I spawned in, found a house and a nice pair of Binoculars, I took them and then.. well these just randomly spawned. I can't pick them up, and they don't look like hatchets and crowbars...      How old are you?   priceless.   Oh god, this is amazing.   I'm on -7 time, but I'll play!   Anyone?   Steam. test_subject7776   I'll group with you.   Okay, Will do mate! :D   Sometimes, not really though. And Far, far, far away. At the coast.   Alrighty, My steam ID is my Reddit name!   If you don't trust me, you don't trust me. I'm not going to blame you. But I don't kill.   I'm from AZ too! Though I am not high skilled.   You. I want to be in your group.

 Love the boobs, and you're very pretty.   I have tried full face masks, but don't use them regularly.  Some of them go over the chin, some go to the little dip in your chin below the "base" of your lower teeth.  They should not sit on your teeth at all, if it does, then it's too small.  The only full face mask I have ever seen that "strapping it down super tight" makes it fit better is one that looks like a fireman's mask, has like a clear open visor goes all the way up above your eyebrows and down to that dip below your lower teeth on your chin.  To give you an example, often times I will measure small or medium in over the nose masks, but small usually ends up with it leaking if I move much in most masks.  So there's the possibility you could go medium or large and they picked medium and it just isn't big enough to cover your face sufficient when you move a little causing leaks.   Looking at your specific mask.  The top strap is going to change how much that upper piece flexes against your forehead...if it's flexing even a little it should be tight enough to hold the mask to your nose at the top.  The lower strap you need to adjust it when you lay back in your normal sleeping position because if you adjust it sitting upright it won't fit right at all once you lay down.   Just get it close, then lay down and readjust WITH THE MACHINE ON.  Then your mask should be JUST loose enough to pick the whole mask up slightly off your face and seat it again where you think it needs to be.   Then reason you pick it up off your face and put it back down is so that the rolled in edges of the piece on your face aren't pinched or pushed out of the mask causing it to leak.  They need to be inside the mask and against your face to it forms a pocket of air pushing out on the silicon pad walls making it conform to your face.   You just need your straps to be tight enough so that it conforms but doesn't make "fart" or squeaking noises indicating it's too loose.  I think your mask might be too small.  And from my experience MOST cpap users don't use full face masks when they've had some options to try and find one they like....it's either a nasal pillow (in the nose) or a around the nose type mask.   Full faces are usually for people who can't keep their mouth closed (which is also a sign of your cpap not being treated well) or who have facial issues like slackness due to strokes.   If you're really set on getting a full face mask...try looking into the fire fighter looking mask..  which is infact called a TOTAL face mask.    http://www.cpap.com/productpage/respironics-fitlife-total-full-face-cpap-mask-headgear.html  Can browse there for other ideas on stuff too, they have a pretty good selection.  A lot of doctor offices only carry one brand of masks or machines and kind of let you think it's your only options.   All of it sounds pretty normal for me.    I don't go out much at all anymore.  I make a whole lot of stuff into awkward dirty jokes and I'm allergic to bananas, they give me a itchy mouth which sounds stupid..but yeah.  Plus people look silly eating them.  In SW Ohio.   You should be able to run it off the car battery, but I would check into it as it could damage the units.  I know there were some people that came into a local support group talking about how they can no longer recommend a whole line of stuff for CPAPs due to issues and it voiding the warranties, etc.  They make special batteries for them, but they ALSO make little portable cpap units for using on flights and things that come with it's own battery unit that is pretty much small enough to like strap to your leg.  I forget the MFG.  For example, they were recommending marine batteries for cpaps due to how long they hold charge and put out power...now they no longer do that.      You = hot.  Let's hope you can't sleep more often?.....or something.   I do most of my book consumption video audiobooks.  And I find music to not add much to the experience and often detract from it.  I think they used to use it to make it easier to fastforward through cassettes and stuff where you could hear the sped up audio and it just kind of stuck.    But.....unless you can prove it's really adding to the situation I'd avoid it.   Also, while it's not asked for.  Pronunciation is something that drives me crazy, even more so if they pronounce the same word differently since you don't have the text in front of you to check wtf they are trying to say.  Oh and characters with similar names, or names that start with similar sounds start to get rather confusing to me when there's a lot of dialog.    I like what I've seen so far.  More requested.   1) If there is a shortage, these tradesman schools should have companies PAYING people's way through the school to get a standardized education they can build off of.  1b)  Companies are not doing this because they are purposefully driving wages down and using any and all excuses they can to do it.  2) Companies are looking at eminent failure if they don't have the people they need to do the work.  2b)  Again, they are outsourcing it and using any and all excuses to do so.  It's just a flat out lie.  3) You can't expect people to work at Walmart pay and also tell them that there should be dignity in their work.  3b)  Paying people minimum wage just reinforces that the job is not "skilled" or "desirable".  Which is another way they are driving the jobs to foreign labor and outsourcing when they can.    The only time this is going to change is when these companies keep assuming that the labor they find elsewhere is what they would get at the 80k+ range in the US...and it blows up in their face.   Then I hope workers who have been putting up with shit pay for the same work rake them over the coals nice and good to demonstrate how each and every other company out there doing this crap will suffer a similar fate come their "turning point".   College education requirement stuff is heading the same way.  It's like the exact opposite of Henry Ford's strategy.  Paying people enough so they can buy what they make....has turned into keeping prices the same and making more per unit while the people buying them make effectively less and less each year.  GENIUS!    How long would you say this took?   If you don't mind saying.    Ah only on the second part of the study then.  6cm is I THINK below the threshold.  I believe they told me a 7cm is like "normal" breathing pressure...but I could be wrong it's been awhile since I've been on anything under 10cm.  I actually went from a 14 to a 10cm recently due to medication changes...so always keep this in mind that medication CAN change your pressure if you suddenly get worse.  Drinking will too, I don't drink...but drinking is something they warn a lot against.   I think I've been on Cpap since.....2007ish.  And I've had 3 titration testings, the original and two re-titrates.  1 was due to a machine failure and wanting to make sure the pressure wasn't off, and the other was recently for medication changes and feeling like crap...got a new machine since it had been over 5 years.   My first titration was horrible, granted they were in a hospital building and I could hear things going down the hall and lots of external lights.  They moved to a new more separate location with more "bedroom" type designs and better light blockage etc.  But I had figured out what bugged me most about the room, was that it was too quiet.  I use an air filter at home and it's just generally noisier in the room I sleep in, and the quiet was just unnerving.  To combat the quiet they were able to get a box fan and place it in the room with me to create some noise.  The wires suck too, but it's better to just be cautious but sleep how you wanna sleep and wires be damned to be honest...because if you can't get to sleep..they aren't going to get any meaningful readings.  Oh they also had some sleep number beds, which were kinda fun to play with...much better than "hospital bed" beds.    To get heated hoses you need a machine that supports it OR you can get one that is a third party hose and has a separate power brick to heat the hose..  My friend has one of the third party hoses and likes it, so either will work, but the built into the machine hose makes it use water a lot more efficiently which is just such a big difference for me.  AND this just came to me.  The newest machine offerings on CPAPs can be put into a "auto mode" where it will evaluate for itself what kind of pressure you need to some degree.  So they can send you home with the machine and it will try to figure out your needed pressure too so they have another source of information to pool from if the over night stays don't work out.  I don't know how much they use this, but I insisted they do it for me because I didn't believe I went from a 14cm to 10cm given that i had gained weight...and everything pretty much agreed.  Still want a longer heated hose....if any of you CPAP MFGs are reading this....10 foot heated hoses!    Have you tried sleeping without a pillow?  You might be holding your head differently because of the mask.  Ive found a lot of pillows to be rather uncomfortable with the masks and make me have to lay oddly causing neck pain, etc.  Also your mask shouldn't be too tight, they recommend allowing two fingers between the strap and face easily for "tightness" on most.  I know my back would hurt on CPAP because I wouldn't lay naturally with the mask on due to the tubing and everything else and being afraid of pulling the machine off the table for quite awhile.  The hose management thing took away the fear of pulling the machine off since it would have taken extreme force to do it.   Look at buying a hose management device if you can't move in bed without your mask coming off.  Cpap.com has some examples....I bought the "Hoser" or something like that.  Stopped having to wrestle the mask every time I moved.  Most I had to do was spin the connection on it to take pressure off the side that was pulling and move it to over my head or just unbind it where it got caught.    You may need a longer hose...which currently heated hoses are only 6 foot and people need to bug the hell out of them to make 8 and 10 foot ones so you can use management systems more easily.    Have been on CPAP for a number of years, go to regular support group sessions a local sleep center offers.   I would recommend seeing if a support group exists because the people there will have ideas and recommendations most doctors won't even consider for comfort.  1) You can analyze the data yourself.  I have no experience with it but some of the companies even had bluetooth enabled things you can plug into the machine.  2) I don't use a UPS, but you need to make sure it doesnt beep when the power fails because that'll drive you crazy.  One bad night is not the end of the world, but going on three and you'll want to murder your power company.  3)  Once it's successfully treated:  You find a mask you like, you use it all night, and you've visited your doctor for a follow up visit after using it for a month....you SHOULD have knocked out daytime sleepiness.    Hypertension may be alleviated some, but generally I found that if you are on meds you will stay on meds to deal with it unless you lose weight or find some other cause.    Teeth grinding, it did absolutely nothing for me in stopping this.  In fact they seem almost to ignore it completely as a symptom of sleep apnea unless you notice it increasing/getting worse.  Some people recommend taking your mask to your dentist if you are getting fitted for any appliances because it can cause discomfort and stuff lines up a little different.  Morning headaches SHOULD be gone.  They were for me.  Although Ill wake up with a headache now and then depending on the weather, allergies, etc.  Feeling like crap......you should notice a marked difference a month in.  And it should only get better once you get more used to the machine.   My biggest beef with CPAPs in the current generation is that their heated hoses are too damn short.  A 6 foot hose is just long enough to get hung on everything but not long enough to elevated up off the bed and allow for tossing and turning.  I bought a hose management thing that works kind of like a fishing reel for my old machine and it made a HUMONGOUS difference in how much I had to futz with the mask in the night and uncoil myself.  Made for a much more sound sleep where I could just roll over and not wake up enough to remember.  So if by chance they do have a longer than 6 foot heated hose, GET IT is my recommendation.   The new machines are WAY better on water usage with their new humidifier designs and heated hoses....so you aren't draining the tank empty in dry dies and waking up with a dried out nose or crazy dry mouth.  If you're opening your mouth while sleeping, it's probably because of lack of humidity on CPAP.  Also build up a small collection of different masks.  Sometimes heavier masks are more comfortable in winter....or sometimes you'll get a pimple or ingrown hair and a different style mask will give it time to heal.  They also make sleeves for the hose, which kind of did the same thing as the heating on hoses does now.  But it also keeps you from touching cold hard plastic at night that might be distracting.  And use DISTILLED WATER in your humidifier, anything else builds up gunk on the bottom of your humidifier and causes you to inhale water that has a "smell" to it when it becomes gaseous and might irritate you.  It's cheap and now that they use so little water a gallon lasts me nearly 2 months so far, and saves you from having to use vinegar to break up the build up every few months.    If you wake up with dried out eyes, it's a sign that your mask may be leaking by your nose.  Sometimes it can't be helped if you really like a certain style mask...and wearing a sleeping mask will keep it from really bothering you if you can't adjust it to stop it.    What do you hope to do once you graduate as a chemistry student?   What kind of games do you develop?   I don't know about passion, but I enjoy fantasy fiction and some sci-fi books.  I usually listen to the audiobook versions if I can get my hands on them.   More of a thinker and a reader than a go out and do kind of person.   Just as a random thread I picked to read, you might want to take a moment to put some info about your book in the post when do giveaways.  Might generate some buys even if they don't win.   I know you included links, but never hurts to put a little more info in the post to catch eyes......maybe?   Sure, sounds like it could be informative.  Always wondered how much an impact the "test" readers had on the process.   What is expected of beta readers?  I do not believe I have read Hollow World or Riyria, but I have been known to confuse authors and book titles.   I like the coy smile.   Yep.  They also do this same thing with fake checks.  Chances are the "carrier company" is bogus as well.  Few things to look for obvious form letter responses.  Never mentions the  vehicle/item in question.  Can't name the carrier company or you can't find it when looking it up.  Easy test is to respond and mention a completely different car make/model and jack up the price a bunch to cover possible "fees" paypal, etc might have.  If he doesn't care, then scam....who cares what you get if it's free.    Anything boob related.  Sucking them, nipple clips, titfucking.    Oh and spanking, enough to leave a good red hand print....on her.   Hello, I'll give it a shot 35M.  Lurker on Reddit, made the account today.  	23
 I have the Hogwarts crest, Always, and the dark mark    I have tattoos. Like three so far. And more on the way. That's how I rep the wizarding world!!!    Maybe post a link to it? I can't find it....   Why is r/Hogwarts private?    I was just wondering if there was a sub reddit for Hogwarts.    In the audiobooks, it's pronounced Voldemore. In the paper books and movies, it's Voldemort. Someone help?    Not true, they die in the reverse order.    I actually started at 24mgs because that's the amount a real cigarette has. It's actually better than the patch in my opinion because you still have the hand to mouth, which is what did me in so many times. The hand to mouth habit is the true killer in smoking, and vaping really helps with that. The patch won't satisfy that feeling, so you're more likely to go back to smoking.    One nice thing about vaping is that you can progress down!! I'm currently on zero nicotine, but I like the flavour I use. So I continue to do it anyways.    So I don't know how to post how long it's been for me, but it's been over a year now. The e cigarette is a joke. I tried one for a while, and I fucking hated it. What you want to do is go to the nearest vape shop. Look it up, google can tell you where it is. Go in and tell them your story. They will help you out. I have a regular shop I go to, and they are some of the nicest, most supportive people I've met (besides my girlfriend of course.)   Keep it up!! You can do it!!  	10

 I went with the 300mg advice. I felt absolutely nothing, except a little floaty feeling in my hands and legs.   I did a 50mg test dose. No adverse effects. I went with the 300mg advice. I felt absolutely nothing, except a little floaty feeling in my hands and legs.   Okay, it's my first time ever taking Adrafinil. I have looked up dosages and stuff but nothing says anything about first timers. I capped my own powder, just 2 caps, both were 600mg. Is this too much for a beginner? Any help is appreciated!  I weigh 122 lbs or 55 kg. If that helps at all.  	3
 I'm looking to be the first to get quadrupal depression. It cancels out and I live a perfectly normal, happy, life with the occasional fits of hysterical sobbing.   No Michael, an illusion is something.... Wait... Shit   BEES?   Reddit, I'm in the school library and I have a file saved on the computer next to mine because our student drive hasn't worked for 3 weeks. The guy currently on the computer will not get up, despite being asked politely. What can I put up on the screen to get him to move without getting kicked out of school?   Ok, so after flashpoint, I get the how what and why of the new u, and I'm enjoying the non justice league titles. My question however is almost all of the titles seem to be reboots showing the heroes close to the beginning of their careers, which is fine and I get. However, it states that supers have only been around for a few years and based on today's releases, batmans gone through 3 robins and is on his 4th who is his 11 year old son; and the events of killing joke, rip, the year be was dead, return of bw, and batman Inc have clearly all happened, as have the lantern Corp wars.  Is there something I'm missing as to why everyone but bats and lanterns is just starting out, is everyone else lost but an explanation should be coming, or is this "because fuck you I'm grant fucking Morrison that's why?"  Edit: I understand this is not proper reddiquette but who the hell downvoted this? I was literally just asking a question I was confused about. How are there three people who though "there's something he doesn't completely comprehend and needs clarification on... NOOO!"  I understand if this is even read again that i'll get slammed for this but original three downvoters, wtf?   You can seek help wherever is comfortable, If you have a general practitioner, you trust, they can absolutely refer you. If you don't, cold calling can be scary and nerve wracking, but sometimes you just have to follow your instincts.  One way or the other, find someone soon. There is nothing wrong with you, but you do sound like you could use some extra support. Until then, you are beautiful and loved, and we are here to help whenever you need it.      Very long bad relationship had ended recently and I was interested in pursuing a mutual friend. Before I go on I should clarify that I have clinical depression and very low self worth, which i know is fairly every day for reddit, but it pertains to the story. My default assumption is that everyone hates me. I'm not overstating that, the only people I know 100% of the time that love me are my parents.   So when I say that it was a big, hard deal asking her out, understand that it was a big, hard deal asking her out.   But she said yes! I have never been so elated in my life. Even the previous relationship didn't start off with me asking the girl out and her saying yes. So we talked for a few weeks, planning and trying to make the schedule work but nothing ever happened. Things kept coming up. We eventual grew apart over some differences of opinion between my ex and ex's current bf. On a later phone call with ex, she told me that the girl never liked me, and only said yes because she was scared of me and what I might do if I said no, (my depression was undiagnosed at the time and this was high school so any abnormal emotional reaction meant you were 2 steps away from bringing in a rifle.)  tl;dr My ex informed me a new romantic interest only agreed to go out with me because she was scared of me.   HA! YOU CALLED HIM FAT! YOU'RE FUNNY, YOU'RE A FUNNY GUY! AND COMPLETELY IGNORING THAT THAT LANGUAGE IS JUST COMMON VERNACULAR FOR SMITH WITH NO ILL INTENT, GENIUS AND FUNNY.

Why? ffffffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu.         http://www.reddit.com/r/MercWithAMouth/ r/deadpool was taken by others so... done and done.   I dig Dylan as a songwriter, and Times They are a chanin' is on my ipod. Singing otherwise is not my cup of tea.   Yeah, I'm a fine arts major in school so a lot of my friends can be on the hipster side, so I can hear it about country from time to tim.   Starting off, I do love Nickleback and don't understand why they are hated as much as they are.    His name is Robert Paulson   Dell. Fuck everything about them. Two inspiron laptops died within a year of each other. When I sent the first laptop in, it took them 3 months to get it diagnosed and replaced and that was only after me calling and complaining multiple times. Then they were so mind fuckingly incompetent that they "fixed" the old laptop and sent it back to me. I use the quotes because I gave that to my mom and it died within a month.  Never again.    This one is a long shot but if I'm ever going to find it, you guys'll do it. Since I can remember, my father's been telling me about a book he once read that had his favorite one liner ever in it. A detective or a cop walks into an ME's office and says "Well, is it murder?" and the ME Responds "Either that or the most thorough suicide I've ever seen"  Google, book stores, and librarians have failed me. I know it's a long shot but does anyone recognize this line and know what book it's from. It'd make a really great Fathers day gift for him.   The dreams don't stop for a while. I'll get back to you on when they do exactly, I'm on three years.  If you want for health reasons to loose weight then that's wonderful, but motivate for yourself fuck everyone else. In terms of physical appearance, I'm a writer so I can tell certain things from syntax and word choice, and I promise you that you are a beautiful person.   Don't give up on mental health professionals, you'll find someone, just keep trying. You need help and you're worth the effort. It may take some time, but you will find the right fit.   Yeah, it's the fuckin' nights man. Stumble across a pic of an old interest or even just a couple enjoying each other and it all floods in.   I also didn't pick the best of schools I'm guessing. Private university in florida, the preppy to nerd ratio doesn't come down in my favor. I've had more than a few awkward moments in class cracking a futurama joke and getting blank stares....  Thanks for the sentiment though, that's encouraging.    You have no reason to care about me or my life and if you aren't in the mood for a long read, by all means skip this one because there won't be a tldr. Reddit, I don't get it. I suffer from depression, and have for a long long time, though it was only diagnosed a few months ago. But even with that knowledge, there's still so much I don't understand. A lot of my issues stem from lonlines, which I'm sure is shocking coming from a guy on the internet at 3am. However, I can't figure out what I'm missing. I'm relatively smart, have the ability to make people laugh, I'm overweight but haven't quite passed into ugly. What's the secret ingrediant to finding people that I missed? Did they teach it in school one day that I was sick. I'm not talking about a wife or my soul mate, that will come when it comes, I'm talking about a woman who can spend time with me and say you are worth spending more time with/on. Again I'm not asking for the rest of my life, but I see women all the time in these long term relationships with absolutely retched people, it makes me insane. It's a running joke with my friends that my life is a sitcom but it really is full of stereotypical bullshit that I just don't know how to get past or get around. Which leads to my other point. The loneliness is saddening and crushing and I don't know why. The fact of the matter is things happen at different times for different people and I know I'll find someone eventually, but it's been twenty two years and while I know that mentally, emotionally it's just like this gorge of sadness and desperation that I can't seem to cross. 22 years and not one girl has ever thought to say yes or ask me out on a date. I can't figure out how to get past this or why I need to. My time is coming, I know this. I'm smart, funny, cuteish, and can write fairly well, I know it will get there. But till then there's nights like tonight. Stumbling across pictures of the "almost had it" and just sliding down the walls, and I just don't know why. If you read this, thank you for your time, it means the world.   Thank you, I really appreciate the sentiment.The small difference is that I have an a-typically presenting depressive disorder, I find and recognize joy in every day life, but then if a downswing hits I can think on those fondly, but not truly happily.   If we go back to the gorge metaphor, if I slide down a wall a little bit, I can stop and enjoy the foliage growing on that wall, and even scoot back up a bit, until sliding down a bit further.   Warning!!! Downer to follow. I need to rant, maybe exercise some demons.

If you read this, thank you for your time, it means the world.    I was just screwed by my colleges financial aid tacking on an extra semester to school, meaning that I'm going to have to pay an extra 7000 dollars to graduate which may mean more loans as most of my scholarships expire after year four. I desperately need a job, even more so now that I zerod out my bank account to get my car towed and looked at to determine that the timing belt I had replaced six months ago snapped again, and I don't have money to fix it. But if you don't have reliable transportation, most companies are turning you down out of hand. My mentor through college is getting laid off because the head of our department is a jelous territorial cunt who can't stand that my mentor is more talented and well liked than her. This is causing major stress in terms of finding work and is severely damaging her marriage to a guy who has become one of my closest friends. I also recently found out that my grandfather is dying of colon cancer and while he still should have a few good months, probably won't live to see me graduate college, which he would have if this snafu hadn't happened and I was walking in two weeks. No entertaining stories but I could use a pick me up.   Abortion is state sponsored murder. I'm a democrat with a lot of feminist friends, we don't talk about this...   THATS what it was   I...

I'm working on it, I've been power reading through so it's burried my history and that's a google search I'm not going too specific on.   That's my thing. They once did a joke about snorting crushed d d die off of an 11 year old boys ass. They've done way worse.   Original: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/8/11/  Response: http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2010/8/13/   Please please please please keep this reasoned and cool headed. I just want an actual discussion and finding out what other people think about the dickwolves controversy from the last few months.  How I view things right now.  It was a joke. An off color joke that wasn't meant to offend but was inevitably going to. If you go back and read the original script, it was a commentary on "heroic" gaming culture and there is no conceivable way that it can be read as supporting rape.   That being said, they could have handled the fallout better. They shouldn't have apologize, nor should they have been asked to, and the follow up comic about the matter was perfect. However, pressing the issue just to press it with the t shirt and all of that was not necessary and shouldn't have been done.   When it comes down to it it was a joke, a joke I personally laughed at, and I have had rape touch my life in multiple incidents. If you were offended by it, then I'm sorry but sometimes people are going to make jokes that are going to offend you and that doesn't mean that they are advocating the position that did the offending.   For those saying this issue is done with, what spawned me writing this was going through the back catalog and researching their development for inspiration and I came across timelines and opinion pieces, it's very much not dead.  Just wanted some other people's thoughts and opinions on the issue.   Downvoted for incorrectly identifying a beauty and the beast reference as Raymond.   Really any monologue by Sorkin but this one has been ringing with me the past few months   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWRVbWMvi7c   Relevant http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hfYJsQAhl0 feature=related   For light depression maybe but for my case and what I gather to be this man's case, it's a chemical imbalance and outside of Neo level thought control no, you cannot just think yourself happy.   Speaking as someone who suffers from clinical depression, I would ask that you stop pimping bullshit pseudoscience and do a little bit of research into how crippling and hellacious an experience it is, and how for 95% of us, it's a bit harder than being stronger and realizing "fear is a facade" or whatever else you heard at that particular hotel ballroom.    I grew up in the south, so there were a lot of rednecks and bullies. The rednecks who would throw out hateful speech left and right and assume you would agree with them, and the bullies who strutted around the place thinking they were top shit when you knew how sad they really were but also knew how readily and totally they could fuck your shit up so you just steered clear and had a begrudging respect for them even if you didn't agree with them.  In 8th grade the rednecks and bullies started feuding at it was the most wonderful piece of MADD come to life I've ever seen. Many people from both groups were expelled.  I wanted this to be like that... I'm sad now.   TL;DR I wish a fight from junior high had repeated itself.   Isn't a preemptive edit just a post?  	43
 The last time I watched SSY, I think my mind was spinning from everything that happens in the end that the impact was lost a little bit. This time I'm determined to watch it properly!   It's taken my second watch to realise that maybe Yakomaru/Squealer's shift in name has deeper meaning than his new, recognised autonomy and authority. When he was named Squealer, he was cowardly and seemingly sold Saki and Satoru out. He's almost literally squealing to save his own skin.   I don't really know how to feel about Squealer/Yakomaru even now that I've almost finished rewatching SSY...   Arguably one of the more interesting characters in Shinsekai Yori, I thought it would be awesome to see what other people thought of him. What do you think of the change in his personality? Do you think he was plotting everything from the start?   This discussion is to be strictly about Squealer/Yakomaru so spoilers are fine. I mean, it's a bit hard not to discuss a character without talking about everything they've done, right?    I've nearly finished watching Shinsekai Yori and I'm just blown away by the impact it has. Like you, it's leaving me deep in thought and I can't help but feel really...dark. SSY isn't a happy anime by any stretch and I think it's meant to really challenge its audience. Ultimately, I think it makes us think a lot about human nature, and nature of ethics. It's hard not to find myself thinking about not only the characters and the plot, but the deeper themes of the anime as well. SSY is probably the best anime I've ever seen.   	4
 I wanna lick you.    It's funny. I was thinking that you were a beautiful child when I looked at this. Even though you had long hair as a kid, still.   Um, you were always adorable. Dat smile.    Neil Patrick Harris?  Also, you are attractive. Wow.   DAMN.   God you are so good at this.   Apparently, you look like several different celebrities. And asian.   That's gonna be one handsome little devil.   It was just before my 17th birthday. It was unprotected, in the laundry room, up against a dryer. We tried four different positions and lasted a good half hour, surprisingly, because it was the first time for both of us. And, 'til this day, the sight of a dryer turns me on.   Whyyyyy would someone downvote this.   Flushing the toilet.   When I read this, I read "evil-doer" as "evil-deer"   Holy crap. Please tell him that he looks gorgeous.    La Crosse, WI   i think /r/ladyboners would like you.   Your dog is Fizzgig.   For some reason I am imagining you drunk.   Well. I don't want my soup anymore.    I think I puked, but I'm not sure because of the disgusting sensory overload this comment just gave me.   I almost shit my pants seeing my username. For two incredibly stupid and perhaps conceited seconds, I thought that this post was dedicated to me.     I have so many, I can't even pick. I have nightmares every night. I am also a very vivid dreamer, which is nice when I'm having a good dream, but usually I'm not. Probably five nights out of seven I wake up and have a hard time differentiating between reality and non-reality because every detail in the dream is exactly the way it looks, feels, tastes, smells and sounds like in real life. It is perfect to the level of Inception. But I will tell three of my particularly disturbing dreams, in chronological order.  The first disturbing dream I remember happened when I was five years old. I had a dream that trees were mad that humans were using them for paper and our own selfish needs and so they revealed that they could talk (they actually looked a lot like the trees in the Wizard of Oz, except more menacing) and they took over the world. There were particular types of trees, like the birch and the sequoia (among others), that they had rejected because they were "peaceful" and didnt want to harm the humans. Anyway, the dominating tree types had put all humans in concentration camp-looking places and at meal times they gave us a plate with three different types of bark on it. Two  of the types were from the "dominating" tree races that had died naturally and the other was from the "lesser" trees that they had killed. If you were lucky youd get something like birch, because if you happened to eat the bark from the dominating trees, you were deemed unworthy to serve the trees because you were unable to differentiate between your "masters" and your "enemies." In the dream, I was sitting on my cousin's lap (she used to babysit me a lot) and I remember picking up my fork and pointing to each one. She had become great at telling the difference so she always helped me. She told me which one not to eat, and because I was a child, of course I ate that one. Immediately, the tree-guard standing by me picked me up and threw me into its gaping mouth. It digested me and I could feel my legs burning as I heard my cousin's hysterical screams. Then I woke up.  The second one was when I was about thirteen or fourteen. I had watched Disturbia with one of my friends and about a month later, I had this dream. I was sitting on the couch, watching static on the TV as it stormed outside. The way our house was set up, you could see all the way to the back door in the kitchen two rooms away from the living room. Lighting crashed and i saw a shadow of a man in the livingroom. I looked to the right and I saw the Killer from Disturbia staring into the glass of the back door. The light from the static on the TV barely reached him, so the shadows made his eyes look like empty sockets. We stared at each other for a good ten seconds before he opened his mouth ghoulishly wide and screamed in rage. He started trying to smash the window in and I bolted upstairs and leaped underneath the covers. In my dream, I poked my finger through one of the holes that was *actually in my covers in real life*. I pulled out some of the polyester filling nervously and started playing with it, hoping he wouldnt find me. Suddenly, I heard loud rapping on my window that was right across the room from my bed. It thundered again, and I realize now that this is when I woke up, but in real life I could still hear the rapping at the window, and I was still playing with the filler because I had taken it out in my sleep. I lied in bed for a good hour before I peeked out from under the covers and saw a tree branch tapping on my window and realized it wasn't real. My body ached for a couple days after that from that hour of tensing up in pure terror.  The last one I'll tell happened last night. I'll tell you an abridged version since this comment is already way too long. Basically, my boyfriend and I started living with these people who were in a cult and lived in the shittiest, low down abandoned house you can imagine. Think Fight Club but multiply the shittiness by about ten. I went into the bathroom in our room to wash my face, and i opened the mirrored cabinet door to find a cut up baby and its face was right on the level of my face. I was frozen. And then it smilled and laughed at me. Its mouth started spurting blood along with its other body parts. In the dream I had just found out I was pregnant.    I'm not sure if this is mean or not, but it made me really angry. I am not one bit overweight and my (now ex) boyfriend told me that I should work out because he "wanted to see what it was like" to see me smaller. And then he said, "If I dont like it, I'll tell you to gain weight back." Then, after a little more thinking on his part, he said, "Nevermind, I like you the way you are. Don't do anything."  I never said that I didnt like the way I looked or anything, and he never took into consideration what i wanted my body to look like. It was just as if he owned it and could tell me what to do with it.    No.  Your cat's high.   The first song I heard by them was Panic Switch and I instantly obsessed, but then it sort of died out a little. I forgot about this song for a while and now im hooked again.   I know that feel, bro. I'm basically still a lurker, except I'm the Oprah of upvotes.   Does anyone know what I'm talking about when I say that this is maybe a million times worse than Talking Tina from The Twilight Zone?   I regularly babysat for my neighbor's daughter, and the day this happened was just a regular day. We were walking to the park, and in the parking lot she saw a puddle that had oil in it, which was making a rainbow. She looked at it and looked up at me to see that I had seen it as well. I smiled back at her. We didn't mention it for the rest of the night. It was just one of those mundane and seemingly insignificant occurrences.  I feel I should also mention that she hardly ever talked except to say something absolutely brilliant and creative, except she was a little morbid.   I was scared to see her at night, since she looked like a typical little girl that should have been in a horror movie (blue eyes that pierced through your soul, pale with very dark brown hair that could have been black, nightgown etc.) and it was usually at night when she woke up to deliver one of these glimpses into her strange little mind.  She had gotten out of bed absolutely silently and had stepped slightly in  front of me, where I was sitting on the couch, watching TV. I jumped a little. Never got used to it.  She asked me, "That rainbow? That we saw on the ground today? It fell from the sky, and it died, didn't it?" Then she got really close to my face.  "And you just SMILED."   I was too creeped out to go back there. Now when I see one of those puddles on the ground I get shudders. Her mind must be a scary place.   Best comment I have read all day.   Oh my god. These kids are terrible...it makes me wonder what kind of things they have experienced to be able to do that to someone...such bad things happen in this world.   	29
 I need absolute quiet when I'm sleeping. Thats the reason I wear headphones to bed (it's done the trick til now). Rain sounds sooth me but I can't fall asleep with them. Thanks though!   whats a white noise machine?   Recently my flatmates have taken to watching tv on their laptop in the hall of our flat. There are three of them and it only started happening recently. They put on youtube clips of movies, songs (and sing a long with them) and talk really loudly. Sometimes they scream and one tends to shriek a lot. Sometimes I can hear them running up and down the flat chasing eachother like children. FYI - no drinking involved. Usually I put up with it but when I have a 9am lecture (and I know that none of them are in until around 12pm) I can tell its gonna be a long night. I shouldn't have to put up with this though right? Also I have depression to getting sleep is really important. I have said to them nicely that I was trying to sleep (that was last night) and they quietened down but I'm afraid that they will be more bitchy to me if I come out and say it on a regular basis.  BUT ITS FUCKING ANNOYING! So what do I do? This is uni accomodation so I have to stay til June and can't change flats (another flatmate of ours applied ages ago because of them and was told there is none)   I do. I feel guilty because I have had nothing in my life was truly traumatic (though my bio dad did stop contact with me when I was 9) or horrifying in my life to make me feel this way. I also have nothing to be sad for. I am university, have enough money and then some to get by and live a 'decent' life. So why do I feel like I hate my life  that I'd be better off dead? It makes no sense to me but it is what it is.  	4
 Hey, I think what you are doing is really cool, and I just recently bought the game (about two weeks before it became free) and wouldn't mind getting a free weapon/item. I normally play as sniper/medic, and sometimes heavy/spy.  Steam ID: juliusc01  Edit: Thank you so much, I really appreciate the strange sniper rifle!  	1
 She's dead, Jim.    I do wish the CBS Sports stream would quit crapping out. ROLL TIDE!!      Pffft we will be in the ACC long before then. :P   Good article. I asked a groundskeeper if they got hazard pay for football games. He said no. :(  Everyone did get holiday pay, since it was Thanksgiving break.   Me either.    [so the guy was wearing a gorilla mask](http://www.wtoc.com/story/27556260/gsu-police-open-streets-back-up-after-reports-of-suspicious-person)   The old one.   According to someone on Facebook with a police scanner, they apprehended a suspect before they gave the all clear.   They haven't evacuated the Carroll building, package may be a science project.   Sunbelt gets four tie-ins next year. CHALLENGE ACCEPTED.   [We've got the beer pong table covered, you guys.](http://i.imgur.com/dxTWovQ.jpg)   Our final NCAA appeal was denied, so I don't see how we can unless some bowl committee just decides to be a rebel.   I see what you did there.   [I'm partial to this for the Championship](http://i.imgur.com/To8hyMm.jpg)   Alright then. Rings all around, gents!   I think when we were FCS we only had rings made for our 6 National Championships, but I could be wrong. I can't find a link anywhere that says one way or the other.   Fried, usually. It is the South after all.   Last year they served gator in the dining halls. [True Story](http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/12/georgia-southern-florida-alligator-dining)   "Undefeated Sunbelt Champs Celebrate Season with Pizza Party, Cosmic Bowling"   It's our first season in the FBS.    Yes Fritz did really well. Our kicking frustrated me, as well as the whole 'drop back six yards to gain two' thing our QBs kept doing. He did awesome, and I could tell he was invested in the boys. But we cannot afford complacency.    Why thank you :)   http://gseagles.com/news/2014/12/2/FB_1202141600.aspx   Georgia Southern fans travel VERY well (the University often sponsors bus trips) so that is not a legitimate argument against them playing.   *kicks stupid rule*   Because we miss waaaay too many extra points.      In your own defense, it was a subtle taunt engineered to target only GaState fans. :)   *sadly kicks pebble around*   Source for this? :(   69-31 was an impressive win IMHO. :P   Another reason I'd like to see Southern play a bowl: Matt Brieda.   He's a finalist for the Doak Walker award and more game time can only help his chances. The guys he is competing against all get that extra game.   Plus, Georgia southern has no transfer players in their roster.   Yea you're right, got confused.   Georgia Southern was barred from postseason FCS games last year because of the transition, but that was a team wide application.   This page has some good info for individual athletes.  http://www.athleticscholarships.net/college-transfer-4-4.htm   I believe that just such a situation is what the rule was created to prevent.   However Georgia Southern has zero transfers and significantly less scholarships than other sunbelt teams, which is why we are appealing.   Yeah, the stupid rule thing is my main argument. We have met (and exceeded) all the FBS qualifications. We wouldn't have made the transfer if we didn't. I'm bummed out that we are the only conference champs whose season is (probably) already over. I'm bummed out for the senior players who stuck it through the transition, beat Florida in the Swamp, earned an undefeated conference championship, and now have to watch teams they beat go play on the national stage instead. Give me a ONE MORE TIME!!  :)   I'm not sure what our chances are, but it would be nice. Our boys played their hearts out this season. HAIL SOUTHERN!      Nope, just a tech fan but thanks for playing slugger!   Lol thanks much. It does suck :(    Yea poor GSU ball :(   No worries, different approaches. :)   Lmao that would be the boyfriend I credited my post to. Too funny.   This was my boyfriend's suggestion.       Yes. Yes it is.   We are in a transitional season since we moved up from the SoCON last year. It's a NCAA rule. We put in a waiver request but we're denied. We have appealed the decision. We are 8-0 Sunbelt Champs and 9-3 overall in our first FBS season. Teams we squished will be going instead of us. :(   Lol   http://imgur.com/8s4MPqp   http://imgur.com/8s4MPqp   Yea I noticed that too hehe but we have had that blue and white uniform style since Erk brought the program back because it was all we could afford. I think it's very classy.   http://imgur.com/8s4MPqp      It was really nice to see Youyoute get some good ball time in his last game. :)  	55
 Mine generally have to be in omelet form. Scrambled is a weird texture, and if the yolk and whites are separate, I can't stand the taste. Mushroom, tomato, onion, pepper, and cheese omelet is my favorite.   As a kid and even a teen, I hated beans, but since becoming vegetarian I have tried them again and opened up to them.   Ice cream is obviously delicious, but milk has always been my beverage of choice.   I looked for my main nutrition book to see if I could find any more information, but it's back at my parents' place. When I go home for thanksgiving I'll see if it has anything else to say about it and if it has anything about nutrition and depression.   Where are you looking to attend and what do you want to major in? Anything science tends to do that until enough information, research, and studies are available to come to a definite conclusion. In all of my classes I have been taught omega 3 is beneficial.   Me too, I just searched my schools courses to see if any went over nutrition and depression/anxiety, but I wasn't able to find anything.  I've started searching online for local psychiatrists/therapists, and it is slightly overwhelming.    Respecting my likes and dislikes is something I need to work on. I don't mind going to the bar and being social, but I'm kind of past the drunken college party scene.   I know you said changing your diet helped, but are you also currently taking any medication or seeking counseling? (I apologize if you've already covered this, I'm on my phone and I'm not sure how to see previous posts while typing a reply. :/)   Such a simple phrase, yet that would probably solve half the problem. Thank you for sharing.    I keep telling myself it will pass, but it hasn't.    I eat eggs occasionally, but have always been super picky with how they have to be cooked, otherwise I don't like the taste.   The best sources for protein are definitely from meat, dairy products are also good and grains have some protein, but not much. I get most of my protein from dairy products and beans. I absolutely love milk and skim actually has more protein than whole milk.  If you're interested in studying nutrition, go for it. There is a lot of information out there and you could easily purchase books and learn a lot on your own. Just make sure they are credible. Nutrition is just my minor, but in my spare time I try to learn as much as I can.    Nutrition is one of the things I'm studying in school, and what you're saying makes a lot of sense. I've been pescatarian (vegetarian but eats seafood) for about 8 months now, and I'm sure I have several deficiencies based on my diet that hasn't helped my depression.    Exactly. If I could pinpoint it, then I could fix it.   I'm sorry you're in the same boat. I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone.    The word mate makes me smile.   Have you found anything that helps?   Definitely not the answer I was looking for, but it makes sense.    Are meds really the only option? I was on some meds for about two months and I hated it, haven't been on them in almost a year and I really don't want to be. :/    Definitely going to print that off the next time I'm in the computer lab.  Thank you.    Words cannot describe how much what you said is what I needed to hear.    Thank you. :)    I also really don't want to be put on medication, and when I went to my family doctor, that was the first and only thing she did.   I know for me to actively seek out a therapist is probably the hardest thing for me, but probably the best step for me as well. I've admitted to myself that something isn't right, but if I admit it to someone else, that would mean I can't pretend that I'm okay anymore.   One of my biggest fears is being told by a therapist that I need to just get over it - I know how ridiculous that sounds.    Which is more helpful, seeing a therapist or a psychiatrist?    I've thought about seeing someone, but I'm really bad at communicating how I feel and opening up to a stranger. Was it hard at first for you to open up?   Thank you. :)    I'm finding more and more uses for the blowtorch. Just used it to make Smores in my kitchen. Best investment ever.    Used this recipe http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/emeril-lagasse/vanilla-bean-creme-brulee-recipe/index.html and used an entire vanilla bean instead of only half. Struggled with the blowtorch part a bit though, in the pic you can see some of the sugar wasn't completely caramelized, but on other ones I ended up burning it. Any suggestions?      I used to have a hedgehog named Popcorn, and this makes me miss him. This is adorable. :)    In the basement of Robinson is also an old butcher area and the freezers are creepy.    Even if the save battery dies, they are super easy to replace.    I feel your pain, the only internship I could find was nonpaying, but what makes it worse is I need the internship for graduation and thus I am paying for the credits.  I pay to go to work everyday...   What to expect: They will prick your finger before you can give blood to test your iron.    Sex, Drugs, and Cocoa Puffs - any good?   Call at age 5 to explain that there was nothing I could do to stop my grandpa and uncle from committing suicide, and to not waste the next 17 years trying to please everyone and feeling like a failure when I'm not successful. Because 1. It is impossible to please everyone, 2. Pleasing everyone won't bring my grandpa and uncle back, and 3. Even if people seem happy on the outside, it doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.   I got glasses for the first time in 2nd grade and made the same discovery - I told everyone because I wanted to make sure everyone knew that trees had leaves.  	28
 I don't understand why so many women feel like they need to make a baby. Everyone wants to experience pregnancy.  Why the fuck would you want to go through that kind of pain? Stretch marks, weight gain, all kinds of complications during the pregnancy, and then of course, labour. Not to mention, raising a newborn is a pain in the ass.  Yeah, I'd rather adopt. For me at least, I really couldn't care less if my child looks like me or not. I feel like a much better person knowing that I'm going to hopefully be giving some child's a better life rather than making another useless human to take up more space.  	1
 Anal sex with a virgin girl and a guy with an above-average penis size cannot end well.    Do you have a source for the size of Philadelphia? Surely there were larger Indian or Chinese cities.    But surely the people causing the conditions leading to the Serbians feeling the need to revolt were at fault?   Aren't all wars a competition of imperial powers masquerading as good vs evil?   I think you're a) onto a winner of a girl and b) going to need to take it slow. She's been hurt badly before, wants to trust you, but can't - YET. Also, I know from personal experience that depression will only magnify this, and she will perceive all of these problems as being her fault. All you can do is not pressure her but continue to be loving and caring, and she will do the rest in time.   To use a convenient metaphor from your own story, you need to slowly lead her into the water and carefully help her relearn to swim, despite her fear and apprehension.    I'm pretty sure you do share that opinion with everyone.    I hate to break it to you, bro, but that kind of attitude is exactly what women (or anyone) finds LEAST attractive. Comparatively, no one gives a fuck if you're ugly/hot smart/dumb so on and so forth, and they'll put up with a bit of self depreciation and lack of self esteem, but when you've let it turn into (what comes across as) bitterness and anger at everything around you that you perceive as better than you, NO ONE will want to spend time with you in any capacity. You have to force yourself to believe in yourself - not even that you're the best or the most outstanding at something, but at least that you're AS GOOD AS EVERYBODY ELSE.  For example, you mentioned that there's a chick who swam across Lake Ontario. So you're not capable of doing that. Well, neither am I. Neither are 6.9 BILLION of the other people in the world. Neither is the guy above me who is a QUALIFIED OLYMPIC SWIMMER. But I can guarantee you're better at swimming across that lake than 1 billion (yes, one billion) people in the world. Chances are you're still better than 3 billion people.  The other thing you need to remind yourself is that depression and low self-esteem is the easy way out. By telling yourself that you suck and that you can't even try, you ARE worse than everybody else at the one thing we all compete in - LIFE. Life itself. It's a race to the finish line, and you're walking dejectedly in the opposite direction. By turning that around and bring determined to win life, you are instantly superior to everybody in the skill that matters more than anything.   And it'll make you sexy.   Source: low self esteem, clinical depression, and discovering the hard way that - despite how hard my friends try, and despite anything that anyone ever does - the only person who will get change any of that is ME.   EDIT: And dude, linking me to an entire thread of people who have completely changed their lives with a bit of exercise and fashion sense, and telling me you're still ugly, is like beating me around the face with the solutions to all of your problems while saying a solution doesn't exist. Seriously. Just go read what you just freaking showed me.    Props for putting the TL;DR at the top. I can't understand why one would have to read everything else before finding it.    Sounds like the witch hunt seen in Monty Python/Holy Grail.    The fact that he had to withdraw a further $300 to cover his actions probably didn't help this.    To be fair, the same goes for women not being men without penises.   TIL there's a Taken 2   This is the appropriate response to a good 50% of /r/datingadvice.    Go find a girl, any girl, preferably a hot one. Look at her. Realise the fact that she - it - is nothing but a squishy bag of water and organs. This bag of meat moves around and noises come out of its mouth. Random impulses of electricity cause this to happen. This object is nothing more, and nothing less, than a sack of fluids and bones.   Look at anyone like that for even a moment and they will never intimidate you again.    It sounds like you're doing pretty well, and that you just needed to egg it out and have some people reassure you (and there's nothing wrong with that).  Stay strong!   Exactly my point.    This is one of those things that you really want to read, but really really shouldn't, because it sends you right back to square one.  And so we come to love the damage we do to ourselves with the absence of that other person, cling to it as much as we clung to them, and use loneliness itself to get through the day.  Thank god I deleted her phone number, because I don't think I'd be able to restrain myself at the moment otherwise.  EDIT: Also, if you're a deviantart person, I highly suggest you submit this. It was beautiful.   Classical music is hardly music for the masses either.   At my uni's music program I find it completely the opposite - classical musicians are superior, and god help you if you're playing Jazz Bazz. Snobbery everywhere.  Of course, I'm just a lowly Musical Theatre actor (incidentally by far the most competitive course to get into) so I get it from all sides.   I like to say "tell me the most awesome thing about yourself." Shows I'm interested in her, usually reveals something they're passionate about, and boosts their self esteem by allowing them to brag for a second. Also, if they come out with something shallow or stupid without thinking about their answer at all, it shows that they probably have very little maturity or self-introspection, and I know that they wouldn't be well suited to me.   Tbh it sounds like there's a problem with her, not you, that she doesn't want to tell you. Especially if she contacted you later to make you not feel bad - if you'd pissed her off she wouldn't give a fuck.  Has she broken up with anyone recently, and can't relate to a new guy yet? A self esteem issue where she feels like she doesn't deserve you? (Unlikely I know, but I've seen a girl with depression remain convinced that no one could ever love her even after being asked out by a guy)   Too put it nicely, /r/seduction (not /r/seddit, which is the same with just 300 subs) is... geared towards sex and nothing else. It also encourages people to look at the opposite sex as an opportunity and target of manipulation, not a person with emotions.  In short, it's not for everybody.   As fun as these threads are to read, they're all essentially pointless - you could wear a little pink tutu and still be sexy if you're attractive, and if you're not, even a $40 000 suit won't save you.  Rule 1: Be attractive. Rule 2: Don't be unattractive.   Girls don't emotionally mature faster. They're just as fucking stupid at 17, they just don't display it in the 'let's do stuff that might get us killed' way.   Majority of SOCIAL risks. Girls do have pregnancy. But I agree with you.   If it gets buried then no one is going to see or read it anyway. So why point it out?   Firstly, I suggest you xpost to /r/singing. They get these kind of requests on a daily basis.  Also, your audition song doesn't have to be about the same thing as the show - especially with a character this specific. If it's a funny show, go a character song. If it's more serious, likewise.  For your range (which I suggest you edit into the original post, along with your age), I suggest [I'm Not That Smart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2M93eivYXr4) from The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee  as a lighthearted character song, and [Valjean's Soliloquy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GrJeP9FKN0) as a more serious alternative.   He's saying your penis is 5'3".   Surely if she's mentally unstable, something would have happened like this before? That's a long time!   It ripped the arms off a droid? What a woman.   Dammit Jesus, you fuck everything up.   /r/depression. They are friendly people going through the same thing as you, and I find they can help a lot.   When you need to make a decision with a group, and everyone's doing the 'I don't mind, you pick' thing (such as where shall we get dinner etc.), don't be all considerate and ask them what they want to do. Make a decision right there and then, and stick to it. Major confidence points.   I hope the pizza man delivered.    That's absolutely awful. I'm sorry you had to go through that. If you ever need someone to talk to, please PM me.   I think overall he means the same as you - to own yourself, everything about you, and any situation you might be in.    So basically - be attractive and confident, and don't complain when a girl who you have displayed neither to isn't interested, just because you're 'nice'?   The teacher too has acted inappropriately and unprofessionally. Is there a higher authority you can go to?   That's completely out of line. You should have told him to fuck off in no uncertain terms. It's sexual assault, ANYONE would be uncomfortable with that.    Well, this is r/sex.   Fascist clues?!   Musos can be very huggy. You might want to be careful there.    Swimsuit? Where are you waking up, in a creek?   Similar situation and similar end result, except I only realized the change in myself a few days ago. Great relationship with an amazing and unique person, brutal breakup, depression and the ability to talk to any girl because what the hell, they're not HER, they will never be as good as her.  Finally get over her - now I have the confidence and communication skills without the baggage.   Presumably somewhere where people don't talk to them much.   Exactly.    As someone who is in their first year of college, and had exactly the same situation as you in high school - IT GETS SO MUCH FUCKING BETTER.   This is going to sound terribly specific, but I suggest you try to get into some Music/Performing Arts circles. All of my best friends are musicians, and (with obvious exceptions) they are the kindest, most generous, most fun and by far the most outgoing people you will ever meet. They make friends very quickly and easily, and never have too many, so you'll be welcomed into a group within minutes.  While these types of people obviously are not perfect (can be very egotistical, competitive, and bitchy if you get on their bad side, eccentric as hell), they seem to me to be the best option for getting out of the situation you're in quickly. Giving up on my more conventional 'friends' and increasing my socializing with these guys single-handedly solved my loneliness, found all of my best friends and my first (  subsequent) girlfriend(s), and gave me plenty of things to get out and do/see.  So maybe join a local community choir or theatre company. Join a band/orchestra if you can play an instrument. Trust me, good times will be had.   So why comment?   When you've told him subtly you don't want him arond, and he asks why, you need to tell him EXACTLY why. Meaning he's being creepy and overly attached.  It's part of the 'nice guy' phenonemon - there's a great thread about it over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomen/comments/lncn2/compiled_a_kill_nice_guy_with_fire_guide_for_men/) - wherein he just does not understand all of the social signals you have sent him to say back off. You have no other option but to tell him in no uncertain terms he's not wanted. He be a bit unhappy, but he will learn from the experience and do much better with interpersonal interactions in the future.  If you aren't brutally honest about what he's doing wrong, he'll be one of the sorry creatures that rants about how they are in the 'friendzone' and 'she keeps going out with guys who aren't as nice and dedicated as I am,' etc etc. You can save him the long term agony now with one frank conversation.   The fact that you're being so aggressive in return, when she has clearly stated she was just trying to be helpful, is far worse.   I think the only place they don't have them is above the tree line on our biggest mountains in snow season. Even then, I'd take precautions.   Brisbane and 18 here, I assume you guys have Coffee Club? Fairly classy, waited tables, decent food, but still pretty chilled. Usually in central locations. I take people there all the time.   Can I suggest you crosspost this to /r/relationship_advice or something similar? You hardly need help seducing her, which is what this subreddit is really for. Also, edit out most of the sex, they won't be interested unless it's r/gonewildstories.  As far as suggestions, I'd say that 7 months is plenty of time to have a lot of fun. Tell her you want to be casual, that she can take her time and make up her own mind about whether she trusts you once she knows you better. Don't push her, just enjoy her company.   So give everyone money?   Add this to "I don't think I'm ever going to find someone better"   Hopefully they'll have kids. Then there will be.   To be fair, though, clothes are designed to accent the body of the person wearing them. They don't do the seducing all by themselves.   So do guys.    If only we ever got off reddit and went outside...   It was probably diagnosed and/or medicated.   Because of the twist ending I didn't realise he didn't actually write that for a while.   Lawyered   I'm expecting a full Harvard bibliographical reference directly under the tattoo.   Gonna rock some Jane Austen/Anna Karenina.   The irony is that you need more full stops because you have too many.   A common theme seems to be books - what kind of books? I have shitloads and there's no way I can get them all in my room at once.   	67
 i sleep all night and i sleep all day. i have fatigue and exhaustion where i fall and can't walk.    i always need someone to talk to.    his dose is 60mg or citalopram.    he has tried changing antidepressants. at first it worked but it made him have a breakdown so he went back to the first ones.    i watch movies and listen to music and read books. i used to be very active but can no longer be.    i am in a very loving relationship. we have been together for 2 years. we live together. but our sex life is unfulfilling. it hasn't always been. at the start we had sex all the time and it was amazing. but he is on antidepressants and it crushes his libido and he can't get hard properly or for long. we have tried viagra but it wasn't the same. i don't know what to do. he was a virgin before me. and he is the 17th guy I've had sex with. so sex means a lot to me. it is making me unhappy. we bought a vibrator which spices things up but its not being fucked with a cock. am i being selfish? we do oral which is great but it gets boring. i have thought about leaving him. i have thought about cheating on him. i don't want to do either. should i just be okay with sex every 2 months? we usually do other stuff like fingering and hang jobs weekly.    I'm trying not to do anything stupid. my boyfriend is going to hide any dangerous objects in the house. i tell him i want sex but he has got a low libido because he is on citalopram so we don't do anything. i suffer from fatigue and exhaustion and have no energy to lose weight.    thank you for the kind words. i just wish i wasn't this way.    i wish i was dead. i am usually really apathetic about it. i just want it to happen and me not to have to do anything.   i have no more energy.   i want to slice my skin open. i am fighting it. i have self harmed in the past but managed to stop.   i don't care about myself anymore. i don't wash.   i feel like i need to do something quick.   i am in a loving relationship. he has depression and is very stable. he is understanding. but the sex life is diminished. i want sex.   i am all over the place.   i managed to ring for help when i wanted to kill myself. i wanted to jump off a bridge.   i have no friends.   i have borderline personality disorder. i was on citalopram. i have started a new antidepressant but it is not working.   i am fat and i over eat.   i need to vent.   there us more information but i can never remember all of it.    I am in a very similar place. I have been dealing with depression for the past 5 years. i have tried to kill myself in the past. i have self harmed in the past. this is my first comment on reddit and i have joined reddit about 15 minutes ago. i have no one to turn to. i have been in and out of doctors rooms for a while now. I have my first psychiatrist appointment in 2 months and i don't think i can last until now. i haven't self harmed for a long time but i really really want to. i want to kill myself and am fighting it. i am really unhappy. i can't find my way out. also i get really severe pain in my back and neck from the stress of it all.   its good you are getting help. the line you wrote ' I have a lot of trouble concentrating and sometimes it's hard for me to speak clearly or in complete sentences. ' its like i was writing it because i get that.   	10
 So, I have a lot that I need to get off my chest so here it goes. I'm 20 years old and I'm a friendly person, but I only have a few friends. But, I only tell like two friends what I'm going through because I'm a secretive  person. I'm very social when I'm at school but when I get home I hardly text anyone except my close friends.  My dad was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2010 when I was 17 years old. It was so hard for me and but my dad put a smile throughout everything which kind of helped. He had this treatment where he did not have to loose any weight or hair and he looked normal sometimes I forgot he had cancer because he continued his normal routine. But, recently after some time off of another treatment we found out that the cancer spread. It went onto the hip, spine and expanded in the liver. It crushed me so hard, I have nothing to look forward too but I try to stay strong for me and my dad. He went to the barber today to shave the rest of his hair off since the chemo is making his hair go. Recently right after, my sister got engaged and I'll be honest with you with these news you are supposed to be jumping up for joy and I wasn't. I had to fake it which I feel really bad. The thing is people probably wonder why I only talk about movies and TV shows is because my life at home is hard to talk about. Many people do not know what its like to have a parent with cancer. It affects you emotionally and personally. So I got it off my chest, it feels really good.    I'm sorry to hear that, but at least you guys only dated for a short amount of time. But, you're young only 17 years old you have plenty i mean plenty of time to find someone else. Being 17 years old in a relationship isn't easy and you may be suprised a lot of people loose their friends because they get into the relationship a little more than they should. I say return it buy it for something nice, or donate it to someone in need.    Thank you I appreciate it! It's more of a hobby for me, but I definitely will look into the format etc   **My 5 Questions:** Huge fan of Anna's work, I'm fangirling while I think of questions.  1. Is there one character, you wish you got to play again? 2. You have played so many characters, out of all of them which one would you not be able to be friends with in real life?  3. Is there two movies that you wished had a crossover and combined into one? (Doesn't have to be a movie that you were in)  4. Name a character that you wish existed in real life and you would be BFFS with?  5. If you could spend an hour with someone that you never met before dead or alive who would it be and why?  **Public Contact Information:** If Applicable https://twitter.com/AnnaKendrick47     I loved the movie! I highly recommend it   A friend told me that he was bisexual.    I understand, but it's just hard for me to be myself because it makes other people uncomfortable.    I'm in your boat. I'm 20 years old, I never been in a relationship before and never had a boyfriend. I've been on a few dates, but none of them were more than once with the same guy. I feel like when you turn 20 and you go on FB my newsfeed is filled with relationship statues and pictures of couples and yet I'm still single.    No biting    To be honest, 17 is really young. I know it sucks to be heart broken, but you have so much time to find someone. I'm so jealous, I'm 20 years old and I haven't even had a relationship yet. Just take your time, hang with friends. It will be long, but the sooner the better!   You need to reconnect with your friends and family because this relationship is very new and what happens if you break up thats why its never good to throw your friends because of a relationship.    Beware, I have no experience in screenwriting so the format will be off and I haven't shown this to anyone so I just want to see if this is a good story and if I'm doing decent so far.  Charlie (V.O.):  It all started back in public school, when life was supposed to be full of rainbows. But unfortunately, that wasnt the case for me. I hated public school. I hated the teachers, the chairs and most of all my classmates. I was bullied everyday because I was different.  Somebody named Johnny Depp once said it's OK to be different, that it's good to be different, that we should question ourselves before we pass judgment on someone who looks different, behaves different, talks different, is a different color. But I disagree, being different is what got me bullied in the first place and it made my years at public school like hell. Now I never been to hell so I have no idea what it is like, but from what I hear about it in movies its a place that I never want to go to when I die.  Anyways, now you are probably wondering, what about me is different and makes me stand out than others? Im hard of hearing and have been since the day I came out of my moms vagina. My mom couldnt afford speech therapy or hearing aids because she worked seven days a week and could barely pay off her bills. So I had trouble hearing what people were saying and my voice sounded very low and raspy. Because of that, I became the bullies number one target to torture and no one ever wants to be on their monitor. So one day during public school in grade 8, Jesse the most popular kid in school decided he would be funny and signed my name on the Talent show list for me to sing.  Little did I know, I was apart of his little joke and I was laughed at by the entire school. Ever since then I stopped talking to everyone except my mother and people used to refer me as The Boy Who Was Mute.   INT.  DINNER TABLE- PRESENT DAY 4 years later   Charlie is eating dinner on plastic plates on a small dinner table across from his mother who wears clothes two sizes too small. There is an awkward silence in the room and the audience can only hear chewing.   Shelly takes a bite of her food and puts the fork down looks at Charlie.  Shelly: I know you dont like to talk about this, but hun it has been four years. Dont you think you should spend your last year in a real high school and make some friends?   Charlie: Mom! I really like being home tutored and I like hanging out with you.  Shelly: Thats sweet, but dont you want to hang out with kids your own age?  Charlie: It doesn't bother me and I dont want to. I rather hang out with you.   Shelly: Thats lovely that you want to hang out with your old mother, but you are going to miss out on the high school experience.   Charlie: I think Ill pass.   Charlie tries to change the conversation   Charlie: Can you pass the water please?  Shelly gives a sigh and passes the water to Charlie.  Shelly: I think you are making huge mistake, you are going to miss Prom and so many other things!  Charlie: Its a mistake, Im willingly to make. Plus you only want me to go to prom so you have an excuse to borrow money from dad.  Shelly: That is not true, and you are going back to school!   Charlie: Mom! Come on, you know I hate school.   Shelly: I know you do, but it has been almost four years since the incident. I think everyone has moved on by now.   After a few seconds, Charlie realizes he will not win this fight so he gives up   Charlie: Fine, I'll go.  Shelly smiles widely and gets up from her chair to go hug her son from behind.   Shelly: Trust me, there are worse things in life than going back to school.   Shelly walks back to her seat and talks about the things they need to get for Charlie for school.   FOCUSES ON CHARLIE VOICE OVER  VO: Charlie looks at Shelly,  I knew it was a bad idea and I would have had done anything for me not to go back to school, but seeing the smile on my moms face and seeing how happy she is, is something I havent seen in a really long time so I didnt want to disappoint her. I mean how bad could going back to school can be? I mean having cancer is pretty bad and way worse than going back to school so it shouldnt be bad, or at least I hope so.        INT:  IN THE CAR  TEXT 2 MONTHS LATER- September 2015  Old car drives in front of the high school  Charlie looks at the high school silently and sees people walking into the building through his window.  Shelly: That door is not going to open its self.   Charlie: I know, I guess I wish I didnt have to go back.  Shelly: I know its going to be hard, the first few days wont be easy but do it for me okay.  Charlie looks at his mother  Charlie: Im only doing this for you.  Shelly  fakes a smile   The bell rings  Shelly: That is time for you to go.  She leans into her son for a hug and Charlie walks a little bit from the car with his backpack turns to face his mother before he walks to the building.   Shelly puts the window down and yells  Shelly:  I made your favourite for lunch today!!  Charlie: Thank you! See you later.  Shelly: Ill pick you up when school is done. Dont forget to use your voice okay!  Charlie: Thanks mom!   Charlie waves to his mom and she drives away. Charlie turns around to the school   Charlie: Welcome to hell Charlie (mutters to himself)   Kid 1 walks by to see Charlie not moving and staring at the school  Kid 1: You know that you have to move your legs to get to class.  Charlie looks at Kid 1 and tries to speak but nothing comes out   Kid 1: Weirdo (walks away)   Charlie breathes in and out   Charlie: Great! Im already on a great start, WOOT! (sarcastically and mutters to himself and walks to school building)  INT: Class Hallways Charlie walks to his first class and peaks through the window- he sees that the teacher is already started so he opens the door.  Mr. Evans stops talking and looks at Charlie  Mr. Evans: Youre late  Charlie mouths sorry and walks to his seat  Mr. Evans: Whats your name boy?  Charlie didnt hear and his classmates start to laugh and takes a seat  Mr. Evans talks in a louder tone   Mr. Evans:  Whats your name boy?  Charlie realizes that Mr. Evans asked him a question and mouths sorry and gets paper and writes his name. Mr. Evans has a confused look on his face.   Some of his classmates remembered him, including Jesse   Mr. Evans: Charlie, nice name, but next time come to my class on time. Okay?  Charlie nods to the teacher  Jesse: Charlie buddy! I didnt recognize you at first! Where have you been?   Charlie ignores Jesse and focuses on the teacher  Jesse: Probably working towards in becoming the next Helen Keller, how is that working out for you (says in a joking way)    Charlie starts to sink into his chair   Mr. Evans: Enough Jesse!! Now we are going to discuss about Scarlett Letter. Has anyone heard of it?  Abby raises her hand  Mr. Evans: Yes Abby?   Abby: I watched Easy A does that count?  The class laughs  Mr. Evans: What does Easy A have to do with the Scarlett Letter? (confused)  Abby: Emma Stone character had to read the book in the movie.  Mr. Evans: Well if Emma Stone had to read it, then all of you have to read the first twenty pages.  The whole class groans   Mr. Evans: Welcome back to school ladies and gentleman.    Bell rings   Mr. Evans: Dont forget to do your reading! See you next week.  Everyone in class left, except for Charlie who is about to leave  Mr. Evans: Next time come to my class on time okay?   Charlie nods   Mr. Evans: I know its hard to be here, but youre doing a good job so far. Keep your head high son, this is just the beginning.   Charlie: Thanks (quietly) and walks out the door    Charlie VO: Scene is Charlie sitting in another class  As much as my mother is always right, this was one of the only times she was ever wrong. No one had forgotten what happened four years ago and when I walked into the doors. Man, I wished I had a time machine badly to go back into time right now like in the Back To The Future movie, but I know what is going to end up happening.  Im going to be in the same building as the male version of Regina George for eight months, which is eight months too long for me. Even a minute with Jesse makes me want to bury myself in a grave. Lets just say these eight months will go by very slowly and I dont know how long Ill last before I explode.   INT: Lunch Room  Charlie walks into the lunch room and from his POV the audience sees the cafeteria   Charlie VO: Ill be dead honest with you, the first few days of school or anything pretty much sucks. One because you dont know anyone and two you're an outsider which means you're the kid who eats lunch in the washroom stall and trust me no one ever wants to be that kid who cries while eating a sandwich in the stall while the popular kids laugh at you.  Its not fun and I already did that for all eight years in public school and I do not want to go back there ever again.   Kid 1: What is it with you and staring at people? You are starting to give me the creeps.   Charlie VO: That is my cue to stop talking to myself. But hey its not my fault, Im Jewish and one thing about Jews is that we like to talk.   Kid 1: Only if I knew what you are thinking in that huge head of yours Weirdo.   Kid 1 walks away and Charlie sits at a table by himself.  Jesse walks into the cafeteria with his group and spots Charlie.    Jesse: Listen up everyone!! (all of the lunch room is quiet)   Jesse: I got a joke that I think its really funny and I wanted to share with you all. What do Charlie and Helen Keller have in common? They both cant talk (laughs with his friends)  Charlie VO: Jesse is very hard to read. I dont know his purpose for making my life a living hell. Is it because I get better grades than him or is it because hes just plain bored and making fun of me is entertaining for him. Whatever it is, I hope he stops soon because these Helen Keller jokes are getting old fast.   Ms. Bomer  goes up to Jesse   Ms. Bomer: Thats enough Jesse, see you at 3pm.   Jesse: Are you asking me out Ms. Bomer? Im flattered, but teachers shouldnt ask their students out.    Ms. Bomer: Enough silliness, you have a date in dentition.  If you do not show up, I will have to call your parents.   All of his friends: Somebody is in trouble!   Jesse: Im scared, Ive been a very naughty boy. Are you going to spank me?   Ms. Bomer: Principals office NOW!  Jesse: Your last name is very misleading, its a shame you decided to be a teacher. Anyways see you later boys! Gotta speak to the Principal. (Waves goodbye and walks away)   Ms. Bomer has red cheeks and is very mad and walks up to Mr. Evans   Ms. Bome : How is this boy not expelled?  Mr. Evans: His parents are very involved and donate a lot of money to the school.   Henry: Perks in being a rich kid (walks by and takes a seat beside Charlie)  Henry: Im Henry and you must be mute boy!  Charlie VO: I would pick weirdo over mute boy any day.   Henry: Anyways, Im not here to make fun of you. I think Jesse does enough of that and too much in my opinion. Im here because I was assigned by Mr. Evans to be your peer buddy!  Charlie VO: Great, a teacher feels bad so he forces a student to hang out with me. Is this supposed to make me feel good at all about myself because its not working.   Henry: Now, dont take it too harshly. Im just here to show you the ropes. Just a heads up, dont bother fighting against the cool kids because youll never win.  Anyways, Ill see you around buddy (slaps Charlie on the back and walks away)   Charlie VO: The only thing that is getting me through this day is my moms homemade egg sandwich. When will this day ever end?  (puts his head down on the table)   INT The Bell rings for the end of the day   Everyone walks out into the busy hallway then Charlie is by himself looks at his watch then walks out in the hallway and out the door. Charlie then turns on his phone and gets a text from his mother that she is running behind. Charlie shrugs and walks home.   Charlie opens the door and surprised to see his mom kissing his father Charlie fake coughs to get their attention and his mother/father stop to look at Charlie  Charlie: So this was why you were running behind because you were attacking dads face with your lips. Well I wont keep you, Ill be in my room doing my homework. (Charlie leaves)  Harvey: He didnt even say hello to me!  Shelly: Do you blame the kid? You hardly come see him. You should go.  Harvey: Youre fucking kidding me? I have to leave? That kid is my son remember?  Shelly: Charlie is having to deal with changes with going back to school and all, I dont think us fooling around will make it any better for him. I want him to do well in his studies. You can come back later, just give it a few days.   Harvey: You should of thought of it before I came here.  Shelly: I should of, but I wasnt thinking as a mother like I should of.   Harvey: Whatever bitch (leaves the door slammed)   Shelly goes to the couch   Charlie goes to see his mother who has tears and stands near her.   Charlie: Why do you do this all the time? Go back to him! You separated from him for a reason. He was terrible to you, he cheated on you and yet I still see your lips on his. Why is that?  Shelly: He was my first love Charlie. We met in high school in grade 10 and married three years after that.  I dont know how to be with anyone else except him because hes the only person I been with.  Charlie: Just because he was your first, it doesnt mean he has to be your last.   Shelly: For a young kid, you have an old soul.   Charlie: You calling me old? (playfully slaps his mom on the shoulder)   Shelly: You are very mature for your age.   Charlie: What can you say, Im one of a kind.  (smiles at his mom and puts his head on her shoulder for a few moments)  Shelly: How was your first day of school? Charlie: Not bad, could be worse   Charlie kisses his mom on the head and gets up  Charlie: Im going to go to do some homework and Ill steal something from the fridge for dinner later. (leaves the scene)  Charlie is in his room doing his homework while he can hear his mother yelling on the phone and puts earphones in it to block the noise.    INT: Classroom  Charlie VO: Dont get me wrong, I love to learn just not with other people. Why? People sometimes say the stupidest shit out loud such as   Kid 2: So was Oprah the one who gave the I have a dream speech  Kid 3: Where is Canada?   Kid 4:  Helen Keller she was blind and deaf, but how could she write books and  communicate with others?   Ms. Evans: I think thats it with questions you have regarding history, but  PA SYSTEM: CHARLIE MATTHEWS PLEASE COME SEE THE GUDIANCE COUNSLLER   Charlie VO: What did I do now? INT: GUDIANCE OFFICE  Charlie knocks on the door  Ms. Swift: Come on in  Charlie walks in the room silently   Ms. Swift: Take a seat Charlie  Ms. Swift notices that Charlie thinks hes in trouble  Ms. Swift: Dont worry you are not in trouble.   Charlie sighs as relief and takes a seat  Ms. Swift: We havent met before, but I spoke with your mom once before.  But, I was informed that you need to complete your forty hours of community service by the end of the year if you want to graduate with the rest of your classmates in June. Now this hospital is looking for volunteer and the orientation is tomorrow (shows it on the computer).    INT:   Hospital  Charlie looks down at the piece paper and looks up to the hospital and walks in   Charlie looks around and walks up to the information desk   Information Desk Lady: Hi, what are you looking for?   Charlie tries to speak, but nothing comes out   Rude Guy looks very impatience who is behind Charlie   Information Desk Lady: I wont be able to help you out, if you arent able to tell me the question you have.  Charlie tries to speak   Charlie: Orientation (speaks it very quietly and slowly)  Information Desk Lady: Sorry dear, but you need to speak a little bit louder than that.   Rude Guy is really annoyed   Rude Guy: Come on (mutters to himself, but loud enough for Charlie to hear)  Charlie mouthes Sorry and walks away  Information Desk Lady: Let me know if you need help  Charlie VO: For someone who gets paid to help others, she sure isnt helpful.   Charlie gives up and takes a seat   Emma comes up to Charlie   Emma: You look a little lost  Charlie tries to speak, but nothing comes out  Emma looks at the piece of paper that Charlie is holding  Emma: Can I see that for a second?  Charlie gives piece of paper to Emma  Emma reads the paper   Emma: You are here for the orientation, come with me Ill show you where you have to go.   Charlie: Thanks  (mouths to Emma silently)   Emma: Anytime  Charlie gets up   Emma: My name is Emma, my dad is a doctor here. I volunteer here often.  Emma gives her hand to shake with Charlie  Charlie: Charlie (soft tone)  Emma: Charlie?  Charlie nods   Emma shakes hands with Charlie  Emma: Nice to meet you Charlie, follow me.  Emma walks with Charlie in the hospital to go to the orientation room.   INT: Home  Charlie VO: Although it was only for a few minutes, its been a while since a girl that is not my mother talked to me and it was really nice to finally talk to someone that is my age.  As much as I love my mother, I cant stand her talking about Bold and the Beautiful. Enough is enough! Liam and Hope will never be together!   Charlie walks into his house with a smile on his face  Shelly: Why are you in a smiling mood?   Charlie: Im not (goes to drink some juice from the fridge)  Shelly: I want to come to orientation next time, it looks like fun by seeing the smile on your face.  Charlie: Its not orientation   Shelly: Is there a guy that you liked?  Charlie: A guy? Mom Im not gay.  Shelly: Shucks, I always wanted a gay son.  Charlie: Why?  Shelly: I wanted someone I can go shopping with and hang out with.   Charlie: You claim that we dont have a lot of money.  Shelly: We dont, but it would have been nice if you were gay.  Charlie: Sorry mom, I had a huge crush on my second grade teacher. I think its pretty clear that Im straight.  Shelly: Not even bisexual?  Charlie: Nope!  Shelly: Rumor has it, if you drink alcohol you can become bisexual.   Charlie: MOM!   Shelly: Okay! I tried, but I think I won the lottery. I have a pretty cool son.  Charlie and Shelly share a smile  Shelly: So tell me about this girl, she must be something if she made you smile that big.  Charlie: How did you know its about a girl?  Shelly: You just said youre not into boys, so whats the other option, animals?  Charlie: She is a volunteer and  her dad works at the hospital as well.  I guess its been a while since a girl came up to me and talked to me that isnt older than me.  Shelly: Hey! Im not that old.  Charlie: Your not, if you were you would be using a walker and living in a retirement home.  Shelly: You know how to make me feel younger (laughs)   Charlie: I hope to see her again, she was really nice.  Shelly: I have a feeling that you will see her again.  Charlie VO: I hope my mom is right.      This is something I wanted to get off my chest for a while now. I never realized the word cancer makes other uncomfortable until you have someone close to you that been diagnosed to cancer and you try to tell your friends, but majority of them are speechless and doesn't know how to respond. I guess not maybe 20 year olds have a parent with cancer. I just hope one day, people my age will be able to openly talk to their friends about it and not worry about making their friends uncomfortable.    Love VEEP, I just got into the show and I don't regret a single second.   '' I'm the Vice President of the United States, you stupid little fuckers! These people should be begging me! That door should be half its height so that people can only approach me in my office on their goddamn, motherfucking knees!''- Love this show!   Of course, I would. If that person is your bf/gf they should love you no matter how much you weigh   I say, leave it, but its all up to you   You are not useless, cancer is not easy for the people affected by it as well as the person that has it. You should find someone to talk too, because your keeping it all in and that is not good for you trust me from experience. I'm in the exact same boat as you. First off, you need to tell you friends or someone what's going on then you need to find an outlet besides school on a way to distract you. Second, you can't find a cure, but you can offer her  something like if she wants coffee or something and I think you need to tell your mom how you feel and maybe you can spend some time (everyone needs their space), but maybe look over photo albums etc. All you can do is try. Maybe bring some of her favourite things and do them together- movie etc. All I can say is BE STRONG you will need it and she will too. THE FIGHT ISN'T OVER.   I know how you feel, but the only thing changed about your dad is that he has cancer. I know it's hard and trust me I'm 20 years old and my dad has been having it for the past 3 years trying to find a cure. Last month, we found out that it spread. The only thing you can do is remain strong, find people that you can talk to, I go speak to a lady because at 20 years old my friends some of them don't know how to respond to the shit im going through. Find an outlet to distract you, such as movies, writing etc. It's going to be hard, but it will make you stronger and you're family as well!    Everyone is good at something, you just need to have the courage and go ahead and find it. Maybe you like to write, sing, draw? Find something that you like and you can use that as an outlet. I have been feeling really shitty lately and I love to write movie scripts. If you are barely noticed in the group, you need to tell your friends how you truly feel because if they are you're friends, they should care about you. You need to be honest with them, and if they don't care than I say they aren't your real friends. Quality trumps quanity. You have a girlfriend who cares about you, so I think there must be a few good things about you. I think you should join a club or join something where you can meet new people. It's always nice to interact with new people and possible make new friends. If you're friends make you feel like shit, they are terrible friends. You need to tell them how you feel.   I can understand why you are nervous because she hasn't been acting her usual self. I say it give it a few days and if this continues, just ask how she's doing or do something that will get her to open up to you. You're young only 17, I say go hang with your friends and go see some movies.    To be honest, I wouldn't loose the weight. He should think you're beautiful no matter how much you weigh. Your bf is supposed to make you feel good about yourself, not the other way around.    Just because she is not Jewish, does not mean you can't be with her. As long as both are able to celebrate eachother tradtional holidays that should be fine. You can celebrate Christmas and Hankkuah together   I'm not familiar with Sam's work, so I guess for me and those who aren't familiar with his acting he stood out a little bit more than the actors like Toni, Steve and Allison.    I agree 100%, Jennifer gave a good performance as the trophy wife which is something she has never done before, but compared to her last years performance in Sliver Linings Playbook it wasn't the best which I don't think that was her intention anyways. But that scene in the bedroom where she and Bale were fighting near the end was really good. Amy Adams was really good besides Bale who I thought were the main two who stood out the most   I like how Jennifer Lawrence is able to go and try challenging roles outside of the Hunger Game franchise. She's what not even 25, and already won an Oscar  Golden Globe, been nominated twice (possibly third time). She is truly gifted!   Hands down Amy Adams in American Hustle. The only thing is her performance was good, but some how every year another actress tops her performance. Amy is a really good actress, but she's starting to become the next DiCaprio (lots of noms, but no wins)   agreed that scene where her character and Duncan have an argument at the dinner party.   50/50- Because my dad has cancer and I know how cancer can be uncomfortable to talk about  with friends and I would want my boyfriend to be comfortable with the topic so when I talk about it he can be there for me. Plus 50/50 shows that it's good to laugh once in a while  Pitch Perfect- I'm hearing impaired and Jewish and there is a Deaf Jew scene and it's my favourite movie   Sliver Linings Playbook- I just love it   Means Girls/Pitch Perfect    I heard so many good things about this movie. I love ROM/DRAMAS but, I don't know I couldn't get into this one.    12 Years A Slave- very powerful performance from Chiwetel Ejofor  Wolf of Wall Street- Leonardo DiCaprio (poor guy, gets beaten each time nominated for an Oscar and never wins- hope this is the time)  American Hustle- Christian Bale        Walk To Remember    Zombieland, 50/50-Seth Rogen is in it   Way Way Back, 50/50, Sliver Linings Playbook, State of Play, Taken    I'm not really familiar with Sam's work and this is the first movie I've seen him in lol. I don't think he should win an Oscar, but I thought he had a good performance in the Way Way Back and not many people know about this movie   I really did not like The Butler. I thought the meaning of the story was good, but as a film I did not like it. Oprah's performance was alright, but overrated. I think this was based on a true story, but I didn't really like how Oprah's character died. I thought it was poorly done, maybe that is how the character died in real life, but I think the writers could of added in something to make the death not a lazy way to kill of a character INMO.   I think for it to be nominated at the Golden Globes, American Hustle would have to be in the comedy category. There were a few minor scenes such as the ice fishing moments that were funny, but the majority of the movie was a drama. I feel like this movie will get lots of nominations, but has a possibility of not winning any awards because it was slightly overrated and personally I thought Sliver Linings Playbook was WAY better than American Hustle (im slightly biased)   Hands down Sam Rockwell as Owen in the Way Way Back   I saw the movie today with my family including my parents. And maybe this was not the right movie choice to go see it with because there wasn't just one or two there was like 60% sex/naked woman which made it a little awkward plus I was beside my dad watching it which didn't make it any better. It was 3 hours long which was a little too long to sit in a movie theatre for, but Leonardo DiCaprio did a great performance as Jordan Belfort who gets a little too caught up with himself when he becomes richie rich. Jonah Hill was in it, he was alright but I think Leonardo stole the show.   	39
 Lilly reads Melchio's SBB as an attack on your team so it fills your BB gauges.   My Darvanshel is 6*, still working on getting SBB (BB is 8/10)  Just sent you a request    I sent you a request.  Currently I'm running either Thief God Zelnite or Guardian Darvanshel  Lvl 88   Thanks!  I guess I just wanted to hear that I'd get there eventually.  LoL  Still working on being able to take full advantage of FH and harder Dungeons.  I have decent units, I just need to get them leveled/BB'd/evolved.      Added you. IGN: Jaird  Thanks for the opportunity!   At some point does the Zel become easier to accumulate or do you just run out of units to fuse/evolve?  I have what I need to cover necessities but I'm almost ready to evolve my Zelnite and Darvanshel which will leave me basically broke again.    Oh, ok.  I don't have either of them, so that explains that.   What are the Bulbs used for?  I can't find any info   Thanks. I think I have enough other units to cover what I need so I won't be holding on to my duplicates.   I could use the space anyhow.    I cashed in a bunch of gems trying to go for Darvanshel (Good news is I got him) and I ended up with some duplicate units.  Is it worth it to keep multiple copies of units or should I just feed them to their big brothers/sisters for BB points?  Duplicates I have:  Lucina (L) x2  Mariudeth (B)  (L)  Bran (G)  (L)  Ahvel (G), (O),  (L)  Lilly Matah (L) x2   Hello, I'm not exactly new to BF but I've kinda been winging it thus far. I need some advice/help putting together a squad.

Do I have what I need to tackle some of the bigger challenges/quests?    I have attempted the Research Lab once and one or two of the Grand Gaia missions but not recently (before I had and 6 star units for sure).  Thanks in advance for any help you can give.     #imokaywiththat      Seems fairly self explanatory.   Obviously natural Chicken Porridge isn't shelf stable and they don't have a cooler.   	15
 Do you really not get it or are you just trolling me here   oh my god I'm so sorry    I'm Dutch you guys. Sorry for letting you think otherwise    STOP BEING SORRY DAMMIT . I'm sorry was that to harsh..   I'm sorry for calling you guys dicks.    Of course not I know it isn't real    That's what I thought, even though when I looked behind him there was nothing   No   Yes   Yes. Yes i did.    But guys, I'm even more sorry    Yeah but some redditors are such dicks when It comes to these things so I might  as well apologize ;-)    I'm sorry for bad quality, I upload from my phone. x         gangstar: miami vindication   What does that have to do with anything   Yes, she is :)   Rules: no screenshots   what a cutie!

 Air conditioning. Why is it so noisy and never the right temperature?!   I have a laptop with a 10" screen. You can make it full screen and I can read those on the train, but I generally don't like reading off a screen if it's more than 10 pages.   Also I hate reading off my laptop in bed. I will usually print it off or buy it cause the laptop gets hot.    Did you get it?   I've got it. I'll email it through.   Haha wow how do they enforce that?    Yeah fair enough. I was thinking more of publicly available statistics, but of course the insurance companies would record those.    I don't think anyone actually records those types of statistics.   Also, I was providing statistics relevant to car insurance, so I think this is relevant for that purpose.  I am not really saying women are better drivers than men, only that they are involved in different types of accidents.   Some stats from my state ([link](http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/roadsafety/downloads/accidentstats2007.pdf)):  * 2007: "More than a quarter of all speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 17-25. In contrast, only four per cent of speeding drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were females in that age group."  * 2007: "Fatigue was assessed as being involved in at least 20% of fatal crashes. Thirty-one per cent of the fatigued drivers and motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes were males aged 40 years or more."  * 2006: 374 male road deaths vs 122 female road deaths    Women and men may have the same number of accidents overall, but women may have more smaller prangs than men but fewer big accidents - so claims cost less ([link](http://www.carinsuranceexplained.com/car_insurance_explained/men_vs_women.htm)).     I agree with this. As much as people pretend like they are okay with a mental illness, they can't shake their misconceptions.   A girl where I work told some people she had suffered from severe depression and was on anti-depressants, and I heard hush hush comments from people about it, saying things about how she wasn't stable. It was not done in a nasty tone at all, in fact more of a caring tone, but I still feel she is treated differently to other people. She is very capable of doing the job she was hired to do, and I don't think this should be on people's minds when it comes to her work.   * Learn how to tie all different types of knots * Make a fire by rubbing wood together * Learn a language until I am able to talk to a native speaker using my new language skills - then do that with a random stranger * Help someone who needs it at least once per week * Make a paper clip chain necklace * Try one new thing every day * Learn one new fact about a different country every day   Computer Science!   I started out in pure science and ended up veering towards Comp Sci.  I know a lot of people who've done IT and a lot of them have ended up working at banks and consulting, but a few are doing different things.   Downside is that I graduated in a downturn period. Was really hard to find my first job. I went back to uni and studied more and when I came out again it was great!   I also like how what I can do can be applied to a lot of different industries. As someone with a short attention span for one particular topic, this is important to me.  What I don't like is that IT is often perceived by business as a service, because in most cases that's precisely what it is.   I love that I am in IT, and wouldn't do anything else given the choice again now. Now it's just a matter of finding a job I like too :)    * Long hugs * Rain pattering on my windows  * Seeing other people help someone else   * The internet * Beach waves * Amazing scenery that is too perfect to look real * Rainbows   Keep a bottle of water on hand, whenever you feel like an energy drink, drink the water.   Night and Daycare   That describes my organisation exactly! I am going a little bit insane here. I don't think I will hang around for much longer in all honesty, but I hope to do something good while I am here.  I like your advice, and I will keep trying to focus on constructively moving things forward. I guess sometimes I have been a little impatient, and don't always understand management's decisions. I will follow your advice though and listen to my manager and other people who have been around the organisation.  Unfortunately, most of my peers aren't much help. I have asked them and a lot of them seem to have given up on improving the organisation as it has proven to be too hard, and just focus on their technical work and the other job benefits, like the paycheck and leave. I've become rather de-motivated lately, as my peers tell me to enjoy the pay/leave benefits and not to worry about the problems of the business. At this stage in my career I am not yet prepared to do that though, and I am hoping this becomes a valuable learning experience no matter what the outcome.    It sounds like you have a lot of really good advice to share, so I thought I would ask a question. It's a bit detailed, but I would greatly appreciate any advice on how to deal with my managers.  I have been working at a large government organisation for 18 months and am quite junior.  Although I'm technical I can see a major problem with the organisation (it is primarily a business issue but has ramifications for IT), and I previously raised it with the 2nd in charge (sort of like COO). I regret that I didn't have a solution at the time, as he asked me what I suggest we need to do. I told him that I would need some time to think and reasearch a solution. After I explained that I may offend my managers for raising it directly with him and not my immediate manager, he said he would send an email inviting me to sit with him and with the head of IT to discuss my ideas.   After this meeting I told my manager that the 2nd in charge would like to discuss my ideas, and he said I needed to present to him first. I saw that as a good thing as it was a chance to get some valuable feedback.  However, since then I've moved to another manager in the IT department, and this manager would also like me to present to him first, and then if he approves I can present to my senior manager. After presenting to the senior manager, if he approves then I will be able to present to the head of IT and all the other senior managers. If they are all okay with it, then I will be able to meet with the 2nd in charge to discuss my idea.   I believe this process is going to take a few months and it is quite frustrating, as this is just an idea (and hasn't been approved by anyone yet, and is primarily a business idea), and also the 2nd in charge has asked me to go see him.  I don't know what to do in this sort of situation. I know I can go directly to the 2nd in charge and say that I am still very keen but I have been asked to present to others first before I can talk to him, but I know that will annoy a lot of people. I have spoken to my manager to explain that it wasn't really necessary to present to all senior managers first before going to the 2nd in charge as it was more of a business issue. He couldn't give me a good reason why I had to and in the end said he would talk to the head of IT to see if we can just present to him.   I just feel that they are putting up roadblocks for me and I am not doing this for me but because I really honestly believe that the organisation will benefit from this (and I have attended senior business meetings where they have raised issues relating to this problem that affect the work). The main reason that I think they are doing it is because it will probably create more work for the IT department, but I believe that if the business thinks it is important then that is up to them to decide and not IT.  I would just like to know what you think is the right thing to do in this sort of situation?     I think you need optimism when you're really young. He will be brought back down to earth in time. I don't think you could get through some of the early challenges in life without optimism. Also agree that he has a lot to learn.   I think business education is good for helping you know how to manage or run a business but not necessarily give you the skills required to actually produce an output. If he really wants to do these ideas, he might need to learn a second skill.    Just got home from work, and don't want to think about anything!   A dwarf walks into a bar and he slips over a piece of shit on the floor, he walks off thinking nothing of it.   A few minutes later a huge man walks in a falls over the same piece of shit, the little dwarf shouts out   "I just did that!"   So the big man kills him.   I rear ended a car this morning... I tell you, it was going to be a REALLY bad day!  The driver got out of the other car, and he was a DWARF!!  He looked up at me and said "I am NOT Happy!"  So I said, "Well, which one ARE you then?"  That's how the fight started...   I thought they settled disputes between two people with [Rock-Paper-Scissors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock-paper-scissors)   We waited until 8 months to get my cat desexed. It was too late, we got 4 more kittens. My cat is a slut!   I'm scared.   Especially koala pies.      Best schools/universities: The quality depends a lot on the teachers.   University advice: Go introduce yourself and don't be shy asking questions in class, or talking to your lecturers. Pay attention when they tell you what the assessments are/how they are graded, and start working on them early. Don't worry about what other people are doing. Don't fail a subject more than once.  Ways to save money: Don't buy shit you don't need. Food costs a lot - take your own food/snacks.  Getting a job: Just get whatever you can to begin with, then upgrade when you can.   Can't comment on the other two.     Also replace e's with i's  E-- I: Aus: "Fresh", NZers: "Frish"  E-- I and A -- E: Aus: "Westpac", NZers: "Wistpec"    A -- E: Aus: Pack, NZers: "Peck"   I -- U: Aus: "Fish", NZers: "Fush"  I -- U: Aus: "Pick", NZers: "Puck"   I -- U: Aus: "Big", NZers: "Bug"   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zs_rXxi0zhM feature=related   Don't be disappointed if things don't work out the way you planned - sometimes the alternative is better, even though at first it might not seem that way.   Robin Hood!   I'm not great at diagrams, but here's my shot at it: [http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif](http://imgur.com/INMR5.gif)   Check whether she usually wears gold or silver colored necklaces. Usually people have a preference for one or the other. I'm not sure what things cost there but I'm guessing 9ct Gold or white gold should be good.  If she likes stones, you can pick a stone in a particular color you think she'll like (sometimes jewellery stores arrange their pendants by the color). Otherwise you can go for something with multiple coloured stones or just a nice simple design with no stones or clear stones. You could also look at lockets if you think she'd like that.  Don't get plated jewellery. I think that stuff is a waste of money because it just wears out and then looks crap.   Yeah I don't know if it was because of me (my parents never made an official complaint because they thought it would make it harder for me at school) but the teacher left the school a year later.   At a school camp I fell into a ditch playing a game and broke my arm. I couldn't sleep because of the pain, and went to tell the teacher that I thought I'd sprained it. She told me to take a drink of water and go back to bed. I cried myself to sleep.  Then the next day a friend had a bandage so I put it on. The teacher told me to take it off because it was dirty.   I didn't participate in archery or abseiling which is unusual for me because I love those two things, but she kept treating me like I was overreacting.  I got an x-ray 2 days later and it showed a fracture of the wrist. I got a cast and returned to school. The teacher gave me the dirtiest looks and hated me since then.   Haha I didn't notice that!

I mean she could even use it first and then let you use it, and if she really didn't want to use it after that, then she could throw it out and get a new one since a toothbrush is like $2. I hope she at least let you have some mouthwash.   Don't worry she might not like you but I love hair and bananas!!   Yay I have penguin pj pants too! My other ones are polar bears.   I hate whoever did this!         Their sheep string internet days are meant to be [nearly over!](http://www.digitaltasmania.org/news/14/58)  Although, they said something about Tasmanians being the first to get a [medical smartcard too back in 2004](http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/security/soa/Tasmania-to-get-first-taste-of-Medicare-smartcard/0,130061744,139154706,00.htm) lol.   Recently I saw a news story about the fast Tassie internet. They were interviewing locals to see how excited they were about their improved connection speeds. There was about 2 people out on the streets in this tiny town, and they ended up interviewing an old couple who probably didn't even own a computer.   I'm worried that he was so specific. Is it okay for the dogs to eat a whole citizen, as long as they don't just take bits and pieces? They're not allowed to waste their food when dogs in Africa are starving?   I find the argument that a data mining system (and I'm specifically talking about TIA which no longer exists) produces false positives kind of poor, because correct me if I'm wrong, but false positives come up all the time in investigations. For example during a murder investigation, you would have several suspects most of which are likely to be false positives.  I think the real problem is the fact that you can arrest someone on suspicion of a terrorist attack without proving their guilt/intent like you would normally do in a murder/intent to murder scenario.   In terms of data mining also, although it's impossible, I think it's a broad decision by US citizens - if you know that known terrorists have engaged in a particular pattern of behaviour, and that other terrorists are likely to also engage in that behaviour, is it okay with you if anyone engaging in that pattern of behavior is scrutinized? Keep in mind the majority of suspects are also likely not to be terrorists. I can't answer that question for you, but for me, if the laws around the system protected me from being falsely accused, and the information was only used for the purpose of identify potential terrorists, then I think I may be okay with it. To be clear, I'm not saying that these conditions hold true.   The second argument that it's an invasion of privacy/risk of abuse due to free access to personal records is reasonable enough. But can't the FBI/CIA/NSA get this information if they choose to anyway? (I'm seriously asking - because I don't know). It sounds like this system just makes it easier for them through the data warehouse (the article actually doesn't say how they use data mining for this system).   I can completely understand why people don't trust the government with their information, since some of the new terrorist laws don't seem to protect their rights and are open to abuse. Just like a terrorist shouldn't be able to take away your life, the government shouldn't be able to take away a suspect's livelihood based on a hunch either. I think it's up to law enforcement to recognise that statistical likelihood isn't proof.   It seems to me that the problem isn't really the system and the access to information. But it's the fact that there is a large amount of room for abuse by law enforcement because of the laws relating to suspected terrorists.    ["An average person will produce around half a litre of fart gas per day, which roughly translates as 14 farts a day."](http://scienceray.com/biology/10-things-you-didnt-need-to-know-about-farts/)   I can't read any of the other text all I see is **best wireless cell phone**.   What's the one at the front? What's a microwave aquarium!?!      I started thinking... how could you not notice...  But then I remembered my cat is really fluffy too, and we didn't notice she was pregnant until about 4 weeks before she gave birth to a litter of 4 kittens!! My mum was getting a little worried about my cat's weight and my sister felt her belly and could feel the kittens moving around inside!     I'm in Australia. Most gay men I know talk like normal people. I don't think most people would even know they were gay.   Of my good gay friends, only one of the three is outwardly and obviously gay. He does act a bit like a girl so I think his behaviour is more of a giveaway than the way he talks.   There would be some people here who talk in a certain way but I am guessing that is their way of expressing themselves, and it might seem 'put on' but maybe it is just their way of letting their personality and thoughts shine through.   I reckon you could encourage them to go for another one, but if they really want it then just go with it and be there to support them. My dad never came to any of my games, and while I don't care now when I was a younger I took that as a sign of disinterest/lack of caring about what I do (since sport was so important to me).   I'd agree with this. I did a *lot* of sports when I was young, and sport can help you in all areas of life - socially, physically, mentally. You learn how to make friends, how to keep healthy and fit, and how to cope when you're under pressure, how to deal with losing, how good it feels when you do win, and how to juggle sports with school and other activities.    I'm not sure if this is the same with most pregnant girls, but my sister at least went into a 'nesting' phase to make the house ready for the baby. If there's anything you can do to improve your house then I think that could help.  Also just give her lots of hugs - I've heard a hug has to be 7 seconds or longer for you to get that good/happy feeling out of it.

My blinds were shining bright red when I got up, but now it is more of a grey and just looks a bit like fog.   I keep seeing that in all the photos in the newspaper.  My guess is they don't realise it's dust. When I woke up I thought it was red because of a fire, and then I looked outside it kinda looked like weird fog.    I'm pretty sick too with the flu - I've been at home all this week. I've had a lot of trouble sleeping the past couple of nights because of my coughing. This morning, I went outside for just a few seconds to take a look after I noticed the red sky, and came inside and was coughing up a lung.   I can smell the dust inside but I didn't think it was that bad... Staying home today though.   [For the lazy people](https://dl.getdropbox.com/u/2016753/Untitled3.jpg)   We can host a very successful tea party with our pets/toys.    That's the real reason you say 'pew pew pew' when you are aiming at things!   We can pee into a toilet without getting it all over the floor.   I am doing this right now :(    There's a few different kinds of late for me.   First, there's the I'm late because I don't care - this usually involves being at work on time. It's true, it's a direct reflection on the fact that I dislike my job. I do wake up and set out to be on time but just feel lethargic and take forever to get out of the house because I know what lies ahead is another crap day at work.   Second, I'm late because I have taken on too many things. I did have a job once that required me to be at work by 7am and I worked every day til 7pm. I used to always be rushing and driving way too fast, and found it too stressful. This was more that I didn't get to bed early the night before because I had too much on my schedule. I was working full time and studying part time and just had trouble staying on top of my assignments, sleep and work.   Third, I'm late because I've been held up. Usually I'll be heading out the door and something important comes up at the last minute. It's not intentional but I have to deal with it at the time. Sometimes it's only 5 minutes, other times its longer, but I really try to ignore things whenever I can.   Fourth, I'm late because I'm disorganised. I really do plan a time to get to things, but sometimes I just suck. Once I was away from my place on holidays, and forgot to turn on the hot water when I got back, and I stank like cat piss, so had to turn on the hot water so I could have a lukewarm shower to get to an event. Other times I lose my car keys or wallet, because I can also be a messy person. I really hate the fact that I'm me sometimes.  Fifth, I'm late because I'm me. Sometimes I just don't feel like I want to rush. It's stressful rushing, and I will probably just feel like crap if I rush. I won't be late for you if you are waiting in an uncomfortable spot for me though. I may be late if you are with other people and you're not waiting by yourself. I am often late if you are waiting in the comfort of your own home, and I'm pretty sure watching the tv for a few more minutes won't kill you.  There's probably other reasons for other circumstances but I can't think of them right now.  Just wanted to also add, it's not personal or intentional. If I didn't care then I wouldn't plan to see/meet you, and I wouldn't bother continuing a friendship. I realise that most people feel that it is inconsiderate and so more often these days I make a conscious effort to be on time, but what's a few more minutes anyway...     For the other experiment, 21 people doesn't seem to be a big enough sample size once you divide them into 3 activity groups. Interesting results with the mice though...   "Scalpel... Forceps... FIRE EXTINGUISHER!!"   I love you Reddit!!   1. Turn on the tv - it makes the silences/loneliness less noticeable 2. In between PC games, read Reddit cause Redditors are like friends only virtual. 3. Buy a lamp with a 100W light bulb socket, plug it in, turn it on. 4. Microwaves are overrated, start a balcony fire. 5. When you start the fire and the fire alarm goes off, you will meet all your neighbours who could potentially be friends!!!   I wanted to opt out until I saw all the good alternative uses for my phonebooks! Now I want to steal everyone elses and make furniture and useful household items.   Say hi, have a conversation, see if you get along. If you do, ask them for a drink or something.    I think it's a travel thing. I'm never sure where I can and can't drink water when I am overseas. People I know have gotten pretty sick drinking water in foreign countries. Also water (and ice made from the water) in the US can taste pretty horrible because of the chlorine.      Tell him you have herpes.   [Hey Bro - What's up?](http://www.boarderzone.com/gallerys/data/500/medium/24cockrock_bg.jpg)   I found something similar - not sure if it's the same type of spider or not:  [pic relative to human hand size](http://insects.tamu.edu/images/insects/color/argiope.html)  [Information and how to identify](http://www.spiderwebwatch.org/spiders/Argiope_aurantia) - Females look bigger    Some heels are more difficult to walk in. If you're having trouble, steer clear of tiny heeled stilettos, cause you'll probably just look silly trying to walk.  If you can find something you like with a bigger heel surface area that touches the ground you'll have more stability and hopefully be more comfortable. If you don't mind wedges these can be great. Another tip is if you're having trouble walking is try not to go for anything too pointy, cause that makes it harder to balance too.   Don't show off too much. Like everyone else said, keep to one feature. Otherwise it just looks tarty. Also don't wear anything too tight, being able to see where your underwear is pulling folds in your skin is not a good look.   Also skirts should be at or below where your thigh starts to curve inwards is a good rule.   Be comfortable and confident. You won't look classy and hot if you're uncomfortable with what you're wearing and/or can't walk properly, or if you keep trying to cover yourself.      There's always something to improve in any house, so I'd just pick something and then learn the different ways of doing it. Repeat as many times as you like. Often the best way to learn about something is to fix something broken. I learnt a lot about toilet cisterns because mine wouldn't stop dripping.    I am too busy to look after myself, and when I'm not too busy I make myself busy cause I don't want to think about my problems, but then I do and I get overwhelmed, because I don't look after myself and I get run down. Right now I have a broken shoulder and tonsilitis.  I am actually happy today though. I'd rather be injured and sick than have to go to work :) Plus I get to sleep a lot and eat jelly!   What's the occasion? How much do you want to spend?  For a view of the harbour - in customs house - [Cafe Sydney](http://www.cafesydney.com). More expensive and you have to book but great food and awesome view for an occasion (make sure you get the balcony).  For cheaper places, I really like Newtown for Thai (Thai Riffic for a nice seating place or Doytao Thai for cheaper food).  Tony Romas near King Street Wharf is awesome for Ribs. Kinda like american food.  My favourite pizza/italian place is [Made in Italy](http://www.madeinitaly.com.au). I've never eaten at Pyrmont but I have at Wynyard. Wynyard is a takeaway place but the pizza was excellent.  Edit: Fixed link   This turtle reminds me of [bonsai kitten](http://www.shorty.com/bonsaikitten/gray.html).   Girls who skip the cereal get the milk.   You suck. I have $0 quintillion in savings!   I'm just wondering if anyone has any comments on using XML for data transfer of small data sets between organisations? My experience so far has been good for this purpose and I haven't noticed any problems. The data comes from HP and Oracle systems and we load it into SQL Server.  Also typed XML hasn't gotten much of a mention here. I thought the validation of a data type was a good thing. Does anyone have any comments on typed XML?   The emphasis on sport in Canada sounds similar to in Australia. It's not really like the US. We do have sports teams and maybe some students get sports scholarships (not really sure), but it definitely isn't as big of a deal as I've seen when visiting the US. The point made by Anand999 about getting people to fund the university through sports doesn't really apply here.   I don't think he maculars much at all.   I found this article on violence at US abortion clinics: http://www.religioustolerance.org/abo_viol.htm  Not sure how accurate the information is, but it's an interesting read anyway.  And (with video): http://www.prochoice.org/about_abortion/violence/index.html   I tried this at my work too, but only had my crappy phone to take a photo with. You could see heaps more than without the tape, as in make out objects, but it was pretty blurry.  http://imgur.com/yBJI6.jpg  That is looking out of a meeting room into the photocopier room! The photo is of tape on the frosted side - I could see both into and out of the room.   Tried putting tape on both sides of the glass (frosted and non-frosted) - this made no a difference to the level of distortion compared to when it was only on the frosted side.  Tried putting tape on the non-frosted side and that didn't do anything - I couldn't see in or out!   Hopefully they'll be bright enough to distract people from the chewing gum stuck all over your clothes   For people who want links to the news articles:  http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,25484521-5006009,00.html  http://www.smh.com.au/national/irish-family-mystified-over-vanished-brother-20090514-b4t9.html  PS - I live and work in Sydney city so I'll keep an eye out for you too.   Start with the really easy tasks and get them out of the way first.   That will get you in the work mood cause you'll feel like you achieved something and a little weight has been lifted.  Then start breaking down your bigger tasks into smaller tasks and just do it bit by bit, and hopefully eventually you will get into the swing of things.    You can try generate one here! http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/  Or if that doesn't suit try the links down the bottom.   Try http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/  Has pdf and ps files for some papers.  The search function sucks a bit - you can type (citeseer and the author/name of the paper you want) in google - sometimes that's better.   Yeah they're [recycling](http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-dharavi8-2008sep08,0,1830588.story)!   Also I don't think [redevelopment](http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-33958520080608?sp=true) is that straight-forward.   	95
 I don't know any satanic music...   a system based on rules and works to get you 'whatever the goal is': enlightenment, nirvana or salvation in the case of Christianity   they're not exactly rules, it's a little more complicated than that  and it's a place holder title, atm anyways   one of the criteria for porn is:  The work as a whole must lack "serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific values".  so porn is meaningless other than for sexual purposes   it is compelling, because suicide is a popular 'solution' as well as other various coping methods and your testimony can be used to demonstrate the joy, love and hope in the cross.  if it's not compelling, then it is not convincing enough that there is a God   you say you were raised Christian, you need to be more specific  You are taking a theological approach to this, which I don't recommend.  What I do is understand that you should start over anew and go back to basics: what and why Jesus did what he did and go from there.   I honestly couldn't think of title and I just needed this post for a different post, that's all  it definitely needs a better title, sorry   not referring to those genres  I mean what I say   there are only 2 commandments as rules (there are other commandments):  **Matthew 22:37-40; Mark 12:30-31; Luke 10:27**  1) Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind 2) Love your neighbor as yourself ______________________________________________  **1 Corinthians 6:12, 10:23** "I have the right to do anything," you say--but not everything is beneficial. "I have the right to do anything"--but not everything is constructive.  **1 Corinthians 6:19** Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own;  **1 Corinthians 10:31; Colossians 3:17** whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.  **1 Timothy 4:4** For everything God created is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving  **Philippians 4:8** whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable--if anything is excellent or praiseworthy--think about such things. _____________________________________________ **Matthew 5:17** Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.  Background: when Jesus came to die on the cross, it is to take up our sin, only because he kept the law at full (thus no sin in him), and bury into the grave and we no longer live in sin but we are free from sin because Jesus resurrected from the dead.  So in everything that we do it is based on discernment and conviction not based on rules. _____________________________________________ note: was with anything, there will be exceptions examples:  1)tattoos: -if you are getting one to spite or rebel against someone that is not a good reason to get one you might hurt yourself (no longer love yourself) -you can honor God by getting a tattoo and with right intentions  2) (secular)music: -songs with positive messages (who says by Selena Gomez, Skyscraper by Demi Lovato), love songs can help you lover yourself or others, your neighbors -songs that have no meaning but can be fun (anaconda by Nicki Minaj) are just meant to be fun with right intentions -satanic music cannot be redeemed by God, avoid these  3) homosexuality -it's the sexual act, not the marriage -it provides no (evolutionary) advantage, it is meaningless, lust and flesh therefore it is not honorable for God -STDs, and general sexual consquences  4) Porn -lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific values, therefore cannot be redeemed for the honor of God  5) Drugs -obvious  etc.  In conclusion, it is not a matter whether it is a sin or not but what your intentions are and discernment (exceptions to those who have clouded judgments and outliers). Sin is transgression of the law (Exodus, Leviticus and Deuteronomy) and you are free from those but it is a matter whether it is beneficial to you, others or God or not. No, you cannot just name something n honor of God and hope to redeem it.  **1 Samuel 16:7b** People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."  	9
