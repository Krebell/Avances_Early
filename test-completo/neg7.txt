 If you saw your job being represented in a movie, what did they get wrong about it?   Reddit is the only place I know where Armageddon is put down so heavily. It's far from one of the greats, but if you saw it growing up, you didn't give a shit about realism or cheesiness. It was pure awesomeness. I have a feeling its the hivemind or anit-michael bay bandwagon at work, because no one outside this site slams that movie like Reddit does.    When Lost in Space came out, I was probably 10 or 12. My dad used to drop my brother and I off at the movies while he was working (this was during summer) and we watched Lost and Space over and over and over again and loved it. Great movie for a kid. Watched it recently and still loved it BUT finally realized why so many didn't.    It is just a peeve of mine. I'm sure there are people who genuinely don't know that, but if they spent a week on r/movies they would know.    I swear to God if someone brings up John Cazale, I'm going to lose it.    Just heard that Henry from Blank Check died today or yesterday :/   My favorite by far   LaMotta is way angrier than Rocky, but that didn't work out so well for Clubber Lang, so I'm going with Rocky. He's got the heart.    For example Maximus from Gladiator and William Wallace from Braveheart come to mind.     Far and away the only one.    Logjammin'   You're not Jonesy   During the interrogation scene, the Joke tells Batman "Don't talk like one of them. You're not. Even if you'd like to be." Now obviously he's referring to the police or anyone in empowered to keep Gotham safe, but by saying that, was he just trying to get under Batman's skin, or was he saying that he thinks that's Batman's motivation?   That's like saying I wouldn't take Daryl as a baby over Rick as a baby.    I read this twice. I still don't know what he's talking about.    Racism or the lack aside, that movie was so unbelievably unwatchable. It was the same joke the entire movie. Will Ferrell acts un-hard and Kevin Hart delivers his "What are you doing?!?!?" line. That's Get Hard in a nut shell.    Nice baby. What are you supposed to be, a secret agent?   This was pretty close to my favorite movies list when I was 16 too. Honestly your favorite movies are your own preference, and its really hard not to adore the classic, but the more films you see, the more your taste will change slightly and you'll find yourself being interested in films you never thought you would. Solid list though.   Completely agree. You're either a conformist or a dipshit if your opinion is different. There is no middle ground.    Truthfully, I'm not a huge fan of them myself, but I understand the appeal and I think too many people want to "stand out" from the "sheeple" and claim they suck for no other reason than just to be a douche. Like what you want to like. There's a reason they make so many superhero movies and that's because so many people like them.   I agree to an extent. I decided a long time ago I'll never do a midnight showing of any movie. I also hate 3D movies- but only because it hurts my eyes. But prices alone are ridiculous. Movies can def be enjoyed at home usually with as much fun.    I am sick of everyone treating Armageddon like it is awful. Cut the movie some slack. You can find flaws in ANY movie about space. It is supposed to be fun and goofy and I'm really tired of people, r/movies especially, putting it down so frequently.    What bugs you about movies, theaters, r/movies and more? You get a full license to bitch and complain about what drives you nuts about certain movies or about those whose opinion differ.    In City Slickers 2, Mitch's daughter Holly makes an appearance but when asked about her little brother, she claims he is hiding.    Different strokes. I know some people really like it because they claim they "got" it. Its just too out there for me. Slow. Unclear. Artistic? Not my thang.    Only God Forgives. You all know why.    No, its just one of my all time favorites.    I love that Captain Amazing is ACTUALLY billionaire Lance Hunt, but no one knows. Because Lance Hunt wears glasses. Captain Amazing doesn't wear glasses. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE! HE WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE!   The movie was def cool. That being said there are plenty of cool movies that ALSO don't deserve the insane hype and posts.  	29
 Bruce Almighty   Here is a list of some restaurants and bars: Greenville - Winslows Tavern, Christie's Euro Pub, Atavola, Carolina Ale House, AJs, CPWs, Wasabi 88, Starlight Lounge (trendy), and Villedge  Kinston (about 25 minutes away) - Mother Earth Brewery, Ginger, Red Room, Boiler Room and Chef and the Farmer (Top 100 rest. in America)                                          Greenville is not as bad as people are saying.  Granted I just moved from there for a job, but my 5 year tenure there was not bad.  I was not a student there, but in my late 20s.  Apartment-wise look in the Wimbledon and Madison (used to called Hyde Park, until they renovated them).  I lived in Wimbledon for 3 years and enjoyed it.  As far as things to do go, most people are right there is not a whole lot, especially if you don't want to party with 20 year olds.  There are some descent restaurants in the area. Like people said you can kayak, fish, go to the beach, hike and scuba with all in day trip range.  Raleigh is also only an hour or so away, so you got that.  Like everybody has been saying avoid west of Evans and north of 5th at all costs.  I recommend staying in the vicinity of Arlington/Red Banks Rd.  Would I want to be there for long, absolutely not, but for a short period, i.e. grad school, you can deal with it.     Toby Maguire.

 Sorry if I upset you! This isn't me. This was a girl in my class! That was the statistic and "proof" that she showed! I thought it was absurd, and wondered what others had to say about it!   Thanks for the advice! That's not me though, a girl in my class was talking about it, and I was curious if other girls felt the same. I think it's crazy. I said it was me because people say different things if you say it's someone else. Thank you for being kind!   Well, lucky for you! There's a more recent one coming out this year! :)!    Yes, future. That doesn't prove it hasn't happened. Also, no bragging. I wouldn't want to be one of the people who are accused of "asking for it" because of the way I was dressed   Have problem now that I provided statistics. Everyone knows that any school crime report only counts reported which doesn't paint the whole picture.   https://www.rainn.org/get-information/statistics/reporting-rates   How do you know the last part? For all you know, I could have been. Had things said to me before, and now avoid it all.   https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/182369.pdf   https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/182369.pdf  https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf   If I was "excited" to get raped, why would I try to avoid it? It's disturbing that you think anyone would be excited by rape. That's disturbing.   As i said to someone else, if you want the email to the professor who told us this, I'll happily pm it to you. I have no problem with you asking him   I'm not stereotyping people that get raped. I'm using questions that people actually ask when people get raped. Anyone can be raped. I know this. I don't believe anyone was "asking for it". If it ever happens, I would rather people that believe that have no room to talk.  	11
 Sorry, I love psychology but not the people. I can't help all of the people, just the ones that I select.   Is it english or japanese? and isn't there internet puglins already to view?

 BBC:  1) Don't pay Sky is a basic principle  2) Sky Go doesn't work on modern browsers due to legacy Silverlight rubbish. IPlayer works fine.  3) Sky Go doesn't work on my rooted Android phone. iPlayer works fine.  4) EJ (OK, this one is arguable ;-)   BBC coverage starts at 7am, so race must be 8am local.  Its /still/ wrong on the official site. Honestly...   It bloody well shouldn't be so hard!  Yesterday f1.com said the race was 7am local time (I.e. 7am BST). Today it says 9am!  But it also currently says that qually was 11am to 12noon yesterday when it was actually 9-11!  WTF, have these people never used a clock before?   ...and maybe sinking the funds into buying F1 from CVC?  Red Bull F1 World Championship?  Works for me.   Why a nominal fee? Flog the teams at full whack and sink the cash into buying F1 from CVC - I see few disadvantages here.  My biggest request for them is to refocus on FTA broadcast. Sky can show it too, but it should be on the BBC too (in the UK anyway ;-)   Actually, I'm assuming that long term we'd see RB pull out of racing (Toro Rossi to Renault? RB to Audi?) and they'd be left just running the sport....like they do for loads and loads of other niche activity sports. The Red Bull Air Race series is properly cool and in case you've not checked, the city venues read like an F1 wishlist!   Who do you prefer? The Red Bull F1 Championship run by someone who has proven track record in actually caring what the spectacle looks like, or the CVC F1 Championship, run 100% to make money for CVC, without exception.  I think I know which seat my backside is sat on!   Good for you. Personally, it sounds like a good idea to me.   Actually, they /did/ own it but sold to the BBC a couple of years ago...   Honest advice - don't worry too much about what everyone else thinks. Please don't crucify yourself every time your kid cries - some people might moan (or tut if they are British) but many will smile fondly and remember their own experiences and possibly even the fact that they were a baby too once...  I recommend books, toys and, if old enough, something to watch. Please /do not/ be tempted to drug your child. I would hope that the opinions of others are not /that/ important to you!  Parting words from a new-parent book I remember reading when we first started out:   "When flying with young children, the single best thing you can do is have a double gin before you get on the plane. It won't help your child behave any better, but it will certainly help you to survive the experience!"   I have kids and the best job in the world isn't going to let me go and do bike rides with them, or let me build sandcastles on the beach.   I like my holidays, I look forward to them and (because I live in Europe), I get to take them too ;-)  I also enjoy my job, but the job stays at work when I go on holiday. After all, if they knew where I was, it wouldn't be a holiday /anthony_hopkins   No, not too advanced assuming that he's up to scratch.  It's pretty gruesome though... Much more so than the film.  Why not read it yourself first?   Can't speak about Hammond but May and Clarkson were interesting people to have a drink with. Honestly, not that different to what you'd expect...  Oh, and he never hit me either :-)   Actually, I also have no idea of comparative tax levels either :-)  On a salary of about $150000, a UK citizen would pay around 35% tax all-in.   I seem to recall reading that the US actually pays pretty much the same as the UK per head of population for assisted medical care only, but this is clearly way, way short of universal healthcare.  As a note, I have private health insurance...and if I'm seriously ill, I'd probably use the NHS instead as they are way, way better equipped!   (Generally, private health cover is only used to skip the queue and avoid waiting times, which can be high on the NHS for some services e.g. hip replacements. Emergency cover is "at need" so if you need to be treated immediately, you'll almost certainly get treated immediately)   It's a fair comment, but I'm yet to see many advantages of the US system over the system here in blighty.   Unless you are a private healthcare provider or drug manufacturer of course ;-)  Genuine question here: would you swap systems and, if not, why not?   God damn it your country has some weird priorities - you are one of the richest societies in the world and you charge kids for life saving medicines!!?  Kids pay zero medicine charges here and adults pay a fixed charge, regardless of the medicine.    "Ain't she a beautiful sight"   TIFU by getting up at 5am to watch the race when I should have just watched the highlights in the evening.  Honestly, you missed nothing by being knocked unconscious. This race sucked :-/   The only thing that sucks more is being Fred....   We had them at our estate in Jan filming a section that I guess will never be seen now.  They were out in the hills in rotten weather from 6.30am until 7.30pm, filthy, freezing and soaking and they had virtually nothing to eat all day until they had got back and completed the other filming that had to be done.   And after all that, they still chatted to us after they had eaten and exchanged stories over a glass of wine.  If they had been told that there was no food that day, I suspect they'd have been pretty bloody pissed off then as well!  In short, we don't know what happened but I'd give him the benefit of the doubt.   Honestly?  Not nightlies. I'm back on stock 5.1 as I find the CM12 nightlies to suffer unbearably from slowdown and memory issues  24 hours after boot.   Number 1:  The Larch.   I'm quite comfortable enough with my sexuality that I can cope with getting changed in a "girly named" dressing room.  Are you?   I'm not quite sure what point you are trying to make here....   Never knew this.   Question: even though they don't need to, in your experience do they wear them anyway?   Actually, I'm semiserious here...  We threw EMC out and replaced it with Compellent about 3 years ago and have never looked back. Its cracking kit and does stuff that EMC are still dreaming about.  We've got about 800TB across 4 arrays now and love it :-)   I'd still buy a Compellent instead ;-)   Saved for reference :-)   Gutted, he's a hero of mine. Rest well.   Wow, that's some collection :-)   Yeah, read about that. I'm keen to understand what tools are available to me for monitoring my device....   Hmmm, never been too unhappy with CM myself and I'd always prefer to fix a problem than abandon it and walk away.  Still, thanks for the feedback :-)   Running recent CM12 nightlies on Nexus 5, I've noticed that over time (24-48 hours) my phone's performance drops so much that it becomes unusable and has to be rebooted.  Like anyone, I've got a reasonable (but not excessive) number of apps installed and it would be good to be able to see if one app in particular is causing it, or whether it's something related to CM12 itself.  Can anyone recommend specific tools for monitoring long term health of Android, specifically memory, CPU usage with a particular focus on resource leakage that might not show up through normal avenues?  Thanks all :)   http://xkcd.com/1179/  	33

I recently purchased [this](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TH7T2U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1) HDMI to DVI adapter in order to use my Toshiba CB2 with my [QNIX 27" 1440p monitor](http://www.amazon.com/QNIX-QX2710-Evolution-LED-Monitor/dp/B00BUI44US).  I've been unable to get it to work.  I was just wondering if anyone else was able to get their CB2 working with a 1440p external display. Thanks.   How would I get this to work if already have Elementary OS installed via crouton?   The CB2's screen isn't just better based off just the higher resolution. The CB2's screen covers [98.5%of sRGB color gamut and has a Delte-E score of 1 (0 is the best)](http://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/toshiba-chromebook-2) while the Air covers [63.3% of the color gamut and has a Delta-E of 2.5.](http://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/laptops/apple-macbook-air-13-inch-2014)     You can run a Linux distro via crouton on the Toshiba CB2.  I'm running Elementary OS via crouton right now and runs pretty well. However any chromebook with an Intel Bay Trail processor won't be able to run Linux via Chrubuntu.   I don't think it's flash, I use youtube magic actions and force HTML5 playback on videos.  Most 1080p vids playback well, but there are just some that just stutter, like this one [here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QRqPPFREx4 index=2 list=UUXGgrKt94gR6lmN4aN3mYTg)  As for when I'm running ElementaryOS I have stuttering issues all the time when trying to run play youtube videos.    Performance is just fine outside of video playback.  It can't play certain youtube videos at 1080p which is dissappointing.  It also can have some stuttering issues when playing back video on a 2nd monitor and doing something on the laptop screen.  I am looking forward to future iterations of this laptop with better CPU.   Yea it's pretty nice.  Love the screen and the speaker.  Elementary OS runs pretty well on this laptop. However, I do wish it was just a bit more powerful as I have had some stuttering issues with 1080p vids on youtube.   Yea I'm hoping everything goes well.

 I wonder if Galfa would go through with it. He's been turning to a pretty despicable human being so far. I called him a douchebag a few weeks ago and got downvoted. I don't think that assessment has been far off.   Not here but in Japan it's getting good TV ratings.   Anime in general tend to be prudish about sex, it's not just isolated to female characters. The commenter also seems to heavily conflate sexual expressiveness with intellectual competency, as if one cannot occur without the other.  While most female leads aren't sexually expressive I think it's uncommon in modern anime that they're depicted as inferior and woefully incompetent compared to male counterparts. Of course the commenter will just dismiss that notion with a comment like this:  Obviously I'm painting very broad strokes, and no anime-watchers will struggle to produce counterexamples. Nevertheless, I think if they're honest with themselves, they'll see that anime generally sexualizes women by showing their virginal charm. Rarely is the female lead of anime world-wise or sexually-liberated. Westerners would accept that much more readily. But unfortunately, dojikko and emotionally stunted *-deres are 300x more common.            Chlo Grace Moretz voice acting was underwhelming but the rest of cast were good, especially the parents.   Ema's story felt a bit rushed. I think this could have been better as a two episode arc. If the show is really going the Leon x Ema route, then two episodes would've been better for establishing that.  I wouldn't mind a Leon and Ema romance. Age difference don't bother me. It does feel a bit too immediate after Lara's death.     The scenery shots in the last two episodes have been ace.  http://imgur.com/a/gShN8         [Shigatsu wa Kimi no Uso Episode 18 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/02/shigatsu-wa-kimi-no-uso-your-lie-in.html)   [Larger gif](http://i.imgur.com/o5SlYAf.gifv)   I also prefer my suffering in bulk.   The way the manga showed she was dying was so sudden that it took a while to process. It also took a while for Kousei to process what happened. The cat scene was both allegorical and reality slowly sinking in. I think it was perceptive of the author to let the readers go through similar emotions right along with Kousei.      Heh. I find it ironic that Slaine was afraid that Inaho was exploiting Asseylum when he's actually doing that now by having someone impersonate her so he can make his power plays.   ~~3ACGG66GKYZ~~  ~~UBS3T36GSBB~~  ~~LBTAVBMHWK6~~   A short post on [Garo Episode 18's Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/02/garo-honoo-no-kokuin-episode-18.html).    I feel spoiled now. Even now when I see other shows and they're characters aren't like Yona I get a little disappointed.  I really recommend The Twelve Kingdoms if you want female characters with strong character development. Also Beast Player Erin.   I felt bad for Yona when she couldn't answer the question about what she can bring to the table. Perhaps in the next few episodes she can finally put her archery practice to use and also grow as a leader.   The love triangle drama coming to a head right now feels kind of odd. At this point I feel like the focus should be Kousei's competition, Kaori's condition and their desire to play together again. But then again I also thought Nagi's appearance was also odd and that worked out really well.   To be fair to Kousei, the mixed signals Kaori are sending must be confusing him. He's even going to be more confused now that Tsubaki has confessed haha.  I got a feeling that Watari is going to see through Kaori, be a bro and bat for Kousei.         Hopefully they fermented that mare's milk. Apparently unfermented mare's milk is a strong laxative.  [Supposedly it tastes really sour and smokey.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z35e-_YEzfA)  Also I wouldn't have minded eating salmon for three days.   Galfa is kind of a douchebag. Wouldn't have minded if he actually got killed.   I dunno man. The pitchforks are out and redditors are demanding an apology, Plumlee must have inflicted some serious emotional trauma on these people.   I get my existentialism from Gintama  Whether its the dent below your nose or the built-in microphone on the Famicoms second player controller, there are many things in this world that make no sense. However, humans are meant to eat, poop, and sleep. Everything else we do is useless. Our creations(Patriot) fall into that category.   That town is like a Costco where they force feed you samples.  The show has been entertaining so far with a pretty unique world building but the narrative for these small story arcs could be a bit tighter. The show gets the gist of it across but not the finer details.   I used to be really into kickboxing during the glory days of K-1. Also, from time to time I would look up fight videos of the top ranked Lumpinee and Rajadamnern fighters.  In general, my interest in fight sports (including MMA and boxing) just faded. I just pay attention to the bigger fights and up and coming talent with some hype behind them.   I like the pacing. It feels like the calm before the storm. This series has always been about the slow build up anyway. Each arc takes it time to present the details about the world and the development of the characters, which then culminate to a gratifying climax and resolution.   Why must Leon suffer so much!  I wouldn't mind a revival as long as it's handled well but I'm not sure if I really want it. That death scene was one of those exceptionally executed scenes that leaves a lasting imprint but a revival might weaken that effect.   Maybe "FLAG". I can't find a video showing the controls but I remember them being sensible.    I'd think it's pretty fair to claim that HxH is one of the greatest anime of all-time  And not everyone shares that opinion as evident by a couple of top 25's. I think that's fine, it would be rather boring if everyone likes the same things. As they say, variety is the spice of life.   I always find it endearingly peculiar that the ANN top 25 has three Maria-sama ga Miteru seasons. By the way, it's a very pleasant series.  [All the seasons are on youtube](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4U0FQ15BX8D1-lCVHli3WNK7KhVOuBtH)   I've been trying to spread the brilliance of Koji Yamamura but with almost zero success lol.      Cross Game and Aria.   Yun was right, the gang does keep getting weirder. Really curious how Yona is going to convince the Green Dragon to team up with them. Maybe it will be Hak who's going to do the convincing.  Not even an ounce of jealousy from Yona. Hak has his work cut out for him.  Also if you want another fantasy show with a badass redheaded female MC, I really recommend **The Twelve Kingdoms**. It's a slower show and far more serious and darker. The character development is some the most gratifying in anime and the world building is detailed and expansive.  [Just look at this graceful badass](http://i.imgur.com/gwJjSRJ.jpg)   Tropes aren't inherently bad...really there's a trope for everything since storytelling have been in existence for thousands of years. Tropes are tools, it's how they're used that determines whether the story and/or character appeals to the audience or not.  An obvious ending is not bad either. To me the journey is far more important than the destination.   [My reaction](http://i.imgur.com/e0vFpRA.gif)   [Reaction to that play call and interception](http://i.imgur.com/e0vFpRA.gif)   I just now realized the gray dwarves look like creepy penguins.  The dream scene was great. Really liked the use of color to accompany the changes in emotions. The quivering eyebrows were also a nice touch when Ronja was tearing up. Good stuff by Goro.  lol that knife had an obvious death flag. RIP knife.   It's not a question of ability but health.   The non-Leon episodes are somewhat entertaining but nowhere near as interesting.   Goth-loli with that submarine delivery and a graceful jumping follow through.            Those flashbacks were a nice way of showing that the connection between Ronja and Mattis isn't completely severed, despite their stubbornness.      [The short movie.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx_IflZH-OY feature=youtu.be)  [Brief write-up](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/01/muybridges-strings.html)      But generalizations are fun and get easy upvotes. Funnily enough this is also guilty of pandering that it's criticizing.      I think [Liebestraum No. 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpOtuoHL45Y) by Liszt would've worked well for this episode. It's familiar sounding but not as overused as Clair de Lune.   That's an odd watching habit. After 200 shows a rational person would have an idea of their taste for anime and know what shows to pick up and what to avoid.      The dialogue between Kousei and Kaori was serene with a touch of melancholy. Great stuff.  Unless the mangaka backtracks, I think in the end the story would just imply that Kaori is terminally ill but not actually show her death. I think this way it makes her story more about the way she lived instead of that she died.   [Source](http://youtu.be/45vm6NqgOBE)      Mostly agree with you. It's hard to get into the symbolism and surreal expression of ideas without an interesting narrative and engaging character drama. It almost feels like Ikuhara came up with the ideas and symbolisms first and then haphazardly attached a story and characters to them. In contrast to his other work, Utena, the characters were the heart of the show and the symbolism were built around them.    I really really hope that the 2nd season of Knights of Sidonia receive the same quality of character animation. It probably won't though due to a most likely lower budget. With the Ghibli name attached to Ronja, Polygon got some good funding from NHK.   Mattis is getting all the hate and deservedly so but the Borkas were awful with their ungrateful attitude towards Ronja's sacrifice. Let us not forget they also shot first.   While Maria is performing good deeds, Saint Micheal is partially right that heavenly or witch interference whenever something bad happens messes too much with the natural order of things. Although he's also in the extreme end by not doing anything. Like with most matters, moderation is key.  Maria tries to stop the war mostly for the selfish reason of hating it, which results in her not seeing the bigger picture.  So, Saint Micheal does have a point but he's just a dick about it. With that said you should all still convert to Wicca and worship thy Goddess Maria.   [Sanzoku no Musume Ronja](http://gfycat.com/PowerlessGaseousBernesemountaindog)   http://youtu.be/Z1evvY8xuOs         The first few episodes should go back to 4:3 aspect ratio just to troll people.

This episode definitely delivered the powerful emotions. Although, I was a bit disappointed with a couple of key moments that I was really looking forward to. The dialogue didn't quite deliver like the manga did in those two moments.  [It's to...familiarize myself with sadness](http://i.imgur.com/yqzNv31.jpg) (This really left a mark when I was reading it. Such a melancholic line and image)  [Am I crying because I'm sad that I'm only speaking to Kousei as usual?](http://i.imgur.com/dcSPDDd.jpg)   One of the best anime shows ever. I'm not sure if this is the right way to describe it, but it's a mentally and emotionally demanding show.  Also, this was a spin-off of the bakeneko arc from Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales. I recommend watching that arc.   That court system is rigged! But I'll overlook the injustice because it was too sexy.  Shaba-da-doo   Mattis straight up turned sinister, almost like a completely different character.  Ronja's voice actress delivered a great performance. Also, in dramatic scenes like this, phonetically animated lip syncing is a huge difference maker in terms of bringing the characters' emotions to life.    A couple more from the same creator.

I thought they were as fun as this episode and the explicit sexual humor and sexually implied acts remained strong.   [Death Parade Episode 1 - Cinematography](http://animecinematography.blogspot.com/2015/01/death-parade-episode-1.html)      The biggest difference being is the Rolling Girls fight scene is better animated and choreographed than anything from Kill la Kill.   This was a fun episode, had me laughing out loud multiple times. The Titanic couple got me good.  Aoko was adorable in this episode. Secret best girl of Fall-Winter seasons.   Saazbaum's slide show of his feeling was really effective. Gotta take pointers from that episode the next time I do a public presentation.   /u/_lynn already provided the answer.  [More animal animation from Ronja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kL1M7SZ4Z5o feature=youtu.be)    I loved how open to interpretation Death Billards ending was.  It really wasn't though. The old man whispering to Decim, which elevator he was on in the end and his grin were all obvious cues of where each of them ended up.     http://gfycat.com/ThoroughGleefulKentrosaurus   Please keep this family safe. Please keep this family safe. Leon needs to catch a break. For the first time in his life the guy experienced a semblance of family life...and an actual father figure.  I hope the show puts a stain on the white cape of the super perfect prince. Infallible characters are not interesting to me.   This episode left out a decent amount stuff from the manga. It was still nice but I would've preferred that it adapted most of the material since they're good. It also sped up the pace a bit and for shows like this I prefer a slower build up towards the big moments. Makes it more gratifying.  Perhaps they just changed the order of things.

Plenty of scenes were full animation (24 fps). The lip syncing is phonetically animated, so there's no flapping mouth effect.      Best animal animation.  The adventurous mischief of Ronja and Birk is really charming. They also have great chemistry. That was a fun and feel-good episode until that inauspicious ending.

At least I don't think it's as dead as the Sanzoku no Musume Ronja threads.   Sounds like this might be his third feature length film. I think his two feature length films (The Place Promised in Our Early Days and Children Who Chase Lost Voices) were his weaker works. His character writing is great and shorter films play to that strength but longer films require more storytelling which I think he struggles a bit with. For longer films having a co-writer might be of benefit, just like Hosoda had Satoko Okudera as a co-writer.   Kaori smiled! I'll take any positive thing I can get. I also really liked that Tsubaki has come to accept her feelings for Kousei but also understood how delicate his situation is. I just wished this was done right after chapter 29.  The Watari and Kousei dialogue was great and handled with a light touch that made it feel genuine. Kousei was in anguish but not super angsty. Watari was supportive but not pushy.

She dedicated her whole life for this moment and in the end she wasn't able to do much.      [YES! YES! YES!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5p6qpG3bLA)            Melodrama is not inherently bad writing. It's just another tool at the writer's or director's disposal. Whether it turns out well or not depends on how it is used.  This subreddit has a habit of attaching negative connotation to tropes and cliche, which is lazy criticism and lacks critical thinking. What should be criticized is how the trope is used and not the trope itself.   [Tropes are Tools](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropesAreTools?from=Main.TropesAreNotBad)   I maybe wrong about this, but I think this was the season when the league put more emphasis on calling fouls on contact. This was to boost scoring as a response to the low scoring finals between the Spurs and the Pistons. In that list there were six players attempting more than 10 or more free throws per game.   I want continuation of these shows:  **Natsume's Book of Friends** under Studio Ghibli with Takahiro Omori still as the director.  **Kino's Journey** under Studio Ghibli with Hiroshi Nagahama (Mushi-shi) as the director.  **The Beast Player Erin** under Studio Ghibli directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi (The Secret World of Arrietty) or Omori  **Tetsuwan Birdy: Decode** under Ufotable with Kazuki Akane still as the director.  **Chihayafuru** and **NANA** done by same studio and director (MADHOUSE and Morio Asaka).  For original projects:  A sci-fi show written by Kenji Kamiyama (Gits: SAC and Eden of the East), under Polygon Pictures and directed by Yutaka Izubuchi, Mamoru Oshii or Shinichiro Watanabe.  Any movie project by Makoto Shinkai, Mamoru Hosoda and Yasuhiro Yoshiura.  Pixar collaboration with the above directors.  Breakout project for Kiyotaka Oshiyama (Space Dandy "The Big Fish is Huge, Baby") and Yasuhiro Nakura (Space Dandy "A World with No Sadness, Baby")   Always liked Kuroda's composure. He's rarely ever rattled and just fights through bad spots.       When they suggested doing the horses in CG, I immediately thought of the horse animation in Sanzoku no Musume Ronja, which I thought looked pretty nice.  http://gfycat.com/RawBlondCanvasback  http://gfycat.com/BlackandwhiteConsciousGorilla  They even animated some of the mannerisms.  http://gfycat.com/WellinformedOddBarnowl      I'm kind of surprised by how stern of a teacher Kousei ended up being but in a good way since it's evident of how his character has changed.   I think the whole substitute thing was just playful teasing by Kaori that Kousei sort of took to heart. I think even Watari realizes this, hence the scene when he asked Kaori if she likes Kousei and why he keeps encouraging him.  I also think Kaori, unlike Tsubaki, is fully aware of her feelings for Kousei. She just strikes me as a more honest character (to herself). But as you mentioned her terminal illness makes fully engaging difficult.   Loving Plum's development.   I think turning him into a teacher is a nice development as long as that's the extent of their interaction. But I agree, the placement of the new character intro is an odd one since I was expecting more Tsubaki stuff.   The scaling down on the drama was kind of abrupt, especially since it has been so excellent and substantial to Tsubaki's development. I hope the manga doesn't put Tsubaki on hold but I think that's what's going to happen which would be a shame.       Showing Ronja take a nice hot bath to emphasize how badly the Borkas have it with their food and water shortage was a nice touch.

I'm pretty sure that's actually them.    Mom says you have to believe in Santa if you want presents on Christmas.   Sometimes I find this hard to do, like when I see Santa at the mall and he looks different from the Santa I saw last year. If I mention this to my mom she tells me never to talk about that. She says if I do, I wont get any presents on Christmas. She told me to always assume that it's just Santa's magic at work.  Last Christmas I took my little sister to the park. I had snow ball fights with my friends while she built a snow man.   We saw Santa at the park that day. He came over and handed each of us a little, unwrapped present. He told us that we were all good boys and girls. He told my sister that her present was in his sleigh because it was too big to carry.   My sister went with him, but she never came back. The police officers asked us so many questions but we all insisted it was just Santa - big, jolly and red. That was all we knew.  I got so many presents that year - more than usual. I'm so glad I didn't tell anyone that Santa had looked a lot like our neighbor, Mr. Wilkens. And I'm glad I didn't tell them that I saw my sister get into his blue pick-up truck instead of a sleigh. Mom says never to talk about that stuff, that it's just Santa's magic at work. And she says you have to believe in Santa if you want presents on Christmas.    My bad - so deleted!

That was just tops   PROMPT: South America - Body Mutilation - Toothbrush *** It was my frirst trip as a missionary. They sent me to Garana, South Africa -I was in the first group to be assigned there There were 3 of us. Wre were only allowed to take a toothbrush, toilet paper and our clothes  I didnt know whaqt id been expecting but this wasnt it. Only men were allowed out in the village square to hear the gospel and but they were very receptive and seemed to hang on our every word. We were only allowed to leave our tents to give the good word of God.  the firth day we were there we showed up at the tent smiling anfd ready tp deliver the word f our lord. The "congregation" as it was, was silnet through out our entire sermoen.  During the middle of our psalm a village elder interrupted and said a few words in a laguage I didn't understand. The man in our group was escorted off stage and me and the other female missionary, Anna, were  held on stage at spear-point  a translator in the tribe very uncomrfotably deliuvered the words of the elder:   "You have been acceted into the tribe as one of our own. Since you are women you must remove your ears as they are not required for women in our lands."  The other missionary and I looked at each other.  "you will be required to marry village men and teach them the ways of your lord"  "and how are we to remove ours ears?" the other girl asked in horror.  "You may  use whatever you own whatever you have right now"  The the other girl started crying "I have nothing but my hands!"  I slowly pulled my hands from my pockets as they sealed our tents closed.  "I have a toothbrush..and floss."   It sounds like you need to write a NoSleep story. That's bizarre.

It's fine, you're not that person, but [Ouija boards have been around for a very long time.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouija)    Yes, but being in shock it's hard to tell what was real. But yeah, there was something in that closet.   The Suicide Room. That's what they called room 733 - as if I didn't have enough to worry about on my first day as a freshman.   We had assigned to dorm room 734 which, it turns out, wasnt one of the nice add-on rooms in the south hall. No, we found ourselves in the older wing of the building on the 7th floor. I wasnt too bummed out, though; at least theyd honored my request to room with my best friend.  Lydia and I spent most of the morning moving ourselves in. By the time our Resident Advisor came by I was taping up posters and Lydia was reading.  "Hi girls, I'm Beth!" chirped the bubbly blonde girl as she bounded into our room. "I'll be your RA this year."   "Hi," I nodded at her.  "Wow, you girls really work fast, she said taking in our made beds and hung up clothes.  Beth picked up a drawing of Cthulhu that Lydia had done over the summer. She turned it sideways, studying it.   "Is this the kraken from Pirates of the Caribbean?"   Lydia glared at her over the top of her book.  "So anyway, the RA continued, I know our hall isn't as new as the south hall but trust me, there's a lot of history here. This building is almost 60 years old."  "Yes, I can see that." I said looking around. "The rooms are pretty small."  "Well, people were smaller in the 50s." Beth shrugged.  "Really." Lydia said flatly.  "Yep, really." Beth pursed her lips and just continued to stand there, while the room filled with awkward silence.  "So," I said, "the corner room next to us - 733, is it? It looks a lot bigger than our room. Is anyone assigned to that room or could we maybe-"  "Oh, you don't want that room. Beth interrupted. "There were a couple suicides in there. A hanging and a jumper if I remember right. Theyre not assigning anyone to that room.  Anyway, I'd just like to remind you that this is an all girls floor and guys are not allowed up here after 11."   Before we could reply to her Beth clapped her hands and with a quick "well, nice meeting you" she skipped out of the room.  Lydia dropped her book on the bed and stared out into the hall. "I hate her."  "Did you hear that bomb she fucking dropped?"  "I'm going to call her Dumbshit Beth."  "Lydia, seriously. Suicides?"  "Oh, Becca, relax. Every college campus has a few suicides."  "Yeah, but in the same room?"  Lydia sighed. "Really, who cares? It's not *our* room."  "Yeah, I guess." I turned to study the little window in our room. "Can you imagine climbing out of that tiny window and jumping? You'd be alive for at least five seconds before you hit the ground."  "Oh, fuck, Becca, can you not?" Lydia glanced at the window and visibly shuddered. "You know I fucking hate heights and just talking about that shit is raising my blood pressure."  "We could always move into the suicide room," I teased her, "That one has a window on each wall."  "Fuck you."  "Okay, okay. But seriously, think about it. It would take a lot of commitment to squeeze out of that tiny window."  "Yeah, well, remember, people were apparently smaller back then." Lydia mumbled as she pushed her bed further away from the window.     ***  Since Lydia was an outgoing and friendly person, we made friends at lightning speed. There were a lot of parties in those first few weeks, at one of which Lydia inevitably met a guy. I'd known the girl since we were in diapers so I fully anticipated her having a boyfriend by the end of September. His name was Mike and he wasn't anything special; just your standard frat pledge douche canoe.   After about a month on campus the novelty of college started wearing off. Lydia and I found our stride and we spent more weekends studying than drinking. Midterms were coming up in a couple weeks and I was determined to maintain a 4.0 GPA throughout my freshman year.    One night in early October I was woken up by a loud, grinding sound. I sat up in bed and strained to hear it again. Lydia was also wide awake and listening.  *SLAM*  *What the fuck?* She mouthed to me.  It wasn't unusual for there to be noise in the hallways since other people came in at all hours of the night. But this sound had definitely come from next door - the corner room.   *GRIND*   "Is that-"  "Yeah," Lydia whispered. "That's the window next door."  At Lydia's insistence, we kept our window closed at all times. However, there was no mistaking the sound of the window in room 733 being opened and closed again at regular intervals.  *SLAM*   "Who's in there?"  Lydia shrugged.  "Is someone fucking with us? Is this like initiation?"   Lydia raised her eyebrow at me. "Initiation to what?"  "I don't know. College? Maybe they're hazing the freshman?"  *GRIND* (it opened)  "Who is hazing freshman?"  I shrugged.  *SLAM* (it shut)  "Becca, I love you, but that was fucking stupid."  I threw a pillow at her.  "Well, whoever it is, go tell them to knock it the fuck off."  "Me?! I'm not risking being thrown out a window."   *GRIND*  "Well, I'm not doing it!"  "I'm an art major. You're a political science major. YOU go lay down the law."  "Fuck that."   "Then call Dumbshit Beth. Isn't this the kind of nonsense she should deal with?"  *SLAM*  "Im not calling her. Don't you put that evil on me"  "Fine," Lydia whispered loudly, "then we'll just have to ignore it."  "I have class at 7:30!" I whispered.  *GRIND*  "Then do something!"  "Ugh!" I got out of bed and stomped to the door, threw it open dramatically and went down the hall to pound on the door to room 733 which simply said 'Supply Room'.  "People are trying to sleep, please fucking stop." I said when there was no answer.  *SLAM*  "Dude, seriously..." I sighed.  I stepped back from the door and immediately noticed problem.  Room 733 was padlocked shut from the outside. I hurried back to my room.  "What happened?" Lydia asked.  "I'm not going anywhere near that fucking room, again. It's locked from the outside; I don't know how anybody could get in there."  "So, youre saying it's a spooky ghost?" She laughed.  "No, Im saying there is creepy shit going on inside a room colloquially called the Suicide Room.  Lydia scoffed and rolled over to go back to sleep. "You should have been a drama major."  We didnt hear the window next door again that night but the next morning you could clearly see from outside that both windows in the corner room were now wide open.   ***  I watched the windows on room 733 for an entire week but they remained open. Occasionally at night I thought I could hear a noise next door liked marbles dropping and rolling across the floor. Since it never woke Lydia up, I didnt bother to say anything.   One afternoon I was alone in the dorm editing notes on my laptop. I had my headphones in but the music wasnt loud enough to cover the noise of someone knocking on the door.   "Come in," I said without looking up from the screen.  A moment went by and then heard I heard the knocking again. I jerked my earbuds out and slammed the laptop closed.  I turned around, "Come-"  What the fuck? The door to the hallway was wide open. I'd left it open on purpose since Ian (a junior I was dating) was supposed to be stopping by. I heard the knocking again from behind me and literally jumped out of my chair.  It had come from the other side of the room  the closet door. It was the closet that shared a wall with room 733.   "Lydia, you're not fucking funny."  Nothing.  "Lydia, I swear to god, I will punch you in your face."  Silence. I walked over to the closet door and grasped the handle.  "Lydia, youre a fucking-"  "A fucking what?"  Her voice came from the doorway  behind me. I let go of the doorknob and stumbled back, wide-eyed. Lydia threw her stuff on the bed and turned to me, crossing her arms.  "Im a fucking what?"  I...thought you were hiding in the closet." I said, lamely.  "What? Why?"  "Because someone was knocking on the door."  "Jesus, Becca." Lydia rubbed her forehead and walked over to the closet, throwing open the door. There was nothing there but clothes and boxes. She made a swipe of her arm as if to say: what now?  "I swear-"  "Becca, there's no one here."  "I know what I heard."  We glared at each other until our little stand off was interrupted by the timely arrival of Ian.   He immediately sensed the tension in the room. "Hi, ladies... Whats new?"  I gave my roommate a hostile look. "Theres strange shit is going on in that room next door. But thats not new."  'Which room? 735? Or the empty one?"  "The *empty* one." Lydia emphasized.   733. Yeah, I'm not surprised. That's the suicide room."  "Right, we heard about the deaths." I sat down on my bed.   "Yeah, its pretty fucked up. Three suicides all in one dorm room."  "Three?" Lydia raised her eyebrow. "We were told there were two."  "Well there were a couple people in the 70s and then some guy about ten years ago. He jumped out the window.  Lydia and I both shuddered. Although she was much worse, we were both terrified of heights. A falling death was about the worst thing I could think of.  "I will admit that three suicides in the same dorm room is fucking disturbing. Lydia said in an apologetic tone.  "Yeah, I heard there's something in that room." Ian said.  "Like what?"   "No one knows, but every year someone has a new theory, usually right around Halloween something gets published in the campus paper. Whatever is in there, though, it ain't friendly."  "So, has anyone ever killed themselves in the neighboring rooms? Like this one?"  "Nah, just 733. Honestly, I was surprised when I heard they were opening the north hall this year."  "They told us we were the biggest incoming freshman class in twenty years." I said absentmindedly.   "Yeah, I heard that, too. You know you could request a room change." Ian sat down on the bed next to me and I leaned against his shoulder.  "Yeah, but they wouldn't keep us together." Lydia cut in. "Becca and I have been best friends for 15 years. We can't room with other people."  "So should we just keep living here, next to Satan?" I glanced at the closet door again.  Lydia shrugged. "At least we'll have some stories to tell after graduation."  "These aren't the kind of stories I want to tell."   ***  A few days later Lydia began to believe my closet story. I woke up in the middle of the night to the sound of someone whispering. I looked over at Lydia, who was already staring at me with wide eyes. She slowly brought a finger to her lips.  I listened intently, trying to hear what the voice was saying and where it was coming from but I couldn't understand even one word. I got out of my bed and tiptoed over to Lydia's. The whispering was definitely louder over there, but then she shared a wall with room 733. I listened harder.  *...never...taken...mouths...of fools...*  *What the hell?* Lydia leaned over and put her ear up to the wall. The whispers suddenly stopped and I leaned closer. Suddenly there was a loud bang from the other side. Lydia immediately recoiled and clutched her ear in pain.   Someone was in there. Suddenly more angry than scared I again threw open our door and stomped over to the supposedly empty supply room.  I banged on the door loudly not caring who else I woke up at this point.   "Are you fucking kidding me?! I yelled at the door. This shit isn't funny anymore. Come out of that fucking room, you asshole."  Silence. And then the doorknob started to turn.  I don't know what I'd expected to happen but it wasn't that. I backed up so far from the door that I ran into the opposite wall. When the handle had turned all the way down, something started to push from the other side. The door groaned loudly but the locks held.   I held my breath until the pressure on the door subsided and the handle slowly returned to its normal position.  I noticed Lydia peaking her head out of our room. She held up her hands as if to say *what happened?*  "Someone thinks they're funny." I answered her out loud.  She shook her head and disappeared back into our room.   I knelt down on the floor and brought my head down to the carpet, peering under the door crack. It was the first time I had seen into the corner room.   Room 733 was definitely a supply closet. There were chairs stacked along one wall and bed frames along the other. A few rotting mattresses were piled under one of the windows and a thick layer of dust covered everything in the room. The windows were absolutely huge, which was something you couldnt really tell by looking up at the building. There were open as always and I could definitely see how someone could easily climb through them to the outside ledge.   The room didn't look like it had been disturbed in a couple of decades which sent a shudder wracking through my body.  The moonlight, which had been providing enough light to see into the room, suddenly vanished and I saw only pitch black inside. I blinked rapidly trying to adjust my night vision. I squeezed my eyes shut and when I opened them, a large yellow eye was looking back at me, only a few inches away from my face on the other side of the door.  I screamed and woke up half the dorm.    ***  There was no denying that things were escalating. The next morning Lydia and I put in dorm change requests with Resident Services and hoped for the best. In the meantime, we agreed to never be alone in our dorm room at night. Either we both spent the night at home or neither of us did. We started spending most nights with our respective boyfriends.  I told Ian everything that had happened and he suggested I maybe talk to the campus Paranormal Society. I hesitantly made an appointment and Lydia and I met with a small, cleanly dressed kid named Craig and four of his "colleagues the following Tuesday.  We told them everything we could remember, every incident, no matter how small.  Craig and the four other members of the Paranormal Society sat quietly and took notes for half an hour. It wasnt until we finished that anyone spoke.  "Is that all?" Craig asked.  "Yes..." I said slowly.  "Would you mind waiting out in the hall for a few minutes so that I may confer with my colleagues?"  "Sure," Lydia smiled indulgently and stood up. "Whatever you need."  The door had barely shut behind us when Lydia snorted and rolled her eyes. "Let's go."  "Go where?" I asked.  "Are you serious?"  "Lydia, come on, we need help, I am *freaking* out. We haven't stayed one night in our dorm since Thursday so this isn't something we can just brush off."  "Okay. She threw her hands up. Let's hear what they have to say and then we can go over to Resident Services and check on our move requests."  We loitered out in the hallway for another 15 minutes before Craig came out and asked up to come back and take a seat.  With all the pomp and circumstance of a meeting of parliament, Craig cleared his throat and made his diagnosis.   "What youre dealing with, ladies, is a very angry ghost."   "Is that your professional opinion, Craig?" Lydia said. I shot her a look.  "Y-yes, he stuttered. A vengeful spirit-  A spirit? I asked. I very much doubted that thats what we were dealing with.  Yes, answered one of the not-Craigs. Thats ghost to the layperson.  Jesus Christ, Lydia groaned and rubbed her temples.   Mistaking Lydias frustration with despair, Craig rushed right into his speech.  Dont be afraid, ladies, were going to take care of you.  Its true that spirits can be quite a headache if you dont know how to exorcize them which is why its good you came to us.  Suicides almost always result in angry ghosts, they need revenge.  "Revenge on whom?" I asked.  "On other students. Perhaps this particular spirit was bullied into taking his own life and now seeks to torment others.  Ah, listen-  "We can take care of this for you right away, all we ask is a small donation to the society, Craig continued. We honestly didnt realize that room was having this much activity. It's really very exciting."  "Great, well, thank you for your time," Lydia said as she grabbed my hand and pulled me out of my chair.   Do you want to set something up for this weekend? Craig asked.  Tell you what, well call you.  Lydia hurried me out of the room wearing a weary look and we didnt speak again until we were almost to the Admin building.    That was a waste of time. She said.  Look, Im not disagreeing with you, but-  Becca, tell me you didnt honestly buy into that?   So you dont think its a...a I was having trouble even saying the word, it sounded so ridiculous. ghost?  Well, I dont fucking know, but neither do they. That guy had no idea what the fuck he was talking about.  I pulled my hood lower over my eyes as we stepped into line at the Resident Services desk.  Let me put it this way. Lydia continued. Theyre playing Ghostbusters and were* living* the fucking Exorcist.   "Fine, I sighed. Then what do you want to do? Just keep sleeping at Mike and Ian's until we get reassigned?  I just want this to end. Lydia crossed her arms and stared straight ahead.  We all wanted this to end. Even if living next to that fucking room wasnt scary it was sure as hell distracting.  Alright, well, I mean we're probably safe during daylight hours so as long as we dont spend nights there we should be okay. Our room is only ghost adjacent after all, and our new assignments will come through soon." I checked my watch. Fuck its almost 2.  "Shit, really? I gotta go. Mike got accepted to Sigma Chi and he's getting initiated today."  "Oh yeah, I forgot he rushed."  The girl at the desk waved us forward. I hadnt even realized wed reached the front of the line.  Let me know what they say, Lydia said as she ran out the door.  The girl at the desk eyed me suspiciously as I approached.   Hi, Im-  Youre the girl trying to move out of 734 in Reilly, arent you?  Shed caught me off guard. Yeah, one of them. Howd you know?  Sorry, I overheard you. I also saw your file cross my desk a few days ago and I gotta ask: why are you looking to transfer rooms, exactly?  I was tired. I was beaten down. I didnt have the energy to think of a lie.  Because shit is going on in the empty room next door and its really freaking us out.  Noises, whispers, knocking, the other night I saw someone...  You saw someone?  Yeah.  In room 733?  Yeah. I looked under the door. There was definitely someone in there.  The girl narrowed her eyes at me for a moment and then nodded for no particular reason.  Well, your rooms arent ready yet but Ive pushed them through as a priority. For right now youre stuck, though. There just isnt anywhere else to put you.  I sighed. Id figured as much.  Im Alice, she continued, and, look, Ive actually done a lot of research on the Reilly suicides and I think I can help you. Or at the very least offer some insight.  Really? I asked, hesitantly.   Absolutely.  Im in Taylor Hall, room 310. Ill be back to my dorm by 4 today."  "Thanks. We just came from the Paranormal Society on campus.   Ugh, say no more, Alice rolled her eyes.   Yeah, soIll definitely see you at 4.  Great, Alice said, and smiled.   ***  I was early to Taylor, but then so was she. I told our story for the second time that day and Alice wasnt afraid to interrupt with questions, though her queries didnt betray her thoughts.  When I was finished she leaned back in her chair and sighed deeply.  "I cant believe it, she shook her head. Id always heard rumors but I honestly doubted any of it was true.  I can assure you  everything Ive told you is absolutely true.  And how is it now? When youre there?  We arent ever there at night but during the day weve heard scratching on the wall, really quiet whispering and sometimes we still hear the window opening and closing. In broad fucking daylight. However every time I look up from the street the windows to 733 are open.  Alice nodded. Well, for the record I dont think youre in any danger. As much as it sucks, you guys are simply a casualty. You just need to stay out of room 733.  I snorted. Are you kidding? I would never go in there.  "I believe that you believe that. But this thing, whatever it is, it's tricky. Manipulative. A *liar*. And it's smarter than you."  "I'll try not to be offended by that."  "You shouldn't be."  What do you think it is?  Something very old and very evil.  I regarded her skeptically and then let my eyes wander around the room. I hadnt really noticed the dcor before but to say Alice had an interest in the occult was an understatement.  "I can't see any situation where I would be compelled to enter that room."  "I know. But you have to be prepared that there may come a time when you have to make a *decision* about entering that room. Because what youre dealing with? Its already killed five people.  "Five?! I thought it was three!"  "Yeah, well, not everyone is inclined to do the level of research that I do. Lets see, there was Ellen Burnham in 1961  she jumped out the window. She was the very first. And then Tad Collinsworth in 1968 - he jumped, too. Marissa Grigg in 1975, she hung herself. Erin Murphy in 1979 - she jumped. And then Erik Dousten in 1992 - he hung himself."  "Five suicides. How could the university still let people live in there?  "They dont, apparently. Thats why its a supply room.  And back then?  Well, every few years, once everyone who would remember had graduated, the room would be reassigned. This was before the internet, you know, and the incoming freshman were clueless. But after that last one - Erik Dousten - they closed the entire north hall of the 7th floor and built more rooms onto the south hall."  "So, what does it want?"  Alice shrugged. "Chaos. Death. Souls. Who knows? No one even knows what it *is*."  "Okay, so what *do* we know?"  "We know that it's somehow bound to that room though it seems to have minimal influence just outside of it. We know that everyone who ever died was alone at the time. And we know that it's a trickster. That's what we know."  It wasnt enough. Why do you think they do it? I asked quietly.  The victims?  I nodded.  All I know is whats rumored to be in the evidence files. All the suicides were found with pictures or writings that were considered unspeakable at the time.  They contained horrible, evil things that would make you physically sick to read or see, they say.  And these people, they drew them? They wrote that stuff?  Yep. Whatever is in that room drove them mad.  Thats fucking terrifying.  Have you guys considered getting somebody to bless the room?"  "Jesus."  "Well you'll have a hard time getting him but perhaps some other sort of holy person."  "No, I mean, Jesus, you're talking about an exorcism."  Alice shrugged. "Maybe. The rumor in the 70s was that this all started with a Ouija board game gone wrong in 1961."  Really? That shits made by Hasbro.  "Not in the 60s it wasnt. Anyway, it's just a rumor. The only person on campus who would know is Tom Moen in Admin. I've tried to talk to him before but he refuses to see me."  "Did he go here in 1961?"  "Yes. And he was staying in Reilly."  "We need to talk to him. I need to know what the fuck is happening or I wont be able to live the rest of my life as a well adjusted person."  "I suppose we can try to chase him down on campus."  Can we talk to him tomorrow?"  "We can try.  ***  Mr. Moen wouldn't see us that day or the next. We tried to catch him on his lunch hour and then again while he was leaving work but he got around us every time. It was soon clear that the old man was actively avoiding us.  Lydia and I had seen little of each other since wed continued to sleep in other dorms. I went back to our room twice a day - once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Usually the other room was silent but that didnt make me feel better. I could always sense something on the other side of the wall, somehow watching me. It felt like the calm before the storm.  The Thursday before Halloween I came back to the dorm to shower in the evening, much later than usual.  Id seen Lydia that afternoon and shed informed me that she had enough clothes stored at Mikes to last until graduation  so I knew Id be there alone.   I showered down the hall in the safety of the bathrooms and then walked back to my room to change. I was supposed to meet Ian in half an hour to head out to a party and I wanted to get out of here as quick as possible.    Since the silence was unnerving me, I threw my iPod on the docking station and turned up AC/DC.  I got dressed and then stood in front of the mirror to dry my hair. I flipped my head over and blow dried upside down to try and give my hair some volume. When I flipped my head back up and shut off the blow-dryer I immediately noticed the silence in the room. But that wasnt all I noticed.  I wasnt in my dorm anymore. Behind me was reflected the dusty bedframes and large open windows of room 733. I spun around in a panic to find that I was actually standing in my own room. I looked back at the mirror to see that 733 still reflected there. A slight movement behind me was all it took to make me run.   I grabbed my purse and phone and I fled from my room slamming the door behind me. On the elevator ride down I called Alice.  "I can't do it anymore," I said when she picked up. "I cant go back in that room, again. I cant ever go back.  What happened?  I told her.  "Jesus. What do you want to do?" She asked.  "I need to talk to someone who knows what the fuck is going on. Is Tom Moen the only person we know was here in 1961?"  "The only one I know of. Maybe we can get him on his way in tomorrow morning? We'll just corner him and refuse to move until he tells us something. He comes in at 6:30 according to the schedule I have. Do you want to meet me outside the Starbucks in the Atrium?"  "Fuck yeah I do. I have a class at 7:30 but I'll blow it off."  Okay. See you then."  I wasnt usually much for parties but I was glad I was going to one that night. As soon as we got there I asked Ian to get me a drink. Since I wasnt usually much of a drinker he gave me a raised eyebrow. I gave him a brief synopsis of what had happened earlier, hoping he wouldnt think I was crazy.   Ian made me a scotch and coke. It was the first of many.  Around midnight I went to have a cigarette and checked my phone. I had a voicemail from Lydia left at 11:04pm.  *"Hey Becca, listen I just, ugh, I just had a huge fucking fight with Mike. He, well, I guess his frat decided that for Halloween this year all the new brothers have to spend the night in the Suicide Room. In our dorm.  I just, I can't fucking take it. He knows what's been going on with us and he still agreed to do this. Hes now trying to convince me that Sigma Chi is behind all of the stuff going on in room 733 because theyve been trying to drum up buzz for their Halloween deal. I can't-"*  I hit end and threw my phone in my bag. No wonder Lydia was pissed. This was not good. Not good at all.   I found Ian inside and asked him to take me home. I was suddenly very stressed, very tired and very drunk.   When the alarm went off at 6am, it took everything I had to pull myself out of bed. I got dressed in the clothes I'd worn the night before and shuffled my way across campus to the Atrium.   Alice was already there with a black coffee in hand.  "I figured you'd need this," she laughed.  "How'd you know?"   "Your texts."  "I texted you last night?"  "Yeah, at about 1. You told me about Sigma Chi.  "Oh, god, yeah." I pushed my sunglasses higher up my nose and pulled my hood lower over my eyes.   "Those guys are idiots. Remember how I told you that it's crafty? Well what if the point of messing with you was to make 733 provocative, you know, to seduce people into going inside. No one has been in that room for years, can you imagine how hungry that thing is?  "Do you think they're really at risk?" I asked as I sat down on the steps to the Admin building.  "Yeah. In fact the *only* thing they have going for them is that all those suicide victims were alone at the time of their deaths."  "So, it'll be less powerful with all of them there?"  "Theoretically. We would know a lot more if we knew what it was. And we can't know what it is without knowing how it got here. And that is why we need Moen."   "What time is he supposed to get here?"  "Actually, twenty minutes ago," Alice said, grimly.  It was another half an hour before we resigned ourselves to the fact that Mr. Moen had snuck around us as usual. We went to the front office hoping to beg again for an appointment with him anyway.  The woman at the Admin desk regarded us coldly.  Tom isn't coming in today. Or any other day for that matter. He quit yesterday. Looks like you wont be harassing him anymore."  "We weren't harassing him, I said. We just desperately needed to talk to him."  We still do. Added Alice.  "Well you wont get any of his personal information from me," she said snidely and walked away.  "What the fuck do we do now?" I asked Alice.  "Without Tom Moen there's nothing left to do."  "Alice, fuck, I can't go back into that room.   "Well, then I guess its good your transfers came through."  "They did?!"  "Yep. I got the notice when I checked my work email this morning. You're going to Morton and Lydia is going to Tinsley."  "Oh thank god."  "I thought you'd be happy about that. I also convinced my boss not to assign anyone else to room 734.  "Thank fuck."  The only thing is you wont be able to move until Monday."  "I can last through the weekend, especially now that the end is in sight. I have to tell Lydia."  I opened my phone to pull up Lydia's number but my attention was caught by the red 1 badge over the voicemail logo. I hit play. It was the rest of the message from last night.   *"-even look at his dumb fucking face anymore so I'm going to head home. Don't worry about me, I'll be okay. Im drunk enough to sleep through any bullshit from next door. I'm just so fucking pissed off right now. I would honestly rather deal with Dumbshit Beth than Michael-My-Parents-Must-Be-Siblings-Because- I'm-That-Fucking-Retarded-Benson. Lets hang out tomorrow. Love ya!"*  The message ended.   "Goddamn it."   Alice gave me a questioning look.  "Lydia spent the night in our dorm."  Alice cringed.   "She's safe though, right?"  "As long as she doesn't go into 733."  "She wont. I thought of the always open large windows of the corner room. If nothing else the mere thought of those would keep Lydia the hell out of that room.  "Good. Well, since we have nothing else to do, do you want to go look for theology books in the library? It's pretty much the only thing open right now. "  Sure," I shrugged.  I didn't have another class until 10.  The little old lady who sat behind the library's checkout desk must have been 1,000 years old. Ms. Stapley's eyes were small and watery and her skin looked like it was melting off of her skull. Still, she was nice and knowledgeable and she sent us in the right direction for books on demonology, though she gave us a curious look as she did.  There wasnt much. We read everything we could but it either wasnt relevant or wasnt in English. We returned to her desk 30 minutes later.  "Ah, do you have anything on the occult?"  "The occult? Ah..." Her voice trailed off. "Yes, I do. Over there to the left of the reference section.  "Ok thanks. Sorry, Im too hung-over to use the Dewey decimal system," I said.   "I don't think she likes the look of us," Alice whispered as we walked away.  "Our look or our subject matter?"  "Probably neither."  Within the hour we were back up at her desk having struck out again. We could tell she was getting annoyed as her eyes narrowed suspiciously at us as we approached.  "Ah, sorry, do you know where we could find something on sances or Ouija boards or-"  "Now listen, girls. Ms. Stapley stood up from her desk and looked over her glasses at us. I really hope this is for class."  "It is," I said.  "It's not," Alice answered simultaneously. "It's personal research.  "Research? What kind of research?"  "Look, we're not going to mess with a Ouija board or anything" I said.   "Good," Ms. Stapley smoothed her pleated pants and sat back down. "Because I can't have that sort of thing going on here again."  "*Again?*" Alice latched on.  The older woman suddenly looked very uncomfortable and started fidgeting with a stack of books on her desk.  We may have something on sances in-   "Ms. Stapley, were researching what happened in Reilly in 1961. Alice interrupted.  And also whats been happening there ever since.  "Well, it's no secret, is it? A student committed suicide in that room. Dreadful but not unheard of on a university campus.  "Five students." I corrected her.  "But you know that, right? Alice was suddenly talking very fast. Because you sound like youre well versed in this story. Please, tell us how this started and we might be able to end it."  "End it?" Ms. Stapley's voice became quieter but more concentrated. "Dont be so arrogant, young lady. You can't end it. People have always died in that room and they always will. There is no end to it so youd best stay far away from it."  "But maybe if we knew how this all started -"  "It started just as you think it did. But everyone that was involved is either very old or very dead by now. Just stay away from that room. Concentrate on your studies."  I leaned over her desk. "Well, I'd love to but they assigned my friend and me to the room next door. Maybe you can forget about all the suicides but we cant. It wont fucking let us."  "Young lady, I never forget." Ms. Stapely voice was even quieter now. "My friend Ellen was the very first to be killed in that room. She was my very best friend and not a night goes by that I don't imagine her wiggling out of that tiny window, standing upon the cold ledge in her bare feet and jumping off the 7th floor of that building."  Alice sighed.  Im really sorry. I didnt know.  "Yes, well these are old wounds, my dear. Now girls, I suggest you request a room reassignment immediately. No one should be living on the seventh floor of that building.  And thats all Im going to tell you about it.   Alice sighed but resigned herself to a nod. We wouldnt learn anything more here. Still, it was quite a breakthrough - at least we had *some* information now.  Alice walked away and I made to follow her but my feet wouldnt move. Something was bothering me - a small yet poignant word had been buried in Ms. Stapley's story; a word that suddenly seemed very important.  "Eh, Ms. Stapley, I asked the tired, old woman at the desk, Why did you refer to the windows in 733 tiny? Because Ive seen those windows and theyre huge, like 5 feet tall.  "Dear, you're thinking of the corner room, thats the supply closet. Room 733 is next door to that."  "No-no," I stuttered, "that's room 734."  "Yes, well, it is *now*. When they built the additional rooms on to the south hall they moved all the room numbers down.  *Oh my god.* I suddenly felt very hot and very dizzy.  "That sneaky fucker," Alice whispered next to me, her skin paling.  "Lydia."   We took off across the campus at a dead run, witnessed only by the few bleary-eyed students on their way to morning classes. When Reilly finally came into view I stumbled on the pavement as my blood turned to ice. From our vantage point we could clearly see the windows of the corner room were closed  the first and only time I had ever seen that way.  And the window to my room was open.   We ran into the lobby, pushing past several latte-sipping, ugg boot-wearing freshman who had just gotten off the elevator. I hit 7 and watched the doors close more slowly than they ever had before. I leaned against the wall, trying to steady my breathing.  "Alice, how the fuck did this happen?"  "I don't know. I dont fucking know.  "She's been in there all night, Alice. In our room. Alone.  Alice shook her head but had nothing to say.  When the doors finally opened on floor 7, we saw a quiet, deserted hallway. I ran toward my room with Alice right behind me. Rounding the corner, I threw open my door hoping it wasnt locked.  And it wasnt.  Lydia looked back at me. And for one breathless moment, cruel glimmer of hope crossed over her tear streaked face.  But it was too late. The next second, she leaned forward so slightly, and she was gone.  She screamed the entire way down.  Alice ran to the ledge where Lydia had just been while I stood motionless. She stuck her head out the window and looked down just as a different kind of screaming started from the bottom floor. Alice closed her hand over her mouth and pulled her head back into the room as tears of shock ran down her ghost- white face.   The screaming from outside got louder as more people saw what remained of my best friend on the cold pavement. I leaned back against the dresser and slumped to the floor. A falling death. Lydia never wanted a falling death.   I absentmindedly picked up one of the pictures that were strewn all over the floor. It was a picture of Lydia's mother. She was dead. I picked up another picture. It was Lydias baby sister. She was dead, too.  There were dozens of pictures just like it all over the floor - Lydia has been busy last night. As for the things depicted in them, I cannot tell you. Lydia was a talented artist and I only saw a few before I got sick on the floor next to me.   Alice was standing in the doorway yelling something down the hall. I don't know what she was saying because all I could hear was a high pitched whine in the room. Suddenly a piece of paper slid out from under the crack in the closet door and glided across the floor toward me. I picked it up and studied it for a moment.   This was drawn by Lydia too, but it wasnt like the others. It was a picture of the closet from my exact vantage point. In the drawing the door was cracked and there was something looking back from the darkness.  I put the paper down and studied the closet. The door was cracked open just like the picture. I squinted my eyes and tried to see inside. Just as I started to distinguish the defined lines of a long face looking back at me, Alice pulled me to my feet.  "We need to get out of here," I thought I heard her say.  I never went back into that room. My parents moved my things and I spent the rest of the semester in an apartment off campus. I transferred to an out of state school for my spring semester and finished my degree there.  Every night I dream of Lydia pulling herself through the tiny window, shimmying out onto the cold ledge, standing up and knowing theres nothing between her body and the terrifying abyss in front of her.  I watch her look down seven stories to the black pavement below and realize, though not accept, her terrible fate. I see the blind horror cross her familiar features. I hear her wildly pounding heart, desperately trying to race through every beat of the life she should have lived, and knowing it has only mere seconds.   I watch her look back at me. And I watch her fall.   It's been 9 years since that night. And every fall semester for 9 years Ive called Resident Services to see which dorms are open for new student assignments. Reilly is always open. The seventh floor is closed.   This year life and work got in the way and I called much later than usual. I was put on hold immediately.    "Resident Services." A man finally answered. "Were you the one asking about open rooms in Reilly?  Yes, thats me.  We're entirely filled up and theres a waiting list for Reilly. But, as it happens, you actually have great timing. I make no promises but we may be able to get you in. We just got approval this morning.  Approval for what? I said slowly   Were opening up the seventh floor.   [C.W.](https://www.facebook.com/ck.walker00)                                    Thank you!   Yes, understood, I just paraphrased the context.     I believe you are right and the plural of kraken is "kraken".  In the context above ("look at this picture of the kraken from pirates of the Caribbean") would you capitalize the word?   the new one over on the nosleep board - [don't text and drive.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2jcb8c/dont_text_and_drive/)   that's the only one I've seen with pictures in awhile.   I can see I need to watch this movie.   How flattering that the butler remembers I am indeed a Madame and not a Sir!   [Leprechaun 4: In Space](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116861/)  I'd really love to watch that win an oscar.   Try /r/nosleepfinder. The butler there /u/nosleepfinder-butler knows all and he's quite dapper.   The third is a skeletal...creature and the 4th I don't even fucking know. It's got teeth    Jesus...turn up the brightness on your screen because it's horrifying      Thanks, man!   I apologize in advance for this because there is a possibility, albeit small, that i read this outside of Nosleep.   Basically a girl and her group of friends adopt someone into their group who the narrator can't see or hear. She thinks they're messing with her for the next 20 years. Turns out she accidentally killed her, they go dig up the body, she still can't see her.  It was really brilliant, just wish I could find it.   That dog is handsome.   Congratulations- that's awesome!   Im willing though I'm by no means an expert.    /r/beerwithaview /r/thewalkingdead /r/asoiaf /r/AskReddit /r/worldnews /r/comiccon /r/running    my mom is dead.   RIP Carter. Only the good die young.   Whatever multiple personality disorder is called now - that's what you're dealing with.    Oh shit, I thought the pictures were of the girl you cheated with.   Boo!   I'm so glad somebody made this sub.   It was. I loved this story.   Mr. Vultures,   Do you plan to write another series/novella for your beloved nosleep?    Okay. I think we can parody Poe's "The Raven" by reworking it as "The Jackdaw".    Sigh. Insurance underwriter.    yep! I'll do Fearcon, Phx Comic Con fanfest (in january) and Comic Con in June. Let me know if you're going to be at fear con!   You need to get rid of Oreo 2 before she outs you.    Nah, it's ok, it's a lot more entertaining this way. Thanks though!    I can do Fearcon in Phoenix next month. I'm pretty sure /u/EtTuTortilla is local too.    Oh man, that was done like six months ago when I was new to nosleep. Some of my answers are cringeworthy, so apologies for that.    I'm didnt even know this existed. Glad to see 1000vultures got top billing. He's like the Walt Disney of nosleep.    I still love you, Nic.   	80

Nate        Do you really believe they were ESSENTIAL for his success?  Absolutely, I'm sure he'd say the same thing.    That doesn't diminish he hard work or his investment.  Without a market for Telsa's cars, he fails, and without the California Zero-emission tax credits, Tesla isn't even profitable.  There are stories told of how close Tesla was to going under, I believe a couple of months from not being able to make payroll (read bankrupt.)    Building PayPal is significantly easier than a car company, and the sale price of any internet-based company should be weighted carefully (How much did What's App sell for again?  Does anyone seriously think a mobile phone app was harder to develop that a car company? Luck  and a good idea is a huge part of the internet success, in fact luck is substantially under appreciated in business success.)  Here's a story for you to read: [Tesla Is No Success Story Tesla is only profitable thanks to politics and tax subsidies.](http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/06/03/teslas-success-is-the-result-of-political-favoritism)  Some quotes:  Tesla Motors, the California-based electric car start-up, has been the subject of a great deal of hype. With the recent news that it repaid its $465 million low-interest loan from the Department of Energy, it's now being heralded as a success story worthy of redeeming the failures of a green-energy subsidy program that has included the likes of Solyndra, Abound, Ener1, and Fisker Automotive. Since then, Tesla's stock value has more than doubled and the company is currently valued at around $12 billion.  and   Even with the support of federal and state politicians, Tesla would still be reporting losses were it not for its ability to profit off of other auto manufacturers in California. In the first quarter of 2013, Tesla reported its first-ever quarterly profit by using special credits from California's Air Resources Board, which rewards auto manufacturers for the production of "zero-emission" vehicles. So far this year, Tesla was able to turn what would have been a $57 million loss into an $11 million gain by selling $68 million worth of these credits to other auto manufacturers in California.   Without a low-interest loan from the DOE, Tesla would have had some trouble getting started.  Sure he could have gone to venture capital, but they would have wanted a lot of control over the company, something Musk has been reported as being unwilling to give.   PhD chemist here, you are right.  "Simple" things are months of work.   You realize his efforts have gotten significant government support.  SpaceX is basically funded by a NASA contract, Tesla received a government-backed loan, and the sales of their cars are supported by a meaningful tax incentive.  It is unlikely he would have made it without the government, so this is probably a case of a perfect counter example to the libertarian dream.

For example, acrylates copolymer can be any from a list of acrylate monomers and literally any molecular weight above 1500 or so.    put $1k towards a decent mortgage  Anyone who is making that much doesn't has a mortgage payment much higher that $1000, $2000 to $3000 for the mortgage is a lot more realistic. If you don't have a mortgage payment, you probably pay cash for an M4 anyway.    That being said, you general analysis is correct, someone could in principle afford this, but it would be pretty dumb.  I believe most people who drive M cars lease them. (Assuming the majority of those with M cars aren't hobby racers.)  I suspect a majority of the people who drive them are business guys who want the appearance/status symbol. (that doesn't cheapen the car, just a society thing.)     Because INCI names aren't chemical names, they are a nomenclature of their own.

I think 5 mL of methanol is all that it take to blind you.    Ethanol, you can drink an 8 oz glass and just have a bad headache the next day!   Pretty much.   Mercury is only used in one vaccination that children get, the DTaP, and the form used is not toxic to humans at anywhere near the concentrations used.  You could drink elemental mercury and it would pass right through you, the salts are substantially more dangerous because they are far more readily absorbed.   You are correct, they are both organomercury compounds, but different types.  Similar to ethanol and methanol, which are both alcohols, however they have drastically different toxicities.  A lot of ethanol os a drunken good time, 15 mL of methanol will kill you.   [Today, the only childhood vaccines that have trace amounts of thimerosal are: one DTaP vaccine and one DTaP-Hib combination vaccine.](http://www.cdc.gov/vaccinesafety/Concerns/Thimerosal/thimerosal_faqs.html#f)  So it's just the DTaP.   Actually, they didn't.  Aluminum is in there as a [adjuvent]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjuvant) not a preservative, aluminum was already there.   It's important not to propagate misinformation however.  Also, the mercury used at a preservative in vaccines is a different compound of mercury, and isn't nearly as dangerous to humans.    The mercury found in tuna, however, is more than a vaccination ever was and **is** the dangerous kind, methylmercury.  It's presence is largely the result of humans burning coal which releases mercury into the environment.

It was the right response to Diaz's style, that's what you do to one dimensional fighters, take away their style.   Condit was point-fighting Diaz, too.  You could also look at this as exposing Diaz for being unable to adapt once his game plan was taken away from him.     This is an opinion piece, not research.

Also, if something bad would come up from a link on an "approved" site, would reddit still be able to claim safe harbor?   Every single one of your comments in /r/science has been removed for breaking various rules, you've ranged the gambit from inane and off topic to homophobic and insulting.  And now you're whining to strangers about how terribly oppressed you are.     glib lib/ adjective (of words or the person speaking them) fluent and voluble but insincere and shallow. "she was careful not to let the answer sound too glib"      Thanks.  In /r/science, we have an unusual situation in that we have an incredible number of mods, 814 last count, which gives us a lot of internal review of mod actions without the drama of having a public mod log or anything like that.  Because /r/science is one of the most moderated subreddits we get a people who post thinking it's any old sub that they can make their shitty, off-topic, political comments in and get away with it.  They can't (and should not be able to, frankly.)  While we do have mods from many different back grounds, I assure you that we don't have a dramatic ideological bend beyond being pro-science, as in peer-reviewed science.  We aren't pushing any philosophical positions, mostly we try to keep them out.  That's why his comment was removed, he's making a glib comment that is pushing a personal position (which is seen in his previous comments.)   In /r/science, the only time we look at behavior outside is to confirm a track record of poor behavior.  ( posting on a racist subreddit would tend to confirm that a user is a racist for example.)   It's because of a history of bad comments by this user.  We give temp bans to get user's attention, nothing special here.  It was a shitty comment that offered little insight.     He received a warning because of his history of bad comments, most of them have been removed for being overly hostile or political in nature.  It's not just this comment in isolation.    Sorry that we don't feel like getting into arguments with hostile users looking to screen shot our conversations for grandstanding.  /r/science is not a free-speech subreddit, we have rules, we enforce those rules.        He isn't banned, he's just not giving you the complete story, like leaving out the parts where he is reinstated and given a warning to make better comments in the future.  We issue short term bans to get people's attention, works doesn't it?  Not as drama filled that way is it?    [Here's the real conversation](http://imgur.com/eYeAUpL)  Note the bit he left out at the end.  But by all means, don't let this interfere with your circlejerk and harassing messages.

Is that closer to rheology or tribiology?   (Like I said, I'm not the one who knows about this stuff, and it's the difference of slightly different orange backgrounds on flair, anthro used to be in soc, so there are probably anthro people with soc css classes.)   Our resident anthropologists tell us that Linguistics is a subset of Anthro.  http://www.aaanet.org/about/WhatisAnthropology.cfm  Social Anthro, Physical Anthro, Archaeology and Linguistics.  None of these are subsets of chemistry, so I don't have a knowledgeable opinion.      Yup.  There isn't really an easy way to further break down the fields since people put their particular area, not a subfield in the text.  It would have to be done manually by someone familiar with the fields separating each out.  Some of them would be pretty hard to classify as well!    For example, we have people with engineering degrees who work on computer programs to analyze biology.  So which field are they in?   It's under anthro, we follow the North American standard.

 Instead of the Catcher in the Rye read The Outsiders by S. E. Hinton.   Until I got to Reddit I had no idea that people saw images in their head when they read since I never have. Hasn't stopped me from getting wrapped up in books and being able to suspend disbelief when necessary. At the same time, yes, I dislike epic/high fantasy because there's so much description that does nothing for me -- it just drags down the pace of the story. I do like urban and comic fantasy because they tend to dispense with all that wordiness. I also read a variety of other genres.   It's mostly bestsellers and books people had to read in school, regardless of genre.    Try /r/literature then.   I'm not a Christian either and I can't defend why they decided that homosexuality is about the worst thing ever while bacon is a-ok.   It is the prayer for the sick! I'm impressed that they got it basically right. He said the word for "sick people" and not "sick person," but close enough!   This is not correct. The Bible gave signs for which mammals were allowed to be eaten and which weren't. They are: split hooves and chewing their cud. Pigs are singled out for special mention because they have split hooves but don't chew their cud. Three other animals are singled out for chewing their cud but not having split hooves but since they're not commonly eaten anyway, people tend to forget about them.  It has nothing to do with dirt or trichinosis.    Kegels can help. Yes, kegels for men.   What "pop culture" are you referring to? Pop singers are generally denigrated if they don't play instruments unless they have an amazing voice because of the (mistaken) perception that they're not really talented or not really artists.   Because every state has its own geography, culture, history, resources, industries, etc., so each state makes laws that suit its own needs.    Before a person goes in for surgery it's relatively common to "donate to yourself" if they think you might need it.   Hareton  That's a name?  ......I see it was used in Wuthering Heights. Reading that was so traumatic that clearly I have blocked all memory of it.      Some stores offer anti-bacterial wipes to wipe down your cart.

How to renew an expired Green Card: http://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-green-card-granted/renew-green-card   Because they tried Prohibition already and it was a disaster. It could be in the future once marijuana is fully legalized around the world they will start in on demonizing alcohol.   They are chemical reactions in our bodies which we interpret as emotions of one sort or another. For example, when you hug somebody and get a release of oxytocin, you interpret it as love.   When you fill your mouth with water there is no lack of oxygen. Swishing water around your mouth can help prevent tooth decay by washing away sugars or particles stuck between your teeth, but it can't kill germs. Only mouthwash can do that.   Still the same answer, honestly. Obviously it depends on your relationship, but I've had some funny (read: awkward) encounters with non-Orthodox coworkers on the subject of religion and it's left me gun shy.    "Happy holiday."   It's a nice thought for you to be more specific, but I personally find it uncomfortable. Plus, if the person saying "happy holiday" has their own holiday around the same time, I can easily say back "Thanks, you too."   I look at tall beautiful blonde people and I think "I'm supposed to look like that." What's the difference between you and me? Otherkin look at animals and think "I'm supposed to look like that." What's the difference between you and them?   Funny, I was about to mention the third book in Follett's Century trilogy: Edge of Eternity. I will probably finish it this weekend, but it's such a slog. It's more like a trip through history than an actual story about real characters, like a more boring version of Forrest Gump.    Let him read Ivanhoe, then. Outlander is basically the 20th century version of Twilight.   "It was as black in the closet as old blood"  The Sweetness at the Bottom of the Pie by Alan Bradley.  Disappointing book, actually. I expected it to be delightful and it's not.   It's meant to be a throwback to the olden days before they were able to produce paper evenly. As sort of mentioned above, it's a stylistic choice, often used for literary fiction to imply that the book is somehow more "authentic." (Though if you Google it, plenty of crap gets deckle edging too. Sometimes it's just a publisher's *thing*.)   That's called deckle edge and it's totally normal. When I Googled what you said the title was, that's exactly how they described it. You got the book you ordered.  On the Road Paperback  Deckle Edge, June 1, 1999   On the top right-hand side of your phone.   He shouldn't be trying any of those things. He doesn't have a sleep disorder.  If this is the first time he's lived with someone, then he just needs time to adjust. It may take a while -- months even -- but a hotel room doesn't compare. Not only because it was probably for a relatively short amount of time, but also because it was not his own room and it was a disruption in his normal life routine, all of which can cause sleeping problems.   No need to make life difficult for yourself. Just because a book is considered to have literary merit doesn't mean it can't be short and/or easy to read. I'd go with ~~the Crucible,~~ A Separate Peace, and 1984.  Wait, you said it had to be a novel. Hamlet and Dante's Inferno aren't novels.    As for the bed thing, that's pretty easy....two twin beds pushed together lets you "share" a bed but pick the mattress that works best for both of you.  Or the sleep number bed where the two sides can be adjusted separately if the room is too small for two twin beds.   Apparently if you don't own a lot of books, they age you down, potentially by 20+ years, and vice versa: if you own a lot of books, they age you up. That question should be deleted, or at least weighted differently since no doubt a good many people, such as myself, get books from the library. Not to mention that owning a lot of books has nothing to do with your "taste" in books.      Not only do I do this, I try whatever it is the person is interested in, so I'll have more of a personal experience of what they're talking about. Even if I end up not liking it, at least I gave it a shot. And sometimes I do end up liking it so now we have a shared interest.  I have yet to meet anybody who would do this for me. And that's why I'm still single.   Well, part of the reason.   The idea is that a drunk might be aware that they are drunk and take as much care as they can, be cautious.  Except this doesn't happen. The old saying is that if a person is weaving all over the road, they're drunk; if they're driving extra cautiously, they're stoned.  Distracted driving is not worse than drunk driving, in fact, it's better -- in the sense that you can choose to put down your phone but you cannot stop being drunk by choosing not to be drunk anymore.   In my experience, often enough to be noticeable.  For example, at work, I can't tell you how many times I've been sitting at my desk, the phone rings once and then hangs up, and whoever it was never makes any attempt to call or contact me again. So if I'm not at my desk when a call comes in and when I get back there's a "missed call" indication but they haven't left a message or sent me an e-mail, I'm going to assume they dialed my number by accident.   Just because someone dialed my number it doesn't necessarily mean they want to talk to me, or it doesn't necessarily mean they want to talk to me later. It could easily be a wrong number* or that they wanted to talk to me right then and there and if I'm not around, never mind, I don't need to call them back later.   *Yes, even if it's someone you know. For example, I've dialed one friend when I meant to call another.    It feels really awkward to call someone for no reason, mostly because I can't stop thinking that the other person has better things to do and wants to get off the phone.  You need to trust that your friends want to talk to you. If they don't, then you might want to reconsider whether they're actually your friends or not.  I have friends that I talk to for two hours every week, I have friends I talk to for an hour a month. I chit-chat with my mother for about five minutes at a time multiple times a week sometimes. It entirely depends on what your schedule is, their schedule is, and what you have to say to each other.   Lately I've found some of my conversations start awkwardly, like we're both being polite about letting the other person go first. I need to start being more assertive because one of my friends tends to monopolize the conversation if I let her go first.  The conversations end when it's time to go to bed or it's time to go do something such as putting the kids to bed or taking the cake out of the oven or switching over the laundry from the washing machine to the dryer.    I feel like I'm unable to multitask while holding a phone to my ear.  1. Don't multitask. If you're sitting in a restaurant with your friend you might both be eating, but you're not doing the laundry or walking the dog or sending out resumes. There's no reason why you should be multitasking just because you're sitting at home.  2. If you simply must multitask, get some kind of hands-free device or put the call on speakerphone.   Plus, only wear cotton underwear.   Not really correct. There were some well-known rich Jewish families and there were certainly some well-off Jewish communities, but overall, the majority of Jews throughout history were poor.   This kind of conspiracy theory that OP is talking about really only goes back to the Protocols of the Elders of Zion, which was first published in 1903. Previous to that, the sort of conspiracy theories about Jews was that they were poisoning wells and using the blood of Christian children in their matzah, not that they were taking over the world.    The US-Mexico border isn't linear. A good chunk of it is the Rio Grande. Most US state borders aren't linear either. I only count ten states whose borders are precisely straight or nearly so. Even the US-Canada border is only straight for part of the way.   I'm not sure you could draw any better conclusions than we already do from studies and death certifications/autopsies. Without extensive information about a person's background and lifestyle, you couldn't control for confounding factors.    Baccano was better.    Where do you live, OP? Are owls common around there?   I haven't seen the movie yet but as I watched the trailer for Far From Men (with Viggo Mortensen), it felt like they literally gave away the entire movie.       "Take a Walk" by Passion Pit is sort of about that.    Theoretically I have no problem with people carrying guns but in reality I find that many people who want to carry them are more paranoid about their safety than reality warrants and they're looking to be heroes, which too often leads to unsafe practices such as not keeping their guns properly secured when children are around or by shooting first and asking questions later.   Most likely the state's health department, possibly also the CDC.   But while it's an interesting idea, I'm not entirely sure that looking at people's medical records would really tell us much since they're not controlled studies.   Most likely they're very dry. Blinking a few times and creating tears should clear it up, if not, then artificial tears/saline should do the trick.   Stories aren't just intellectually engaging, they're also emotionally engaging. You care about a story you're reading. By and large you couldn't care less about the history you're studying.     Symptoms of food poisoning generally don't happen overnight  Generally they do. Some don't, but the most commons ones do. In fact, many of them show symptoms after only a few hours.   Never do this. Someone who isn't identifiable as Jewish is the same as a non-Jew, in terms of practical matters.   For example, if I were in a theme park and I needed directions to the bathroom, it doesn't matter the religion of the person I ask; if I needed directions to the kosher food stand, then someone who isn't identifiably Jewish probably won't know.   This is only true for male versus female life expectancy and nothing really to do with any particular person.   As has been said, men are more likely to have risky jobs. They are also more likely to engage in risky behavior and less likely to take care of their health, such as by going to the doctor when they have symptoms of a serious illness.    They most certainly will not tell you that. This only happens in the movies. The only time that staying conscious matters is if the person potentially has a concussion.   Cannot confirm. I live in NYC, work with plumbers, have gotten more gas calls in the past three days than in past three months.   And I feel like I've been an adult ever since I can remember and only now that I'm bordering middle age do I finally feel like I'm the right age.  At the same time, I like to pick up pennies, sing silly songs, watch cartoons, and go on Reddit.   So, get off my lawn, OP!   Fear. Even if you that person isn't "the one," at least you have someone. If you leave them, you're afraid that you might not meet anyone ever again.    Murder is an infinite crime.    It's not legit in the sense that the DEAC is not considered an accrediting body for the purposes of claiming that a school is "accredited."   If you're outside the US the UoP might be worth more because they say you can transfer the credits to NYU Abu Dhabi.    I never heard of it so I Googled. It's not accredited, so it's not entirely legit.    I speak French. It says: Do you want fries with that?  Strange sign to put on wires, but hey, that's the French for you, always promoting their own cuisine.   You're hanging out in the wrong threads? I see it all the time.  Though occasionally I do get the feeling that some Redditors are not used to defending their opinions and they back off awfully quickly when challenged, which can be boring.    Not quite.  Whether a particular type of bird flies south for the winter depends mainly on one thing: what type of food it eats.  In areas that have cold winters, some common bird foods, such as nectar and insects, may not be available year-round. Birds that eat those foods must fly south to find food to survive. Other birds that eat seeds or bugs that live under tree bark often hang around, since they can continue to find food all winter long.  - See more at: http://wonderopolis.org/wonder/do-all-birds-fly-south-in-the-winter/#sthash.5lCv33GM.dpuf            If they weren't Orthodox Jews/followers of the Shabbos, this tragedy would not have occurred.  This is false.   Hot plates are commonly used items.   They are safe to use.  They are not safe to misuse.  It is not a religious requirement to misuse a hot plate.  The tragedy occurred because of their misuse of the hot plate.  Of course I know what you're trying to say, and you're mistaken. The only way you'd be correct is if hot plates were inherently unsafe and Orthodox Jews insisted on using them anyway. This is clearly not the case.   No, we don't agree at all. If using a hot plate were unsafe then they wouldn't sell them.    I reread your post and I just want to make sure we are on the same page: you understand they left the hot plate on on purpose right? In order to avoid using electricity/flicking a switch on their religious holiday.  Which was completely unnecessary. In other words: not a religious requirement. Most people use timers to turn them on and off automatically. There's a guy in this thread who copped to leaving his hot plate on all Sabbath. You can ask him why he thinks it's safe despite the fact that we have proof that it isn't. And if he says "because their hot plate was malfunctioning and mine isn't," then he's clearly just as thoughtless as these people. Nobody knowingly uses a malfunctioning hot plate. In fact, I'm not sure there's anything he could say that wouldn't prove that he's being thoughtless.  Sorry for the idiot comment, it was out of line. it's just such a frustrating situation my emotions got the best of me.  Thanks.   As I said earlier in the thread, anybody who does that is doing so out of carelessness, not religion. There is absolutely no religious reason why they shouldn't use a timer so that it's only on when people are home and awake.   It doesn't have to be complex, it has to be compelling.    What religion do you blame when someone burns down their house when they used a flamethrower to try to kill a spider? When they fell asleep with a lit cigarette? When they used a stove to heat a cold apartment? You're the idiot if you think that religion is a more important factor here than carelessness. Orthodox Jews are not the only people in the world who use hot plates and are not the only ones who have fires caused by them.   This has nothing to do with "hardline Jewish Orthodoxy" and everything to do with thoughtlessness. Every time a person uses electricity or flames they should take utmost care -- and too many people don't. But most people get away with it.    Sadly, not everybody I know lives in NYC.    We will always enter and search to be sure that nobody was home, putting us at risk with their stupid decisions.  And I didn't know that. Will mention it next time the subject comes up.  Meanwhile it's not uncommon for bad fires to spread to neighboring houses  Not everybody lives in such close proximity to others so this isn't always applicable.   BDE.  Please do not leave your hot plate on all Shabbos, and do not leave it alone unattended, especially if you live in a house/building with multiple apartments or a single-family house that is in close proximity to other buildings/houses.   Nobody I know leaves a hot plate on the entire Sabbath. They use timers to turn them on and off. That said, I have told friends not to leave the house unattended if a hot plate is on. They ignored me, believing that these things only happen to other people. But I suppose the upside is that if the house burns down, at least there isn't anybody in it.    Friendship is the basis for a great many women's novels but obviously that's not what the author of this article cares about. And if he's looking for something more literary, there was last year's Friendship by Emily Gould.   The "things that don't need to be kosher for Pesach in the first place" is my favorite part. (Page 102)   Half a dozen, if not twice that. I couldn't put an exact number on it.    I hate that nobody seems to know what's going on. There doesn't seem to be any training regarding the library's features. Interlibrary loan? Only one person knows about it and she's not here right now. The fact that it says my digital loan hold is going to expire tomorrow despite the fact that I only placed it today? Can't explain it.  I also hate that shelf reading isn't done regularly and books that the catalogue says are there aren't really there.   I was considering visiting Denver this year (it didn't work out) but the first thing I did to plan for the trip was Google kosher food. Maybe I'll get there next year.   but they fucked up on checking in my books three times in a row.  How? My library has a book slot but after they managed to lose one of the books I tossed in there, I stopped using it. And after they once didn't acknowledge the fact that I paid a fine on a late item, I always made sure to get a receipt for proof. So one time something going wrong I can see, but three times?   What about this place?  http://brooklynpizzadenver.com/   Library all the way. You have absolutely no need to feel guilty about getting books for free (by which I mean, paid for by your tax dollars).    Thanks! I Googled it and interestingly, van Gogh did a bunch of paintings and sketches of this type of tree!

Maybe they look better with leaves.      Only books that rely on cheap twist and turns matter if they're spoiled or not.       Chocolate chips that are edible for people, irresistible but fatal to bugs.   Not whispering, but they recently did a study where they paired cigarettes with a bad smell while people were sleeping and it did help them cut back on smoking, while pairing a bad smell with smoking while people were awake had no impact.  https://www.sciencenews.org/article/foul-smells-during-sleep-may-help-smokers-quit   Yes, you're right I ignored some parts of your post and I don't find your saying so abrasive, it's just that I'm caught up with this same thing with someone who's in the place of your coworker and it's so hard to have to basically just stand around and watch them suffer because of a bad decision they made 20 years ago and have been compounding ever since.   I don't know what your circumstances are or what your goals are, but your coworker is 100% correct that it's easier to go back to school when you're younger than when you're older, and if you wait to until you "know what you want to do," you might be waiting until you're dead because not everybody figures out what they want. Besides, going to college can help you figure out what you want because there's a variety of classes you wouldn't have an opportunity to take otherwise and professors and advisers that you wouldn't be able to interact with otherwise.      Unless you are talking about a specific person, how can you possibly give a more specific answer?    Not all US states have Powerball, so I'm genuinely surprised that Puerto Rico does (and apparently so do the US Virgin Islands!). That said, those idiots on Twitter are just that: Ignorant idiots.   In the olden days idiots didn't have a worldwide platform to air their nonsense so the only people who knew they existed were their friends and relatives. Now that they can tweet to everyone, and reporters seem to think that looking on Twitter constitutes "news gathering," you're hearing these idiots' voices more and more.   Where have you ever seen predictions a month in advance? Most sites give 10 days out. The monthly "forecasts" are just averages for those dates.   Either they're lazy, they're jerks, they didn't grow up with these habits so they're not accustomed to them, or they're genuinely forgetful.   The grey and white one in the middle third from the front.   But they have to make a point not to keep it fully.       It's forbidden for non-Jews to keep Shabbos. It doesn't matter how sincere they are about it, it's not allowed and presumably they would be punished for it.    Let's see. She has no sense of humor. She's some kind of sexist/homophobe. She doesn't know how to have an adult conversation. She tries to make you think that you're doing something wrong by being yourself.  Someone's being an asshole here, but it's not you, OP. Dump her. You are never going to be right, ever, and eventually this is going to turn toxic.      This isn't as comprehensive as IMDB, but it can be useful.  https://www.commonsensemedia.org/book-reviews   The definition of "musician" is:  a person who writes, sings, or plays music   I guess you missed the two sentences before the one you quoted.  They found the widest gap in entitlement, suggesting that men are more likely than women to exploit others and feel entitled to certain privileges.  The second largest difference was in leadership/authority. "Compared with women, men exhibit more assertiveness and desire for power," Grijalva says.

So either he's a Gary Stu or he's an exaggerating bragger with no sense of perspective. Not seeing that one is better than the other.   Thanks.  	117
 I was once a winner on Whose Line is it Anyway."   "I can whistle through my nose. You wanna see?"   Typical PC life span for mid to low end models is 1-3 years. All Macs are expected to perform well for 5 or more years.    other PCs have the same technical specs and reviews but at half the price.  If you want to take specs on paper and say well, these computers both have 2.0 Ghz with 2Gigs of ram and 200GB of data storage, then yes, you'd be right. But these aren't defining factors of how well a computer performs, especially when two different computers use two different operating systems.  Apple's operating system, upon being user friendly, having tons of productivity enhancing features, as well as multiple desktops which somehow still evades windows programmers, gets away with being able to accomplish the same things based on low-powered low-bloat open-source code. When you run windows on a Mac, you start to notice that the battery life drops since windows does require more power to run more often than not.  Having better specs on paper never guarantees better performance. When you look at the world of mobile phones, android phones just fucking *love* to tout that they have more Ghz or ram or cores than Apple's latest iPhone. But, you notice they still have basic issues such as scrolling not being quite as smooth as it looks in commercials, or their massive megapixel cameras not looking better by any margin than any other camera with 1 or 2 less megapixels.  Get reviews from power users, people who go on forums and debate these. Those are much more valuable than a user review left 2 days after they got it. When you're using a computer for just email and facebook, suddenly, any $300 crapper is going to be just what the doctor ordered and warrent a good review from the first two days.  But wait until there's issues with the computer. This is where Apple stands out. If you experience issues early on, it's confusing on who to go to for support. Best buy? Dell? Some different computer service? Microsoft? What if Dell and Best Buy say "It's a software problem, go to Microsoft", but Microsoft tries to pin it on Best Buy or Dell?  Apple is Apple is Apple. The computer, both hardware and software, came from one company, and THAT'S the company you go to. (Note: Yes, the hardware comes from multiple companies like intel or amd or nvidia, but Apple has sold the hardware to you and takes responsibility for the defects you may experience early on.) If it's under warrentee, Apple will be perfectly happy to fix the problem for you, or find a solution should the problem be a bit more of hassle than anticipated. Hell, they were even so nice to flat-out replace my iPhone 5s when it had an abundance of cracks and a bend that prevented it from working. (Another note, that's from my own stupidity and mishandling. Take care of your items, you should never have to deal with cracks.)   I'd be jumping at that if I had $600.   Most likely any special effects app with great use of keying and masking.   The collisions for Melee battlefield will match Brawl's battlefield. They likely made the stage themselves.   I actually hate how unbearable iTune's UI has become. I really would prefer that they simply stop trying to change the experience and just give us that ducking sidebar and simple lists and artwork that only showed in a corner while a song was playing or when using cover flow.   "What flavor is this?"  "I forget. It's supposed to taste like a painting by Colin Mochrie."   "Have you tried our new kitty kitty bang bang flavor?"

I think you missed [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/ScenesFromAHat/comments/30f04k/worst_april_fools_gags/cprsvea). I didn't see it in there.   Oh my god. I made it in the "Best Of" hall of fame. I've been hoping to get here, and it's finally happened.   "We're totally letting the FCC lose those net neutrality lawsuits Mr. Obama."   It makes sense. People know how to walk out the store with their phones without getting caught. Would you want people tempted to do that with watches that get up to 17,000 dollars?   I'm hoping they patch Hero mode or Master Quest into MM3D.   Massive erection.   "You didn't get to heaven but you made it close  "You didn't get to heaven but you made it close."

For anyone trying to read the title and figure it out, it says:   FCC Chairman said that Net Neutrality is necessary because without it, Internet providers will continue their quest for ultimate power.   "Hey look ma, the Drew Carey Show."   Oh, by far, the plot has its ups and downs just like any other show. MLP included. But the ups far outweigh the downs. I encourage you to continue on with it. I binge twice a week on average, and normally about 10 videos per session. Mostly because the end of each episode makes me hunger to know what happens next.   "Ever wonder how gross it really is that what we're really doing is putting my genitals in your genitals?"   I've been using this Hiatus to go through the first 4 seasons of Once Upon A Time.

Goddamn, I still want to get a 2nd one.   Please let this be a hoax. Everyone already thinks Nintendo is doing nothing but remakes.   It's amazing what some people consider super hype. This was on its moments near the end, but some part dragged for me. There was great back and forth on most matches, and hardly did a game end with the winner having more than 1 stock. But as it is, it's a bit over-hyped.  I did love the Pikachu up-B shinanigans. Reminded me so much of Axe.   *gunshot sound*  "April fools Nate!... Nate?"   *Making come here motion* "Come."   "Goooood evening everyone! Welcome to the special electronic version of Whose Line is it Anyway!"   "Is this the club that burns people who wear capes?"   Hello and for the next 14 pages you're going to read just me writing he ho he ha ho ha ho he ha ho he he ho ho he ho he ho ha.   Is... Is everyone at Nintendo in there 50s and 60s?

To help your potential deal making, why don't you pick out some of the more notable cards and get a pic?   Oh my god. I look like Colin Mochrie   They really are desperate to keep their tyrannic choke hold on the necks and wallets of consumers. Seriously, saying "we can't change the new rules, so let's try to make sure nobody can enforce them" is basically saying "We know we're doing shit they wouldn't like and that consumers don't like, but we're hoping we can keep them stupid until we're retired with lots of their money in our pockets."  Fuck you Pai. Fuck you internet providers. Fuck everyone involved in letting the internet situation get as bad as it did. For fuck's sake, don't tell  us this bullshit how you need more money and tax cuts and that you can't innovate unless you're a fucking monopoly. There are service providers in other countries half as old as you are offering fiber speeds for dirt cheap compared to here and they're all doing just fine. And once the rest of America figures that out, they're gonna rip you a fucking new one.   "I'm not afraid of a machine gun. Are you kidding me?"   We are America, and so is Canada, but only we are considered American!   "I'm technically disease free"   So basically, the ISPs are mad that they have to follow rules now. They've basically been dodging monopoly lawsuits by 'competing' in only about 5% of existing US territory and failing to expand into any other territory where another ISP exists because the other ISP wouldn't let them use the same infrastructure.  The Internet providers are sueing for the privilege to charge content creators to get their data to us faster. They basically want to double dip american pockets and be allowed to offer us speeds lower than the maximum they're capable of. They really don't get the point. The point of the new rules is that anybody can use any equipment that is already built up so you can move in and compete with anybody else's service. It also states that you cannot offer priority to any content creators or double dip into america's pockets.   "Introducing Richard's Dick puffs! How many can fit in *your* mouth?"   "Colin Os. No hair in your cereal, guaranteed."   Bring on the fox players saying, "But it's not how melee did it."   This is pretty pathetic. The only reason it even changed is because of the outlier, Google Fiber. ISPs are still gouging our fucking eyes out just so we can download at 1/20th of the speed they're capable of offering (which wouldn't cost them any extra to let us have).      Self posts don't affect karma. Why the fuck would I be doing this for Karma?   Well shit, I missed when this started. Fuck me. I really wanted to enter.   "Are you a cougar?

"FEED THE HUNGRY" *rip* "FEED THE HUNGRY" *crunch* "FEED THE HUNNREE" *crunch*   "I should poop in the shower."   This is very accurate. Can confirm, am OP.   I think that offer is pretty fair considering the content of the collection.

"GREAT, EVERYONE OUT OF THE CAR NOW"  *family and driver escape with the child*  *car explodes*   "It's me, Fabiano de Latino! With the powers to shoot taco shells out my ass, I FLY!"

"Msr. Johnson, I'd like you to meet my girlfriend Mrs. Johnson."   You're not helping. You helped him make his account? So you know him in real life? Mods tread carefully around those who know each other in real life or claim to know each other as scammers have used duplicate accounts to try to vouch for themselves so that they can ruse others into unfair trades without getting their main account banned. This even goes for me and /u/lily247, which is why we both have verification that we're two separate people (on our feedback threads).  Please do not try to get involved in moderator affairs unless you have been asked to provide assistance.   I hope you're not useing the "average" or "highest' values, and that you're checking links to verify that Yugioh Prices wasn't making any errors. This is very much recommended. There is no way everything you have presented in the binder totals to more than $20 dollars. I have checked myself, I even have many of the same cards. They're all worth around $0.50. People don't buy for average price.   For the apps that aren't important or too frequently used, I do this. I leave Safari and Messages open. Sometimes even Vine. But things like the Guitar tuner, Whisper, Maps, I close those right when I leave the app until I'll need it again.   Please do not go through with this trade. This user has been reported to be fake and/or a scammer.   If you are not able to send immediately/next day, you should not be posting.   I hate to brake it to you, but the total price of the core is actually about $15. The entire binder combined has a value of about $25. You're really asking for too much. This drastic over-pricing will not be tolerated. You have a few hours to revise this listing. If it is not revised it will be removed, and your profile will be banned from all Yugioh subreddits.   Screen capture software? They probably have access to the videos, they edit them and export them optimized for vine, and they use something like vineclient.   I hope it will eventually be for sale for those who couldn't afford both versions.   "Hi, my name is Colin Mochrie, and I'm making this online profile to meet girls."   "Can't wait to eat my, OH MY GOD, A LIGHTSABER!"   "Oh my god, Joan Rivers? It's so nice to... wait, nevermind. Maybe it's not that nice."   Set it to a resolution that has its height at 480 pixels. And if you can, play it in windowed mode, and only capture the window. In premiere, you'll be able to make a sequence with custom setting so the height and width is 480 pixels. Se the pixel aspect ratio to 1.0 so the true aspect ratio of the video is 1:1.  [This is what I'm using](http://i.imgur.com/e5sm7Ys.png). Preference options may vary depending on the version of premiere. I'm using CS4.   I'm actually very surprised about Skill Drain getting such a deep hit on the banlist. And, on behalf of my friend John, I'm saddened that the Dragon Rulers are really gone. He's been playing them since he could afford them. awe well, time for him to run Red-Eye Black Dragon. He's actually been trying to make a good Red-eyes Black Dragon deck for a while. That new support kind of makes up for it.   Vine doesn't support 60 FPS. You're probably just seeing a video that was shot and exported without frames blending together.   Don't capture in such a huge resolution. try recording originally at about 720x480. I know it sounds stupid, "Why wouldn't I record in HD". Trust me, the bigger you record, the more information you lose when downscaling which means the computer has to decide what to throw out, and it's not always a good decision.  And you're probably not seeing bad quality video. It's probably pretty damn good, but you're viewing it in a stretched resolution on your computer screen. Make sure you're viewing it at the original resolution.  Not to mention, I would never recommend Vegas Pro. I'd recommend Premiere if you can get your hands on it.  Check your pixel aspect ratio, make sure it's 1.0.   "I'm in position under your desk Mr. Carey."   Oh god, I hope not. I swear, these trolls need a hobby.

Hi, Billy Mays here for Erectile disfunction. If you're one of the millions not satisfied with your cock not going up, call me, Billy Mays, because I can get you really hard instantly without any tools.   Feel free to discuss things about the ban list. This can be what you want, what you think will happen, or joking about changes. This thread is to cut down on the amount of threads asking about the ban list.  **When will the ban list be out?**  Konami has not promised a reliable date for the ban list to be announced. For all we know, they're still playtesting to construct the new meta for April. There is no way of knowing exactly when it will be announced.  **Should I edit my deck when it comes out or wait until April 1st?**  That answer is up to you. Some players choose to edit as soon as possible to try to beat price spikes from cards that find a good fit in the new meta.  **Will [insert tournament here] be using the old or new banlist?**  This depends on a few factors. Who is holding it? When is it? Large sanctioned tournaments will always use the ban list that is in effect at that time, not the newest announced banlist. Some locals enforce new ban lists early, but this entire depends on who is making the decisions.  **Will [x card] be hit/nerfed/unbanned?**  We don't know  **What will be the top deck afterward?**  We don't know  **What cards should I get beforehand?**  We don't know. Hold off on purchases that try to predict the ban list.   For general purposes, there never is a reliable date for the new ban list. It comes out when it comes out.   This is like saying cameras are free for shoplifters.   "Let's do the Whose Line Appreciation Day Hoedown!"   Because Beats is just a branded equalizer setting. It's actually nothing special about the hardware that makes it sound any better. It's really the same tech you get with any other headphones of the same style.   Starlight_Flux gets moon being ecliplsed. Not only would that be cool, but it seems fitting for fluctuations of the light in the night sky.   So, instead of building a new browser which would conform to the latest standards and strain for a high quality web browsing experience on par with Safari, Chrome, or Firefox, they're just going to rebrand it? And then still keep IE for some windows users? That's absurd. They should just kill it off and put a new browser on with a simple name. Perhaps *Super Highway*. I think that'd be a cool name for something that's supposed to access the information super highway.  But this really doesn't make me happy. Microsoft is too stubborn to just let Internet Explorer go because they have to have "compatibility". Internet Explorer already needed to jump through hoops to be compatible with the evolving and standardized web that it couldn't exactly keep up with.   Link to it is in the header.   If you're asking that big of a deal, then it's better you put it on eBay and link to it through our eBay thread.   Do you have an absolute lowest you'll go for the deck?   "Please don't jump. It costs us a lot in maintenance and clean-up."   "We are the Drew Careys, and we're gonna sing you a song!"   "Welcome everyone, we're Begging For Black Eyes, and we're gonna..." *The rest of the cast comes and beats up the player*   "Hey, Hades, how's it been?"  "Well, I got pounded by a geek with muscles. What about your maleficent?"  "I'm here in the underworld, take a guess at how well it went."   "To talk to a customer press 1."  "I'm sorry, I did not detect a button press. to talk to a customer, press 1."   "Mom, what does Pussy Pink mean?"   Wow. I love how everyone assumes I'm ignorant and start talking about how it's a market thing and not a technology thing. You alone aren't going to change the market. Nobody right now actually needs a battery that will last for 7 days without a charge. I doubt anybody's awake using their device for 7 days so that they couldn't plug it in when they're asleep. I can understand wanting an all-day battery life, but 7 days is pretty ridiculous.  The new macbook already has a logic board half the size of most laptops and uses the extra space for battery life. And they're trying to keep it thin and portable to be comfortable to carry and use. So if you want shit's battery to last longer, tell the corporations directly. Tell the engineer's. Don't tell reddit. Reddit can't do shit.   I seriously doubt it. Apple may be about standards but they still are about protection. And I don't want just anybody using just any low-watt or high-watt USB-C cable they find lying around and potentially ruining their phone's battery by using a mismatched charger.  What I do expect is, not too soon, that lightning's other end will be USB-C.   If you're running Dragon Rulers, you'd probably run Mythic Tree Dragon and Mythic Water Dragon. They can be searched with Tidal and Redox unlike Red-eyes which is a DARK and cannot be searched with any Dragon Ruler.  Mythic Tree and Water dragon synergize well with Tidal and Redox through their effect of special summoning and changing levels and even give the deck rank 8 options. Red-eyes does not. It's a normal monster that must be Normal (trubute) summoned (2 tributes) or SSed through a different card's effect, basically taking up deck room just to be able to SS Red-eyes.  And *my point* wasn't that the vanilla 2500 level 4 beater would obselete Red-eyes specifically 100% of the time. Of fucking course attribute and type play a factor. I was making an example. In decks that actually regularly use normal monsters, a 2500 beater at no tributes trumps just about any other option, especially options you need to tribute for that have fewer atk/def. By after a big play, who wouldn't want to just slap down a fucking 2500 beater for free no matter what type or attribute?   You should submit that idea to Apple and/or third party manufactures. If you could get someone to make that, Apple would likely have more people buying the new Macbook, and the manufacturer who makes it would be getting some happy business as well.   Okay, this guy has a good point, but it's not the point Apple sees in this device.  The new Macbook isn't designed for people who need a lot of ports. The new Macbook is designed for the most basic of users. It's designed for the grandmas and parents who *don't* have or use flashdrives to move things around. It's designed for people who *don't* use their computers for mass productivity. It's *not* for people who use more than just internet to check their daily feed every day. Macbook Air used to be the same way. The place I think they fucked up is the price point. It has less power than the Macbook air (I don't mean it's underpowered, it's not underpowered for its purpose), has fewer ports, isn't as portable, and they want $300 more for it.  Peoeple, shut the fuck up and stop complaining uselessly on the internet. If you really want one but don't think you'd be able to use it, FUCKING TELL APPLE. In case you haven't noticed, just about none of us can do anything about your bitch-ass boo-hoos over having only 1 port.  Apple's introducing a new product that's aimed to pave the way to get users to use fewer wires (be more confident and reliant on iCloud keeping files consistent across their devices), fewer discs, and it's pushing for new standards. It's an early product that *YOU DON'T NEED TO FUCKING BUY*. Early adopters will likely find many problems that the press will go fucking nuts over and trying to claim that Apple made a shit product based on the first batch. But that's what happens. You remember the retina Macbook Pros? They were extremely costly, sacrificed features for thinness and battery life, and had logic board problems when they first started rolling. Apple started ironing out those issues, and those who can actually use one and still be as fully productive as they were before are the ones getting it. The ones who need a thousand more ports just to be productive aren't the ones getting rMBPs and they're not going to be the ones getting the new Macbook.   When you make a battery that can do that, then be my guest and get it into these machines.  ... Oh that's right.   I love your story. It's inspiring. Although, it could do without the "still out there" ending cliche. Just a thought. But, it's your story, and you tell it how you want it to be told.   "Haven't you people ever heard of   Closing the goddamn door?"   I kind of feel this way too. Plus, I think USB-C just looks cooler than other USB devices. And it would bring USB ports to 2.0 or later right? No more getting USB 1.0 ports on a comp that you thought had USB 2.0 ports. (Yeah, It's happened to me a bit.)  	128
 I've been freelancing for a number of years and I've found that it's a sales job mostly. By that I mean it is a numbers game.  The more people you offer your services to the better chance you have of picking up new clients. Half of my day consists of networking, giving presentations, free work for charities etc. Everything I can to sell my services.   Price isn't an issue once I sell someone on the work I can do, though I don't sell anything based on price. I've found the clients that are extremely price conscious only care about that one thing, which results in the product and my sanity suffering.   Whoa I didn't know that, this does sound cool!      I went from a 27" desktop to a 13" retina MacBook and I haven't used the desktop since. I never thought the pixel dense smaller screen would be as capable as it has been. I even sold my cintiq and only use an intros now so I can work anywhere. Best thing I ever did.       If you are developing a marketing plan I'd love if you shared. It sounds like you've got a lot of experience. I've never had to do this sort of marketing so it would be interesting to read.   Maybe, depends on how you present it.

A [texture mod](http://static-6.nexusmods.com/15/mods/110/images/2356-1-1329757130.jpg) would therefore be a modified texture in the game.

 Potion sellah i'm going into battle and i want only your strongest potions.   That's probably information i should add, well anything between 20 - 30 per person for a full course, no preference really on cuisine.   Somewhere that has some good food and a nice calm atmosphere would be perfect any suggestions? Maybe a place to go out for a drink afterwards too.  Edit: Lots of suggestions guys i'll have to have a good look at all of them thank you to all of you! :-)   Yeah but if this happens the drop rates would probably go down even more, and we don't want that now do we, Rotomaniac?   Ah thanks, i thought so, would be nice if it did change the appearance.   Okay so i equipped my new sight through the modify menu but when i get in game my M1G has the original iron sight still attached? Are the sights just for stats or do they actually change?   I thought he meant the camera was in the clock, and the dad found out by seeing it was dirty taking it down and cleaning it, only to notice a camera in there, i watch too many movies...   My school had a bomb threat, one of the students phoned up and said they have placed a bomb somewhere in the school, everyone was evacuated onto the yard (Which was about 50 feet from the buildings, what good that would do) the police were then called and they had the canine unit searching the school for the bomb, they found nothing everything was fine i think they found the student and removed him from the school this was in the UK, all in all i didn't mind, i missed all my classes that day, thank you bomb kid... you're the bomb.  Found a link here if anyone is interested, i don't go to the school anymore. http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/teenager-charged-over-broadgreen-international-3352147   Yeah I sent mine straight away as soon as I found out who my match was guess I'm just a little impatient and excited to see what I get!   I still haven't gotten anything :-( looks like tixx skipped my house this year.   Where did you get this information that they will cost 400 gems a piece?    TittyAttack.com ...   I feel like this system could be easily abused, what if there was multiple scouts on one map by multiple i mean like 30, what if some player just likes making random markers at places for no actual reason, it is a tough issue to solve.  I was thinking something like the commander tag, but for scouts, the tag allows their text in map chat to show up in a different colour to the others, a scout tag, it would also allow people to see which towers have scouts, due to it showing up on the map much like the commander tag, not sure of the pricing of this tag tho, maybe 100g like the old commander tag?   Damn, I'm making those Oreo truffles later, thanks Kevin! (Who knew Asura were such good cooks) Amazing job guys!   I feel the elementals would be alot better if they were made permanently summoned until death then they go on cd, much like necros felsh golem, it would be sooooo much better, this along with the lesser elementals too.   You're right it doesn't feel like you're a plague cloud, probably the best way to do this would be to make the cloud much larger, the actual size of the aoe area, although this would make you a much larger target, it would still be very cool and feel alot more like an elite through a simple cosmetic change.   turns out it's a Sovereign - Victoria, Old Head and not a 5 hahah makes it alot easier for me to research now, thank you for your input really helped narrow my search i'm not good with coins.   Hey guys so my SO's parents have a bunch of these http://m.imgur.com/a/QyGJ2 I was just wondering if you guys could give me some info on how much they're worth today and who or where I should sell them to get the best price thank you! (If this is the wrong subreddit for this type of post please direct me).   Yeah I always check things for myself would never ignore something simply because it was down voted and thank you I didn't mean to accuse you of accusing me hahah.   Ah yeah I would never do that without first checking the link.   Don't have to worry about dungeons all classes are viable, while some may be better than others when it comes to damage or utility, you can be useful as any class if played right, so play what you enjoy, I had the same problem as you, I forced myself to level to 80 even though I was bored, can't say it wasn't worth it once I hit 80.   Thank you!  	22
 Yeah, I've already tried this. When I unsync the albums of my computer with the phone, the problem is not solved... Those damn albums stay there...   So everytime I import my images to my computer, these albums (the ones with the dates on its names) appear in my iPhone. I really need to remove them, for they are starting to make huge space in my HD. How do I do it? When I am on those albums in my iPhone, there is no erase button, but I can visualize the images.  iPhone 4s, sorry for bad english       For those who love Spirited Away as I do, what is the meaning of this title? What does it mean being spirited away?   Really dont know how the arrow got so stuck in my head... It stayed there for a long time lol   Then I got an arrow in the skull...      Actually no... just the good old default Skyrim        	10

 Happened to me in Witcher on console. I was kind of surprised because that hasn't happened to me in years.   FTFY: Moleman Arkham Knight   it just so happens that it has a separate bone there   Ay^y^^y^^^y^^^^y^^^^^y   Not with that attitude.   ruin the game   That ship set sail a while ago.   nbsp;  Edit: Downvote away, the truth hurts bitches!!   You played one mission yet you completed a 6th of the story unknowingly, I think that says it all.   Don't forget Bungies pockets are being lined with sweet cash as well. Don't think for a minute that Bungie doesn't know exactly what they are doing, they're not retarded.   It's not a game, it's a business model.   I think I got cancer in my eyes, can someone blow on them??   Because the fundraiser wasn't successful at raising enough money to save the clock tower. It's scheduled for demolition.    Let them, hopefully they go bankrupt in the near future due to their poor decision making.   Not only that, a lot of people buy gameboys just to play Pokemon games. If they make it a console game they would lose out on so many gameboy sales.       Aw man I missed the draw!! Congrats!! enjoy da moniez.  Edit: **Apparently you are unable to receive money through paypal** ...Just thought I'd make you aware!   Well hey there buddy, any chance of getting one of dem dere recommendations for the preview program??   I've wanted 4 day weeks and 3 day weekend since I was about 13. Life is to love not to work. I really wish there was some way we could change it but it's delusional.    I'm guessing he's released another apology because Watchmojo made a list of top 10 reasons to hate Kanye a few days ago.   **AGAIN!**   Anywhere in Colorado. Mainly because I want to visit america, secondly legalization, thirdly Southpark.   I don't know a vegetarian, life is good.   I was re-watching the latest Top Gear season last night. It was the episode where they go to Australia and have to herd some cattle using their cars. The farm they were on was ***3.2million acres***. My "country" is 2.5 square miles (circa 1600 acres). You can fit my entire country 2000 times into that one single farm.   Australia is fucking massive.   Many places in the world. My local police force only carry batons. We do have armed officers at the airport, but that's it.   They could just make more.. (I don't want one or anything, just saying)   This demonstration is a few years old, just saying. Don't be fooled by the upload date on youtube.   I came here to assure myself I wasn't the only one. Thanks!   Motherfucker stole my moves!   Serioulsy how do you guys take pictures of random people?? I can't bring myself to do it, I feel like an idiot when I do.   The day someone actually makes a fully functional one of these things I'll be impressed, till then please don't waste our time and crush our hopes.   **NSFW**   Those are the ones that are available right now for preview members. More will be added in the very near future once Xbox can strike a deal with developers. Aslong as developers say yes we should be seeing fully capabale backwards compatibility with all games in the very near future. But before any of this happens we need Windows 10 on Xbox. So we're still a few months away.   You're looking at the wrong list buddy. The list you're referring to [Rare Replay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rare_Replay). An Xbox one game which brings 30 classics back to life.    Backwards compatibility will hopefully allow you to play any 360 game you own, natively on your Xbox one (provided that developers give Xbox their permission to use old games for free on the new system).   It made me buy a charger for my long forgotten Ipad.   I did them all...don't. Found maybe 1 sword I've kept, all the rest is lying at the bottom of the ocean floor beside the chests. Still it's nice to see you're map completely greyed out.   Picture of frisbee please OP.   That was better than I expected, they seem to have a really cool bro/sis relationship.   Ayyyy!   This, but let's make it another school just to be safe.   No he means like the French flag.   Next stop, The Pitchfork Emporium. CHOO CHOO!    I tried getting online yesterday, still not working.   That's a really cool way of putting it. I tired my hand at it once with a deck of cards. After a week I was still dropping cards everywhere, that was pretty much all the commitment I could muster.    17 hour work days?? *Poor* people.   I've read a bit into this before. Answer is as simple as practice makes perfect. In this case it is a tonne of practice, way more than I can even imagine to have the patience for.     Can I jump on your magical gold train??   [MRW](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/mind_blown.gif) I read that.      You're a serial killer too?? What are the chances! We should totally live together.   Willikers you're right!...Gosh darn it, can't believe I didn't know that.   Do you want to be haunted by a ghost phone?   Cause that's how you get haunted by a ghost phone.   I think it's too late for that.      I had to get one 2 months after getting the console, it really is worth it.   The graphics are gorgeous. Just goes to show you don't need hyper realistic graphics to have a really good looking game.   God damn it, Now I'm going to have to stop by McD. I'm hungryy.   Fuck that, guests in my house is why I need my own controller.   Really? Xbox controllers are always built extremely well. A lot more durable than Sony as the evidence shows.   How many times is this joke going to be made?? I think this is the third time I've seen it near the front of /r/gaming. We know Yenns a whore ha, ha.   **SOME CONTENT WOULD BE FUCKING AWESOME, THANKS!**   ^^^not ^^^all ^^^of ^^^us ^^^where ^^^able ^^^to ^^^watch ^^^E3   No exact date yet, it will be in Fall though [gaming season]. My guess is somewhere near the beginning of Fall so you can ready yourself for the plethora of new games which are going to be released.   I'm guessing it will be possible once we get the new OS.   I can only begin to imagine the barrage of request you must've gotten, good luck and thanks for doing this!!   I never made such a claim.    Found the guy who pulls things out his ass.   Yeah, and now we can blame trickle down economics for it.   Found the rich stock broker.   Edit: it's a joke, calm down people.   I'm so glad I never got into it. Sorry for your wasted time.   I bought Monopoly and Risk on Xbox this past weekend. Amazing games to play with some friends. Only down side is no physical dice. If Hasbro could make some sort of mat and dice combination that would be awesome. Anyone want to start a kick-starter with me?   Baby girl's a Queen,    But a Queen is just a pawn with a bunch of fancy moves.   My gamer tag is ...    Please don't send me any more friend request haha   What were you expecting? lol.   ..and that's when mods become DLC.   Sounds like was destiny ~~is trying~~ failed to do.      I came here to poke you guys with the proverbial stick and complain about how such an advanced piece of technology is being used on a build a block game. Then I saw the video, that's actually pretty impressive. Still don't see much use for it with real gaming but yea still pretty fucking awesome.   I never like these videos. They claim it's fast but never actually show it being fast. Whenever they are going through the UI they move once every few seconds. That's not how you're going to be using it. They did the same last time.   It's been happening for years, won't make a difference.   All I can think about is the amount of sick days I'm going to have to take later on this year.   This controller looks insane, seriously can't wait to get my hands on one. Great stuff this year!   Seriously what the hell do you guys do yo your controllers? I have 4 all working fine including the one that came with the xbox. No drift or anything. Do you perhaps leave them upside down from time to time?   They already make a solid controller for 49.99. So by that maths the new controller will be 3 times as solid.   On behalf of everyone in this sub: Thank you /u/MajorNelson and the Xbox team for what looks to be like an amazing year of gaming to come. Great stuff!   You're willing to give your only inch up?? Brave man.   That's amazing news!!   Thanks for the quick reply.   Awesome stuff, but what about physical copies?? All of my 360 games are discs.   "So where are we going today Snaps?"   "Not sure RC, wherever the current take us"   *banjo rift*   Took me a while to realise there were more pictures, it's a very slow sunday.   It looks like something straight out of MTV Cribs.   mother put the wrong date    You keep telling your sister that.   So do I, but with a gif you know you don't need to listen.   [MRW opening the album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr8-WiJabBc)   Gifs = no sound, so I know I can enjoy it at work.   I agree the UI needs changing but that isn't the way to go about it. On console it would take you forever to get to your current gear as each tab take a second or 2 to load.   The best method would be drop down lists like they have on the bestiary, alchemy tabs etc. This way you can select the category you need without having to load everything else up on the way. It will give much easier access to your current equipment as you would only need to flick right once and you can add many categories without it looking like a cluster fuck.    They were so close, yet so far. They had the idea just didn't implement it where needed.   Any ways that's my 2 cents.   Yeah I found out yesterday. As well COD zombies [the only reason I will be buying COD] will only be 2 player split screen. The 2 games I love to play coach co-op on with 4 players have been stripped away from me in one year. Assholes.   **LEGO GAMES** enough said!   Welp I know what I'm buying next. Love these lego games!    I just don't understand this credit thing tbh. Where I live you use what you have in the present, not use what you will have in the future. Credit cards are just weird to me and I don't understand why someone will willingly get a credit card knowing you will end up paying more for your purchases.   Why give mods so much gold? Don't the like have it for free anyway?   I need one of these for my house....then I need my friends to actually use it.   One of my mates fainted   Bravo, bravo. The icing on the cake. Girls screaming and this kids faints.   Sooooo where the girl in this story?   Throw the Jew down the well   ^^^Throw ^^^the ^^^Jew ^^^down ^^^the ^^^well   So my country can be free   ^^^So ^^^my ^^^country ^^^can ^^^be ^^^free   I know but it's worse if I don't provide a source, especially on Reddit.   Worst part is he wasn't even concious to enjoy the BJ, nightmare!      Fair enough, can't knock a guy down for hoping!   I would save every single time before diving into the water. Even with the Killer Whale potion it can all go horribly wrong extremely quickly.   *lowers pitchfork*   I hope you're right..   TBH I hope I'm wrong and you're right. I'm just finding very difficult to trust EA lately.   Not the same thing really. That was giving you extra in-game money, this is giving you exclusive weapons that deal more damage. You could make 1,000,000 in GTA in a couple of hours, you will never use these weapons unless you get the pre-order bonus. It will kill the pvp especially since it's at launch, a few players will have better gear form the start because of this bullshit.      The fact that people who pre-order will be getting weapons and equipment that deal extra damage on online matches. That's my problem, unbalanced pvp matches.   This is exactly the reason I posted this. I don't mind skins etc as DLC but when you're paying for better weapons it kills the online gaming experience.         This is just getting out of hand, and making jokes about it isn't going to help the situation. I'm not from America but it pains me to see that the "leading" country on this planet can't even get it's own police force under control. You're out waging war with half the world when you have fundamental problems in your own country that just get passed by and swept under the rug. Go to the streets get your voices heard, enough is enough.  	111
 I saw Cage in concert a little while ago when they played that! Great preformance!   Dude this is dope. I love adding some good car tunes to my playlist.  	2
 murder a baby  You mean zygote, blastocyst, embryo or foetus?  Baby would be intellectually dishonest surely.   Finished it two days ago, loved it! Definitely my favourite on the PS4 so far.  Just starting the 'Last Survivor - Ellen Ripley' add-on now, so atmospheric wandering around the 'set' of Alien and hearing Lambert scream at the start - chilling.  Not sure I've the nerve or stamina to try for the platinum.   It's not really NSFW, but I didn't want any chance the thumbnail would ruin the surprise.      This is handy!  Have they always been happening, haven't noticed a post like this before?   A fairly astonishing one considering the subject matter   Do you still think the UK and Ireland are the same thing?   here are some Irish sites  First up, blogs.telegraph.co.**uk**  tell me more about 'how i know nothing about Ireland'  I just have, but here are some more, children in Ireland are not taught anti-semetic or anti-Israel anything in any official sense.  That some schools take their own view, bear in mind your examples are based in very religious areas of Ireland, isn't right but then we don't check out schools every day with every teacher and I doubt any country does.  Though in my schooling, the very same system, we were given a very positive view of Israel and Israelis.  I still have a fantastic series of jewish artwork on my walls reprinted from a very old jewish calendar. My brother spent considerable time in kibbutz and is still in contact with people he met there.  I still can't believe you think a .uk is an Irish site, are you trolling yourself?  With regard to your sources, there are practically all blogs and opinion pieces.   Didn't think this was still a thing, except on inviable routes.  All the coaches I see around are private hires.   Probably since the bank guarantee, increasing unemployment   emmigration, increased taxes   levies but reduced services   provisions, the medical card fiascoes, tax-dodgers as TDs, debt-defaulters as Health Ministers, Garda corruption, cash for leniency in the courts, RT as government mouthpiece, a government with more strokes than horsepower, Savita, Irish Water, Migrant X, 300m discounts to Denis O'Brien, the Sherblock, Teacher - Pupil ratios, JobBridge, Paper Tiger Inquiries, TIME magazine covers, Patrick Neary, NYSE DO'B, pay-caps as lip service, Eamonn Gilmore, AIB, BOI, negative equity, Brian Purcell, unemployable yet unsackable civil servants, failure to employ thousands of laid-off construction workers in essential infrastructure projects, spin not substance, The World Cup with John Delaney, the Dil as it was as is it   always will be ...  So what piqued you enough to comment so briefly?       I'm still worried that the vote will be rigged.      Looks like Morgan Le Fey is letting him have this one.   Cheetah, kthxbai   Nah, I'll give the attractiveness to the dude.  On the flipside, the dude incurs the risk of 'did I ever tell you about the Cheetah' re-runs, and so creating the potential for widescale Kif-quakes in his well quiffed presence.  On 2nd t, you're probably right      Give [Rune Audio](http://www.runeaudio.com/) a try, it willl turn the pi into a network (SMB or NFS) / usb HD / stream music player.  There'll be no need to use the screen, as anything with a web browser (within wifi range) can control the music.  I love mine and so do the people I made two for :)   Have you checked on the Pi XBMC that under Settings  Services  UPnP all the UPnP options are checked?  You can also install XBMC on the PC   have the two XBMCs talk to each other that way.  Though NFS / Samba is the way to go if you can.   I'm really happy with it.  I didn't have to do anything 'exotic' with XBMC, yet have all the advantages of a central store and I created a home-server at the same time.  If this is your first Pi, be advised I've about 4 of them in active service, and am thinking of reasons to buy more :)  Though for the home-server itself I went with an Odroid U3.   Could you set up an NFS share on the main PC and then XBMC on all the RPIs can connect to that?

To be exact, the internet does nothing of the kind.  It's people who populate the echo chambers, exhibiting a behaviour that no internet law will really curtail and is prevalent everywhere.  After ~20 years of the web, we're still getting used to the audience our conversations and posts can have but we were always having these conversations.  Plus, unsavoury ideas are much better out in the open, where they can be seen and argued against.   Well there's an exception to every rule, and /b/ is the exception to quite a few of them.  As well as a worthy addition to a hosts.deny file of any concerned parent.  Nonetheless, if a kid is bullied on facebook and the like - they will get traced. IRL bullying is not so easy to verify or respond to.   It is indeed bigger, but that's not a problem either.  It's a great time for parents   kids to remind themselves that on-line fora / chat-boards are not reality and need to be taken with a pinch-of-salt.  Bullying is another matter, but one that is actually easier to solve in its on-line forms than its IRL forms.   The thing about group-think is that it can happen everywhere you have a group of people, on-line social networks are nothing new in that regard.      This part is also comical:  The internet may be socialising young people into near-absolute conformity when they have not yet developed sufficient maturity to realise what is happening  And Rock Music will lead to Satanism, yadda yadda yadda ...  Nevermind taking it as an argument to remove religion from students' school education as **it may** create a near-absolute conformity when they have not yet developed sufficient maturity to realise what is happening.  It's another missed opportunity from Breda to have a sensible debate or write a coherent piece on the variety of influences that are literally at everyone's fingertips, not only the school-aged.  All those column inches, to end with the stunning insight that parents should really parent.      That's great, thanks!

I was in a minor fender-bender the other week, 3 distinctly different cars.  After 15 minutes getting everyone's tax details etc., the Senior Garda still didn't know which car belonged to who and accused one of the drivers of giving him incorrect info. Until it was pointed out to him that he was looking at the wrong car.  Never mind the Ban Garda sent out around the town on her own, got a coat thrown over her and beaten up. She was sent out on her own again a few weeks later.  A local thug who assaulted a Garda in the station yet is still free as a bird.

My understanding on the ruling was that while the stats clearly show a gender difference, there is no certainty that 'all women' are better drivers than 'all men' - so applying a general trend to an individual case was unfair.

 Johnny is nothing more than the 21st QB since 99. He'll be gone soon   I'll do my best.   I'll own the hate I perpetrate.   Yeah, I was responding to ManChild goop gobbler saying it was posted already. I DO think he needs bad Manziel press shoved down his throat. I did not know it was posted already.   I'm from Kent. I love Cribbs so much you'd think it was /u/740Buckeye sucking off ManChild.      Not an intentional repost, but the link is broken.   I'm sure you are.   *Edit I didn't know, but out of everyone* You need to hear it twice.   Here's hopin'.      Fantasizing about two at once? Johnny acts like he has a small dick , I understand with a gaping wide ass like yours, that you would long for a good fucking from me. Well I'm gonna give it to you. I'm in process.   His cock is so far inside of you, I don't think you could disengage with a crowbar. Also, fuck ManChild. I'd rather have Weeded back just to spite you. Quinn 2015! Thigpen for life!   GTFO already. Your opinions are fine,  your delivery is bullshit and you have single handedly become the voice of fools on this sub.    GTFO   STFU and get out of this sub.    I wouldn't be surprised at all is your pussy ass can't take the type of bullshit you spew on this sub.    Here, I'll give it a try.

I didn't even know you could talk without them in your mouth .   Here you go talking about busting. Im sure he busts on your face every night while you fantasize about him talking you to town from behind. Is it the alcohol content of his spooge that has you addicted?    You sure talk about ManChild and sucking ALOT. Freudian much, Gargle Balls McBuckeye?   Yeah,  and Manziel has run his crooked little pecker down the mouth of a /u/740Buckeye and the rest of the sub has to smell the cum breath he left you,  because you insist on wagging your cum soaked tongue all over this sub.   Welcome to your new life on reddit   If by half motivated you are talking about how his cock filled filed you up while he paid you to stick his dick all over this sub, I'd say is half hard motivation got you screaming his name in bed,  and by bed,  I mean this sub. Every post your cock sucker waggles about Manziel fills this sub wroth you Manny cum breath. Floss and pick a new topic.    Defending Manziel and gobbling his goop are two different things. You can't defend when your eyes are filled with tears and you have cum seeping out your nose.   Read the rest of my posts you baby fucking cock whore of a human being. Context is important. I want anything to happen that fucks you over and gets rid of Manny the jack fuck ass hat. I pray for Shaw to win strictly to prove you wrong.  I also now have a new reddit mission. Good luck.    I used to like him. Now I don't. You are the poster child for why I don't. He brings fools in his wake, and it's not good for the culture. This is a team,  he's an island. A loser of an island that can't get off my Browns fast enough. I pray that he does something so inappropriate in the off season that the front office has no choice but to fire him. Shaw takes the helm and  takes us to 3 super bowls. We only win one, but we beat Denver for the AFC title each time.  I also hope it makes you see how horrible he is. I also hope he goes to Oakland.  I also hope you have a dream tonight about having sex with your grandma. Sorry to be so vague about my feelings. 'Nite.   I can't wait until he's cut. Strictly because of you /u/740Buckeye. Fuck that guy, because fuck you, and no other reason. You have sucked all over this sub for weeks. Your fan boy outlook is the worst kind of fandom. You HAVE to be a better person in real life than you appear online. To quote John C. Reilly from Guardians of the Galaxy *"I don't believe anyone is 100% a dick, ma'am"*    I do, because it shows he really isn't thinking about anything but the moment he is in.    Because of what /u/Ihateloops said, below. It's a valid point.   He's a Brown. This is a Browns sub. Oh! We are supposed to not talk about him now that he has a negative spotlight  on him for his actions.   Today is a fine day to party. The season is over, but it proves he has no couth.   LOL.      I work at home! Wooooooo!   I like "In the style of Watership Down"    I am an hour and a half from Seattle.  I am so freaking jazzed.   Just moved to Seattle. Very excited.    I just moved to Seattle......Yiiiiisssssss.   That's the same play,  I think.    He looked like he got speared in the sternum. That would have had the ability to mess up his throwing arm.    I really think he got hurt on that sack by Houston. It coincides with his oddly drastic decline.   Or on his mobile phone.    Let's not give Manny a chance to change that. *EDIT: Hoyer has a winning record, boyo. Manny is a 2 time loser.*   He hasn't earned the right to not pay attention.  His actions all season have made him a target.  Thomas could live tweet the whole game and no one would bat an eye, because we know he gets it done on Sunday. We don't know that about JFF. All we know is he fucks off and loses games, so when he fucks off,  it makes us remember that he has been losing us games. And cussing beligerance from fan boys wont change that.    That's fair.   You Are A Ball Of Sunshine.   No downvote, but a boo for you, sir.   When a team plays like a Brown, they don't have a name. Once they score, they do have a name. His name was Jordan Cameron.   Aren't the steelers the bubble blowing babies that ran to the reddit admins (not even the Steelers admin, but the fucking reddit bosses) because of Browns fans going into your scummy ass sub and making these types of posts? You all act the same online as you do after a live game. If you win, you are insufferable, if you lose, you are entitled whiney bitch babies. If you bring this shit to our sub, don't expect us to keep quiet on yours. Treaty broken.   I've been on this train since the draft. Never had seen Johnny OR Shaw play. Watched their highlight reels and said "The moment this Shaw kid gets on the field for a team, he is never getting off until he retires. I bet Johnny and Hoyer both get taken out, and Shaw takes us to the Super Bowl" Well, some of that didn't come true, YET. But we will see. This is my "Johnny gets his start". I am PSYCHED!   I can't believe I have this many feels for a one year player. He has been so solid. Here's to him getting on as a coach somewhere in the Browns organization!   I am so fucking excited. So. Fucking. Excited. I have been a Shaw fan since the Draft and I called him ending the season. I hope he lights it up and wins a spot on the team, permenantly.   If her puss was dripping wet, and she ground it into your pants to the point that it made your cock wet, then it is theoretically possible, since it would have been body fluid contact on your genital skin, then yes. You could technically get it. More likely you got something from actually having sex, or a girlfriend cheating and then giving it to you. Either way, get tested. Reddit can't help you, a clinic can. Good luck.   That is amazing......   This is the first I have heard of this,  as a fan living in Washington.    In sweatpants.   I love The Draw Play.    ruru22   He's my favorite coach we have had since 99, and I was pretty young for the pre-95 Browns, so he is pretty much my favorite coach we have ever had in my lifetime.    So, you would say that the single TD of the Season for Manziel wasnt a dangerous "take the hit" sort of drive where he got clobbered in the side? He was lucky that one didnt take him out. I dont think Johnny avoids contact.     He is going to keep getting beat up and hurt until he is physically unfit to get on the field. RGIII for example. I think Manziel was a panic pick, anyway. He might be worth a LOT in trade bait if we can stop him from getting chewed up and broken.   If Hoyer had been hurt and taken out, Manziel would have gotten an earlier shot. As it stands, Manziel is getting the same shot. He got hurt. shot's over till he's better. #ConnorShaw2015   Because he isnt fit for the NFL, and what's up with the name calling? Last bastion of a failed defense.    More than Johnny has.   You heard me. I said reap it.   So not Manziel, then?   Hoyer has scored more points as a backup in his two games on the bench than Manziel has.    You're just part of the very problem that you are railing against.  You might be THE POSTER CHILD for that which you attack in this post. This proves the old adage: *When you point a finger you have 3 pointing back at you* Be the change you wish to see. When you make that change in your self you will see it mirror in your world. We only see the bad in others that we see in ourselves, and you kinda exemplify that with this thread.   This is why a winning season is now a losing season  Annoying because I'm not blinded by the first glimpse of hope. We shouldn't be happy with an "okay" quarterback, because an "okay" quarterback is going to cost us games by doing stupid shit like throwing balls into the chest of a defender and throwing into triple coverage...teams know that Hoyer has accuracy issues, and they load the box and FORCE us to attempt to air it out...    I think you're just getting the same reaction to your Manziel ultra fanboydom that you spewed all over the Hoyer fans. You are part if the crap ass fan base that called for the head of a 7-6 season. You sewed this shit. You reap it.    Oh, no you're  not.  You say things like  I'm not sucking Manziel's dick, I'm just saying that Hoyer has the mobility of a 450lb hamplanet confined to a wheelchair. also known as a steelers fan       You a Hoyer fan, bro?      I am sure that is true. I am sure a good number of the "I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU WOULD NOT SUPPORT JOHNNY?!" folks are also.   I think maybe we are missing each other due to each of our definition of "calling for his head". I remember the throngs of folks making fun of others because "You don't draft a QB at 22  and then run a perennial backup" and the throngs of all caps posts about just that subject, we're pretty vitriolic.    Miked1be, you are a moderator. You see all of this. You know that people have been calling for Hoyer's head since before the draft.   We don't know that.   Down voting this isn't fair to you,  but boo  sir. Boo to you.   I'm not rooting for either of them,  anymore.  I'm rooting for the Browns as a whole, however that may look. Shaw, Hoyer, Manziel, Mariota, mother fuckin' Jay Cutler, a walk on who I don't know and have never heard of. We aren't a cult of personality, we are a team. So I'm rooting for my team.    He is getting the same support IN THIS REDDIT *Edit: While losing* that Hoyer got.    Just giving him the same consideration Hoyer got.   Cinnamon   So envious. My secret Santa hasn't shipped anything yet, but asked if I liked Batman. Nothing on my list says anything about liking Batman.

From what I heard, it started after little man asked if mom was dating /u/ColdOfWinter. That could be enough.   To be fair,  they only said it sounded like a SIMS character.  Not that it was a SIMS character.  I guess that's where my confusion lies.    It could very well be a poltergeist created by the eldest boy.   Sometimes the two overlap.

I play this song by Prozac: I'm a Bastard   The front office said they will  probably draft a QB every year, and that they will field the people that give us the best chance. I truly think if this office thought Mariota would do the job, they would pull the trigget.

The last thing to keep in mind here is that people who answered this question primary come from Reddit and Voat, so naturally, we are expecting the younger generation here (likely around the 2030 range). Gallup, for example, did similar polls and their results (which should be more representative) demonstrate entirely different results.         We are including a poll to tally results. http://thearima.com/questions/when-visiting-an-unknown-site-will-you-sign-up-with-your-social-media-accounts  Basically, the question here is should startups invest the time and effort to build a social login system? The belief is that this will same time and encourage more sign ups, but obviously it's possible that one is wasting his time because nobody would sign up using their social media accounts in the first place.      who got sacked?   If that doesn't work, it just makes things worse :)   This is, of course, assuming that nobody gets sacked tonight :)      I think remote teams rarely work well. People need to talk to each other in person to exchange and share ideas.   My friend is a designer and he uses the Mac only because he uses a software (I think it's called Sketch) for his job and this software is only available for Mac users. Why don't they also make a PC version?         Original Source: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/traits-great-startup-advisor-mark-macleod  The two things I love to do most are advise founders   their teams plus close complex financial transactions. I love those things so much that I created SurePath Capital Partners so that I could do them all day long! Its been just over two months now since I launched SurePath and its going better than I ever imagined. As Ive settled into this new role, Ive been thinking about what it means to be a great Startup advisor. Here are my thoughts.  Its very common for startups to add advisors. Those advisors come in all shapes and sizes. Most advise on the side while they do something else. That can lead to inconsistent experiences. Ironically, the more prominent that person is, the more disappointing the experience is. With rare exceptions, if you have some A list startup celeb advising you, you might get some great intros, but they will be too busy being their fabulous selves to really engage.  Another common pitfall with advisors is signing up the person with one big win. Often that persons advice consists of telling you what worked at that big win. But you cant just copy. The context is different every time.  In my humble and completely biased opinion, here are the traits that I think the best startup advisors needs to have:  Broad   diverse experience: Its only from going through multiple companies, winners, losers, down markets and upmarkets that you can be a great advisor in good times and bad. You need multiple data points, and the pattern-matching ability that only comes through being in the trenches for a long time.  Client orientation: I began my career in public accounting and spent 6 years in professional services. I grew up career-wise having clients. Whether you started off in consulting or some other services industry or whether service is just a core value, this client orientation is must if you want to offer great advice.  An important aspect of a client orientation is that its never about the advisor! I have listened to prominent, twitter famous advisors blather on incessantly because they love the sound of their voice. Thats just painful. No matter how experienced you are, it should never be about you. Its always about the client.  Objective: The best advisors have no personal agenda. They simply help you sort through the issues and offer up unbiased thoughts and answers. This is a common criticism I hear from founders regarding investors. Its not that they dont trust their investors. But they are aware that while their investors bring great advice and experience, they also manage a fund and have to deliver returns. That can sometimes compromise objectivity.  Another element of objectivity is not getting caught up in the drama. Startups are full of highs and lows. Often in the same day. The best advisors are sympathetic to that but dont get caught up in that themselves.  Solutions first: Its not all that valuable to raise issues or problems without also offering up potential solutions. The last thing a founder needs is more unsolved problems.  Anticipation: If you have deep experience and you have a client first orientation, youre likely going to think of issues and opportunities before your client does. Thats magic.  Coach: The most prominent tech advisor is Bill Campbell, who is known as the Coach. He was a football coach before going on to coach Steve Jobs, Marc Andreessen, Ben Horowitz and many other prominent execs. The thing with coaches (vs. advisors) is they help you arrive at the answer yourself rather than just tell you the answer. That is so powerful.  So, thats my recipe for a great advisor. Am I missing anything?   Found this in /r/atheism and thought it is hilarious.  Credit goes to /u/PM_me_your_toaster for posting it first.            Yes. So I guess you are suggesting they will remaining in the EU but may ditch the Euro?   Question 1: Do you think Greece will remain in the EU given its growing concern of defaulting?  I've created a poll to help tally up opinions. Please vote http://thearima.com/questions/do-you-think-greece-will-remain-in-the-eu-given-its-growing-concern-of-defaulting.  My personal guess this some sort of bailout will be reached at the end (as that's what has always happened). Greece will remain in the EU.  Question 2: Will you adjust your investment strategies in the next few days/weeks according?  I bought some VIX etfs last week, and have happily enjoyed my 30% gain today. Given my answer to the first question (i.e. they will stay in the EU), I would likely clearly out my position in the next few days as I think the VIX index will rise a bit more and then go back down.  I'd love to hear your thoughts!   Yeah exactly, you chop your last boyfriend up, and then you want to date someone else...   Oops, it's a typo :)   I wonder who would date him?         Welcome to Reddit +1   Yeah, I was expecting a more even distribution between the races.   Why not?               Bolasie - I liked this guy in FM managing lower profile clubs.   So if I am a blogger, why do I want others to look for stuff instead of reading my post?   I mean like what business would use it, like e-commerce, or news publisher, or social media etc.      This is an incredible visualization.   What type of site would this plugin be used for?      That's a thorough answer!   A good friend of mine loves the Argonians, so yeah, they are cool too :)   Seems like Orc is pretty popular too!   I don't necessarily think machine learning requires ODE specifically, but I think it's always good to learn some things other than what you will need. ODE (and later on PDE) is very useful for many modelling related problem and is particularly useful for financial problems. I think it's always good to learn a course on that.  BTW, I think in stochastic processes you will need some ODE, and stochastic analysis is used in machine learning.   I bet it's not khajiit :)   Nord is my pick.       I suggest start with something easy, and one that has been done by many people before (so you have a tonne of readings/examples to look at).  Deep learning is good, but it may not be the easiest place to start. Why not look at some simpler problems, like some binary classification problems?   I am using a support vector machine to predict a data set with 650 observations. There are roughly 15 covariates, and then end result is to classify whether the observations belong to group A or group B.  I ran a SVM, and ended up just over 300 support vectors (315 I think). Are there general rules that tell you how many support vectors you should have given the data I have, or is that done on a case-by-case basis?

Then, expand your service as you go.   Everyone knows that this open was played by Miles against Karpov in 1980 and Miles won. But people typically don't tell others that Karpov was completely winning and lost the game only because he made a stupid blunder.   Yeah, I don't believe this at all.   Thanks   I always thought that Sunday being the first week was an old tradition (i.e. the Sabbath) and now most countries recognize Monday as the first day of the week. But perhaps I am mistaken?      When you use the svm() function, you get to select things like type, kernel, etc. But when you do tune.svm(), all it requires is the formula and a list of gammas and costs. What kind of svm does that tuning give you?  	67

 Some info about me: 22 year old American male college student. I will be on a weeklong trip to Cancun, MX for spring break during the middle of March. I am looking for somewhere interesting to go after my trip in Cancun, preferably in Central or South America, or the Caribbean, for about 5-7 days. I am not necessarily looking for any type of party scene since I am just leaving Cancun.  Things I would enjoy: sand sports (sand boarding, dune buggies, etc.), hiking/backpacking, surfing and other water sports.  I am a pretty experienced traveller, I've taken multiple solo cross-country road trips and spent 3 months backpacking in Europe this past summer. I would like to keep things as affordable as possible.  Thanks folks!   That sounds brutal. It can be hard to start exercising if you have a migraine but I always figured the more oxygen you get to your brain the better  	2
 He is such a good writer.   I don't want to discourage you, but unemployment is still really high here and pay is low for a lot of jobs.  You didn't mention what type of job you are interested in.  If you could apply for some jobs, come out on a vacation and interview.  If you get hired, move!   Voc-Rehab located in the Job Connect offices should be able to help.  Opportunity Village may have an employment program also although I'm not sure.  I worked at Catholic Charities at one time, and a coworker was in a wheelchair.  You can pretty much do any office job; it's just finding the right employer.   I don't think the article mentioned people were going without water to save pensions.  Pensions and health care are getting cut also.  I wish Obama could bail them out.   I believe the headline is correct.  The arguments supporting it however would not influence republican beliefs.   By the way, I would love Cheney to expound on his quote.   I'm curious about where he developed the thought on this.  I wonder if deficits do matter??  Other than that, he is about the sleaziest elected official I have ever seen.   Other than the Bootlegger, I didn't know or recognize any of the other locations shown.  I felt that this was a town I didn't know!   But he is right!   I have a friend who started with $250 selling vapes at a flea market.  He now has four stores.   What is Richard Mellon Scaife doing today?  Is he still living?  It's wierd that the Koch brothers have seemed to take his place.   Yes.  She seems to go on forever..... http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/schlafly-increase-pay-gap-so-women-will-have-better-opportunities-find-husband   Why only for emergencies?   I think that is the base income. Everyone earning more than that wouldn't receive anything.   Let's get rid of those pesky unionized public employees.      It's true.  Can you believe it????   Wasn't  Delta employee-owned at one point? Whatever happened with that?      I had just finished the book "Dog Whistle Politics" and it definitely had an effect on how I view the world. I started looking at all issues through this lens and it is amazing how I can see connections I didn't see previously.   Agree.    They call themselves independents so they don't have to accept Bush as one of their own.   Drives me crazy.  They have to be getting it from their parents.   Gives me hope.    I agree with you there.  I don't know alot about Soros (and his business dealings), but when I've seen him on tv, he appears to be rational and thoughtful, two traits that I like.   I thought the light bulb and the phonograph.   Edison invented the light bulb and the phonograph.  He supported direct current (DC) for distribution while his ex-employee Tesla wanted alternate current (AC), a far better system.  Edison was more successful in his lobbying efforts.   Sorry.  I don't know what DAE means,  I just think we would have been better off following Tesla rather than Edison.   Actually, some studies now show that postponing instant gratification is a major step to escaping poverty.  I think they are talking about getting a high school diploma rather than dropping out.   I think this is what we hoped Obama would be.   The absurdity of it all.  But drugs are not the answer either.   What can we do?  They don't even realize they are voting to cut their own  medicare and social security.   Maybe Edison.    Trash Flash or Dirt Alert.      There should be huge voter registration drives in those states.   Why does this not surprise me?    When I was young, I remember seeing photos of the match posted in Goldfield.      I think everyone needs the same pieces as you do.  Last time they ran this contest, NO one in Nevada won anything.   Didn't Ralph Nader say that only the rich can save us?   I think the County has jobs for students.  Henderson Parks and Recreation has jobs for students, so maybe the rest of the public entities (LV, NLV, etc.) probably do also.  If you were 18 and had a WSI (Water Safety Instructor) license, you could probably get hired as a lifeguard by the hotels.  Finally, I would google the Workforce Investment Program in Las Vegas. They have several agencies that have been funded to help youth find employment.   My husband's uncle told him when he was young that he would never see social security.  He is receiving it today.   You will be grateful for these programs when you turn 65.  I also object to them being called Ponzi schemes.  Ponzi schemes run out of investers which is what causes them to go under.  If we kept the money in a locked box, there would be plenty to go around.  We have a bulge in the number of people using the program during the boomer years, but this was expected and won't last.  The boomers also paid 110% of what was going to be needed!!   Might be cheaper than refinishing.   It was a shock to me, but young whites voted for Romney.   I heard George Soros say the same thing basically before GW won his second term.  He said if GW won, there was something wrong with us.  He is right.  There is. Drives me crazy.     Sounds great to me.  I need more recipes,   I work with a woman who believes this, and she will not call herself a republican.  She is an independent.  I would guess she has never not voted republican.   I loved it when he made reference to February 30th.   Hitler did want to be an artist, didn't he?   Have you met with anyone at Job Connect?  They do have a Veteran's representative at their offices.  I know there has been a push to get veteran's employed, but I'm not sure which groups have been promoting employment through job fairs, etc.  The Job Connect office might know.  Good luck.   They may have more money than governments now.   I think it is still common in certain parts of Utah and Arizona.      Thank you for posting this overview.  I'm on many email groups and I get emails every other day to save SS.  I didn't have an overview however and this article put things in perspective.  I wondered many times if Obama was playing chess with the republicans, offering up these (and medicare cuts) knowing the republicans wouldn't take up anything he offered, or if he really believed in cutting.  In any case, it makes me nervous.   Try getting  job in Las Vegas hotel in advertising.  Maybe the Hilton would be good, then you might be able to transfer  anywhere else in the world. A master's would be good too.  UNLV, while not a great college, does offer a master's in hotel mgmt.  You could specialize in public relations or something.   Don't you love em?   Except for the strange vote in Ohio.   You answered with exactly what I was going to say.   The problem is that they are doing it at the local level now.  The exectutive branch is almost moot at this point.  That's why midterm elections are so important.   Didn't Perot win about 25% of the vote.  I liked Anderson too, but Perot would have been a horrible president.   Reagan was not popular when he left office.  The right has spent millions of dollars to rehabilitate his image.   Thank you for that.  I just finished reading "Dog-Whistle Politics" and I was shocked to learn that Romney won the white youth vote.  If youth are more progressive, it may be due to ethnic demographic changes.  You give me hope, because I've been watching these things for a lot of time, and I believe you are right.   Decades ago now, PBS aired a simulation (?) of the Chicago 7 trial using actual transcripts. I never forgot it.      Absolutely.  It's also been called the Two Santa Theory. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_Wanniski   There was also discussion that they didn't want to pay off bonds before they were due.   I don't consider Paul a libertarian.  He is also anti-choice.      If you have 5-7 friends you play with, try Diplomacy.  Puts Risk to shame.  No dice, no luck in the game.   Yes, let's have war and an economy crash again.   Unfortunately they are right.  They have effectively stopped anything from happening at the national level.  Now, everything is happening at the state level.  It's just the wrong things.   If you think he's bad, wait ....  And if George Bush wasn't enough, you can't believe what Cruz would do.   And you can't discuss anything with them reasonably.  I've been there.   Most Tea Party members are the Religious Right.  They just rear their ugly heads every decade or so.   What a great experience.   They forgot to attend the hearing?   Good article.  The article should have pointed out the racial makeup of the Tea Party and the Republican Party for that matter.  It is 90 % white.  I think they put every minority they have out front to show that they are inclusive.  LOL.     Also, the Tea Party is a resurgence of the John Birch Society. I think that the Koch brothers' father was co-founder of the John Birch Society.    You could contract out to hospitals, HMOs or insurance companies for home visits for high risk patients that keep getting admitted, for assessments, review of medications, etc.  You could lower costs, and clients could have a greater health outcome.   When I was young, I remember the 8 hr drive from Las Vegas to Reno, which looks a whole lot less boring than your drive.  There was a billboard by the road that simply said "Ain't this monotonous?"  I wish I had a photo of that billboard today.                     White Americans have not voted for a Democratic President since LBJ who said he was afraid he had lost the Democratic vote for a generation when he signed the Civil Rights Act.  Source: Dog Whistle Politics http://www.amazon.com/Dog-Whistle-Politics-Appeals-Reinvented/dp/0199964270 Sorry for not finding the exact statistics to back it up, but it's in the book.       Good link.    Unfortunately, I think your right.  In the real world, we could show them the light, then register them to vote.      Tax breaks for the rich.  http://www.aei-ideas.org/2012/04/why-we-cant-go-back-to-sky-high-1950s-tax-rates/ It was 91% back then.  People were still rich, but there was a smaller gap.     I also agree.   I agree.   Poverty may cause crime; We do need to fix the problem (and I'm sorry for your experience), but cutting food stamps will only exacerbate the problem.   I know people from big families (not polygamist), and I'm amazed at how they do it.  Hard work too!   I hope you read my response to another comment in this same link.     Actually, I think that "Dog Whistle Politics" stated that 96% of Romney's vote came from the white population.  In terms of membership, Yahoo says whites make up 90% of all Republicans.   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080619075211AAEZsTi "Dog Whistle Politics" did say that Romney won the white vote of every age group which surprised me.  I thought youth had become more liberal.  "Dog Whistle.." also reported that the Democrats have not won the white vote for President since 1964 since LBJ was elected.  You may know that when he signed the Civil Rights Act, he predicted that he may have lost the south for the Dems for a generation. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson  This caused Republicans to develop the Southern Strategy under Nixon. Two Republicans former chairs have apologized for that strategy:  Ken Melman, former chair apologizing for the party using the race card: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/13/AR2005071302342.html  Michael Steel, former GOP chair apologizing for the party's use of the Southern Strategy: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/04/22/michael-steele-for-decade_n_547702.html  You know, I'm white and don't like to hear this either, but sometimes the truth is painful.  I really recommend this book. C-Span had an interview with the book's author.  You can watch an interview at: http://booktv.org/search.aspx?For=dog%20whistle%20politics  I calling someone a liar is not the best way to disagree.      He's right.  The Republican Party is 96% white, and the white population is diminishing as a proportion of the population.  Two former Chairs of the Republican Party have apologized for the party using the race card.  The party is fundamentally flawed.  I just finished reading "Dog Whistle Politics" and recommmend it for people who want to understand it.  Rand Paul is not a libertarian either.  He has some issues that he sounds great on, but then there are other issues....   Why else?  They are stopping everyone else from tackling every other issue.  I don't think that's ignorant.   The Republican Party is 96% white.  I tend to think that is what drives their agenda, which would make it the most important issue that we face.   I wish they would all vote.   I wish I could give you solid facts to back me up, although I feel sure I am right.  I think that was the main reason of having an estate tax - so money wouldn't just accumulate in some families.   I agree with you.  Rand Paul is a perfect example.   It would be nice to have a Democratic President who wasn't pressured by the right for a change.   I bet these states had the most white voters also.  I'm reading "Dog Whistle Politics" now, and 96% of Romney voter's were white.  60% of white voters voted for Romney.  It's ugly.   Me too.    How can you financially support a family that size?   They have no ethics.   Another caseworker here too.  You are so right.     What are THEY trying to accomplish?  Give a buddy a contract.  Humiliate poor people.  They suck.   There are libertarian liberals also.   I think they have turned in to a cult.   There needed to be an increase in food stamps due to what they have done policy wise to the public.  They have made them poor!  Also, cutting food stamps doesn't reduce poverty, it just would make life more difficult for those struggling to get by.  I just don't get republican's logic.   Let them.  I don't shop there anyway.   Too tired.   If the Democratic Party was smart, they would be have a voter registration project of all those folks that would be eligible in states not accepting medicaid.   The GOP has a strange coalition of libertarians, Christians and corporates.    Thanks for your words of support and guidance. Valuable insight.   Not soon enough.    I think eventually all money will naturally flow to the richest leaving everyone else with nothing.   Well, the Wal-mart heirs have 40% of all income.   It is supposed to be majority rule, minority rights.  In this case, the minority (republicans) are stopping the majority from ruling altogether.                    We're not broke.  It's just that all our money is ending up in a few hands.   I bought a book on how the songs came about which I loved.  If I had the time to look it up, I would. Think you can find it online.   Is that why Fox started a new program called "The Independents?" LOL.   We are. I think the largest solar plant in the U.S. is being built in the Mohave Desert (Ivanpah?)   You could start your own reddit, but great choices.   Yes, and the party that claims to support the constitution doesn't address that it is the only agency specifically mentioned in the consitution.   He also won a World War, freed Europe, and guided us through the Great Depression.  That being said, I do think the camps were horrible.  I'm curious too, who would your favorite president be?   A coworker's son works for an airlines.  He gets free flights and goes everywhere on standby.  He also can give free flights to family members and even friends.     Not at all.   At one time, taxes were 94 percent I believe. It was an incentive to earn more for a bigger take home amount. I do think this is excessive, but with the Walton's, it would still be millions.   Name one president who did everything perfectly.   I love it.   Utilities are making it difficult for consumers.  I thought I would look at starting a coop in my state - Nevada - perfect for solar.  It would be illegal for a consumer-sponsored coop.   I was shocked at the NRA's reponse to Newtown.  I thought maybe working together we could come up with something like background checks that everyone could support.  Nope, the NRA's answer was more guns in the schools.     I could understand banning cigarettes, but I don't understand the banning of e-cigs at all.  Someone help me here.   It helped, but the over-leverage of the banks were the main cause.   Don't have time to look for it now, but NPR did a story on it recently.   Since I just paid $30 for one of my three windshield wipers, and I'll have to replace it in two years, good.    I loved Love (the cirque show) so much I went twice in one week.   Some right-wing think tank probably bought them all and will give them away.  I've heard of them doing this.   It's 11 pm and I just ordered two.   Rick Santorum considers Mandala's fight like the Republican's battle against Obamacare.  Unbelievable.     I watched a documentary of a young couple who built one and was shocked at how expensive it was.  I think it cost them $30,000 which seems like a lot for the square footage.   Wait til you get 65 and see how much you want to go to work everyday.  Plan to have your kids support you?   Boomers actually paid 110%, more than they should, to get through this period.   My husband's uncle told him the same thing when he was young.  He is collecting it today after 50 yrs of hard work.  	143
 Brian Jonestown Massacre's Sound of Confusion is amazing. It's more of a compilation of like six songs with some background noise in the beginning but it's great. The Wiper's Youth of America is amazing and is very punk rock with a very nice riff.   If you like indie check out The Virgins, they have some very catchy tunes. If you like 80's or 90's real alternative Teenage Fanclub is great (I Don't Know and Don't Look Back are my favorites). But if you want something more current check out Pity Sex they have an album called Feast of Love and a song on it called Drown Me Out. Also Title Fight have a song called Your Pain Is Mine should satisfy your cravings. Please let me know how it works out!   I think the Stooges put out their best record first. Everyone always talks about Fun House and Raw Power but they overlook The Stooges. It had the best out of place ballad-y songs using like five chords and Ron Ashton going crazy on his solos.   I disagree, anything on Strange Days is better the best song from The Doors.      You have to be really punk to pull it off and/or a The Germs tribute band.   She cracked her voice because of the strain and then miscarried after singing that song but she got whoo from Mick so it's all good.   One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Fight Club  	8

    A good, sound investment!   Thank you :D   We were able to get permission to circumnavigate the globe after our deployment with the Navy. The rest of the Strike Group went back home through the Pacific and we continued up through the Suez and into the Med.   That's fantastic! Where abouts in Utah? Mostly just curious as I'll be driving through there in the near future.   I drank the whole bottle which is one dose (10 oz / ~296mL)   I've used it a couple of times. The first time, I didn't know what I was getting myself into. I was light headed, dizzy and just drained. The second time, I kept hydrated, made sure to eat and just take it easy. I went through quite a few diapers that day. But, even the following few days, my body was not happy and I was passing everything in an unpleasant fashion. If you're looking for loss of control, it's great. I held it until my body just noped and forced the mess into my diaper. Just remember to stay hydrated and eat. And also be prepared for a rough couple of days after as your body adjusts.  7/10 would recommend but very very sparingly.   Yay!   I love your surveys! Plz can I haz moar?      I do believe they are!       lol :D   It's one of those little things most people don't know until you're dealing with it in a professional setting. I wouldn't worry too much about the title as the point is still conveyed :)   This will probably get me downvoted, but when a ship strikes a stationary object, it's an allision. A collision is between two moving vessels. As someone who's dealt with this type of thing before (albeit not on this scale), the Coast Guard makes the distinction. And then both vessels get to deal with the Coast Guard's paperwork! Fun! Nothing like an investigation!   I've got a few ships from this transit! I'll keep an eye out for the banner!         I love this photo with the house in the foreground and the mountains in the back. It just feels... right.      I'm only subscribed because it's a default and I have yet to unsubscribe!   I picked this one up in Alameda (back when our homeport was there :) )   I've considered retiring to there.   Glad to offer bits of knowledge! And that is a good joke. Another is "Why must you be 6 feet tall to join the Coast Guard? So when the boat sinks you can walk back to shore." .  The one ship I was on had a flight deck and a hangar and we ran helo ops for almost every patrol.   For me, I've been sober for 3 years now, so it's not something I've been trying to hard to look into. I do remember loving the discovery of the Hefeweizen.   This was taken with a little Fujifilm digital camera. It's one I picked up at the Exchange before deployment which is also, now at the bottom of the ocean.   Fun fact in that I can answer both!  I was part of the Burial at Sea crew on the USCGC Munro during my tour. There were typically 4 crew members for the honor guard. The CO presided over the Ceremony with the XO acting as his assistant. Mostly the XO held the urn until it was time to hand it to the CO. That and get coated in ash that one time the wind changed direction. It was always a somber occasion and it's lead me to consider burial at sea as my choice of burial.  As for the interdictions, any USCG vessel (small boat included) can perform them. We derive our general Law Enforcement authority from 14 U.S.C. 2. [Here's the Office of Law Enforcement's Webpage.](http://www.uscg.mil/hq/cg5/cg531/) Additional US Codes give further authorities. As a Petty Officer, I had the ability to act as a Law Enforcement Officer (as per [14 U.S. Code  89](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/14/89)). As long as the vessel is flying the Coast Guard Ensign, it has the full authority of the US Coast Guard behind it. Fun fact! When you hear about a US Navy ship making a drug bust, there's a high probability that a US Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment (LEDET) on board and the ship will shift it's TACON (Tactical Control) to the US Coast Guard. This is because the US Navy doesn't have the same authorities as the USCG. On the other hand the USCG becomes a part of the Department of the Navy during times of war.   Wow. Instead of bitching, there's always voat.   The immensity of it all is staggering   Oh gosh. This photo was taken back in 2003. All I really remember from that time was a lot of sea sickness.     	31
 I sear then oven. I think it's less likely you'll overshoot your steak temperature that way.   Living in a desert, I'm always interested in saving water and energy so I wanted to see if the cold pan method of cooking pasta would yield good results. I first learned about it from Chow.com, [here.](http://www.chow.com/food-news/94799/how-to-quickly-cook-pasta-in-a-frying-pan/)   The danger of not using enough water is, of course, sticky pasta so for my first attempt I used whole wheat pasta which has less starch to begin with. I made one serving (3 oz. dry pasta) and used an 8" skillet. I broke the pasta to make sure it fit, which I don't mind. Purists may balk. I added enough water to cover it with a healthy amount to account for absorption and loss to vapor. It was probably around 3 cups (350 mL ?).   It got to boiling pretty fast. [Here is a photo](http://i.imgur.com/s7H1WdL.jpg) of it cooking. I stopped short of al dente by a couple of minutes to drain and reserve the pasta water. I added my marinara and finished cooking, re-adding pasta water as necessary.   The results were damn good. The sauce was thick and clingy and the pasta didn't stick. [Here's the finished dish](http://i.imgur.com/3TXfoUw.jpg) with some grated parmigiana and basil.  Edit:  In case anyone was curious, I ended up tossing away less than 2/3rd cup of water.   The Windows 10 computer icon looks like an iMac?   Not really. Look at Google's design guidelines. Metro and Windows 8 began to popularize the flat design, with little use of gradients. Jony Ive took iOS in that direction. There are so many devices now. Apple's UI and Google's guidelines emphasize a very clean look with minimal distractions that work well across a lot of different screen sizes and resolutions. To me, the Windows 10 iconography stays within those design principles.   I'm a pretty liberal Democrat and I find this title incredibly misleading. Reducing corporate taxes does not necessarily translate to increased wealth for the top 1%.   Landrover's [Valentine's Day Ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlRuD0mWDds). Very clever concept, and it is a true story.      What's this "reading" you speak of?   I work on the 6th floor of a building overlooking Main Street of my city. I was looking out the window one day and saw a dude driving down the street slowly with a hand down in his pants. I thought "No. Oh hell no."  I wish to God that I can un-remember that day.   Logan's Run   I thought you had to be buried in cement in the U.S.? Or is this not the U.S.?   I'm not a historian but by the 18th century, humans have spent a lot of time on the water with paper, quill and ink. I would imagine that they had dryboxes.   Did you just say 'stroke victim?' How does one get victimized by stroking?   Point taken.   I tried to be factual in the title.   I read elsewhere that he also had no prior criminal history whatsoever.   Here's a story of an expat who was beaten to death by customs officers for not paying the bribe.  *At Dhaka airport there is a gang of police and customs officers who supplement their pounds 80-a-month salaries by demanding between pounds 30 and pounds 50 from returning expatriates.*  *The general consensus, supported by a leaked CID crime report, is that Mr Miah was murdered, almost certainly by being beaten to death.*  *Humayen R Choudhury, the parliamentary speaker, doubted that the vast feudal pyramid of corruption could be breached, saying: "I know that people are treated very badly at Dhaka Airport, and we want to change that, but I imagine that you will come up against a brick wall when you want to talk to customs officers."*  [The Independent](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/death-at-the-airport-exposes-web-of-corruption-in-bangladesh-1308111.html)  In a country like that, anything can be accomplished at the right price.   AND a $1,000 fine.   *Sales of gold have long been an important source of funds for the North Korean regime, which has been largely cut off from the global financial system by sanctions imposed to curb its nuclear-weapons program.*  *Kim Kwang-Jin, a former banker for the Pyongyang regime, said North Korea could have been moving the precious metal in an effort to find buyers.*  *North Korea often uses diplomats to carry cash and other valuables, defectors and diplomats say. Increased sanctions and scrutiny of official bank accounts have increased the need for secret movement of items in this way, they say.*  [Wall Street Journal](http://www.wsj.com/articles/north-korean-carrying-1-4-million-in-gold-bars-intercepted-in-bangladesh-1425736098)  Will there be anything else?      I would guess that PayPal, Apple, Softcard, Google and all the soft wallet services are also under trade restrictions. Besides, running a $1 Million transaction, while possible, might raise some eyebrows and draw scrutiny.   Oh hell no. The customs agent wants to see Benjamin Franklin, the most liquid piece of paper in the world.   I ask because tonight when I sat down the server asked if we wanted appetizers. I hadn't had a chance to look over the menu yet but I asked her "do you have a meat   cheese plate?"  "Yes!" she said.  "OK, we'll have that."  She brings two plates. One with the charcuterie, one with the cheese. In my continuing nave-ness I thought "hmm, why two plates," but didn't say anything. I realized when I got the bill that the meat   cheese plate was a meat plate and a cheese plate. $20 each.  It was delicious though.      $1.4M is not really that much gold at todays prices. This guy was probably a courier for one or two high ranking government leaders and was just going to trade it for cash. Because of economic sanctions, North Korea has very little foreign cash. You need cash--like U.S. Dollars--to buy/import foreign goods. There are people who will sell you anything--Mercedes, Fendi purses (popular with the first lady), Armani suits--but they won't take the North Korean Won.  The reason why he got caught is because he didn't make any bribes or didn't bribe the right people at the airport. Arguing diplomatic immunity won't get you anywhere but if you slip enough money into your passport you could get almost anything through customs in a 3rd world country.   There are two kinds of girls who go to the gym. One kind goes there to be admired. The other kind goes there to work out in peace. Neither will give you their number.    As somebody who has lost a mom, I have some suggestions. This would have worked well for me but I don't know your friend so keep that in mind.  I had to take care of the arrangements. That took a lot of time so I wish somebody just helped take care of little stuff. Water the plants, walk the dog, etc. Keep your eyes out for that kind of stuff and offer.  Be honest. You can't imagine how it feels if it hasn't happened to you and it's OK to just say "I can't possibly imagine what you're going through." Any sentence that starts with "I wish" isn't going to be all that helpful.  It's a sad time but it's also OK to smile, laugh and even joke--"Your mom would not approve of that shirt for her funeral." Sometimes dark humor helps crack the tension. Again, you know your friend, I don't.   I'm guessing the reason why you're agonizing over pennies is because of what your parents did during your upbringing. In between the lines I think you sense that as well. One thing I've learned from my own therapy is that family of origin baggage is heavy.  Treat yourself to one or two brand name things every grocery trip and increase that as you feel comfortable with the fact that it really doesn't make a shits worth of difference at the end of the day.   Apparently I put it in the glove compartment and it flipped over the top and fell behind the compartment when I shut it. The glove compartment was probably too full of shit but still, a crappy Chevy Astrovan design. The guy had taken out the center console to do some work in there and found my wallet.   I did, just not there.   People had insane topiary gardens.   It's just data. What we make of it is purely our own invention. The data is just data.   If instead of circles they were bombs or tanks then the illustration would have been perhaps too politicized. But as it is, it's a just a standard way of depicting relative values and, to me, unworthy of being called "beautiful."      They have to monetize for the investors or else the founders will get the boot.      Thanks!   It also means that the officer has at least reasonable suspicion which allows him/her to ask more questions to determine probable cause.   Good advice. I just want to add that if you are actually being detained on reasonable suspicion or probable cause, you can state to the officer that you have an attorney. At that point they are supposed to end questioning until your attorney is present.   Unless you are being detained, the only thing you are required to give police is your name and any identification if they ask for it. You can refuse to answer any other questions and a refusal will never be used as any evidence of guilt in court. But you should always do so in a courteous manner or else you may give the police something to arrest you for.  That said, keep in mind that cops are just trying to do their jobs. Yes, I have heard the horror stories of some pretty big assholes in uniform too. But the vast majority just want to keep things under control. Sometimes they are responding to citizen calls about suspicious activity and they want to make sure that you're legit. They would probably appreciate clearing you quickly so they can move on to trying to find the actual person the caller was complaining about.  Even if you think the cop is overstepping his authority, you should comply but clearly state that you object to having to do it. The court will not allow any evidence gathered from an illegal search if it ever gets that far.   You have a good point. I was so entranced by his movies I wasn't thinking.   Kind of like Vince Vaughn? I think it would work pretty well actually.   I think OP is thinking fried spring rolls. That's the term most used in trendier restaurants and vietnamese or thai restaurants because "egg roll" is too associated with crappy Americanized Chinese restaurants.  To answer OP's question:  Fresh spring rolls are made from softened rice paper, has fresh veggie ingredients and pre-cooked meats inside (shrimp or pork usually). Fresh spring rolls are not fried. On the other hand, fried spring rolls is ground meat and vegetables rolled in a special spring roll paper that fries up crispy and deep fried. A chinese egg roll -- I'm talking the crappy restaurant kind -- is usually some kind of meatless cabbage filling inside the same fried spring roll wrap, and it's deep fried as well.   They want to tap into your impulse buying habit. They don't want you to think which your mind can't do as well when it's trying to process the auctioneer. It's also a way to increase the speed and thereby increase the pressure on you.   The chemical structure of the different plastics isn't anything that nature has ever made so there are no organisms that consume it or can break it down and it doesn't rust or dissolve. Plastics, theoretically, last forever under normal circumstances and they never get recycled back into nature. Personally, I think we will eventually see the evolution of micro-organisms that can feed on plastics. It may take a million years though.  Petroleum itself isn't bad. It's the byproducts of combustion that is bad. CO2 in the atmosphere soaks heat instead of allowing it to dissipate into space, causing the Earth's surface temperatures to rise and altering the climate. Particulates like soot get into our lungs and are carcinogenic.   A reasonable doubt is when you're not convinced because there are other possible explanations that the prosecution could not effectively dismiss.  A trial generally goes like this:  The prosecutor has a theory and they show evidence to support that theory. Time lines, weapons, blood stains on the defendant, eyewitness testimony, etc. The defense attorney tries to introduce "reasonable doubt" about the most critical pieces of evidence. The defense doesn't have to come up with a competing theory though ideally it would be helpful if they could. The defense attorney will try to show that perhaps the eyewitness was too far away for a positive identification, or that the time line would be too difficult to accomplish. Basically, anything to have a majority of the jurors say "hmmm, maybe he didn't do it."   You're being rational. Knock it off.   I love how his opponent just rubs his hands together in glee after making the counter move.   I'm not putting any blame on the municipalities, and I get what you're saying. I think they would benefit from more education of their community of the effects of trying to grind everything in the sink disposer. The rice in the photo is a perfect example of stuff that should have and very easily could have gone into the garbage bin.   All you have to do is go up to a cop, kick him in the balls and yell "Don't tase me Bro!!"   It would only be used to catch bad guys. I promise (wink).   Municipalities should do a better job of teaching homeowners. The solids that goes into your sink just gets filtered out and taken to the landfill anyways. Homeowners can save themselves potential problems and also be friendlier to their sewage treatment if they just scrape their leftovers into the trash instead of the garbage disposal.  I haven't had a garburator in 15 years and haven't had any clog problems.   There are a lot of people who will take a story like this, fill it in with fictitious stuff they've seen on CSI, and think that a processing a rape kit will somehow magically deliver incriminating and irrefutable evidence of guilt.   All I can say is:  Keep fighting ignorance.   Can I get the plans for that for my 3D printer?   Maybe she was cold but if somebody is so frail that they can let a single sentence push them to suicide then I think the problem isn't with the girl.   Unmatched DNA doesn't go into any database so this just isn't going to happen, at least not today. It would be an interesting database to have though.      Besides the storage issue which has already been covered, the other difference is that video is being processed at N frames per second whereas a camera (even a smartphone) can afford up to a couple of seconds to process and store a single image. The processing power of the security camera or the DVR affects the resolution and quality of the image.   I agree with that 100%. The issue I have is that people are demanding that *all* rape kits get processed. That's needless yet that happened recently in Salt Lake City. The city council and police department caved to the political pressure. Money/time/resources will be needlessly wasted.   You let the dough sit and rise to allow the yeast work its magic. The yeast is converting the carbohydrates into carbon dioxide which will gives the bread its bubbles when it bakes. The rise will also give bread a different, less floury flavor.   In a case where the assailant is not known by the victim then it can lead to a match in a database. It's worthwhile in those circumstances and detectives will almost certainly order processing of the kit. But if the detective already knows who the accused is and they don't dispute that they had sex with the victim, why process the kit? The latter is the majority of rape cases.  For wrongful convictions the defendant can always ask for processing and they can also employ an independent lab to process it.   Most of the time it doesn't because the accused are known by the victim and there isn't any dispute that sexual intercourse took place. It comes down to consent/non-consent and processing a rape kit does not help resolve this dispute in any way whatsoever.   In most cases, the accused is known by the victim. Processing a rape kit isn't needed if the guy admits to having sex with the victim. The rape kit can only help resolve who the rapist was if the assailant is unknown or the accused disputes having sexual contact. It doesn't help in he said/she said cases and is just a waste of resources.  (Edited to clarify wording.)   Backlog aside, as a cop (I assume you actually mean detective since cops police and detectives investigate), tell me what goes into the decision to request rape kit processing vs. not requesting it.   Why? Serious question here.   My cop bro went through it at the academy. In his video they're all laughing. You can't help it. But he said it's a good lesson, exactly for the reasons Jashinist said below. He said he never wants to go through that again.   Shit, that's bad reddit form on my part. I gotta get it off his phone...    Damn, that sucks.   My bro is a cop and he had to go through this at the academy. His video is fucking hilarious.   Synthetic oil is not actually synthesized. It has its base in crude oil from the ground, just like conventional oil. It just has been refined to a more pure product.  Edit: Adding an [explanation](https://mobiloil.com/en/article/car-maintenance/learn-about-motor-oil-facts/synthetic-oil-vs-conventional-oil) from Mobil.   For a quick primer, listen to [this podcast](http://backstoryradio.org/shows/body-politics-a-history-of-health-care/) from Backstory With the American History Guys. They are 3 professors of American history and they talk about how the whole idea of health insurance got started, how it evolved to be employer-based in the U.S. (you would never guess) and why it's different than the European model.   Yeah the COBRA law was a step in the right direction, as long as you could maintain your coverage. If you let it lapse then you got screwed. If you just lost your job and your prospects are pretty dim, wouldn't you understand it if somebody decided to let their health insurance lapse in order to keep their mortgage and house a few more months?   Yes, that's right.   But you'd still have to pay the premiums for that gap year, of course.   What hospitals are cutting budgets? Other than VA hospitals, I actually haven't ever heard of that.   I'm a self-employed 45 year old and I pay $450 per month for health   dental for just myself. It's an 80/20 plan (I pay 20%) with a $2000 deductible. It's a "Camry" plan.   [Top grossing for-profit hospitals](http://www.beckershospitalreview.com/lists/50-top-grossing-for-profit-hospitals-2014.html) in the U.S.  Some hospitals are [corporations with shareholders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hospital_Corporation_of_America). Others are non-profit. At non-profit University of Pittsburgh Hospital, the CEO makes $6 Million a year.  [Why non-profit hospitals are the most profitable hospitals in the U.S.](http://www.arbiternews.com/2014/04/08/why-nonprofits-are-the-most-profitable-hospitals-in-the-us/)   I had one medical bill that was only partially paid due to a insurance screw up and it was on my credit report. I only found out about 5 years later (I don't apply for loans very often). I saw it on the report and called the collection agency to find out what it was. They told me who it originally was with (for some lab tests, if I recall). Funny thing is that after I called them, they started calling me and pestering me to pay the bill. I told them that I had insurance at the time and told them to take it up with them. This went on for months.   And prior to the ACA law ("Obamacare") your chronic condition could prevent you from even getting insurance. Cancer survivors in remission were frequently turned down if/when they lost their job and their group insurance. And if you had a chronic medical problem and a potential employer found out, it does sometimes affect their decision whether to hire you because it will raise their insurance costs. This is especially true for small companies whose premiums can jump wildly if you get one or two employees who are big health care users.   Hospitals also use this to maintain their tax-exempt status. Tax exempt hospitals "donate" about 1% to 2% of their services. They say "donate" but most of it is just uncollectible debt. But it's apparently enough to allow them to not have to pay taxes on their profits.   If you had absolutely zero assets then maybe you won't have to pay. But if you had a house, maybe a little bit of savings, all of that could get wiped out since your bills would be sent to collections who would start legal proceedings on that debt. The only you'll have going for you is that debtors prisons have been outlawed.  In the UK you will get prescribed painkillers and post-surgical rehab treatment that helps you recover faster, makes sure you can get around your house or apartment, and stuff like walkers and shower chairs in case you have trouble standing up or walking. In the US if you don't have insurance you have to pay full price for your drugs, any needed equipment and people to help you rehab so you can get back to work.  The US is a totally backward barbarian society. But we're not the only ones. There's Rwanda, Uganda, El Salvador....   I remember reading a long time ago about a Japanese guy who was unlucky enough to be caught in both the Hiroshima and Nagasaki detonations, very close to ground zero. After recovering he lived a long life with apparently not much side effect. I'll see if I can find a link....  Edit:  [Tsutomu Yamaguchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsutomu_Yamaguchi) lived a relatively healthy life and died in 2010 at the age of 93 from stomach cancer.   Point taken.      If I ever meet the engineer who came up with the idea of counting the number of separation lines instead of the number of sections, I'll tattoo KISS on his ass.  	84

 This assumes that demand stays the same even though labor wages is demand.   Keep in mind, Japan is automating their labor force. Wages is demand.   Some Businesses will shut down because demand has fallen.   It is very team based and hard work for low reward of a goal or even a TIE according those people    Any sports that rewards players for receiving an excessive force/battle/combat will have floppers.   hockey is a very expensive sport for people to play.   No. it is those big government Democrats and Obama, who want to keep the Patriot Act and NSA intact.   Because you know... GOP is for freedom and limited government.  Vote for Jeb Bush! ;)   Somehow the NSA and Patriot Act is more important than Environmental Issues and Climate Change.    Wanted to repeal the 1964 Civil Rights Act at one time.  Wanted to deregulate the EPA  Wanted to disarm the FDA   What are you talking about?   Outsourcing is good for the economy because we can focus on service and high-tech jobs. Then, we need to automate those as well. :)   It should be obvious by now that big businesses are the only ones who truly have the access to world markets.       then we should outsource the entire service industry to machines.    If the entire labor source is gone, then demand should should also be gone.    To have full comparative advantage, we should outsource the entire manufacturing industry overseas.   How will the U.S. Control the most important economic regions if trade enables all countries to mutually cooperate with each other? Trade has no big winners.   How exactly this freetrade deal going to counter China, if we already do trade with China, but not in a formal agreement to eliminate tariffs on each other to 0%. We already get a lot of their imports yet China still maintains a higher tariff on us than our tariff on Chinese goods? Freetrade tries to makes all prices and wages in the world close to world equilibrium.   What is not to say that we also manipulate our currency as well?   No it won't. Free-Trade lifts all boats. Consumers can buy stuff at a cheaper price. Without Trade, your goods will cost a lot more and you will have less choices to choose from. That is why the agreement is secret, so we have to get the best trade offer out there, which lifts all boats overall. There are no losers and trade deficits don't matter because..... you just imported more goods than you export, which means consumers are having a lot of choices.   Back in the 1920s, when manufacturing jobs were present, how come nobody wanted blacksmithing jobs back? Why make stuff for our own usage when we can just get items from other places for cheap? We need to depend on other growing economies for our growth. :)      If you agree to buy a lot of my big business products and natural resources, I will buy your bridge for cheaper than the other guy. But don't tell the other guy, okay?    My only hope to get Polster into my starting lineup is to hope Ishizaki, Davies, or Woodberry doesn't play in the next game.... .   Trade Agreements are secret so American Businesses and Consumers can get the best trade deal offer. If we open it up, then we might lose in a freetrade deal that lifts all boats because there would be too many amendments and hidden secrets exposed.      Really annoying people. Like sure spend $80 on a box and destroy everything lol   I have researched a lot of strange ideology combinations that try to appear "moderate" like:  Liberal Conservative, Progressive Conservative, Compassionate Conservative, Third Way Liberals, and Conservative Liberals  I know there is a slight difference between each one, but do they fit in centrism?    Ya or you can run 3 cores and 1 machine dup, but have a card where you discard a card.   Personally, it is good to have cyber valleys on the field to stall, but they aren't "cyber dragon".   It really depends though. If you have 3 cores and 1 machine dup, what happens if you already used 3 cores, you would need a card that has discard eff?   You don't need 3 Power Bonds because you will probably won't fusion summon 3 times. Why have 2 machine dups, if there isn't 2 targets for it? You don't want to dead draw it.    Will some of the lore will be altered or not exist?    You provide one team. how about QPR, Wigan, etc? Those teams enter the EPL and then get relegated. There are more teams that get relegated than teams who compete well in the EPL. In a perfect world, each EPL team wins the league every 20 years (assuming no relegation). Of course, we know that it is impossible, since no league in any sport is that competitive. We see the same to similar top tier teams in the top nearly every year and it lasts for decades.      Why is nobody talking about the trade deficit ? has freetrade helped to decrease our current trade deficit or do trade deficits don't matter since trade lifts all boats?   Simple. American small businesses don't have the massive world outreach. Foreigners don't know if there is a small business in America who sells similar items to an American Big Business. A small business can't really set up shop or manufacturing place in a foreign company as easily.   Agricultural jobs were never middle class. They have always been low wage and in need of subsidizes.    It will happen once every country engages in near freetrade. Then everything is at world equilibrium in prices and wages.   it is weird though because usually deficits of any kind is bad in mathematical perspective, but trade deficits is fine according to current economic thinking. As long as you engage in trade, then it lifts all boats.   Yes that also works but it is not competitive since the good players on the bottom teams leave the team.    The reason is because the top flight teams want to stay in the top flight. Very good players always want to go to the best team, so it inherently favors the top teams. What is the point of joining a bottom tier premier league team, if they will be relegated in the future?   people don't know that taxation on limited vertical supply with a diagonal demand curve makes the consumers pay nearly all the tax.   Watch Nelson Rockefeller's speech to the GOP national convention in 1964. Some of his remarks can be applied to today's time era.   I love my state and my constituents, but I hate your politicians and your interests.  Low Approval Rating of Congress, yet nearly 90%+ incumbency.    Who cares. Just agree with it because..... it is a freetrade agreement. Trade = Good Economics :)  - Nearly Every Economist, Business leader, Conservative Republicans, and Pro-Trade Democrats.   Rockefeller Republicans and Progressive/Liberal Republicans would like to have a word with you. lol     Nelson Rockefeller (the moderate Rockefeller Republicans were booed by the Goldwater Conservatives in the 1964 GOP National Convention), Dwight Eisenhower (desegregated the Southern Schools from Conservative Dixicrats + continued the New Deal + warned about the military industrial complex), Richard Nixon (who enacted the EPA and basically was Keynesian in economics), Teddy Roosevelt (one of the leaders of the progressive movement), and Abraham Lincoln (freed the slaves and opposed the States Rights Movement + Supported the idea of the federal government assistance in building railroads) would be shocked at how conservative and southern/rural the Republican Party currently is.   Also, Bob Dole stated, "I thought I was a conservative, but weve got some in Congress now who are so far right theyre about to fall out of the Capitol."  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/04/23/bob-dole-says-the-republican-party-is-way-more-conservative-than-it-was-even-20-years-ago-hes-right/   Yep. :D    Ya. It is so impossible to summon this out except from a cyber dragon nova deck.    Somewhat...but it also tells us that teams are unwilling to play starting players often during double game weeks, so they can rest players, etc   barbaroid the ultimate battle machine    Exactly, Rockefeller denounced extremism from both the left and right and was booed because of that.   LOL Both parties had liberal, moderate, and conservative wings that battled each other out for control. Those factions were very regional. progressive republicans and southern democrats found their true ideological homes now.   But freetrade benefits the entire economy overall say economists and business leaders. Think about the cheap prices that we get in goods and think of the markets that you wouldn't have without trade such as coffee, Japanese cars, and Accessories from the Middle East. Do Americans want to pay higher prices for goods that they consume today? Probably not. tariffs are bad.   If people back then had a 90% marginal income tax rate and people say that the effective tax rate was much lower.....and if today people's marginal income tax rate is around 30 to 40%, but the effective tax rate can reach 0% for some people, Wouldn't the effective tax rate back then be higher than today's effective tax rate?   The effective tax rate back then would still be higher than the effective tax rate today.    However, I only have 3 defenders. Should I place Bedell on the team and put Davies and Polster on the bench, so if Polster gets 1 point, then I could just replace Bedell with Davies. If Polster gets more than 4 points, He will be subbed into Bedell, but do I get to replace Woodberry with Davies?    I never really tried out this tactic, but good to know. :D Thanks!   :|   I had Rolfe earlier in the weeks prior.    Why three Artifact Sanctums, but only 2 Artifacts?  Batteryman Industrial Strength is more of a side-deck card against slower decks. It is a dead draw, if you don't have an engine to throw thunder cards into the grave. I recommend Thunder Dragons.+ 1 Hand Destruction than 2 Cardcar Ds  You could add Abyss Stungray, but it is trap monster, level 5, Thunder      Like you said. Drei's effect is manual and doesn't say that you use in another player's turn.    Firebirds is an amazing name   Search "pojo batteryman guide" on google and find the most recent thread. :)   Effects that have either player's turn is quick play while manual is spell speed 1   he is probably a pawn from the fusion dimension. After all, he noticed cuz summoning and commented with a strange tone. Plus, he has purple stuff, which is fusion dimension stuff.   I have a feeling that the guy with purple hair at the end is from the fusion dimension.    I might consider voting for Kasich for President, but given that he will choose the next Supreme Court Justice....Probably not.    Kasich is one of the most decent Republican candidates out of the ones listed.  Rubio and Paul are semi-okay in my opinion, but not preferred.       Ishizaki :)   I am just stating the position of people with academic knowledge in economics and business. I don't necessary agree with them, but I do agree with Reich's view on some concerning aspects.    Mexico, where the USA claims that their economy has gotten better, but illegal immigration still is a problem from there.    Ya, but I personally don't believe all the "talking points" of pro-free-trade in full. Yes, they do have a point, but there are lots of anti-freetrade points as well.    http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus  Include Healthcare Spending, Environmental Cleanup, Research, Housing, etc   It doesn't make sense at the moment because the current transit and spread of development isn't focused on rail nor public transit, but rather cars. Keep in mind, you can't expand roads within cities and highways can't be expanded if development is already there, so there should be other modes of transit, if cities don't want massive congestion problems during rush-hour.    "i think the congestion of highways has far more to do with an increased supply of motor vehicles as opposed to increased supply of highways"   Cars are unusable, if nobody rides them. If the overall economy gains more cars, not everybody is using all the cars. Transportation is the act of people going from place to place. Once highways are more open, congestion and time travel would be less, which in turn decreases usage of commuter rail + public transit, which moves those people onto the highways. That is induced demand. There is no point in public transit because the lifestyle is already revolved around cars. Yes, if you live in an area with population not growing and build bigger highways, yes there will be less congestion.    Infrastructure spending is necessary in any urban area. without it, you will have heavy sprawl with 8 lane highways one way in some highways in Georgia. Plus, you still have traffic+congestion from induced demand, so you would need to build even more lanes and roads.    Building more Highways causes induced demand, which will keep them congested, if population continues to grow. Also, highways and roads take up more space than train tracks.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand   Tax Cuts, Loans for Businesses, Subsidizes, Unemployment benefits, Education Loans, Education Spending, Infrastructure Spending, etc   They just point to an easier shift for workers to go into better "industries", lower prices of goods for consumers, businesses doing well, developing countries gaining better living standards.   There are no losers in free-trade in the overall perspective according to people with knowledge on trade economics.   http://projects.nytimes.com/44th_president/stimulus     Yes. The same applies for military spending for soldiers. Healthcare spending for doctors. Subsidizes for Businesses. Tax Cuts for Taxpayers.   about around 40-110 billion dollars out of the 800 billion dollars went to infrastructure. This is little compared to the 1 trillion dollars+ we actually need.   because the stimulus was 1/3 tax cuts. Infrastructure was only up to 100 billion of the 800 billion allocated for the stimulus. You need to do research on the stimulus.    The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also supports it as well even though they were against it decades ago.   Also, Some Highways there are 8 lanes on both sides and both are still congested during rush hour.    then supports and votes for anti-pork barrel projects, wasteful spending, abolishing gas tax, etc politicians. The cycle continues.   Obama also wants us to get out of our cars by discouraging car usage. Thanks Obama!   This is generally a problem in the south, but also in Michigan with regards to the gas tax increase. they don't want money spent on public transit but rather on just roads and highway expansions.    It was only around 40 to 100 billion dollars of the 800 billion allocated for the stimulus.   Laguardia airport, Amtrak, Public transit in cities not in the Northeast, west coast, and sections of the Midwest    Cost too much. Citizens vote down any gas tax hike. Budget deficits. Some view infrastructure as pork barrel spending. Some blame inefficient government ex: house members on Amtrak   I could honestly see conservatives saying, "Democrats run the cities and manage bad infrastructure. Thus, Democrats create bad infrastructure, while Republicans in rural states have better infrastructure because our roads and highways are paved."   ^^^  Ignoring the fact that infrastructure maintenance and project expansions+modernization costs insane amounts of money.....    What!?!?! You tell me that we should reduce the supply of our defenses? We are #1, so stop trying to make America look weak and broken. ;)  Think about the other countries, when they see America disarming. :|   But people need to be educated in order to get to higher paying jobs such as Engineering. Entry Level Jobs are not a living. :)  If Conservatives used the same logic for military spending, "Soldiers support increased military spending because they benefit from it." Bad.   Joe Biden, Cory Booker, Bernie Sanders, etc   I am pretty sure Rand would want better infrastructure, but I believe that he would side more on the property rights side, when the government needs to reorganize the land for infrastructure projects. Also, he would be more pro-privatization. For example, Amtrak would be fully privatized.    Yes, but I don't think Congress will pass such a plan in the near future. :\   I bet that they would even go as far to say "Military = Socialism"    Reducing the Gas Tax would reduce revenues for the Highway Trust Fund. but....  The real question is whether a reduction in the gas tax will encourage more people on cars traveling or not. Elasticity question.     I posted this because of the video. I feel like the article is pretty straightforward from what we have heard for months now.

Personally, I wished Yuya's voice was similar to that of Jaden, since at the moment, it does sound a bit annoying, but I can get used to it. Gong is what throws me off. Like....Texan Voice? LOL   Yuya's, Gong's, and Skip's voice don't really match. Why is Gong a Texan?   Why do the voices sound so strange?   Yet Japan still manufactures cars for its own citizens and for export. Something that American manufacturing can't seem to do.   Seattle and New England's defense are pretty decent so I don't really expect him to get a lot of points, but expect the unexpected lol  	108
             Almost missed that crazy LSP!   I don't post climate/env stuff on the weekends because the newsletters don't go out on the weekends. Back when they went out, I posted on the weekends. (I think you can see that in my old posts in /r/CHART_BOT but it might've been before that so no guarantees.)   And if the trackers included my activity in private (karmawhore-only) subreddits where you trolly fanboys can't follow me, things would look a bit different...  Anyway, I'm off to the mermaid parade now, since it's practically in my back yard. Have fun chasing archie around in circles!    [DIDN'T CATCH THAT, WHAT?](http://i.imgur.com/WZ9Cjyu.png)   [I'm gonna get you!](http://i.imgur.com/VzEKQEb.gif)   [I DON'T KNOW WHY WE'RE YELLING!](http://i.imgur.com/2ubASe9.png)                                                                  Please refrain from using colloquial names, as it can cause confusion. If you'd like, resubmit with either Dihydrogen Monoxide or 'hydroxyl acid' in the title instead.    lol, daily mail   Whereas when you look at any group disputing climate change, 100% of the funding is from fossil fuel groups or dark money, aka nonprofit money laundering for the Kochs. And good luck finding their funding info, because they sure don't make it as easy to find as AAAS.   (And a note, that funding was only for the "What We Know" project, not the AAAS as a whole.)    Well if you want to take that path, then it should be pretty obvious-who is more likely to be right, and who is more likely to be bought off, the group that consists of 97% of the scientists in the field, who get public grants for research (meaning they don't get to pocket the money) and who are delivering a message no one wants to hear in peer-reviewed journals for the past 100 years, or the group of just 3%, who get private funding from fossil fuel companies (meaning they do get to pocket money) and are delivering a message that fossil fuel companies want to put out, and whose work rarely appears in peer-reviewed journals and when they do are quickly and thoroughly debunked.   So you can either believe that nearly every single one the world's climate scientists at every legitimate institution and every university have been bought, or that a small handful of scientists with otherwise dead-end careers have been bought.  That said, I'd recommend you take a look at the science. There are a number of fairly straightforward explainers from what should be credible sources- The A[merican Association for the Advancement of Science](http://whatweknow.aaas.org/), the group that puts out the #1 peer-reviewed journal, Science and is one of the oldest and most prestigious academic institutions ever is a good place to start. Then there's the [National Climate Assessment](http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/), which uses information and scientists from the various government scientific agencies, and was started by Bush to explain the state of climate science.  Then [there's the IPCC](http://ipcc.ch/), which is the international look at the state of the science, and has been approved by delegates from every country (including petrostates like Saudi Arabia. So even Saudis agree that what's there is the truth.)    http://w2.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/encyclicals/documents/papa-francesco_20150524_enciclica-laudato-si.html   lol, so you're blaming the fact that deniers circlejerk misleading Antarctic sea ice figures on the study authors.   I bet deniers would also get questions about the rate of warming wrong. I also bet they'd get questions about how much warming is caused by man wrong too!   But thanks for confirming that TP'ers/deniers come from a position of factual inaccuracy.

Given that climate is the issue at hand, this one is clearly more relevant than Kahan.    Me either, that's why I posted coverage of a peer-reviewed paper.    Past studies like that one deal with general science literacy. This is specific to climate science, therefore much more relevant.

But I know a lot about the interviews and how recruiters think.  Like a previous poster said, smile. Always smile. Don't talk about how much you love Disneyland. They don't care who your favorite character is or how many times you've been. When they ask you your number one concern, it is ALWAYS safety. Think about how the four keys of Disneyland (Safety, Courtesy, Show, Efficiency) affect your role and answer the questions in that way. You're not supposed to know those keys right now so don't talk about knowing them but casually mentioning them would be prime (i.e. "I recognize that to be a great CM, I have to be courteous to all guests when performing my role." That's another one: don't forget to think of yourself when answering questions as a part of a show, a cast member with a role.  That's about it.

Second pick YOU FUCK   And the only ones without a Superbowl ring ;) Edit: I have more downvotes than the Eagles do Superbowl Rings MUAHAHAHAHA   FINE, Let the rock off, BEGIN HAHAHAHAHHA   Not my tempo   So Santana did deflate those balls   Klaus thinks this is 2K15 and always tried to get the steal but it always leads to a foul   Damn he was playing Disneyland, So method   This movie is almost guaranteed to be pushed back to January or February    I think I got something in my teeth, could you get it out for me?   Yeah I guess so, still sucks gargantuan monkey nuts   Very true, however I just don't want to see RG3 die   Sooo are we in agreement that the league hates RG3?   RGIII's first game will be against the Dolphins, a defense consisting of Suh and Wake......are you fucking kidding me.   And RGIII has to play this defense week 1.....fuck   Hell throw in Meechum and we can have a Meechsome   Just Forget about Dre   End of watch   Big Fat liar    Twilight      Ehhhh 3 years ago is awhile ago, Sabotage was shit and he wasn't the lead or anything, Avatar 2 I guess will have him back so there is that but I doubt it will cause a resurgence of his career.   Oh no, we're getting into to the hate circlejerk for a popular movie, not saying you're circlejerking though, however this is the post that will lead to "Am I the only who hated Mad Max Fury Road?" And then "Why Mad Max gave me HIV"  	32
 Jesus Christ! If you want to be an asshole about this whole thing then lets take a look at your beautiful very polite post we have here. Not a shred of reasoning to disprove anything. I thought this was a safe place with knowledgeable individuals. Put down the bong? Really? All I was doing was throwing a theory out there and hoping for intelligent people to explain why this definitively could not work because I sincerely want to know. None of which you addressed. like the idea of that dark matter and black holes may be linked which is probably non-since but I guess ideas (even exotic ones) are worthless to you. I have studied astrophysics, graduated, and somehow I still manage to not be a total dick. I just wanted to throw out a crazy idea that I wanted others to disproof and talk about. After all isn't that the basis of new ideas? Thank you for your very awesome post that will surly incurage me to be less open minded. Much apreciated   ^Great ^^white ^^^bufflo   Does anyone out there have any ideas what might be in the Cincinnati box in the Hot Tub Time Machine movies? I just watched the second one and they mention the box a lot more than the first movie but still no clues to whats in it. If you haven't seen the second movie please still give some ideas because like I said you know just as much about the box even if you haven't seen the second movie. I read that the writers of the films may be trying to make another movie that starts off with this mystery or is based around it but I got the impression at the end of the second movie that they won't be making anymore. Please comment if you have any knowledge about this as well. Remember that the Cincinnati box is a shoe box so whatever it contains must fit in it (or does it?) I'm curious what we can come up with.   Thats badass then. Nice work. also dig the gauges    why no love here? I think this is badass. Is your hair really green?      Came here to say just that!   Thanks a lot man. I appreciate you taking the time to help me out   How would I wire up a balancer circuit to my charger. Most R/C battery's have a wire you just plug into the charger? Any Idea?   Thanks for the info, I understand all those terms. I have a R/C car battery charger that charges every kind of battery and has build in voltage protection and lots of other features. Would that work as a PCM. Im not an idiot. Its not like im plugging the thing into a wall socket. I have my charger set to charge 2 cells with the combined MAh of both battery's. Now would that work?  This is what I have... http://i.ebayimg.com/images/i/131355448556-0-1/s-l1000.jpg    [Here is a pic] (http://i.imgur.com/SGMgzxp.jpg?1)   So I have 2 battery's vertical in there battery sled. One battery with its positive side at the top and the other with its negative side at the top. At the bottom there is a wire connecting the two. If I connect a battery charger to the top of the 2 battery's will they both charge equally? or do I need some type of balancer. These are li-ion batterys.  Thanks in advance if anyone can give me the answer!   I was expecting a bit more with the decent album cover and then... Holy shit this is absolute garbage.         Well thank you fellow vapor! I'm a perfectionist and have a lot of patience. That's the key to clean builds. Taking your time and not rushing things.      Oh I see. For me my comfort zone is 0.2 to 0.6 so those lower ohms for me are on the other end of the spectrum of this build. Didn't mean to go 101 on you haha   Compared to harsh hot builds that give you great clouds but sacrifice on flavor and smoothness of the vape. This build gives great flavor with a smooth vape but im not blowing huge clouds.    Thank you, I wrapped them around a micro screw driver that's the same diameter as a .093 (42) drill bit.      nice. I do the same. I have 2 vapes, my RBA for the clouds and then my Evod2 for the taste and just to sit and puff all night on. The duel must really take the ohms down. But your also using 24 gauge so maybe its mostly that.   Nice build! Can you tell me if the juice flavors are harsh or weak with that kind of cloud and low ohms?   Its not rocket science, its VAPE SCIENCE! and yea dont be a dick. There is a lot to building coils when you want to know what your doing. But if you want to just loop a wire and stick it in a tank then, yea its not hard.   Thanks for clarifying that for me.   Thank you for taking the time and writing that up. Its really what I was looking for. My knowledge before vapeing was R/C stuff so I know a lot about Battery safety, wattage, voltage, ext. but terms like Resistance, and Ohms are new terms to me. I am reading all about ohms law right now but would you (or someone else) explain Resistance to me? What aspect of vaping does Resistance effect? Flavor? vape? Heat?   Edit: Sweetleef took care of it. Thanks!   1. What is the advantages/disadvantages between tight wound coils and spread out coils. 2. How does the amount of wraps effect heat, vape, ext... (Is is more wraps less heat?) Im looking for a simplified answer even though I know this is a very large question. 3. What is the effect that larger wraps (aka macro coils)and smaller wraps (nano) produce?  Ive been looking for answers to these questions and its hard to come by straight forward answers because I know its not a easy question, but if anyone can simplify these answers I would REALLY appreciate it. Thanks guys!   Find a corner, go under a blanket maybe?, yea a car, maybe the floor in a good spot. I'm sure you can find a spot. A good way to test is to softly let some vape out your mouth and see how it moves. If it just kinda lingers thats fine but if it moves find somewhere else.     You would be amazed of how little air flow can REALLY effect vape smoke. Even when I blow rings over my laptop they dissipate fast because of the computer fan even though it blows down on the desk. My advice is find an area with no air flow and give it a go. Remember to get the smoke in your mouth not your lungs and not to push them out to hard. I use a combo of clicking my jaw a bit and a little push with my tong. Good luck.   Those are awesome. So many ideas I got from them. Thank you!       Reminds me of that true life episode *Im a rap artist* (or some name like that) where the kid dresses like hes already a rapper and thinks hes going to get a huge record deal then they show him at a show and theres like 8 people there and hes so bad is hard to watch.   FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! NOOOOOO   HAHA, Is that on a piece of printer paper?!   That's what I thought and always known. Thanks.   I also read somewhere that Suboxone added the Naloxone to its recipe just so they could patent the name because just bup was taken by the brand subutex and that bup itself is the primary blocker and the low dose of the Naloxone doesnt do much at all. If what I read is right then suboxone and subutex block opiates the same way and you can't feel a p30 on eather. Please help me guys cause I thought this was common knowlage but my friend thinks hes 100% sure.   My friend swears up and down that you can take subutex and do a p30 right after and feel both of the drugs. Anyone have any input on this? Is he right? I thought the Buprenorphine was what does most of the blocking and Subutex is just Bup. I need some advice cause that would be awesome if my friend was right but I dont want to chance it without knowing.   man, its an honor. (Hope your not just messing with us.) I'm going to buy a print off that site you provided. I didn't realize you went through so many images. How did you have your camera setup? was it on a timer? did you take a picture every half hour even at night? (wouldn't that be a waste?) just curious, thanks!   The Earth is breathing.   Dude... Whoa    I did the same. And thanks for the upvote!         I've used a box filled with an old sweatshirt, old jeans, and duct tape to hold it together and my .22 pellet rifle wont go all the way through. Pretty simple to make. I'm sure you can figure something out.   This was really interesting to listen too.      If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite. For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro' narrow chinks of his cavern. -William Blake   	46
 Honestly, if you are still not like sub 1:00 to like sub40 consistently, the cube wont matter. I suggest getting a decent cheap cube on ebay, like a 5-10 dollar. I just checked canada ebay and there are a few decent ones. The important thing is learning all of PLL and OLL, and getting fast at F2L. I used a broken in rubiks brand with lube until I was sub 45 consistently. Then I switched to a zhanchi and have had it for a while.    Can we talk about this for a second? Why are M and E slices on the secondary faces? Why just those two? Why couldnt everything just be relative to RUF? This always bothered me but I just learned it "cuz thats the way it is."   I used his page to learn. It is a wonderful resource. Also check out his algorithm changer if you try to make your own algs using cube explorer or something. And if I remember correctly, he has a eoline scrambler that you can input the number of bad edges you want and it will return scrambles for that.   And for last layer stuff, also check out [petrus' s site.]( http://lar5.com/cube/index.html) The last layer stuff and the last block stuff is relevant, as well as subsets of the general block building stuff. He has a neat 2-alg 1 look LL idea.   E: cant find the EOline scrambler that I mentioned, but I found this on the speedsolving wiki: [eoline solver]( http://rubiks-cube.c0.pl/inne/eoline.html). I havent looked at it because Im on my phone though.    I do zz and once you get past eoline, it is blazing fast. I am currently learning COLL and that is comparable to OLL in amount of algs anyways, so if you dont know OLL (which I never learned full OLL either) then this might be an option. Also, COLL is useful if you do K4 on larger cubes or roux or a couple other methods and is a good precursor to full zbll if you wanted to go that route.   Also try roux or petrus. They start out with a lot less structured block building so if you have difficulties with that, ZZ is the way to go. I seriously considered petrus before settling on ZZ. The last half of your solve is similar in petrus and zz anyways. You just orient at a different stage and your first block is more intuitive   EOLine will be the biggest hurdle for you when starting. If you decide to go that route, I suggest taking eoline slow. Dont do eo+line because you will get in the habbit. Just slowly plan out eoline and do it with your eyes closed then check it. After a couple weeks you should be good.    Give me your password and I can find it for you.    If you want to be friends, just be friends. Fuck what everyone else says. And if more comes from it then so be it. Unless you really really want a friendship or dont see her like that. Then establish some ground rules about what is happening and what can happen.    Why though. If you decide to ignore everything everyone said and claim it was a conspiracy, then why? Letting it run its course is enough of a test. A 20 minute outage is not sufficiently a test because plenty of people would not have seen it.    Maybe you can get on tv. Chris hansen has a new show comming out.       People that "made" the months did it a long time ago and kind of estimated. A month is about the length of a lunar cycle, for example. And you will find that a lunar cycle is actually a couple days short of a 30 or 31 day month. But a long time ago it was "close enough."  Also, they used to use seasons for crop growing and didnt need to be dead on. A couple days off was ok. You will find that throughout history, the length of a year, amount of months, and all those details have changed a bit.   The issue comes down to relating a precise system based on astronomical events, and a system that humans use and can remember. It would be confusing if a year was 365.25 days and that was divided into 12 blocks of 30.4 days, etc. Weekends and holidays would be weird every year and stuff like that. So we kinda adapt the traditional stuff with the stuff we know is accurate today, and every couple years adjust the calendar (leap years).  It is possible for us all decide to shift the year and say, have summer start on the 1st of june and stuff like that, and we have shifted the calendar before in human history. But today it would take so much effort to coordinate that between 7 billion people and fix all the software issues that come from it and all that.   So the short answer is: its not aligned because our ancestors didnt align it centuries ago.    TL;DR  I ducked up.  FTFY    Am poor, plz halp   It would further strengthen my disbelief   Thats it?..   Yea, checking your tubes is a 3rd date kind of thing.    My penis is fully erect from this coversation, I'm caressing it just like I would to what would be left of your penis if you were here with me. I can just imagine it, blowing my load on your face. Your stubs (I'd make you an amputee and tun the hole in the stubs into mini anuses, like any good owner would) clawing at my crotch begging for more of my hot mayo. You're searching for something aren't you anon? The reason you're so angry and have one night stands with the wrong people. Once you come with me you'll become a part of me, no wait, an extension of me. I'd do whatever I want and you'd just roll your eyes back into your skull, arch your back and beg for more. Trust me anon you'll love it, they all do.   Actually, I wouldnt be surprised if it was cooler inside now that you mention it.    Brojob!    That would be doing the friend a favor.    Your body yearns for those temptresses, but does your heat? My penis is fully erect from this coversation, I'm caressing it just like I would to what would be left of your penis if you were here with me. I can just imagine it, blowing my load on your face.

Trust me anon you'll love it, they all do.   Eww   Blue. Because red is my favorite color and I always get a red toothbrush, except I didnt this time so I remembered.    Did she like them?   And a couple weeks ago, and a couple more weeks ago, and a year ago like it is done every year, aND OH SHIT I JUST REALIZED MOTHERS DAY IS THIS WEEKEND!! FUCK, I need to get something.    Same thing   I never bought any of that "size matters" crap until my junior year in college. I lived in the dorms with two roommates, David and John. David was a pretty ordinary looking guy, kinda quiet - but John was tall, lean, muscular and (according to him anyway) was hung like a bull. He used to joke about it a lot - even around my girlfriend, Amy. Amy was a sophomore and was petite, shy and somewhat quiet. I didn't like it when John would make his "big dick" comments and jokes around Amy, but she told me she didn't pay any attention to him and truth be told, she really couldn't stand John.  I have a 5.5" dick and with Amy being so petite, it always seemed to do the trick. I was only the third guy she'd ever been with and only her second boyfriend - maybe my guard was just down but who knows.  Anyway, one Friday night, Amy and I were hanging out in my dorm room drinking, smoking some weed and watching TV. David and John had both gone home for the weekend - or so we thought. At about 1AM (Amy and I were pretty toasted by then), John walked in. He'd ended up hanging out with some of his friends off campus and had decided to just drive home in the morning since his parents only lived about an hour and a half away. He could see that Amy and I were both pretty hammered. He grabbed a beer and sat down and we smoked somem more weed with him. Amy was pretty drunk and started giving John shit. John seemed to get a kick out of it and I could see him kinda flirting with Amy. Then I noticed (and hoped that Amy wouldn't) that John wasn't wearing any underwear.  But Amy started massaging my dick through my jeans and being so fucked up, I just laid my head back and enjoyed it - I couldn't believe she was doing that right in front of John! I heard John get up to pass Amy the joint we were smoking and I heard her gasp, long and deep and she suddenly stopped stroking my dick. I opened my eyes and saw John standing righ tin front of Amy with a HUGE fucking bulge in his pants - just inches from her face. The room was so quiet you could have heard a pin drop. He just stood there and I could feel her hand tremble and hear her breathing quicken. when she slowly looked up at him, almost in awe and respect, I could feel my heart start to pound in my chest. Then she softly whispered "ohhhhhhhhhhh" as she gingerly reached up to brush her finger tips across that massive knot in his pants. When she touched it, it throbbed - shit I could see it throb thorugh his pants - Amy just gasped again and looked up at him.  "What?" John asked her and just kinda laughed. Amy did NOT laugh. Instead, she softly asked "can i see it?" John stopped laughing, looked at her very seriously and told her to take it out. Amy never even hesitated - or looked back at me for an "OK" - just just obeyed him and began to open his jeans. I coudl see her nipples rock hard under her t-shirt and I could tell she was practically panting.  She opened his jeans and his big thick dick just fell out...and he had NOT been kidding. That cock was strong, thick, heavy and muscular. The head was a big purple mushroom that sat on top of the thickest shaft i'd ever seen. He was semi-hard and was HUGE compared to me. Amy just gasped and kept whispering "ohmygod..ohmygod...ohmygod". When she wrapped her hand around it, her brow just knotted in disbelief and she almost laughed at how thick he was - her fingers couldn't even touch. John just stood there watching my girlfriend worship his magnificent cock. Slowly shaking her head in disbelief, she two-fisted him - one hand next to the other...and there was STILL a few inches left - and he was getting rock hard, too.  Amy smiled and patted the couch next to her and John sat down, his cock standing straight up. Honestly he had to be almost 10" (judging from the size of Amy's hand). I opened my pants and took my own cock out. Amy took my cock in her left hand and John's in her right - but there was little doubt whose cock was getting more attention. She couldn't take her eyes off his cock and her hand only occasionally stroked my dick...but John's she pumped with long, purposeful strokes until she finally couldn't help herself any longer and knelt in front of him, kissing his cock and rubbing it against her soft pale skin.  She sucked his dick until SHE came - just from sucking him! I stroked the whole time until he pulled her toward him, peeled off her pants (she didnt even make the slightest attempt to stop him) and sat her on his lap, her back to his chest - the two of them right next to me. She just rolled her head back to kiss him as he squeezed her tits through her shirt. Her hands went down and pushed that big cock against her pussy and she groaned so loud when it touched her that I thought people outside would hear.  John's dick was so fucking big that he easily penetrated her from behind with her sitting on his lap. She arched up so she could take as much of it as she could and they started to fuck right there next to me. It shocked me how easily her petite little body accomodated that horse cock of his. John pounded her in positions that i physically CANNOT do for over an hour - I have no idea how many times she came - she was even in tears a few times (though she never once told him to stop).  He asked her if she was on the pill and when she said she was on the patch, he told her that he was going to cum inside of her to mark her - which only made her cum again! when he finally came, he had Amy on her back, her legs shaking violently as they both came together - and true to his word, John dumped his seed deep up inside my girlfriend's pussy right in front of me. But shit - he didn't even lose his damn hard on! They fucked for about another 40 minutes and he came twice more. Amy was a wreck by the time we all went to bed.  I will never forget the look on her face - like she was afraid of him and in love with him all at once - the whole time they fucked. She later told me that there were no words to describe it - it was incredible but even that didn't seem enough. To my knowledge they never fucked again and Amy and I dated for about another year before we finally broke up. I always wondered if she ended up with him or some other big dick guy. But one thing I know for sure - she NEVER fucked me like she did John and the things she said about John - the way she looked at him - and the way she was around him after that night (almost shy and meek) convinced me that a big dick makes a difference.  Amy told me that she "HAD to respect him" even if she didn't like him...and that she almost felt like he "had a right to her". So there ya go.   Why do we care about the button at all? I mean it's an interesting game of keeping the number away from zero, but other than that, this sub is devoid of content. Nothing beyond 6 colors and a timer. Yet why do we care so much about this program which in reality doesn't affect our lives at all?  (btw If you don't like reading, go read the TL;DR at the bottom)  I have watched this sub ever since the day it was born, and it has been interesting seeing the masses get so "excited" about this april fools joke. (Just to be sure I'm not saying that this whole sub isn't *nothing* but an april fools joke, the users have definitely turned this sub into something of meaning for themselves). But there shouldn't be this passion for the button. There is literally no earthly reason for there to be factions of colors and "discrimination" between them. And yet there is a community for it.  This whole brouhaha is very reminiscent of twitch plays pokemon. Yet the difference between twitch plays pokemon and r/thebutton is that watching a character being controlled by thousands of people in a game that almost everyone inputting commands has played is much more compelling to watch and to be apart of than watching a timer. And so the people who were a part of twitch plays pokemon *had* *a* *reason* to sit there and watch the screen. But watching the character get on and jump off a ledge became repetitive. So repetitive in fact that they gave personality to the pokemon (Abby, bird jesus, the false prophet). Those who watched created a religion (Praise helix). They tried to create reasons for why certain things happened (why they looked at the helix fossil so often). They were confronted with a void, and subsequently tried to fill it. And it was wonderful. It was arguably one of the greater internet sensations of this decade. And those who were *in* on it from the beginning had pride in what they were a part of. They felt like they belonged somewhere.  Now, once again we were confronted with something that is community based yet devoid of reliable entertainment. Many recognised this and tried to recreate the magic of TPP. The same thing could be argued for the Orangered/Periwinkle april fools. Hell, this sub was probably inspired by that.   But this isn't TPP. There is no reason to stay in this sub beyond literally watching a timer. It was soon apparent that it was difficult creating any meaningful OC, so we turned to something which worked before, factions/religions. Only this time, it was artificial. It grew too quickly, and was simply too forced to be anything like TPP. But we ignored the elephant in the room. We closed our eyes, put our hands over our ears, and shouted about how much fun this was.  Every person is desperate for a sense of belonging. We want to feel like they are a part of the group. We all want to be accepted. We all want to be able to say something, and have someone else back us up. Some of the actions on this sub can be attributed to this need of acceptance, but can you seriously argue that this many religions and factions can be created so quickly? For something that is so meaningless?   This whole sub is a circlejerk. Just social masturbation about how awesome we all are for choosing to take sides over pressing the button. We are all self aware about this situation. No one is seriously thinking that red's are better than purple's. They just want others to think, "woah those guys are so wacky, they created a whole RELIGION. They are so dedicated for something so meaningless. They are sooooooo interesting and funny".   This whole sub, down to it's very roots, is fake. And by saying that, I'm not saying that greys don't hate purples (not only because it's so freaking obvious), I'm saying that the very reason for typing in the words "filthy pusher" isn't *because* of the community. The people who type in "filthy pusher" are trying to *create* a community. They are trying to create a community that wouldn't have ever come about on its own. That is what is fake about all this. Its kind of sad in a way.  This sub is great as an idea, but everyone is so freaking self-aware of what they are doing. I know what this april fools joke was supposed to do. To create divide between people just like the Orangered/Periwinkle did. Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this sub at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of reddit, people had a reason to go on reddit that was much greater than simply bashing the other color.  Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.  TL;DR   **This sub's community is not 'real' in a sense. It has never been honest. People realized that, and forced it in anyway. The only reason why this bastardized community exists is because we all want to be a part of the next TPP or Orangered/Periwinkle.**    So no?    /r/girlswithbigcameras for, um, more things that people do to take , um, *good* photographs. ^^^^^NSFW   Damn, "miss ethiopia 2015" would have been a better title.

The commenters are the ones that are buying this polished turd. You are right that it was forced and the analogy to a polished turd is excellent, but just like gold, a worthless rock, it has value because people give it value.   Once the button runs out, I dont think they would put it in the code for, say, "innitiate the launch sequence" or "send this command to that specific server." That would give it away. There is probably something monitoring it or one of the mods will do something once it runs out. To say that "because the code doesnt give it away, then nothing will happen," is a little bit jumpy.   And how is the button not emotional? The factions wouldnt have formed if someone didnt feel anything about it. Yea we cant vent the same amount of steam as running 4 miles during a soccer game would allow us to, but we still get to vent some. The small victory we get from watching the button survive another day is something. The arguments like this are small football games we play with each other.   You keep saying that the button is not as great as life or sports, and I already said the analogies are stretching on my side, sure. Yea the button is not the next great sport we will watch on payperview, but that doesnt mean that the elements are not there. That doesnt mean that the small victory of a small three pointer is meaningless. You called it meaningless and im saying it isnt. Yea there are way better things we could use as stimuli, but there are also worse.   The button isnt the "next best thing," but it is still "a thing."    Wtf seriously?    You are right that the comparison to life is a gross oversimplification, but I dont agree that the button brings nothing. It brings the excitement of the unknown after the inevitable end when it reaches 0. It brings the conversations like this. It brings the ability to waste time. While it is not as rich as life or other subs in the stimulus it could bring, it still brings some.   The factions that formed and the monitoring and stats that people collect is like a sport. You could argue that basketball or soccer is pointless. You chase ball around trying to complete a menial task like putting something in a net or pressing something. All for what? To affect a counter? And we do it over and over again and people devote their lives to it? People get so good at it we pay them millions to do it.   While button pressing doesnt require the skill of a pro athlete, back in the day sports werent as organized or at the high level we are now. The button is like the birth of a new sport or religion and its still forced, disorganized, and sloppy. It looks pointless from the outside like it looks pointless for 22 guys to run around with a ball.   The beauty of this all is that it shows that humans can take nothing and make a sport out of it. In the quest for entertainment, we can formalize any simple task and make rules and follow it all seriously like we have the button. Beerpong, football, hopscotch,  writing, are all simple tasks that we make complex rules (or in some cases not so complex) and follow and play professionally or at an amateur level just for entertainment. And beautiful things come out of it.   The slight bit of adrenaline that we get from pressing the button is comparable to the adrenaline from racing. The competive nature that came out when factions formed is not unlike fans following different teams.   Life can provide many stimuli, and the button is one of them.    Who is to decide what has a point? The point of a thing is the reason its users give it. You could attempt to use the same logic to diminish cell phones, the internet, or life itself.   What is the point of life? We are born cold, crying and naked, then the majority of us struggle every day, and we all die in the end. The whole process would be much easier if we all died now in the same way that the button would be much easier if we all ignored it.   But what is the fun in that?  I keep working a 9-5 and doing what I do, despite the inevitably of it all, because occasionally I derive pleasure from the flowers or from the sun or from my frend's laughter. We continue to come to the sub because we derive pleasure from the mindless clicking and the community and factions and inside jokes.  I respect your opinion even though I disagree and I do think it is awesome that you are sticking around and replying even though everyone agrees with you. But the button and its pointlessness is an extension of reddit and its pointlessness, and of the pointless inevitable nature of life in general.   If anything, this discussion has made me realize how much deeper the button really is.    And there are a bunch of people that enjoy this site without the button. Whats the point?   Some people enjoy being karmawhores, and some people enjoy pressing buttons. The preference of others (on how they enjoy a site) does not diminish the way other people use the site (especially when so many use it in those ways).   I completely agree with you. I changed the post into a karma copypasta in my other reply to show how OP's ideas can relate to anything. Im from the United states so let me drop another example. When we were a young colony, everyone laughed at the rebellion and the "cute little colony" actin' up. You could say it wasnt a real thing, it certainly wasnt a "real" country yet. But in a way it was a thing because the group of people, the founding fathers, everyone that lived here, wanted it to be a real thing. They made their own laws, own states, own rules and traditions. And after a while it became a thing.   We make new subs all the time. The need to belong aside, a sub isnt any less of a sub than a default because it is new. If there is a community that contributes, then it is a real thing. A "circlejerk" isnt any less real because it is a circle jerk. However rushed or forced it may be, close to a million random people have come together to press the button, and millions more have come to form a community and everything that comes with it.   The factions and silly politics, if anything, reinforce how much of a "thing" the button really is.      Why do we care about the karma at all? I mean it's an interesting game of keeping the number away from zero, but other than that, this site is devoid of content. Nothing beyond 600k subs and a counter. Yet why do we care so much about this program which in reality doesn't affect our lives at all?  (btw If you don't like reading, go read the TL;DR at the bottom)  I have watched this site ever since the day it was born, and it has been interesting seeing the masses get so "excited" about this joke. (Just to be sure I'm not saying that this whole site isn't *nothing* but a joke, the users have definitely turned this site into something of meaning for themselves). But there shouldn't be this passion for the karma. There is literally no earthly reason for there to be factions of linkers/commenters and "discrimination" between them. And yet there is a community for it.  This whole brouhaha is very reminiscent of twitch plays pokemon. Yet the difference between twitch plays pokemon and karma is that watching a character being controlled by thousands of people in a game that almost everyone inputting commands has played is much more compelling to watch and to be apart of than watching a counter. And so the people who were a part of twitch plays pokemon *had* *a* *reason* to sit there and watch the screen. But watching the character get on and jump off a ledge became repetitive. So repetitive in fact that they gave personality to the pokemon (Abby, bird jesus, the false prophet). Those who watched created a religion (Praise helix). They tried to create reasons for why certain things happened (why they looked at the helix fossil so often). They were confronted with a void, and subsequently tried to fill it. And it was wonderful. It was arguably one of the greater internet sensations of this decade. And those who were *in* on it from the beginning had pride in what they were a part of. They felt like they belonged somewhere.  Now, once again we were confronted with something that is community based yet devoid of reliable entertainment. Many recognised this and tried to recreate the magic of TPP. The same thing could be argued for the Orangered/Periwinkle april fools. Hell, this site was probably inspired by that.   But this isn't TPP. There is no reason to stay in this site beyond literally watching a counter. It was soon apparent that it was difficult creating any meaningful OC, so we turned to something which worked before, factions/subs. Only this time, it was artificial. It grew too quickly, and was simply too forced to be anything like TPP. But we ignored the elephant in the room. We closed our eyes, put our hands over our ears, and shouted about how much fun getting karma was.  Every person is desperate for a sense of belonging. We want to feel like they are a part of the group. We all want to be accepted. We all want to be able to say something, and have someone else back us up. Some of the actions on this site can be attributed to this need of acceptance, but can you seriously argue that this many subs and factions can be created so quickly? For something that is so meaningless?   This whole site is a circlejerk. Just social masturbation about how awesome we all are for choosing to take sides over shitposting the new queue. We are all self aware about this situation. No one is seriously thinking that linkers's are better than commenters's. They just want others to think, "woah those guys are so wacky, they created a whole RELIGION. They are so dedicated for something so meaningless. They are sooooooo interesting and funny".   This whole site, down to it's very roots, is fake. And by saying that, I'm not saying that commenters don't hate linkers (not only because it's so freaking obvious), I'm saying that the very reason for typing in the words "filthy karmawhore" isn't *because* of the community. The people who type in "filthy karmawhore" are trying to *create* a community. They are trying to create a community that wouldn't have ever come about on its own. That is what is fake about all this. Its kind of sad in a way.  This site is great as an idea, but everyone is so freaking self-aware of what they are doing. I know what this joke was supposed to do. To create divide between people just like the Orangered/Periwinkle did. Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this site at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of the internet, people had a reason to go on the internet that was much greater than simply bashing the other shitposters.  Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.  TL;DR   **This site's community is not 'real' in a sense. It has never been honest. People realized that, and forced it in anyway. The only reason why this bastardized community exists is because we all want to be a part of the next TPP or Orangered/Periwinkle.**     Why do we care about the karma at all?

The people who type in "filthy pusher" are trying to *create* a community. They are trying to create a community that wouldn't have ever come about on its own. That is what is fake about all this. Its kind of sad in a way.  This sub is great as an idea, but everyone is so freaking self-aware of what they are doing. I know what this april fools joke was supposed to do. To create divide between people just like the Orangered/Periwinkle did. Except this time everyone knew how to act, and overemphasized the factions despite there being no reason to be on this sub at all. The Orangered/Periwinkle thing worked because it was the entirety of reddit, people had a reason to go on reddit that was much greater than simply bashing the other color.  Now this may not matter to you, but for me, I really hate it when people try to indirectly steer a topic/community/conversation/idea/etc into a direction it would have never gone to if we all would have just called out the bullshit. Call me cynical, but let things grow naturally on their own.  TL;DR   **This sub's community is not 'real' in a sense. It has never been honest. People realized that, and forced it in anyway. The only reason why this bastardized community exists is because we all want to be a part of the next TPP or Orangered/Periwinkle.**   https://www.reddit.com/r/thebutton/comments/33w8z1/this_sub_has_always_been_chasing_something_it/      I remembered it being only 1 so I looked it up. Its dimensions are 24,00040,000 km east-to-west and 12,00014,000 km north-to-south. Earths Diameter is about 12.7k km so I probably remembered that it was 1 in the North to South direction. Two to three can fit overall as you said.

Im not saying that, im saying that it already popped out. Once it is there, they can either choose to have mods or not have mods. If they dont have mods, they dont make more money. If they do have mods they can make money, and deserve to too. But should they get greedy on that money? Even if they ask for 1%, they will still make more money than before. I dont know where the line should be, but the issue everyone has is that 45% for bethesda is a little bit past the line, wherever the line may be. Especially for something that adds to their game.    Does that mean its fair though? Yea they bring a lot to the table for a modder, but do they bring in 75%? I dont think so. Yea sure they deserve a cut, im not saying the modders should get 100%, but dont be greedy with it. Especially since at the point that the mods are made, valve takes on no more risk. The platform and game are already made at that point. The mod is just like icing on the cake. Valve isnt putting in any dev risk, any time, or any money into bringing mods out. Other than what they already do.   Automod deleted trolla's comments because the cruel humans programmed him to remove any reddot/facebook/twitter links.

But at that voltage, taking into account the resistance of human flesh, not much current will get to you.   When they talk about amps on batteries, they mean the max amp draw or they say amp-hours which is a measure of capacity.   A circuit will draw the amount of current it needs. A gigaohm resistor will not draw much current, but a motor (which is basically a wire coiled up) will draw a lot more. Your flesh has a very high resistance that varies with humidity and other factors,  and if the voltage isnt too high, you wont get that much current through you. Its not like the battery just forces 30A into everything it gets connected to.

That they would have a kid. And of billions of sperm, the one that resulted in you is the one that made it. And we get to have our blip of time in the universe before dying and going back to starstuff to wait for the inevitability of the violent death, or not so violent death, of the universe.

 The author criticizes equating the term 'democratization' with the recent trends in technology or the economy, but the great majority of humanity are much more empowered as consumers than as citizens. A democratic vote was unlikely to have lowered the Confederate flag in S. Carolina, but the prospect of losing a sliver of market share sent Walmart, Amazon, and even Nascar, scurrying into opposition. The Chinese juggernaut does not promise civil rights, it promises more personal consumption, and from this derives legitimacy. Halting the destruction of the biosphere will require both extracting fewer resources and directing much of this into projects of remediation -- the shopping spree must end. This will require a command economy, which is fundamentally in opposition to personal freedom. Will a democratic majority ever freely choose this radical pathway to survival?       Perhaps. the Singularity is already here, and arrived centuries ago, with the emergence of a global civilization. Certainly, all the indicators -- population, resource use, accumulated knowledge -- have been increasing at an accelerating exponential rate for some time. The super-organism has only evolved from primitive to complex; a paper postal system to the telegraph to the internet, is analogous to the evolution of the senses, from taste to sight.   However, as the late Garrett Hardin observed, in the physical world, the longer an exponential process has existed, the less likely it is to continue. Trees do not grow into the stratosphere; collapse can be expected, may be imminent. This is all the more likely because this present Singularity is very stupid super-intelligence. It appears to be running Bostrom's (sic) runaway paper clip factory, relentlessly converting the biosphere and the Earth's crust into Facebook pages and frequent flyer miles.     I saw the film first, and this detracted nothing from my reading of the novel. Burgess offers a darkly comic satire that questions the basis of human morality and how society responds to deviance. Kubrick (as usual) makes a masterful adaptation and despite the passage of forty-odd years, the cinematography, the costumes and sets still evoke a 'future' to me. As to the original ending to the novel, the missing twenty-first chapter, that was deleted from the American edition. I have not read this ending, but from description, I think it would undercut the central point of the story, and would certainly diminish its delightfully cynical conclusion. Its removal, by the American publisher and then by Kubrick, shows the value added by a good editor.    Fasterfind is right. Congress is the equivalent of NCAA basketball or football -- it is farming system for future corporate lobbyists.  Likewise, the executive branch is staffed by lobbyists, who can revolve from the Treasury Dept. to Wall Street with ease. The President is Chief Lobbyist, but must collect his commissions on the backside, as gratuities disguised as 'speaking fees'. Every bright-eyed candidate for student body president is now seeking this ultimate goal. It is the consolation prize that motivates fifteen dwarfs to run for a pair of slots on a Republican ticket, and Donald Trump will work this angle against them. Trump's wealth makes him the only candidate not for hire, and that best illustrates the depth of our corruption.       The financial media are propagandists and carnival shills for the plutocracy. The Greek financial crisis has been given emphasis to promote the imposition of continuing austerity on other distressed social welfare states. In contrast, the approaching Chinese debacle must be ignored, until key players can hedge their losses ahead of the market collapse.   While I agree that nuclear power has never made sense from the EIEO perspective, 438 nuclear plants currently exist and 67 are under construction. Most of the existing reactors are rapidly aging, and governments will incur enormous legacy costs in decommissioning these and disposing of the waste. Debt-burdened, energy-hungry societies are unlikely to meet this challenge, and I believe there is significant danger of a string of Fukushima level events, will can only accelerate the general collapse. Framed in this context, I would think that the Fukushima debacle would be an appropriate topic for debate for this subreddit. In appreciation of the value of this site, I thank you.  	7
 Hey guy/gal. Are you at uni? Also try, "Mindfulness by Mark Williams". Its an audiobook about meditation. I think it will help you A LOT more than yoga and it actually gets prescribed to people with anxiety and depression. The last few chapters are the actual meditations themselves but listen to the whole beginning of the audiobook as it really teaches you why you are feeling bad etc... It's really good!    Did you watch any yet? Thoughts?    I just want to say that a lot of people on this subreddit make a post stating how awful they are feeling and how they feel like they are never going to get better. I'd just like to point out that you deserve a congratulations for even posting about your current problems! Discussing something that a lot of people really don't want to talk about because you want to get it fixed is a first step in itself and something to be proud of! You aren't just lying idly and not attempting to get it solved. You are actually reaching out and putting in work despite feeling so awful. That is honestly one of the most motivating, beautiful things. Literally just saying "fuck you" to anxiety and speaking about it, talking about it, getting help.  So to all those who post asking what they can do to get happy or un-anxious again I just wanted to say that you already started doing it :) Love you all    Also you're brave. You had the nerve to actually talk about something that makes you feel horrifically awful and nearly gives you panic attacks instead of burying it into your conscious!    Also, don't say you want to die. There is so much to live for. You are not back at square one and you can be happy with people. But in order to love others you have to love yourself! Write down (pen on paper) everything that you are proud of doing in a big list. Seriously don't not bother. Just do it. Write down everything you are proud of and that you like about yourself then read it.  I can already think of the first thing for your list. You care. Saying things like "I don't deserve happiness" show that you are a human being who cares that they might have upset others and that's so good because there are so many people who don't.    I've read your post history and you are not at all a horrible person. The problem is, people compare their behind the scenes to other peoples highlight reels. You are a completely normal human being. You are not terrible despite what you think of yourself. I also often consider myself a bad person inside but I say fuck it - As batman said "It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me"  Your "mistakes" are utterly minuscule and you need to learn to love yourself no matter what :)   I'm sorry but there is no way in hell she had anxiety for 2 years and just "learned how to turn it off". This person is toxic to you and you should not let her make you feel bad. You should confront her and tell her that anxiety is a serious illness and if she can't accept you for who you are then she can leave. It may be hard, but in general, ridding yourself of toxic people will make you so much happier in the long run. You need a firm base of supportive and loving people behind you to help you improve and get better. I'm really sorry that this person has said these things to you and I love you :) If you need to talk I'm here :)   Hey! Internet hug :) I'm sorry you feel bad at the moment but one bad episode is not a "setback". You aren't at all back at square one. Just because you have a few bumps on the road up doesn't mean you are going backwards. With all progress you will get "setbacks" where you feel everything has been undone but it simply hasn't. You have a week of success and then one anxious night. Thats a good ratio and something to be proud of :)   It's actually terrifying to imagine you are trying to escape and this dude just spots you and manages to get to your boat at the speed of light.   That was quite beautiful.    Yaaay! I'm so happy :)   	11

And then you top it off with a body picture, that honestly, looks like you belong in a magazine. The only negative thing I can say is that you're too perfect, but that's just being petty at this point, lol.   You are gorgeous. You have an infectious smile, and from what I can tell, your body looks amazing. If anything, you look even cuter post-preggo.   You are absolutely stunning! I love your eyes. You make me feel more beautiful just by looking at you C:   You don't have to tell me twice.  	10

Let him enjoy himself in peace.    To additionally try and quell your disbelief of my story: This was 20 some-odd years ago.  IIRC, ferries out of Hyannis (to Nantucket Island) were halted because of ~20ft swells.  However,  Nantucket Airlines (think the TV show "Wings") was still willing to fly.  The dual prop -as I remember it- sat ~6-8 people behind the 'cockpit' seats.  It was an open cabin, and you could elect to sit up-front next to the pilot if you wanted to.  There was no divider of any kind.  I had never been in an airplane like it before (or since), so I opted to do it (no one else wanted to).  It was fascinating, but I had no idea what I was in for, and had no idea just how precarious the weather in the sky really was.  It scared the crap out of me at the time.  The pilot told me not to touch anything, but I totally had a steering wheel-like device floating back and forth in front of me - doing all the same movements as the pilots one.  Nantucket was awesome.  The weather cleared the following day, and I lived  delusionally like a king for about a week, playing about in the vicinity of some ridiculously rich people.  Bonus story you can choose to believe or not:  Don't disturb nesting seagulls out in Coatue refuge.  They will dive bomb/shit on you!  I got chased down a beach for about a quarter mile before they stopped trying to shit bomb me.  Running top-speed in soft sand dunes is a real PITA.  I didn't know I invaded their space, but they sure didn't care.  I wouldn't even know if you can still go out there like I did back then, but at the time you could take any vehicle out there that had ....  "dunes pass"?  or something like that.  The rich people I was a guest of had one on their old beat-up Jeep Cherokee, and so I went out there at their suggestion.  Note: You have to heavily deflate your tires or you *will* get stuck out there.   I got stuck twice and had to keep deflating as well as use wood blanks that were in the back/trunk (it seemed like excessive deflation, but it was eventually the only thing that worked).  The entry to the dunes/refuge areas had air pumps (and deflation/pressure guages) for [de/re]-inflating your tires when you got went in/out.  Totally weird for a "city boy" like me, but it was an awesome adventure.  I dont know if the above is still possible, but it was absolutely true ~20 years ago.  I took the ferry back to Hyannis when it was over.   I absolutely did, flying to Nantucket Island.  I am originally from Massachusetts, which you can confirm in my post history.   Ahh...  I've looked through your history in order to understand just WTF you are implying here.  You're a white LGBT - so you catch shit from white guys who think your cute and it fries their brains that you don't like them back.

I was tempted to /r/shittytumblrgifs you and -1, but I totally understand what you mean now.  You prolly wanna move once you are old enough.   Its definitely a lifetime memory.

As a TV watcher, I agree with these statements.    *DUN DUN...*   I didn't know we had a grind. I thought we were an autonomous collective.   I took-off in a small dual-prop aircraft in high-winds once.  As soon as the wheel lost tracktion with the runway, we were pushed sideways about 30 feet.  The entire flight (to an island) we had to fly with heavy skew? into the wind to fight the push.  Being a small plane, it felt like we were flying at a 45 degree angle the entire time.  Bonus: Being a small plane, I had the luck of getting to sit up-front with the pilot and got to see everything that was going on really well, and the fight that the pilot had with the plane the entire time.  You can imagine what the landing was like...   coming in, pointing away from the runway at an angle to fight the wind - but moving straight toward it - and really fast.  The pilot wanted ground asap.  As soon as the wheels get traction, the plain swings abruptly straight - like you just got... umm...  I really cant compare it to anything else.  It was the oddest sensation of a big shove with a straighten your shit out attitude attached from mothernature. It was fucking terrifying.  I will never fly under those circumstances again.

I Think the reason why so many Americans, as well as myself, are against the idea of paying the tax because it's non-optional and it's very likely it won't benefit you.  Think about it, if you're a young American who has no real health problems and rarely needs to go to the doctor then why would you want to pay for a service you're most likely never going to need? Or even worse, if you're someone who is struggling to get by paying for things like rent or food, then how are you going to survive when you're now being forced to pay for health insurance?  And then there's the fact that people who have health insurance would never want to switch to national healthcare, think of these peoples mentality's, it goes from "I make money and i'm successful so I can ensure that if I ever get hurt I'll get proper medical care" to "I make money and i'm successful so now I have to pay for other people to get medical care.  Really I think you just need to look at it from all the perspectives you can think of and realize that to a lot of them national healthcare is unappealing and it's not just them being evil and mean.

Brittany Spears.   [IT'S HAPPENING.](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Ron-Paul_Its-Happening1.gif)   Hey guys, so I just fucked up a few minutes ago, lemme explain.  It's 2 in the morning and i'm 16, I have my own room and laptop, it's a simple laptop, a chromebook, but it does what I need it to do. However, I'm also a heavy listener of music and as such have a nice pair of over the ear headphones. So i come into my room, I had just gotten back from using the bathroom after trying to fall asleep for the past four hours, but try as I might I can't sleep.  As I come back into my room I decide that sleep isn't happening so I instead opt to go to grab my computer and surf the web. I begin surfing and after a while I decide to put on some music, I check to make sure my headset is plugged in. Now, my headset has two plugs a USB and an audio/mic cable. I can feel that it's plugged into the USB port but the audio cable isn't plugged in so I quickly fix that, however my chromebook only has one input that works as either a mic port or an audio out port.  I plug in the audio cable, not really looking, and pull up [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IwmYAdgU18) The song starts up and I notice it's a bit quiet, so I bump up the volume on my chromebook until it's at full volume, at this point it's listenable and I'm pleasantly rocking out. About 2 minutes later my dad bursts into the room, yelling at the top of his lungs about how he has work tomorrow and I need to turn that down immediately.  I'm confused for a moment before I look down and notice that... My mic cable was plugged in instead of my audio out cable. Since I had noise cancelling headphones I hadn't noticed them yelling at me to turn it off, and I hadn't noticed that it was so quiet even at max volume because I had those on...  TL;DR: Mix up mic input and audio output cables for my headset and end up blasting Rock music at full volume at 2:00 in the morning.   No, but the plague has already swept across those lands and turned the french into inhuman monsters which are massive bloated walking corpses... These monsters are known only as blobs...

Does this mean I did it wrong and have to re-do the whole thing using the division method, or is there a way I can salvage my map?  BTW. From what I can figure, the problem is that in Inkscape the borders for all the objects overlap, creating problems with the borders.      Sabaton. Especially with the real world maps.

 Seriously though :(   Collin Cowgill   Fair enough; I assumed we were talking career paths since we were talking about Hoiberg and what not. But you're definitely right in that regard.   At least 95% of these college coaches aren't gonna go coach internationally; so for all intents and purposes, they'd jump straight to the NBA from college. Those are the only steps for them.   Ah, interesting. Why not?   Doesn't the way the Big 12 football TV contract is scheduled make it almost impossible for people to leave? I thought it was something like the conference keeps your share of the TV money from wherever you move to if you leave.   I stand corrected on that point, then. Thanks for the research and legwork, have an upvote! Although I think our attendance numbers are somewhat inflated by the fact that we do draw quite a few fans of visiting teams, mostly because SoCal is damn nice to visit. We still draw really well.  Still don't think Arte is a great owner, but I will limit my opinions to the baseball side of things.    Holy shit dude. Slow your roll on the sweeping generalizations.   I could be wrong, read somewhere that the prices had gone up. Admittedly I don't remember what the prices have always been.  And yeah, parking is cheap there for sure comparatively. The point I was making is that the savings in beer prices was redistributed elsewhere. Which I'm doubting now.   Nice! He was a really good fourth outfielder for us, we only let him go cuz of some wonky call-up stuff we had to do with our bullpen. Glad he's playing well   How is JB for you guys? Is he getting playing time? Miss him out here.   Angels fans are at best sharply divided about Moreno. He was the reason we signed Hamilton after telling Torii Hunter (who was beloved here) that we didn't have the money to resign him. He went over the head of our GM to do so, who was pretty frustrated by it. He was also the reason we ran Hamilton out of town for nothing.  We do appreciate his willingness to (EDIT: spend to) win, but the beer price thing was largely a sham. Dropped beer prices and raised parking prices in one swoop haha (EDIT: this point is largely proven wrong below, just don't want to delete it for purposes of continuity/not hiding my mistakes haha).   As well you should, like I said, wasn't trying to say anyone has unrealistic expectations or anything. I just saw some comments wondering how they were doing it, and the cluster luck seems to be a strong contender for explaining it.   I love Logan Forsythe. I live in San Diego, so I go to a fair number of Padres games, and he was always my favorite player on the team. Can't really explain why. He was just awesome. Seemed like he did [stuff like this all the time](http://m.mlb.com/video/v22051069/?game_pk=318560) (he hit a walkoff HR in that game too). Love seeing him thrive for you guys.   Despite Tim McCarver's failings, I will always be impressed with the way he called exactly what was gonna happen.   Gotta be the last day of the 2011 season. [For reference, or just rewatch it again because it's amazing.](http://m.mlb.com/video/v19789807/?query=2011%2Bgame%2B162)   This is why you always stay til the end. That's so awesome haha   I do! This is an awesome streak   I stand corrected   First off, not trying to hate, I love that the Twins are playing so well! So fun to see newfound success, especially in the Central, where it's been death, taxes, and the Tigers for what seems like forever now (I know it hasn't I know).  That being said, [this might have something to do with the Twins' success](http://thepowerrank.com/cluster-luck/). 12 runs luckier than the next luckiest team in MLB via cluster luck.   It is because it's not on the schedule until it's necessary. The equivalent of what you're saying is what happened with Oakland and Texas a couple years ago, where they played Game 162 tied atop the AL West.   Absolutely perfect throw too. Only way they throw him out there. Hell of a play.   Point taken, I see what you're saying. You'll never hear me dismiss the value of semantics in arguments haha, don't know why that became a thing. Semantics are important.  Definitely agree that it's the obvious place to upgrade if we're going to do so. I just don't think the situation is as dire as many are making it out to be because the team as a whole has been extraordinarily unlucky so far.   We're 29th in the league in BABIP, 1 point ahead of Boston (who was like 10 points behind us before we played them this past weekend, and they got lucky against us haha). We're hitting the ball well, it's just not getting down for some reason.   We're also 26th in the league in defensive cluster luck (poor Oakland is in last, with luck three times as bad as ours defensively). The fact that we're still pitching pretty well is also extremely encouraging.  The fact that we're still around .500 is pretty great with regards to the luck we've had. I have faith it'll turn around, and when it does, we'll be a pretty good ballclub.   He's never really hit for a high average; his value is his on-base ability. He will be a useful player come season-end. His failings right now are just more noticeable because almost the entire team is struggling.   Is he gonna help at all?   When Shoe keeps the ball down, he's very good. When he doesn't, we get most of this season.  Also that Chapman fastball. Yeesch    one of those ~~series~~ **years**, so far  FTFY.  Seriously, we're ripping the ball in the past few weeks. Nothing is getting down. 29th in MLB in BABIP, one point ahead of Boston, who was like 20 points below us before our weekend series against them when they took away like 17 hits and had 28 slow rollers get through in the Sunday game alone  Yes I'm a little frustrated   They're both fine where they are thank you. Stay over there, play with your own toys   That's my favorite spelling of melodramatic ever   Guys wait :(   I mean it's technically correct breh   Apostrophe bruh   Well I was just watching Moneyball on my flight and it happens in the movie  EDIT: so obviously all the time /s   *The Palm at the End of the Mind* by Wallace Stevens is great. Any Coleman Barks translation of Rumi is awesome too.   I agree 100%. Those ITT suggesting that we'd be willing to part with Heaney for this kind of player don't have a sense of what the organization's trajectory is, or how hard we worked to get him.  Also, I agree that Joyce will get it going, was just saying what we'd do with Revere if we got him. Joyce probably won't be great, but he can certainly produce and contribute to the team, and I think that's way more valuable than trading for a guy who's decent but not a game-changer. That's what Joyce will be, and we don't have to give up anything to get him; we already have him.   We'd likely put him in left instead of Joyce, who has been one of the worst hitters in the league so far.   We have a backup DH/1B in CJ Cron. Do you know anything about our team past what you see on ESPN? You're showing a very surface level understanding of the organization.   This is a comical idea.    more than one pitching prospect  not more than one player. More than one pitching prospect.   Revere profiles similarly to Aybar offensively, but with less situational hitting ability. Pretty high average but doesn't draw walks so a middling/below-average OBP. Plus he's not a good defender. He would, however, add another running threat to the order.  Ultimately, I'd want to see what we'd give up. If it's anything of consequence, I'd prefer that we didn't.   I'm not saying the deals are equivalent, I'm saying we are unlikely to do it unless it's nearly all paid because of the Hamilton deal. They are different things, and that's why I think a deal is unlikely between the Angels and Phillies. The situations are categorically different, yes, but the Hamilton situation affects what the Angels would be willing to do to bring in Howard (answer: not much).   Didn't say it was, but I don't think we'd be willing to part with more than one pitching prospect, we don't have enough. There's a reason the Angels haven't been talked about as a landing spot for Hamels.   This is exactly right. The A's this year are the definition of "You can't win a pennant in April, but you can lose it".   Yeah we'll probably want even more money. We just got rid of Hamilton and paid almost all of it, we're not trying to bring a contract like that in and pay too.   Angels fans seem properly rated. We're nice enough most of the time, but the knowledge of the fan base is really poor. Not to mention the beach balls. Went to Opening Day last year, 10 beach balls got on the field and stopped play. I was cringing of embarrassment.   Hahaha. The young pitcher...would be Heaney.    Pretty much. Hopefully the offense can progress to the mean and we'll be scary.   Angels pitching staff has the best ERA in the AL in May, and third best in the majors. Largely because we've had so many starts of 7+ innings. Which seems like the only way we win because we only have two reliable bullpen arms (Smith and Street, who are both amazing), and our offense isn't outgunning anyone right now.   Yeah no way Heaney goes to Philly. Not unless Hamels is coming back.   Sosh said almost no one will play all 4 games this series cuz of the turf.   Do it after we play the Sox this weekend. Then I'm game.   Angels are not taking on that contract unless it's literally almost all paid for, and we don't have to give up anyone who has the ability to make a major league impact. Seriously doubt it.   It's not even finally, he's been swinging well for a bit. Nothing is getting down   I think my favorite part about this is how he has to look at the base in the last 10 feet and chop his steps to touch it.  I wonder if he would describe his expression after the play as a bemused grin or a knowing chortle.   More than a little disappointed. Did the ACC have total control or something? Cuz these are basically piss-off-little-guy games.   They were both good this year, and neither is losing very much, although Richmond is losing Kendall Anthony. ODU in particular seems to be on the way up.   Ed Cooley, Chris Mack, Archie Miller, Andy Enfield, John Groce, among others, in just skimming the list...it's like a who's who of upcoming coaches.   That is a really cool idea. Get the most qualified people jobs.   Definitely has something to do with it. The entire Royals staff is quick to the plate, it's something they've cultivated. Perez is also great at controlling the running game.    I'm guessing he was reading that for insight into how others saw things, not for his own viewpoint.   I read this and initially thought you were talking about Senor Met, which, yeah.   Little bit of column A, little bit of column B I think. He does let the ball go really early.   I read something last year about how even though Ventura throws as hard as he does, his release makes his velocity much less effective because he throws it further from the plate than a lot of pitchers. As in the ball has further to travel, so even though it's going faster, the batter has more time to react.   Negative response bias.   This was also the time of the year when the A's were killing everyone in run differential. Something something counting chickens.  EDIT: Wow, gold circle jerk, yay!   Hahah that's fair enough. I'd love to see what Cowgill could do with full-time ABs. He was hitting well last year before he took that one to the face. Or even platooning him and Efren    Yeah, he obviously should've known, but if you were ever gonna do it, this would've been the easiest game to not know.   Like I said haha. Revere is not that good at all, and Joyce, though not at all a world-beater, is not as bad as he has been.  Knee-jerking and giving up prospects for someone that will provide minus defense and a modest improvement with the bat at best, is foolish and short-sighted. Revere is not worth giving anything up for.   Please don't do this. He's not any better than what we have.   There is a significant difference between the clusterfuck that is LAX and all of those airports, so yeah, I'll take the field.  "looking at" was a colloquialism, not a literal statement. I understand that you can hear planes from all of those places; I am saying it is not anymore of a nuisance than street traffic as long as you're not right next to it, which no one would've been.  Traffic would've been a concern, yes, but with the time they had to plan it, and the lack of heavy development in the area, I'm confident they could've come up with something workable. As far as environmental costs go, that's just facetious. All of those people who need to fly are gonna fly somewhere; now they're driving to an airport further away and then taking the same flight, so a net increase in the amount of pollution, not a decrease. Unless you were just talking about the Orange County impact, which is both scientifically dubious and again, NIMBY.  Oh, money has a hand in trying to get it built, the difference is that there was also a major social benefit to having an accessible international airport in the area, far larger than that of the "huge swath of grass" that is the Great Park. So the societal benefit is far larger in that case.  And if you're really gonna go there and say that no one who doesn't live in the flight path of the airport deserves to have a say, then stop eating food from the supermarket, drinking water from the tap, using electricity...like seriously. That's not the world we live in.   LAX Jr. is a little steep, don't you think? And there would've been an ample buffer between the closest houses and the airport; we largely would've been looking at planes flying overhead, not dealing with the takeoff noise in a game-changing amount.  And, both for Orange County in general and for the rest of southern California and the country at large, yes, you need to make a good amount of money to live in Irvine. And honestly, those of us who live in the area (I am from Irvine originally) and don't make that much money are not the people who got it killed; the people with money did. That's the point I was making with regards to money.  It just reeks of NIMBYism. Sure, fuck someone else over, but don't you dare make me deal with it.   Wooo that second one is a pretty hot take.   [Blowing an 11 game lead in the division.](http://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/107/files/2011/10/1995.jpg)   There is no other serious candidate without going back to 95.   For sure, didn't read it as a joke, my bad   Uhhhhhhh not sure what this has to do with us losing.  If anything I'd think Iannetta being player of the game was a great thing for our chances of winning, since his baseline production has been such a black hole.    Awesome, happy to hear it! What would you recommend reading next by him?  My favorite of his was *In A Sunburned Country*, about Australia. Can't really go wrong though.   I'd be more impressed if his OBP was higher than the NL average OPS /s  Seriously he's raking right now.   The even sadder thing is that they had the political clout to kill it. Dollars talk, sense walks.    If you remove the blackouts from MLB.tv, you put MLB.tv directly into competition with the regional networks who currently pay billions of dollars for their exclusive TV rights. Without blackouts, those TV rights are no longer exclusive, and you make them compete against a service that provides exactly what a large proportion of people want from their TV, which is access to the games. The value of those rights deals now plummets, and a huge slice of baseball's revenue has just cratered.  MLB.tv is not drawing in the casual fan. MLB.tv is drawing in the diehards, those of us who follow the sport as a whole, and follow it closely. You're not losing an opportunity to grow/maintain the fanbase by blacking out local games.  It does suck for certain markets, since they lie in the middle of multiple teams' broadcast areas. If anything, that's where we'll see changes. Maybe allow users to select one team at the beginning of the year that they won't be blacked out for or something. Which wouldn't solve everything, but it would help a lot.   Not sure it was totally fleshed out, but it would've been on the bigger side.   I get that, but the demand for flights in and out of the area was and is enough to fill up two airports, given the size of John Wayne and its limited hours.  The airport was killed because rich Irvine/Newport Beach residents didn't want planes flying overhead. Which frankly get over yourselves.   The Great Park has already fulfilled its main objective, which was to kill the airport they were planning on putting there. There's no incentive for them to develop it, and that's why it still is what it is.   Vinnie just wanted his own earned runs, didn't want Morin to hog them all.  It's okay, plenty of baseball left   ..what are you saying?  Well yeah, but viewership only makes sense if it's monetized. Online ads aren't the ticket; they can't even fill the ads up now.   I know it's anathema on this sub to say the blackout rules are a good idea..but they are.    Those policies are not idiotic. They're inconvenient for fans. Those policies make a ton of sense, and as much as I'd like to not have them, it's hard to imagine a world where (to cite the most obvious example) MLB.tv costs as little as it does and doesn't have blackout rules.   Really? I don't know much about hockey, so I'll concede that, but the NBA playoffs have not been very good games outside of the Clippers-Spurs series.  EDIT: Okay, people like games with exciting finishes. Doesn't mean those games were well played.   Iannetta can still play. He'll come around.   I think we'll actually do a better job   He packed his Head N Shoulders in his carry on, didn't get through TSA   Yeah I figured he'd struggle against you guys a bit. I was hoping for like 4 runs in 5 innings, not 4 runs in 1.2  The real question is, how badly will our offense continue to suck? Cuz it sounds like you guys have been terrible at keeping teams from scoring. Let us help you with that.   But seriously, which one of you guys invited 2014 CJ Wilson? Not cool guys. Not cool.   He's awesome, we love him  	92
 Lmao. Are you positive about that? look up Catherine the great.     Not a girl but the biggest instance of me missing a signal from a girl was back in high-school. My little brothers sister(different dads, different moms) no relation outside of my little bro, anyway she randomly started hanging around me whenever she would come over to visit my lil bro, one day while she was spending the night over our house(this was long after my mom and her dad had ended but she was still close to our family) she came to my room, asked me to come into our living-room, i sat next to her, one thing led to another and i lost my virginity that night.   Anyway a few weeks later, she calls my house, i pick up in she starts talking about how she wants to come over and hangout again and asked could she speak to my mom, my mom and her are on the phone, she ask my mom, mom looks over at me wondering if i want to be bothered i blurt out mom no! because despite the fact we had sex i really could not stand her or her sister, my mom also did not want to be bothered so she made up an excuse in said maybe next time. I later realized what she was hinting at when she said hang out again about 3 months later. F%#$     I don't get it?   What's the difference? you act like men give a damn about a woman being a slut. We look for the slutty chicks, that's why we head to the clubs, that's why we dream of nympho's and that's why we like to get chicks wasted. News flash the guy is not interested in your personality, he's interested in those personalitits.   You think a guy will stay around for the illusion of a blowjob? some might but the probability of an entire town doing so not likely. Calling b.s, op your mom is the town bicycle.    Academic*    So how long did it take you to realize you were married?   lolz facts.   Brazil for one.   In once again this is why spain,england, france and the rest of these countries with generations of knowledge continuously under-perform compared to countries which came later. Scroll up they did state that.   or did you? but yeah interesting.    America has 5x the amount of the us? so we're outclassing ourselves goddamn it.     Aww he is adorable. https://boxerworld.com/forums/threads/long-hair-boxer.19839/page-2 googled this, one of the comments mention this is traceable back to some uk breeds.    Can confirm this guy punches.    Then. I looked it up-_- it refers to time.   Back then is correct back than would be incorrect when we're referring to time. Nope fuck  you're correct, than is used in conjunction with more.    Yeah but i'm talking pre-79   Ha funnily enough this is my account. In no i'm not using subterfuge, now death to israel!!!! joking i'm a pro-zionist shill:) but i do support the Iranian people, in no i did not leave out the ayatollahs. I thought this was common knowledge they ruined the relationship.   Right. Like they did for josh by sending him to a former cop who turned out to be a child molester? lmao these are the side hug people. More then likely they have made them feel like it's their fault.    2 of 30..... right. Anyway i'm just saying you should give a better source next time, mainly because i think allot of people would be interested. Start with india and south east asia, they probably have clear cut cases.    Not what i feel. What we clearly saw in the interviews, like what you're doing by stating oh it "happened" a long time ago and "why is this even being brought up" etc   I don't watch 19 kids and counting yet it still exist until very recently-_-   No saying america could not compete because we do not have a century of heritage with kicking a ball with our feet is shitting on America.    Um professionally? or are we talking about public popularity? can you link some info.   The article clearly referenced male to female and vice versa instances where actors did it in china, also i never said they only did it for entertainment purposes i clearly pointed out various social political purposes and even modern purposes by citing Albanian women in concerns to why people cross-dress but like you stated before crossdressing is not indicative of transgender identity lets leave it at that and not contradict ourselves because i'm not arguing against your points i'm really not.     I can go scroll up in point out where you stated this and passed it off as fact."http://www.bilerico.com/2008/02/transgender_history_trans_expression_in.php If you think being trans is some new fad, please realize trans people have always been a part of humanity and they always will be. History is full of examples of trans people attempting to transition with what society has at hand at the moment. From the Gallai of ancient Rome, to the two spirited people of the America's there is not one culture or time in all of recorded and unrecorded human existence in which trans people did not make up some percentage of the population. The only difference is that now, as is the case with many other medical issues, we have developed appropriate treatments. When people say "trans isn't real because chromosomes"-  In once again those same feelings and causes that are indicative of transgender identity is can not be discerned from historical figures. Like you pointed out crossdressing is not endemic of being trans-gendered if so jamie fox, martin Lawrence and jim carrey would all be transitioning as we speak. They're many reasons for cross-dressing using examples of this as indicative of a historical presence for trans-gendered is not factual and should not be passed off as such. But like i said i understand where you're coming from, it's how i feel when someone tries to disprove me in concerns to african history. I know my people, i know where we come from and i know that we did not just pop up in chains so sorry once again if this looks like i'm attacking you.       No one said feel awful but i have a problem with someone downplaying child sexual abuse, especially if they're being what's the legal term in court? led? led to this conclusion and outlook. Most people do or are you a duggar?   Damn it i knew you would see the line and misconstrue that, let me reiterate a line can be curved. I am not line biased. No but in all seriousness it's not speculation that is bad or dangerous, it's not even gender or sexuality speculation unless you're catholic in then that may be a problem. Rather or not Lawrence of Arabia was gay,straight,bi or even asexual is a very fond subject of historical biographers, speculation is a big part actually when it comes to biographical portraits of historical figures, the main issue however is when this speculation is passed off as fact.  The thing about biographers is allot of what they write on a person, specifically personality traits and other characteristic's that are not backed by specific writings or other things are all really just speculation when it comes down to it this is the norm. But theirs a difference between presenting something as speculation and presenting something as fact, earlier a poster referenced suicide rates on post op trans and you had at him because obviously this is not factual. The same can be applied to you, i have no problems with speculation but you should clearly label this as speculation of the gender identities in historical figures/people's when citing it for the basis of your statements instead of passing it off as fact. I know this was probably because you're tiredd of transphobes and want to present a strong argument to shut them down but in the long run it might be better so you won't have to deal with anyone attempting to discredit you on the basis of this alone.     Got me there. Because my family cares about my views on those who have suffered from child sexual abuse and have influenced me to this opinion. Thank you jester.    I believe to forgive first you must face what occurred, I've never heard of someone being told to forgive a situation when it is still being downplayed and from the interviews the duggar family is really downplaying this or diverting the issue to non relevant topics.    Thank you for sharing this. In i understand not from the perspective of an abuse victim but having a number of ex partners who suffered the same abuse, unfortunately even from close family members. Your perspective is not uncommon, my ex felt the same way, she was actually still suffering from the abuse nightly, i did not find this out till later, it took months for me to finally convince she should seek help but she always refused on the basis of "not making a fuss"   she was a very inwardly cold person, extremely guarded when it came to her own personal feelings so i can understand where you're coming from.  She did not want to take any action because she had in her own word built up a wall in concerns to her emotions. I hear this often repeated by those who are victims of rape since it usually is done by someone close to them, how they say they still love the person but at the same time hate them. It's a very confusing place, which is why i have the view that the same viewpoint would be the ones the duggar sisters are having, on the one hand you know what your brother did, but he is still your family. Theirs a documentary i had to watch for a pysch class concerning pedophiles and the children they abused, in one woman said how she still had the urge and inherent need to have her father around who abused her, saying how she felt on certain days after she got a good grade or accomplished something she wished she could call him up in be like dad i got an A.  In you're perfectly fine and from my personal experience your outlook more common then uncommon at-least going by my ex's, allot of times people assume rape victims should be crying, tearful or feeling disgusted in some ways but whenever one of my ex's disclosed this information to me it was either delivered in a matter of fact way or nonchalantly or sometimes just a random w.e to start a conversation.   I think the only time it was really emotional was when one admitted to herself and me she was being abused, but once again that was when it was still occurring so it can really depend on time and, when the abuse began and stopped,   Not you granny. But i have heard from others calling it fluid. In sorry for that then, but you can't decide rather or not my opinion is being nitpicky because sources you're using to validate your statements are not holding up. The point of any source is to be critiqued because this is what you're basing it entirely on. That's very true, in if the concept of gender has progressed and greatly change isn't it wrong to assume our current understanding and view of it is completely null in concerns to historical gender identity?  That's why i referenced the elven crossdresser, what we see as signs of transgenderism, how we view it in that historical and cultural context it can be completely unrelated. The link you posted even states the same at the very bottom. Monks and philosophers actually would not be included but alchemist most definitely, interesting read on the subject of how it was coined  http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=127037417  Imagine if they had chosen atheist, god the 1950's would of been hell on earth for the scientific community. You are popularizing futuristic concepts, just dropped the atomic bomb and split the atom a few years before, the world is hypothesizing new concepts while at the same time people scared of commies are forcing god into everything and here you're, the atheist.   Sorry once again history major here, that's not factual, much like theories in science we can study events, source historical accounts, if need be excavate and then of course compare in theorize based on the available evidence what occurred. History is literally reading between the lines, which is one of the reasons why it's fascinating. The one thing we cannot do to a fault is really the mindset of historical individuals we can surmise their personalities, traits, and how they might of been but this is all really a opinionated guess which is one of the reasons why i dislike when people try in post their mindsets on historical figures and events. Those who do this usually have a political objective, which honestly i do not mind, but be honest about, if you want to lay claim to Alexander the great being homosexual for the purpose of giving a historical figure that gay young adults can look up to fine but their is a a point we should respect.    TLC actually used to be extremely educational but like history channel it sold out.    Thank you. Lets not ignore this simple fact, their family is extremely on the cult esque spectrum as you can get without expanding into a compound in adding more families.    Yes exactly. The same way abuse victims who are still in abusive relationships or environments or people who have been kidnapped in have Stockholm syndrome cannot have mature outlooks on a situation.    Now this is confusing. One minute it is fluid and the next it's not, OK so can i call bullshit on people trying to raise their children gender neutral? because this is becoming contradictory. Not using a stand in it was a personal reference to how complex gender and gender is if anything?   But all the people referenced, like 9 out of ten were cross-dressers your link implied were transgender. Which is why i pointed it out. OK agreed that's usually how history works, my question to you is how can we then state they're categorically transgender, because then you're putting your own cultural bias on it just like how gay people are now putting their bias on historical figures who may or may not be gay.  But the rest of your post was very informative, sorry if this is nitpicky.    Duggar is that you? you cannot wish the pedo away like the gay, it does not work like that, it's not 2 for 1 my friend. Normal families would not protect and allow their son to molest his younger sisters or send him to counseling with a a man later convicted of having kiddie porn. They have proven repeatedly that their method was ineffedctive.    Duggar? is that? jesus you cannot wish the pedo away like the gays, won't happen.    Going to go a little progressive here but. Gender identity is pretty fluid correct? who says it would be that difficult? we know the concept of tomboy exist, it does not mean a woman who is a tomboy or shows characteristics of a man is trans-gendered or wishes to be a man. Caitlin Jenner lived for decades as a man, he was and is sorry she is a Olympian who was considered a perfect specimen of masculinity and athleticism back in his day yet he is transgender.   I'm going to use a personal reference here, but i was recently playing this game called witcher 3, theirs a quest, involving this elven clothes designer who likes to cross-dress, he is not into men, does not see himself as a woman but explains he likes to dress up, likes to see himself as other roles, other professions of higher or lower social status. Not saying this covers them but it did kind of give me an idea of how fluid it really is and the concepts of self identity, like you stated we really cannot know absolutely in i think that goes both ways.  "In seventh Century BC, King Ashurbanipal (Sardanapalus) of Assyria spent a great deal of time in womens' clothing, something that was later used to justify overthrowing him. In Egypt, 1503 BC, Egyptian Queen Hatshepsut ascended to the throne, the second Egyptian queen to rule (the first was Queen Sobekneferu of the 12th Dynasty). Possibly learning from the disfavor shown to her predecessor, she donned male clothing and a false beard signifying kingship, and reigned until 1482 B.C. She had one daughter, Neferure, who she groomed as successor (male clothing, false beard and all), but Neferure did not live into adulthood. After her death, her second husband attempted to erase all record of her. And Nzinga ruled as King of Angola from 1624 - 1653, cross-dressed and led several successful military battles against the Portuguese. Read more at" this for instance seems to showcase that this case of cross-dressing was more due to societal norms in which a man was seen as possessing more power then a woman so she chose to use take up dressing as a man to strengthen her authority not as a pure  belief of seeing herself as a man but it was expedient to use the physical attributes.   Sorry was kind of hoping it would have more depth instead of being moves in response to cultural stigma of being a woman.   	37

In order to do that I will need you to provide more precise information. When you started practicing about a year ago exactly what did you do? Did you start with 1 hour per day and what was the step by step process you followed? Did you sit for practice once per day or multiple times? How did your practice change over the year? In the last month what has your practice been like? When and where do you sit for practice? How long are your sessions? Can you describe the session(s) you did yesterday...precisely how did you practice from the moment you took your seat until the alarm sounded at the end? Have you had any physical injuries or mental/emotional illness challenges in the last few months? Have you begun taking or stopped taking any drugs/medications in the last few months?  Once per day, I would do it in the morning sometimes and sometimes in the evening. I would do it outside sometimes and sometimes inside the houes but mostly outside.

You matter but most things in life do not matter such as politics, money, morals, ethics, superiority, the law, good and evil. As you can see it resembles nietzsche's notions. Those things do matter in some sense but not as much as you. The key is to not rationalize anything. If you have a vision, create it and don't use any excuses such as money because money is a word used to describe freedom in a capitalist society. Isn't it contradictory and ironic when you are enslaved by freedom? We simplify freedom to money and work hard to get it but we are not daring enough to explore unfamiliar territory of what it truly means to be free and create your own values. We justify money by thinking that we worked hard and deserve it therefore there is no more work to be done. But we are all too familiar with the word "money" and the idea of money; in the same way that if we learn useless facts or be active in politics we are making a difference or we are stimulating ourselves intellectually. I'm not saying they are wrong but do not be enslaved by them, do not master them either but be free of them. How to test freedom?

 First, you'll need a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW).  I'd suggest downloading [Reaper](http://www.reaper.fm/), which is a (basically) free software - it has a 60 day free trial, but still works exactly the same after the trial "ends."  I also have [FL Studio](http://www.image-line.com/flstudio/), but I use Reaper to manipulate audio files because I think it's the easier of the two to use for that.  After you have your DAW, find 2 (or more) songs you like!  It helps if they have similar BPM, but that's not a necessity.  A good rule of thumb I use is if they're within 10% of one another (I think I made one with a 128 BPM song and a 140 BPM song).  Download the songs you want to use (in Reaper, .wav files are generally easier to use than .mp3 files, so convert your songs with iTunes, a website, or some other means if you can).  Finally, open the files of the songs with your DAW and have fun!  Mashups are a great way to spend some spare time!!!   No problem!  Just wanted to help straighten things out for you if you had gotten confused.  Orcas are the largest oceanic dolphin species but, interestingly, they and the other blackfish (dolphins that are predominately black) have "whale" in their common name!   Are you saying since killer whales are toothed whales they're also dolphins?  If so, that's not true.  Sperm whales, beaked whales, and porpoises are all toothed whales and are not (oceanic) dolphins.   If you're comparing killer whales to other toothed whales and saying that since killer whales are more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to other toothed whales, then you're correct.    Taxonomically, yes.  Whales are any species that belong to the order Cetacea and oceanic dolphins are any species that belong to the family Delphinidae (river dolphins encompass a few different families).  So from a taxonomic context, you'd be correct saying a killer whale is a whale, correct and more specific saying a killer whale is a dolphin, correct and most specific saying a killer whale is an oceanic dolphin, but wrong saying a killer whale is not a dolphin (or an oceanic dolphin).   But this might not be the case in common nomenclature.  People tend to call small whales with a pronounced rostrum, "dolphins," which is a characterization that killer whales (and other "blackfish" - pilot whales, false killer whales, and pygmy killer whales) don't fit.  And there are also dolphins without pronounced beaks, such as the Risso's and Irrawaddy dolphins but they're smaller than .  River dolphins are not in the family Delphinidae, but are still called dolphins because of the large rostrums they have. Generally speaking, people call big cetaceans "whales," small cetaceans with conical teeth "dolphins," and small cetaceans with spade-shaped teeth "porpoises."  So from a common nomenclature context, you wouldn't be wrong calling a killer whale a whale since they're large relative to the other members of the family Delphinidae and the river dolphins and they don't have a pointy beak.  TL;DR: there's a difference between taxonomic and common nomenclature - in common nomenclature, many families are lumped together as "dolphins" and large oceanic dolphins are called "whales."   **E**   Sweatpants have been my go-to cold weather leg covering for years (to be fair though, I'm a college student).  They just feel better to me than jeans do!  I've also gone through some rapid weight fluctuations (down 30, down another 20, up 30, up another 30, down 30, etc.), so it's easier to have sweat pants with draw strings than cycle through a bunch of different sized jeans.  Also, they're making some nice looking sweats nowadays with pockets and normal pant legs (no more of the elastic-ringed bottoms)!   Sure thing!  And thanks for the advice!  I think I'm only going to get Massive now and if I decide I want more, I can always wait until the next sale.   Thanks!  I've heard positive things about massive and as long as it's as robust as I've heard, I may just stick with that (plus whatever comes with the DAW I decide to buy) for now.  This is definitely just a recreational activity for me so I think it might be best to go with the easier one for now.   Thanks!  I'm looking at producing as more of a hobby than anything so I want to keep my expenses down but still be able to make something that has a good quality.  From searching Reddit, it seems that synths go on sale rather frequently, so hopefully if you can't afford them now, you can afford them next time around!    That might be a good way to go!  I'm coming at this from a hobby point of view so I don't want to throw too much money into it, but I also want to have enough tools to set myself up to be successful in making something I enjoy.    Awesome, thanks!  I originally saw this link in r/FL_Studio and when I looked at the "Other Discussions" tab, there wasn't one for the post in this sub for some reason.   I've been interested in making music for a while and have played around with free DAW trials and free synths, but haven't actually bought any software yet.  Any suggestions on which of these to get?  I know Massive is good, but I don't know anything about the other synths.  	12

 The context is the population.  There are 112,374,333 people who live in the state in question, Maharashtra.  58,243,056 are men.  In 6 months, 1300 farmers have killed themselves.  " So in just six months this year, the farmer suicide toll has already touched 66% of the 1,981 cases recorded in the entire year of 2014."  Last year, 1981 farmers killed themselves in that state.

The majority of people in r/movies aren't exactly the people I would want to make an educated decision on sound editing in movies.

I know it's never gonna happen, like, ever, but it would have been nice to see the Raid 2 get mentioned for sound effects or editing, as, in my opinion, the film was immensely technically impressive in those areas. Godzilla should have also got some sound effects noms.   The majority of people won't care about editing nominations. It's pretty much impossible to make a awards show with popularly excepted nominations EVERY time, but one could certainly argue that a show that's voted for by 90% 60+ white males won't ever come close.   Actually, I'd say critical dissonance is just as common as any other form of media, however, due to the wonders of the internet, people have an incredibly hostile approach to any kind of criticism/lack of perceived criticism. People are gonna hate destructoid for giving gone home 10/10 in the same way they hate destructoid for giving AC 2 a 4/10, or Empire magazine for giving Birdman a 5/5. Accepting other peoples opinions about trivial shit and moving on just isn't very valued in today's society.    Fun fact: the inventor of the lie detector was a polygamist, BDSM obsessed inventor of wonder women who likely had a fetish for people using lie detectors.   In *theory*. we already know that chronicles x carries over some of the races from xenoblade.   Actually, the OP is implied to be the intro to a show taking place in another timeline, with the song actually having a double meaning. You can also notice stuff like Madoka getting gradually more depressed due to the wacky antics, reinforcing the shows saccharine themes.   IF they sell it to the Her audience (who I'd say about 5% will have seen GITS, we're talking fairly casual film buffs here) they'll make it look more muted and quiet, mainly focusing on environment stuff in trailers. Under the skin is very debatable, many would argue that it's a character driven, and performance driven film, I've seen MANY people lavish praise on that performance.   Lucy was one of the biggest summer blockbusters of the year, and had a fairly decent critical reception, despite the fact that the film is pretty surreal. Johansson also starred in Captain America 2, another massive hit, and Her, which garnered a lot of acclaim. I also think under the skin had a lot of critical success due to her performance, particularly as it relied on her seducing people in real life. (some of those guys aren't actors) Spielberg also technically CAN'T take his name off, because he owns dreamworks, and he never took his name off transformers. My feeling is that the movie will be good to mediocre, but get decent acclaim from people who haven't seen the anime, and either aim for the 'her' audience or go all in with summer blockbuster mode, in which case it will likely sell gangbusters.   At least a GITS movie isn't being written by an actively hated figure like Frank Miller. the director made a decently popular movie (and had an affair with Kristen Stewart ) Lucy was a massive hit at the box office, and under the skin was a critically acclaimed indie, and Spielberg brings a ton of funds to advertising.   Well, Sin city 2 was also a mediocre movie from the writer of some islamaphobic comics and the director of spy kids 4, whereas GITS has a hot new director, one of the worlds biggest megastars and the approval of Spielberg.    Spike Lee's Oldboy was a movie NOBODY cared about though, at least people give a crap about GITS and Scarlett Johanssen.    That's actually why After Earth never mention shalalalalamalan in the trailers, he was just too damaging to market.   or get the coconut   Nito's just *dead.* Reanimated by some dark magic that keeps him in this state of death.   Basically, before you got there, there was about 100 different factions fighting each other, for wildly different Goals. But gradually, time eroded them away, condensing them down into the husks you see in the game, because they're simply nothing *left* to fight anymore.   Oh, he was already complaining on Ghazi about you? Fair enough. Seriously, I was mainly objecting to you attacking him for a Dtoid post on reddit, but I guess if he attacked you on ghazi already, it's fair to attack him here. Sorry to interrupt your little internet battle!   Wait, so do you have any actual evidence he's come from Ghazi? I mean, he's been on destructoid way, *way* before that post was made, And whilst I don't religiously follow c-blogs, I'm pretty sure he had a presence there, and it's not like that arguing technique originated on gamerghazi.  I just don't understand why You've decided to post it here.   Who the hell is 'Them?' why are you tying so hard to imply that TitusGroan is some form of malevolent entity, all he did was disagree with and criticize you.   The BSS is my favorite weapon. I was struggling with the game, got to the parish, and this baby dropped from the third Knight I fought. That sexy bastard.   Yeah, it's *impossible* that TitusGroan just missed that blog post. What difference does it make, anyway? You decided that a chan post was truthful, created a fiction around Anita Sarkeesian making controls easier, and it was picked up and seen as fact by a ton of people. It's pretty fair of Titus to call you out on that when you keep going on about feministfrequency, and it's pretty weird to act like he's some kind of Ghazi plant, and not even address him on the forum itself.    It's implied the plan A ship is going there anyway, but Anne Hathaway would have died in that time due to time distortion anyway.   I don't understand how TitusGroan 'followed' you to the community blogs, he's been on Dtoid for years. (so have I, incidentally)    Haven't played dark souls 2, but in the original dark souls AI's like solaire, Tarkus and Lautrec had way more health than you did, which is why Ganking is so prevalent.   Wait, how is it open ended? Anne Hathaway activates Plan B, dies of old age, the human civilization continues, thrives, becomes fifth dimensional beings, and creates the time loop which allows mccanaugheys  character to rescue the Earth humans, which then potentially rescue Hathaway. What's not to get?   Basically, the tomb of giants is a pretty difficult early level in the game, but an incredibly easy last level of the game, so do it as late as possible, bring some stuff that can light your way, and enjoy the cool atmosphere.   Try getting the sunlight maggot, It makes it so much easier to see in Blightown.   RELEASE THE WAR ELEPHANTS! THEIR BLADES WILL FALL UPON OUR GIANT SPONGES!   LOWER THE DWARVEN ATOM SMASHER!   Well, firstly, I believe their gameplay role is to be stealthed past, by moving from cover to cover, and they also demonstrate the fairly obvious message of 'brothels are bad, these women are forced to work in brothels, this guy kills people for sexual pleasure, your taget is a scumbag etc' as demonstrated by Log1c bombs rebuttal of  Thunderfoots video (although forgive me for going by on memory) that video also shows that the path isn't the ONLY path through that area.  I'd also argue that since it's a stealth game, the whole POINT is not to interact with people, as that requires being seen/discovered, and the player is discouraged from doing anything because it's an unnecessary risk. (you can also go through the whole game murdering EVERYONE with a variety of weapons, and ARE encouraged to kill a lot of people in creative/violent ways) I'd say that's enough ambiguity to say that that part not definitely ,objectively sexist. However, there are parts that do prove Anita's point better than she did, (her lack of detail on a lot of examples can prove annoying. Why is spelunky sexist, why is Watch_dogs portraying a sex auction negatively equivalent to endorsing it?) such as, for example, the hitman sniper challenge, where you literally are rewarded with a striptease through a sniper rifle scope, or the nun fight, where have to think of ways to light assassins dressed in bondage gear on fire to get the best score, which are parts of the game that encourage violence against women, rather than just feature the possibility of violence.   Y'see, I fought stray immediately after equipping the crest shield, and it never blocked ANYTHING for me. I ended up going full dex into him.   As you die, you actually DO die in that particular world forever, but due to time being convoluted, you're moved to a different one where you didn't. The curse of undead is a kind of cosmic balancing in favor of humanity, and the creator of the undead curse is a God far more powerful than the in-game God's, possibly Velka or a general judeo-christian concept of God. Therefore, the only thing that can possibly happen is the reign of 'Gods' ends in all possible universes/strands of time.   Every time you respawn you go to an alternate reality, and stuff either doesn't respawn due to that already being gone in the reality or due to some divine controller actively not respawning it to help you.   Eh i'd say that Absolution encourages you not to kill the women in That  particular example by having it go against gameplay mechanics (it's a stealth game) and giving those particular NPC's sympathetic dialogue. However, there are OTHER elements of the game that do encourage you to do that, such as the hitman sniper challenge thing in Log1c bombs video and the nun attack, which are less ambiguous example. I do think TB is wrong, and that the whole point gets blown out of proportion, but some better examples could've been made to prove that point.   It's worth pointing out that that there really isn't *consensus* on this matter, as multiple people who are branded 'anti gg' actually think bayonetta is a *positive portrayal* instead, and encourage debate on the subject.   I don't know, TB is still giving Jim sterling money via Patreon and retweeting his stuff, and thew only bridge that he's seemed to really have burned recently with his tirades is the yogscast.   a weapon to surpass metal gear?   eh, it's a shame that it's a goal that won't actually be met. But who knows, maybe if they get drunk enough it'll be lowered to 850 k or something?   Basically, the game can be hacked so that every swing of their sword teleports you to an area outside the map, where you cant die and fall forever, because DS saves all the time, you're stuck there. They can also do things like give you an egghead or curse you or whatever, and just generally screw up your game. The multiplayer component of DS basically necessitates people not modding or looking through the code.    To be honest, the PC version of dark souls is swarming with hackers who could already permanently break your saves, so the debug version isn't adding that much salt to the wound.   It's a 'hit 3 weakpoints' fight popularized by zelda.   Wasn't it just one guy one reddit though? Or was there more of an outcry on Tumblr?   I'm going to try to play inquisition as an asexual character due to this.    Nah, there bigger problem was that people they deluded into joining GG Didn't do that. The 'Ethics in game journalism' guys didn't hate DA, because it's a good game, and they couldn't effectively stave themselves off.   There was also a gay character in Phantasy star II.   Well, there was captain Rainbow, where you had to get Birdo out of Prison by proving they were a girl by finding there vibrator.... yeah....   Actually, I don't think *representation* for women in games isn't really that bad, as a tonne of games just let you make your own character now, with RPG's in particular generally having pretty even representation. (not a full 50/50, but decent enough) You still have some old stalwarts, like the FPS genre, but even they are making concessions to the demographic by having token female characters and character creators for multiplayer. Whether women are represented *well* in games is another matter, and there's a large lack of charismatic leads in games in general, but it's not exactly difficult to find female characters in games.   Have you done the dragon age keep? I'm new to the franchise too, but due to the *fantastic* way the PSN servers are down, I can't play it, because I want to sync my keep saves.   Eh, depends how interpret killing imaginary people for your own enjoyment without pretensions of 'advancing a story'. They're pure escapism basically, and I think it's unwise to consider them to be universally considered 'gross' yet.   Well, the first Postal is essentially a more retro version of hatred, basically just killing people for the sake of it, in much the same way as old arcade games and stuff. It was called mediocre by critics and was passed upon. Postal 2(the popular one) was a much more satirical game, you start every level in a frustrating situation, like waiting in line, and can CHOOSE to start doing stupid, violent shit like using a cat as a silencer or whatever, basically, much like GTA or Just Cause but in a much more constructed level, like say, hitman. Postal 2 is essentially the game people like, and is much lighter/sillier than Hatred.   Right, I was with you up until that point, but a British person, liking *those?* My god.   You're in the *continent* of America, you Yankee, pancake eating scum!   If you're looking for walking simulators, a lot of recent horror games have similar gameplay mechanics to Gone Home, such as Alien: isolation, amnesia 2, outlast and particularly P.T. After that you've got the Stanley Parable, which is 'funnier' than Gone Home, but noticeably shorter (and wasn't complained about by GG for some reason)   Another neat thing about Lautrec is that his mage companion in the fight wears the crimson set, and there's precisely on sealer of New Londo unaccounted for...   I hope Rythian plays Sweden again. Does Malmo have a better memory than Datlof?   Yeah, but the way CQC/hostage taking is managed is way more efficient, and quick, and cool.   They cost the same amount of money, why shouldn't I? Why should you buy GZ over HD collection, even if GZ is just an intro?   Rythian only went for cultural last game. He usually goes Diplomatic/Science, which actually succeeded... once....   But that doesn't apply to MGS. The Les Enfentes terribles project is the reason big boss left the patriots, which factionalized it between Para, sigint, and zero and snake and Ocelot, with Eva having shaky allegiances at the time of TPP (and presumably still a Chinese agent) if you don't know that, the drama won't have a much depth.   Well, the 4k are way better guarded than everything else, remember, to get there you have to get the seal/ get past the forest hunters and hydra, kill sif, get a cursed weapon, get ingward to lower the water, get past the wraiths, find artorias' ring, and THEN you can enter the Abyss, whereas everywhere else basically just lets you/an army stroll in. Only one guy could ever reclaim New Londo, and he has to do it alone.   It's difficult to say. New Londo is probably the place most fucked up by the time displacement. (possibly because of proximity to the abyss) Hence why artorias has history there despite dying in Oolacile, darkwraith attack you if your on their side, ingward doesn't care about the wraiths , the summonable ally may have died years ago etc.   It's....ok, it's mostly finishing up Peace Walker and setting up TPP. And in my opinion, it has way more emotional impact if you've played MGS3 and Peace Walker. MGS3 and Peace walker are also much better games for the money, even if GZ is still good.   Yep, apart from TPP almost certainly specifically addressing the Les enfant terribles project.   I'd say play MGS3 and Peace Walker before reading online, and then the other games are pretty fair to look up. MGS3 in particular really sets up TPP, and it's better to experience characters/twists first hand.   You sort of need to get a bit further into Peace walker for it to really 'click'. Once you start fultoning a lot of guys the game really starts to open up, and all the controls are designed to make you feel like this incredible badass. I'd also recommend playing through MGS3 again, either  with a guide or having read the TV tropes page. There's an incredible amount of neat stuff you've missed. Just the end alone has about 50 unique interactions, and you can do cool stuff like throwing rotten food around the fear, which'll make him eat and poison him.   What about Food fight?   Doesn't Q answer to his race though? He's also more fallible and less pragmatic than a lot of characters, and would probably lose to say, batman.   Well, it probably got brigaded by by people who saw all the coverage, and, to be honest, Hatred looks a lot more functional than 90% of greenlight games anyway.   Not really, this subreddit is against gamergate, not against Hatred. He doesn't need to justify himself.   They've also never released rapelay on steam. Could this be *denying Capitalism?*   I like how GTA gets blamed on the feminists because apparently it's only feminists who care about violence against Women. Why would a *conservative* ever want to ban a game?   Hey, remember how everyone abandoned Sega in 1990 for having a gay character in phantasy star II? Everyone knows Sega began to *struggle* in 1990.   Not just that, he was the *previous CEO of FROM* If that's not collusion, I don't know what is.   Well, He actually got it wrong, he clearly meant to say **Artorias** great sword.   Perhaps the mistake is crossbreed priscilla? After all, the common sentiment is that she's Seathes child.   I think part of GG is pent up aggression over the Gone Home getting 10/10's everywhere, and costing a fair amount of money on release, you could also point to things like the Sarkeesian videos and the Polaris game Jam as other things which built up some bad blood. A lot of people didn't like some of these things for issues other than social ones (If a guy says 'Gone home costs too much' or Sarkeesian should have stuck to her video deadlines' he gets lumped with GG) and therefore allowed themselves to be distanced from the people who WERE complaining about those social issues. (i.e the 'it's about ethics' stuff)   mmm? maybe we should tell them the secret? plans to kill? the men and ban them? from the games?      Avengers 2 will suck because I said everything else would suck, and,well, I'd look stupid if I said it might be OK. Can't break rule of three!   Heh, funnily enough he's freaking out over the trailer on twitter.   I don't think I've ever seen a game Sips is so naturally talented at, similarly, I've never seen him go so far out of his way to screw himself.   Blodborne is basically set in future Carim, Marvelous Chester is even implied to come from a Victorian version of Carim    Everything other than SMB isn't really a dedicated platformer, most are metroidvanias where platforming isn't that valued, and some are MOBAS or sandbox games. There are a bunch of PC platformers, but the majority of people find button pushing to be more enjoyable than key presses.   IMO third person action games, such as Devil may cry, benefit from a controller, as do 3D platformers, rythm games and some JRPG's   After nearly 10 minutes of dead silence from Lewis   Ben: so many composite bowmen   Lewis: Yes *lets see how they do*  Bloody terrifying.    Arm fall off man?   You'd think after over a year of knowing about the bug they'd know how to fix it properly.   Well, by the end of the game you should really have a light spell or the sunlight helm from Solaire, or at least I did. I dunno, maybe I was just lucky.   Well, pinwheel is essentially meant to be ran to on suicide/machismo runs, and is a reward for beating that section early. I really steamrolled both TOTG and the catacombs as a level 90, and the pervading feeling I got is that it's really not designed for a character that's pretty powerful/knows all it's tricks   When people say 'one shot' they may also mean killing it without it getting to fight back, I can stab the skeledogs twice with a BSS before they can attack.   Basically, get the keyblade form the polearm merchant and use it to fight solaire, when he dies, it'll open up the next area.   Basically, the guy who makes all those Bro movies with terrible female characters. I'm excited for suicide squad (although I have no idea where Amanda Waller is) but Ayer is NOT some kind of savant.   Well, the Inhumans movie is being made so they can have mutants without having to step on the license. It'll probably be similar to the comic arc now with the terrigen mist attacks or whatever.   Well, it's a setting a pretty awful message to *ban female ejaculation*, even if it is in porn, and is essentially a short sighted attack on people who can't campaign against it because Britain is too prudish, and it's not like the Government has nothing better to do, a couple weeks ago it was discovered there was a *child rape and murder ring* of politicians.   Wow, the true story here is that Arnie Hammers gone from starring in Hollywood blockbusters to working in Hollywood Bowling alleys.    Well, The green parties work in Brighton has been an utter shit show, they're massively unpopular over here now.   Maybe, but to me the theme of the UA is that Velka is helping you, so it lines up better, but other opinions are available.   I mean Anastacia is the only one that still has a body after her death, the others disappear in a burst of light. Presumably, someone thought it was vital the firekeep shrine firekeeper was as hard to kill as possible, as it's the de-facto safest place in Lordran.   It makes sense from a lore perspective, Solaire, like other players, is in another world, so he's already killed his worlds centipede demon, and put his summon sign down for some jolly co-operation. What wouldn't make sense is seigmeyer having the ring, as he's in your world exclusively.  	104
 "Ohh... I am not gonna kill you .......I am just gonna hurt you..really..really bad!"   Incredible. Really looking forward to it.   I think Pierce Brosnan is the best bond ever.  	3
 Carson running to the left of Christie and Paul, start the popcorn.   We banned the Klan from wearing mask in public back in the sixties and the Georgia Supreme Court upheld it about twenty five years ago. As far as I know it's never been taken to the U.S. Supreme Court, so apparently, you can't ban free speech, but you can ban anonymous free speech. If not, I guess we have to give the Klan back their hoods. Doesn't matter what the message is, you either do or don't have a right to anonymous free speech.     Selling products worldwide, made through offshore sources can bring record profits  If that is true, how would increasing their profits even more, bring back U.S. jobs? Wouldn't they just logically invest even more of their capital in outsourcing? Also, you still haven't addressed the false narrative in your headline that "U.S. companies are already at a competitive disadvantage", yet somehow are still making record profits.   So, you concede that profits are at record highs, in spite of having posted a headline that says that "U.S. companies are already at a competitive disadvantage"? How could both be true?

I suspect that about a hundred people, all with a couple dozen accounts and no job or much of a life, sustain these subs and make then appear more popular than they really are.

Many of these same shows would have been sponsored by corporations conspiring to convince the majority of the american people that smoking wasn't addictive and didn't lead to lung disease.               So your local politics aren't a concern?   This message brought to you by the Know Nothing Party.         And she said this while wearing short hair, no make up and pants.   According to a Fox News poll, released [yesterday](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/interactive/2015/01/29/fox-news-poll-voters-believe-romney-clinton-remain-top-picks-for-2016-believe/), Romney lead with 21% followed by Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee each at 11%, and Jeb Bush at 10%. How does Romney backing out the next day move Bush from fourth place to Frontrunner?   Dog Whistles.      He likes sweet rolls.             But it wouldn't have been "England" back then would it? Would have been Britian.   They paved paradise, but life finds a way.   So, if a Muslim woman came to the White House, she should uncover her head and wear a skirt that shows her knees or she would be considered rude?    To collect unemployment benefits, you must have worked a minimum amount of time and/or received a minimum amount of earnings -- from your previous employer. So how is that free and who is it stolen from?                  Died the same year as John Marston.   That was on Bush's watch.            How many farms actually get cable television?   Is that the same book that says you can't eat bacon?   Have you ever heard of the book "Why Johnny Can't Read"? It was published in 1955, 60 years ago.      And when Obama wore "Mom Jeans" nobody, oh wait...   Pretty sure she knows about this and pretty sure she knows what's in it and doesn't think it could hurt her chances.   In a large wooden crate labeled ACME.    Seriously, who the fuck pays people to climb rocks?!?   If I could put $60-80 more bucks a month in the pockets of almost every single household in the U.S. I really wouldn't care what it did to oil producers in Texas, and North Dakota. Net Sum gain.    I would guess programing a Christian station would be difficult, not only would you have to take musical style into consideration, but the Dogma and Theology expressed in the lyrics as well.

So this guy is opposed to having laws enforced or opposed to having laws?    I guess that's why we've got all those Independent in congress.   I guess if you subscribe to the theory that Pop music isn't good music, you must accept that good music isn't very popular.       and popular.

But none of them were cops.   Just think of all the people who did complete University that you've never heard of.   Have they heard about helicopters?     This isn't actually a dumb move, for a guy running for VP. Huck is figuring that the GOP nominee will be someone like Bush that is so pro immigration and education, that Neo-Cons will call them a "Rino", or someone like Paul that isn't pro military or anti drug enough for them, that there will be a need to balance the ticket with an evangelical.   Me too. I was like "Just because they found a 19th century pear point in a freshly killed whale in the 90's, doesn't mean it was thrown by a 19th century guy."

I like this. It makes me happy. People who refuse to buy health insurance screw over the rest of us when they run up huge medical bills they can't pay by causing the hospitals to charge the rest of us higher prices to make up the difference which leaves insurers no choice but to raise our rates. I'll be glad to see them voluntarily paying higher taxes that they could have avoided by simply buying something that they needed to buy in the first place. They're no better than people who build their house in a floodplain and expect FEMA to bail them out every ten years.        Kinda doubt batmanEXPLOSION is an adult.            This is my guess, after de Blasio "indicated his commitment to tackling the problem with a new approach" homeless people, from other places, moved to NY, figuring it would be easier to be homeless in NY.   I'm old enough to remember when whites in the South called MLK   the Freedom Riders "Trouble Makers".   Looks like Jimmy Carter.   Now we all have to buy thin mints.   Ditto.

Wait, so you're telling me that just because something is unpopular with most of those affected by it, doesn't mean that it will be a failure?     I think people are mislead by the name   font into thinking it's some old established newspaper that it isn't. It was founded in '82 by the Moonies.   Yeah, that was like a WND post.         Yes actually it does. Compared to other cars made in the 1950's, this car is neither oversized or gets shitty milage.    It's was the late 70's, but that's a late 50's car.   Check out /r/GeezerRock.   Is that half part of the two-thirds that didn't vote and made this possible?   Twice a day.   This assumes that one can't be both Black and Republican and therefore must be either a fake Black or a fake Republican.    Maybe that you learned this today?   Great, another way to burn electricity and not get exercise.       They taste better in South Detroit.    Was she shot because of her party affiliation? Was she shot by an elected official?   I really can't see how this is supposed to outrage me.   Guns, imagine a democrat in favor of financial regulations for Wall street, opposed to long term foreign military entanglements and that the NRA has no problems with?     I think he provides balance. Whereas Warren will run to the left of Clinton on some issues and Sanders will run to the left of her on most issues, Webb will actually run to her right on some.          Don't we fund our government by taxing income in this country?   The kind of "weapon" he is carrying is irrelevant, if he was a twelve year old white boy from Kentucky and was carrying a .22 rifle and cops did this, a whole different group of people would be outraged that his second amendment rights had been violated.     It would seem that witness numbers 10   46 were at entirely different events.    He is also a villain in the Marvel Universe.  http://marvel.com/universe/Mather,_Cotton   And 70 times more likely they are right handed.    Who the hell uninstalls Skyrim?!?   5 out of 6 white murder victim are killed by whites. Statistically, if you are white, you should be more worried about being killed by white people.       Wouldn't you have to know where and when something was going to happen to do that?   Ted Cruz suggests Al Gore's running mate to replace Hagel as Secretary of Defense.         I actually feel kind of bad for the conservatives now, as long as the emails were missing, they could fantasize about what was in them, now it'll be Benghazi all over again.    Pretty sure if Fox News had been around back in '65, they would have ran a headline something like this for LBJ.      Did anybody chicken pick before Jerry Reed?      No way man, no way!   Do I understand that there was something like 60 people living in 22 houses, subsistence farming on a little over 11 acres of land with stone age tools and they were considered the elites?     Was he a real mellow type who smoked a pipe?   It's a free lunch, eat it or don't eat it.    And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not vex him.  But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.   There are competitors to the BBC, like Sky News.            Wouldn't it be cheaper to just have public stonings?   That sounds a lot like L.A. Noire without cars.     A Democrat who supports abortion and absolute gun rights, interesting.   But there isn't a "hands off policy" for immigrants with "extensive criminal backgrounds".     ABC, CBS   NBC are refusing to carry his speech tonight, but he is an emperor.         NewsNight with Aaron Brown hasn't even been on for nine years.   So some people are nearly two hours away from a McDonald's?   And Nord Mead, at least in Helgen.   But what if amongst those ten guilty that go free are John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy and Jeffrey Daimler, wouldn't more innocents ultimately suffer?   And we all know how well that worked out.               Al Sharpton has run unsuccessfully for elected office on multiple occasions, but has never been a member of Congress.            "Every time there's a Sean Bell or a Ferguson or a Trayvon Martin, we go through my taxes."         Going with possum.   Of all the places to look for OTR, for some reason it never occurred to my to look at Grooveshark.      	199
 AIDS - Alcohol Induced Drizzle Shits  I read it on a bathroom stall once   "16 other discussions" well reposting this turned into a thing   /u/DMRage, It seems you have found yourself in the Vikings Bridgewater circlejerk! Welcome my friend! Here we believe... no... we know Teddy will be the greatest Viking since Leif Erikson (hinga dinga durrrga). All posts denying our bridge over troubled water will be mercilessly down voted by delirious Vikings fans who have nothing to do but root against the Packers, and scan all forums for talks of how great Teddy is. So grab a Grainbelt, serve yourself some luttefisk, and get ready to put what little hope you have for football enjoyment into the T man himself. Because we just can't take another dissapointment.  Signed a purple people eater for 26 years, /u/test_subject2317  Skol   Ah yes, the ol [finding yourself redaroo](http://www.reddit.com/user/Zerei)  	4
    That is a very silly comic.    I might get down voted here, but I'm with you in that I'm not as crazy about the Iron man films either.    Have you seen the new Robocop?     The "hey I loved the movie is (like I stated) nostalgic, and also very subjective - which is completely valid. Movies by their very nature speak to different people in different ways.    But I would still reiterate that movies are not black and white.  We love movies because they are so multi-dimensional.   I would go back to my article (and give me more traffic ;) ) by emphasizing that it is the soul of the film that matters most.   With your reasoning (Murphy's death and Lewis gender/race), nothing short of the Paul Verhoeven film would suffice - and I'm not sure if I'm crossing any lines here, but I think that a highly faithful adaptation would just come off as imitation Verhoeven/Robocop.  Which would ring extremely false and very disingenuous.  That's why I wouldn't defend say... the Total Recall remake or the Red Dawn remake.    This film tries something new.  The vital parts of the film that you refer to is that he dies - how he dies is interpreted by the directors in different ways.  The vital thing about the partner is that there is a tether to his earlier humanity - not race or gender.  Those are just superficial.  The film also seems to have a Fellini-esque quality, where the marketing team is imagining how to "design the product" for a larger audience.  Maybe Padhila is commenting on the bullshit marketing that they think WE like.  I would even caution to guess that maybe their would be a certain segment of the audience that wants a Robocopo more like the original EM-208.  ;)  All I'm saying is, if you give the film a chance, you might notice that it's actually trying to be about something.     Completely inventive use of squibs.  	4
 You clearly haven't thought about J.J. Watt playing next to Aldon Smith.  QBs would *die*.   Yeah ... that'd be a nice replacement for Justin Smith.   That really set the mood of the whole game.  The Niners were there to *hit* people.   That site isn't exactly a bastion of quality journalism.    the Nissan Cube's weird back window thing.  There's a lot more wrong with the Cube's appearance than just its back window.      It looked like a suicide bombing - who were the Chilean's going to go after?  The killer was dead.    I don't know if you're implying that the French supplied a lot of troops or if they had a part in the leadership of the Army.  They did.  There were almost as many French troops at Yorktown as American, and the fleet that won the Battle of Chesapeake Bay was entirely French.   There's no camping at the trailhead itself, but there's a nice campground called "Domingo Springs" a quarter mile beforehand.  Best water you'll ever taste, there.   Seems doubtful.  Sim's entire male family would have to die first - he's got three older brothers.  "Poet Killer" refers to the sword, and I think someone used it to kill Sim, whom Kvothe then avenged and took the sword (which is possibly Cinder's).    I'm surprised by the amount of electricity across the parts of the South which can get well below freezing many times during the winter.  There's a difference between "occasionally goes below freezing during one season" and "gets below free 50% of days of the year."  It's in the latter case the electricity becomes much less economical.    While flipping through a book at work a few years back, I found a "Merry Christmas" letter from Paul Newman to my boss (who worked in the film industry a long time), dated 1975.  So that was interesting.   He's lying - they're deep-sea fishing poles, to help feed the crew.    'There are three things all wise men fear: the sea in storm, a night with no moon, and the anger of a gentle man.'  I love the fact that Rothfuss quotes are now being tossed about as deep wisdom.   El'the is the highest rank.    Even being born and raised here I don't like Nevada as a whole.  Funny how often I hear that.  I know a bunch of people from Reno, and I don't think any of them actually like it there.    Does vaccinating make everyone safer? Yes. Does that make it okay to force people to do it? No.  Make an argument against mandatory vaccination that can't be made in favor of allowing drunk driving.   I thought I'd offer it here first, instead of trying eBay, where the interest might be limited.  It's in *decent* shape, though it has a torn overleaf with an old dedication, and minor water damage around the corners of some of the back pages.  It's the 1890 printing, and has a lot of really great illustrations.  It's been collecting dust on my shelf for twenty-five years, and I figure someone here might be interested in it for historical or decorative purposes.  **PM me** if so.  Here's some pictures:  http://imgur.com/a/DXD3e    So you'd have to stay in Chester or near Lake Almanor to stay in the prettier parts of the area.  The hills south of Almanor are pretty ravaged from the Chips Fire, and then Sierra Pacific going in and clear-cutting.    Ah, yes, "Just Turn Overs," along with such illustrious company as Ken Dorsey and Cody Pickett.    Depends on how much effort you want to go to.  - A handful of pebbles from Glass Beach - Avocados and almonds - Wine from Napa or Sonoma, and some Sierra Nevada beer - Emu or ostrich jerky  - A postcard from San Diego, since I'm guessing proper Mexican food wouldn't survive the trip.  Maybe some good flour tortillas. - A sliver of redwood or sequoia bark, picked up off the ground. - A ticket stub from a San Francisco street car. - A few grains of California gold, in a small clear glass vial filled with Feather River water (hell, I can provide that one). - Some Ghirardelli chocolate. - Absolutely nothing whatsofuckingever to do with Fresno, Bakersfield, or Vacaville.   There are, to be honest, far more beautiful lines in the KKC.  I just can't bring them to mind.  But Rothfuss sure knows how to sing a passage.   It seems a lot more likely that Roderic is the King to be killed, and that the Jakis family was trying to poison the Maer.  Remember, Caudacus mentions visiting the Jakis family estates not too long ago.  I think Bredon is a human agent for the Chandrian, myself.  I also think Dagon is a disguised Chandrian - perhaps even Cinder.    I do want to give it to someone in like dire need and all.  Then don't worry about me - I've just been scrounging around online trying to get some money in my PayPal account.   I could use about that much in my PayPal account ... it's not for anything remotely important, I've just got my eye on something and the seller only takes PayPal, and my linked checking account is overdrawn for at least two more days.    At least that's what Palosczi-Horvath writes in his Krushchev biography, it's an old book and maybe there's better scholarship nowadays.  You'll want to read William Taubman's *Khrushchev* (2003), then.  The secret speech was the results of months of research instigated by Khrushchev, and largely written by him with help from a few others.  Written and re-written, and passed around the Presidium before it was delivered (by a day or two). Malenkov didn't seem to figure into it, and was already well on his way down, with the attempted coup sort of his last gasp.   Way to stay on top of breaking events there, OP.   Lassen National Park, I suspect.  Lots of active vents, decent hiking, and a great resort to stay in (Drakesbad).  Though it's too late to book a room now.   When gathered around the fire before the "assault" on Ambrose's rooms, Kvothe notices that Devi is wearing Denna's jewelry, and when he asks where she got it, she says "A pretty young man used it to settle his debt to me."    Pretty sure he was just in way over his head.  He came across as too perfectly naive, and did so in a way that kept upping the ante.  Like his earlier acts didn't work, so he had to lay it on a bit thicker before Denna helped him.  Much like Kvothe, I don't think Denna is as world-wise and clever as she thinks she is.   "Sacrifice Fresno" is always the right answer.   Gun owners in California are *also* not like Jews in Nazi Germany.  And you have yet to show any rationality or truth, beyond repeating that phrase over and over like some talisman that you don't actually understand.   "Stairway to Heaven."  It's not even a very good song.    Yes, that would be an entitlement is everyone was given firearms for free.  ... uh, that directly contradicts your own previous statement that an entitlement is "guaranteed access."  A right would be the freedom from being forced into not being able to own them. Like the Nazis did to the Jews under the Third Reich ect  Well, that was fast.  Because gun owners in America are like Jews in Nazi Germany.   Well, you've certainly proven your point with great eloquence and evidence.    Guaranteed access to something is called an entitlement, not a right.  So guaranteed access to purchasing firearms is an entitlement, not a right?  You know, by your logic.   Found the single-issue voter.   Because Putin has really scored success after success in the whole "international relations" scene.   That would involve a massive jump in personnel - the RN has about 32,000 active members.  A *Nimitz*, including airwing, has a crew of over 5,500.  Even the newer *Ford*s, with increased efficiency of operations and automation, has a complement over 4,000.     If you find a tipo  ... was that on purpose?   I don't have the option of heating food up for lunch at work, so I love making cold pastas - which rules out anything tomato-sauce based.  Either I make:    Quickly boiled rotini (cold pasta is best with a bit of bite); mixed with shredded deli-sliced ham, pepperoncinis, kalamata olives, red onion, feta cheese, salt, pepper, and a bit of mayo for a sauce.  or   Udon noodles, finely chopped green onions, chicken or fried tofu, shredded cabbage, slivered almonds, and a dressing of sesame   peanut oil, soy sauce, crushed or powdered ginger, powdered garlic, lemon juice, rice vinegar, and fine-ground white pepper.    De Wault and Bosche are good for drills, but the latter is an expensive brand.   If you're looking to save a bit of money, Milwaukee has been making good drills - and other power tools - for a while now.  And for very casual use around the house, Ryobi is fine.  Black   Deckers just fall right the fuck apart, though.   ... well, guess I know what I'll be doing tonight.   I've repeatedly tried Chrono Trigger, and can't get more than five minutes or so in.  After FFIII, Chrono Trigger just feels so ... childish.  The sound and music are a bit harsher and less pleasant, too.   In a true post collapse where we needed to be truly self sufficient wouldn't having things like seed or building materials/skills, knowledge of farming, water reclamation, electrical skills etc be a more relevant bartering items?  Sure, for the first few years.  But after some point, you're going to want a universally transferable currency, and history has shown that people prefer precious metals for that.  It's mostly an illusion, but if everyone plays along, it becomes real.    I'm Ryan, a Scotsman living in southern England.  That is so cliched.  And could not he have avoided unnecessary apostrophes?    the best of all has probably been Tim Couch,   Derek Andersen was *OK*.  For a season.  He was hilariously bad in Arizona, of course.   I don't know about conning Kvothe, but I definitely think she got scammed by Geoffrey, when she paid off his debt to Devi by giving him jewelry.  He may even have split the difference with Devi.   There are a bunch of towns mentioned as being near Newarre (Rannish   Baedn, for example), and a few mentioned as being near the bandit camp (Crosson, etc.), but no overlap.  The map found in the bandit camp also seems to imply a great deal of distance from any town, unlike the short walk Bast takes to get to the lightning tree.  There's a greystone near the lightning tree, which Kvothe would be sure to notice at some point when dealing with the bandits.  And, most importantly, the lightning tree is on a hill, the bandit camp was in a small valley (a "bowl" as Kvothe describes it).  There's just nothing to connect to the two.   Of course it does.   Target will probably just cut her a five-figure check to go away, and if she's smart she'll take it.   "I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream."  Look it up, find a free copy online, and weep.   It's California - I'm always worried about fire danger, and not because of dry lawns.  Hell, a dry lawn will flame up and burn out in like five minutes, without spreading.  It's all the dry brushland and forest that's the problem.   "Die Hard."  I'd just want to see how that worked out.   I'd have to do something useful for at least an hour.   Drank a beer.  By the time I finished, reddit was back, and I was in the proper mindset to enjoy it.    Generally you cut wood 2 years prior to burning anyway.  If it's green, yes.  If it's standing dead, you can burn it right away.  This works great for lodgepole, which matures and dies off rather fast.    I love anything pretty much by Lois McMaster Bujold.  Bujold writes the best dialogue in sci-fi, and damned near the best dialogue in any genre.  Miles negotiating with the hostage takers in *Komarr* ... just brilliant.   Meh ... Jack McDevitt is great at writing 3/4s of a book.  He really has trouble with his endings - like he had a great, epic idea, but doesn't know exactly what to *do* with it.   It also doesn't have any missiles attached, so it's not Russian enough.   Sacramento is halfway to everything, which puts you in a great spot.  I can't recommend anything on the coast, since I'm not familiar with it, but don't forget that it's not just the ocean that has good beaches - there are plenty of large lakes within a 2-4 hour drive.   Overlapping fields of fire, combined with sloped walls that helped deflect artillery fire.   There's no such thing as blowing money on booze.   I didn't.  It's a perfectly useful online social tool, and most of the aggravation that people have with it is self-created.   A family - two parents and two young children, came in, sat down, and were perfectly quiet during the entire movie.  As was the rest of the audience.    They would have preferred OBL to remain alive to make Obama look bad.  It's not so much that, as that it didn't happen while Bush was President.  Because, you see, Jesus Cowboy Bush was just *supposed* to bring in bin Laden, "Wanted Dead or Alive Poster" style.  And when that pre-conceived narrative didn't happen, they just couldn't handle the reality of what *did* happen.    that these guys were able to master it.  Except the Germans never even came close to mastering it.  The GZ was poorly designed, and likely would've been target practice it it'd ever tried to sortie out.    Bush came on TV and straight up said "Osama bin Laden. Afghanistan." Then a couple months later, it was just "Hussein. Iraq."  You sort of had to live through it - the right-wing media hate machine was in full force against anyone who questioned invading Iraq.  And a lot of Yellow Dogs (Democrats who voted for the war) spinelessly went along with it, making it that much easier to utterly demonize anyone who said so much "Hey, this just might possibly be a bad idea."    it doesn't tell me how to find a fire-extinguisher-checking-professional   That'd be the nearest Fire Department.    I can't believe *The Walking Dead* has been lying to me.   ... but seriously, this is a huge problem with post-apocalyptic fiction.   They're just hoping you'll be the one to get pulled over when you get near Colusa.   It poured like hell for about twenty minutes ... and then stopped.   Ambrose can't become king unless the Maer is dead first, which you seem to rule out.  Lerand Alveron is in line to the throne immediately after anyone in the Calanthis family.  Although I do agree that Ambrose and his father are trying to murder their way to the throne.  Arranged shipwrecks and duels being the case so far, as well as trying to poison the Maer (and the Chancellor, making Hemme the new Chancellor).   Fine - tell me by what metric *you* would define "Worst division in the NFL."  Because I'm guessing "Anything that doesn't have the NFC South as the result" is your answer.   How about a really horrific point differential?  I mean, -227 for the division is atrocious.  Only the AFC South is close to that bad, and both South divisions have about twice the negative point differential as the next worst division.   There had actually been a series of minor and medium sized eruptions over the course of the previous year or so.  This picture led to a huge-assed mushroom cloud that could be seen throughout northern California - just GIS for "Lassen Eruption 1915".      It's colloquial, kind of like saying "Canadian Goose/Geese."  Its like calling a jackdaw a crow.   #3232;_ #3232;   Where they're usually just called a Bluejay.  And they're persistently annoying as hell, especially in the morning.   My parents always kept soy sauce in the lazy-susan corner style shelf in the kitchen, for years at a time.  Never went bad.   Was that the split-screen one?  Because it looked really cool, but I never got around to playing it.   That is correct, they didn't.   Gone?    How is the NRA extreme?  Have you actually listened to them?  We're talking about the people who literally think the UN is going to come rolling in any day to seize everyone's guns.  Just look at the foaming-at-the-mouth NRA whackjoberry over the UN Small Arms Treaty a few years back.    As an inner city healthcare worker, how many injuries do you see from assault weapons and high capacity magazines?  That's a good question, unfortunately the Republican controlled Congress of the late-90s banned any research into this.  It's almost like they didn't want to know the answer.   If this represents a $1.00/hr. raise, and if every employee was working a full 40-hours a week, 52 weeks a year (which, at a pizza place, I really doubt), this would be a $25,000/yr. increase.  That's ... about the price of one full time, min. wage employee.    Yeah, I'm thinking this place was going under anyways, if it's operating on such a narrow margin.   Taking baths with my sister.   With actual puppet strings, that are edited out in real-time.  The crowd gets bribed, because that'd probably cost a lot less than the absurd profits made from this fight.   Nothing.  It's just ... man, don't worry about it.  It all just sucks.  Have a drink then have another one.  Then another one.  Shit's just fucked up.   So, nothing of value.   Best:  I don't recall that ever happening.  Worst: Coming home the other day and finding the power turned off.  Woohoo! Yay for being broke!   Give it to me, I actually need it.   Despair and alcohol.     I found that the Ringworld series did much the same thing.   Niven is a classic case of an author being overtaken by the Brain Eater.    Yolks have the funkiest of tastes  I've never read something so fundamentally wrong in my life.  You've never enjoyed using toast to sop up the yolk from a fried egg?   *Gentlemen Jole and the Red Queen*  Lois's blog post:  http://www.goodreads.com/author_blog_posts/8046824-new-book  An excerpt:  http://vorkosigan.wikia.com/wiki/New_Book_Spoilers  A *very* interesting bit of information:  http://servantofclio.tumblr.com/post/115623389286/as-ive-noted-i-attended-a-reading-by-lois   This may be old news to some (date March 16th), but I didn't see anything about it here.   Unless you live in a small town, in which case it's strange *not* to see them.  I mean, there were only like thirty total teachers from Kindergarten up through High School.  And a lot of them had kids that were friends of mine, so I'd go over to their houses on a regular basis.   Well, I don't know about him, but I'm making aluminum ingots as a trade good after the collapse of civilization.   ^Either ^that ^or ^I've ^fallen ^asleep ^on ^the ^couch ^a ^few ^times ^while ^cooking ^on ^high ^heat.   Even OKC is now more than twenty years ago.   Kvothe isn't, but his sword is, implying that he used it to kill a poet.   Newarre is in Vint; that's been pretty well established.    Anthony Davis and Mike Iupati over Earl Thomas and Dez Bryant (hell Dez or Demaryius)  Six of one, half-dozen of another.  Davis and Iupati really paid off.    He may well be Vashet's poet-king.  Vashet specifically says that her poet-king was from the Small Kingdoms.  I think Kvothe kills both Ambrose *and* Roderic - the first gains his reputation as a "poet killer," the second his reputation as a "King-killer."    The fact that Ambrose is a shitty poet doesn't matter.  Plenty of ass-kissers will likely play up his talent, making him into some kind of gifted poet.    I lived in San Francisco for a decade.   San Francisco is like California concentrate.  It doesn't entirely reflect on the rest of the state, except maybe Berkeley and Davis.   Oh, God, the cancer warning stickers.  They're on fucking *everything*, regardless of how little sense it makes.  Like, aluminum chairs.   Do you claim that Russian forces in Ukraine teleported to get there?    I still haven't made it out to Drakesbad and that whole region of the park. Going to explore that and the Juniper lake region (which I haven't been to either)  I usually don't encourage tourism but ... the east end of the park is better.  I feel kind of dirty for suggesting it, but seriously - head on up into Drakesbad and Juniper.    You're insane.  Just flat-out chicken-fucking insane.   Because clearly, the Russian military could be involved *inside Ukraine* without having to cross the border.  Somehow.    As I said before there is obviously Russian military in Ukraine  Which was my point all along.  but not the 100 long vehicle convoys.   I never said anything about 100 vehicle long convoys - you're the one that keeps bringing that up.  You're really obsessive about fighting a strawman.    OK.  Photographic evidence, video evidence, separatists admitting to journalists that the Russian military was helping, vehicles flying Russian flags ... I guess that's all meaningless.  Because you just *don't think it's true*, little Russia-bot, that's what's important.      Please show me a picture of the Russian military crossing the border. Not the Russian military in Ukraine.  You can't have the second without the first, unless you believe in teleportation.  Then again, you probably believe in all sorts of completely insane shit.  	112
 QI. I'm an elf and Stephen Fry is my Dad now. Best day ever.     No. The priest is the real father.    Mine's green. Can I stay? Perhaps as a sub-citizen?   I like food, booze and memes.   Brisbane, Australia.    Quentin Tarantino, Stephen Fry, Jack White.     Glad I clicked.     My folks managed a student accommodation complex. The washing machines were $1.50 per use. $1 and 20c pieces are close enough in size that they worked.   One day Dad goes to take the change out of the receptacle and finds 70c only and some clothes in the machine.  He took the clothes and when the girl came up to say someone stole her clothes he gave them back and said "Is there anything you want to tell us?".   Cue embarrassment, apologies, laughter and a promise she'd never do it again.     This guy is Australian. Medicare is our public health insurance provider. In our country that's actually about how much a therapist would cost, provided you don't have an addiction, at which point the government pays for all of it.   This is the facebook status of a friend of mine a week after he admitted to being an alcoholic:  "So now I have a GP, a social worker, a psychologist, an employment consultant, and a drug counselor all at no cost. Australia's not that shit sometimes."    Up+   This is my favorite reddit post ever.    Mixologist. Some bartenders are putting this wank on their resumes.  Just say cocktail competent.    TIL: frogs live 10-12 years in the wild. Can you imagine a frog's 10th birthday. Heh. Stupid frog. You don't have parties. Gribbit.    Don't try to make friends at uni. I'm about to finish my 4 years and I'm not taking a single friend with me. If it happens, cool, but don't plan on having 'buddies from college' when you are 50.    If you're confused about what to do, take 6 months off. Work, travel if you have the means. Working full time, even as a bartender or waitress will make you enough money to be able to save so maybe you can alleviate some of the financial pressure.    But that's all based on my experience.

 The uncyclopedia? What is this some sort of bing knockoff?   This goes for guys and girls *especially* on a first date: Do not be on your phone!   I love this episode, Barney's part is hilarious. "More marinara sauce!"  Really though, was Lily actually about to hop on a plane to Spain? Without Marshal and no money or plan for being there? This just gets glossed over but I bet if Marshal had found out about that it would've been a whole different story   Are you saying that first part is a good or bad thing? Because I think S6 was overall a little too serious   Good lord, this is the type of website we were encouraged to make in my 6th grade web design class. So awesome and horrible   The round mouse that they used? I hated those things   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wORpqiYJm84  This week's project   You have nicotinic receptors that neurotransmitters can act upon including nicotine. So nicotine directly acts upon your nervous system which is why you get so dependent on it. Of course this is my limited knowledge from phys class so an actual doctor should take it away from here   She wanted the genes   But then how will I install Chrome?   I am I will?      Observe other comments before you start commenting. See what types of posts people like/dislike on here. Also a good place for subreddits is your favorite tv show   First saw her in the hallway of my gen Bio class and thought she was cute. A month later she was at my apt because she ended up bein a friend of a friend. Skip ahead like 5 months and I invited her to  a party I was having out of the blue and she came. We dated for 8 months after that   On home for spring break atm and m'mom made shrimp stir fry. So tasty   Skateboarding has the coolest physics   Pretty much. At McDonalds I got a burn from the fish steamer that was on my wrist for years later. Plus all the hot oil jumping off the grill constantly. Usually not a big deal though   /r/paidforwinrar   Whatever that Greek place is in South Seattle, they make the best fries I've ever tasted   I'm from seattle area! If you like weird stuff check out Ye Olde curiosity shop in Seattle, it's right along the water. You're also within walking distance of pretty much the whole city, at least as far as touristy stuff goes. If you want to go hiking, the Cascade mountain range is about 40 minutes from Seattle so not too far   Like the other person said it depends on how much you'll be making. That is not too much debt though tbh   Watch this sub be trending tomorrow   You'd be surprised. At night when all those places close down there are crazy people everywhere, and it's usually when all the tourist/business people are trying to leave   The times I've been up to Seattle I swear it turns into a whole different place the minute it turns dark out. There's some crazy people there, and like you said this is right by the main bus stop   He's trying to forget the constant hunger   NPH once again kills it with the acting at the end. He conveys that feeling of regret so well I can feel it everytime   Hopefully with proper spelling   Reminds me of the Portlandia sketch. You should have set him free   It's like the combover but the combfoward   that's usually how things get worse   It's a desert with nothing there besides Spokane   Someone want to explain this to a noob like me?   Thanks for your time. I'll be goin to the doctor soon   I don't think she was perfect I just think she was one of the few characters on the show that was a legitimately good person.  And she was finally a girl that Barney wanted to respect and someone he could live up to. Barney should have been allowed to get a girl like that   Yesterday my friend pointed out they look a bit yellow, and looking in the mirror they are definitely not quite white. I know that's a sign of jaundice but it just seems very unlikely. I'm a 22 college student, and yes I drink but I'd say an average amount. Any help?   *glass shattering*   I just think it should be removed all together. I don't llike any laugh tracks though   It still adds to cost though, and that's just one small example   How about we just stop spending money on things we really don't need at the moment. Looking at you oldbookieturnedstudentcenter   Slow down there you're flooding pics with too many quality pics   http://imgur.com/Z2dM9pl,BalGPVx#0  http://imgur.com/Z2dM9pl,BalGPVx#1  And here it is at Fairchild AFB. I'll upload more piCs if anyones interested   Dr Thunder   How about Tab cola?   I mean Barney Hooked up with Katy Perry and Brittany Spears so I don't know about that. I agree though Ted and Zoe is my least favorite. Just makes zero sense   That's what I'm sayin. Dark at 4:30 is seriously depressing. And who cares if it is dark in the morning   Often times you don't get very high your first time because the receptors in your brain aren't as activated as they could be. And you are more prepared the second time   Fair enough. I'd personally recommend trying it more than once but no big deal   Well good on you for being a responsible parent      Corpuscle   Now there's a jump in comedy   Absolutely. I feel like you are focused on one aspect here. This is a massive show and they did a great job constantly tying ideas/jokes in with each other. Some of their subtle references to other parts of the show are genius. And yeah they had their inconsistencies but nothing that ruined the show   Crocodile Dundee 3 totally holds up   Are we still talking about people?   The problem is it's really hard to keep a consistent pace for more than a bit sometimes. Things get tired and you have to move around a bit if you want to keep going   Ok that is pretty similar. Then again, there are tons of songs that sound similar to other songs   Looks like he made it. Clever bastard   Super Mario 3D land is super fun on nintendo wii u and very playable at any skill level   I've been to the midwest a few times and never saw anyone guzzling down mayonnaise and gummy bears   If this is real post it in response to the top comment    That makes no sense though. he attempted to move that stuff around to a better spot and they threatened to fire him? He probably got fired for taking his phone out at work   I think at this point its just like saying Kleenex or jello. I dont think people are idiots for saying the word gopro theyre not trying to advertise for them   It's not. And instead of the last 10 of these pics being posted in the OG thread karma whores have to make their own post so everyone can suffer   Star Wars Battlefront, the game I've played hundreds of hours. I remember in 8th grade my friends and I counted down the days for the 2nd one to come out. Of course, it's all about Bespin Platforms and the sand dunes level. Then space battles on the second one   wastedgifs and michaelbaygifs   Well it was definitely in America too so I guess everywhere   Came in here to say that definitely is Century Link not Scotland    Twitch plays pokemon is what got me here. My username is after Lord Helix   6' and 150 lbs. Tryin to build more muscle mass though   Of course. Western films, cowboys, jazz, clothing, culture within the states, grunge/punk, cars. It goes on   I live in a college town, 2 summers ago there was an entire block of houses on greek row that opened up their lawns to one big party. There was easily over 500 people there, the street was totally filled with people, the houses were crowded and beer pong in the lawns. I could hear it all the way from downtown which is like a mile away   I kinda think this is really dumb. For one he's 20 years older, he's wearing a hat and sunglasses, and they wouldn't be expecting him to just be there   This is more of a myspace mirror shot   Not as cool as /r/28thworldproblems   Drunk me says it's... good! That right pinky toe though is like an entity of its own tho   Maybe this is the lookout cat while the other cats TP the yard? So many unanswered questions   This non non-alcoholic beer has alcohol in it   Knox claymation videos on Youtube. Not a site but seriously those were freakin hilarious   I remember for one glorious day I was the best in the world at that game. Oh how I lived   So we're just a couple a white people?   I'm fine with the location, dorms can walk there easily etc. I don't like the proposed uses though, either. It should be turned into something we don't already have, we have more than enough gym space. I seriously doubt this would alleviate much from the rec, they would just both be incredibly crowded   As your lawyer I have to advise you stop all further comments   Without being quantitative here I seriously think they drink every day to some degree or another, sometimes starting at about 8am. It's hard to tell what days they actually are in the bar since there's no definitive time line in the episodes. Some episodes span over weeks while others are days. Or in the case of season 9, about 10 minutes lol   I'm just waiting for the day someone either comes into my house at night or there's like a classroom hostage situation. Haven't decided on if I want to be the big guy on the news or humbly walk away from the situation yet though   The trick is to just stay on the edge   OP had the Breaking Bad filter on   KenM is a genius   [Sup bro](http://imgur.com/jJpJok1)   Considering everyone is getting the same degree/striving to the same goal I don't see how that matters at all. But based on your grades I think you can kindof guess how you are doing compared to others   I love this episode. Jorge Garcia playing the Blitz was hilarious like when he yells out the numbers from Lost. I also like this episode because they travel around alot. Seeing them in the bar and Ted's apartment gets kindof old after awhile but them driving around was pretty funny.  And seeing Barney's cardboard oven "I should probably disconnect the gas then"   -19 karma and gilded 3 times? That's gotta be some sort of record   What was worse is we had already heard all his songs 100 times. THEN they hit the radio, made it like 1000 times   dat double filet o fish is where it's at   Probably because they are far more expensive than other sports cars. Last time I checked a Mustang is like 20k less. And many people in their 20s seem to drive WRXs and used BMW's   I know some people who were offered lower management positions because they had degrees, one of which wasn't even in business or anything. I don't think getting a full time job will be too difficult for you because they need those people here, not just students who can work weekends   And the first time Lily is in his apartment he notices her by looking at the wall? Seems like it's implied that there is a mirror there or something reflective   Mentally. Getting an A in anatomy. It's the only A in a science class in college I've gotten and it took serious time   I think not at all. For one, even with all the knowledge at my fingertips I hardly look it up. In fact I'm sitting in a library right now with enough books to easily become a heart and brain surgeon but I'm not reading them because I'm not motivated to on my own. School has structure, and teaches you how to learn things, and you can interact with others. And if you've ever taken an online class you know they're just not as enjoyable as the classroom setting   I used to think this was the most boring show of all time. So wrong, I can't describe it the show is just amazing   I wonder if that's on his resume   I have terrible posture when I walk but when I actually remember to walk up straight I feel manlier   Seriously. Does the word porn mean something else? Maybe, but in this day in age especially on the internet it ultimately means one thing, and that's porn   Was just watching this episode and it's pretty extreme how Ted pulls this off, really to the point where Robin wants to date him less than she already did.  Not just renting the blue instrumented band but it also looks like there's about $100 worth of roses in the room. I guess looking back it just seems like Ted really was desperate for her   I believe its S2E4 Ted mosby-Architect.  Robin says one watch through was more than enough for that movie   Not nearly as awful as "Well, it the bug room, Ted. Your ass just got bugged."   Or when Robin did the flip on Stella's daughter's bike trying to get back to the news station   Or when they sit on the table, and ask why when you tell them to get off. How bout 0 respect and that table costs more than your life   If I win I will flood /r/randomactsofpizza with pizza      I loved Robin all the up til about season 8. It started with her yelling at Patrice which I just found really annoying. Then in Season 9 when she was fighting with her mother in law the day before the wedding was not funny it was just painful.  Finally she just continued to be independent to the point where she only cared for herself  	110
 I heard about a tweak the first week of the iOS 7 jailbreak on r/jailbreak that enabled everything going to the a5 processor on the iPhone 5s to be routed to the m5 processor instead. This in turn is supposed to make the phone a little bit laggy, but give amazing battery life. About two weeks later, somebody asked the same question as i am asking here, but it went undiscussed. Does anybody know anything about it?   What if he didn't stack those rocks and they were a naturally occurring phenomenon? [Relevant](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AYFD18BwmJ4 desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAYFD18BwmJ4)   Legion Commander! Nice loops, do you use cinema 4d to do this? Doesn't that require some pretty powerful hardware?   Am I the only one that thinks this looks like a cold/boring place to live? Love the car though.   If I were you, I would have still gone after the parents for payment. This picture is ridiculous.      Multiple people at my school have iPhones and it is nice to be able to share a gif or photo/link without having to know their contact/number. I use it a ton.   The fingerprint scanner has never worked for me, I've always looked at it as a gimmick. But apparently, it works for 98% of the people at my school and on /r/jailbreak. The only way I'm using it now is with the new touch home app. It sends you to the home screen or multitasking switcher by just placing(not pushing) your finger on the home button, no touch id required.   	8
 I'm not worried about food or water. There's matches, lighters. That's not what I'm worried about...I did find something with a date. I found a lot of things. I'll post more in the next update. I just need some time. Please don't leave me. Please stay.   I don't want to know what it looks like. Hearing it was enough. I felt it. It was all around me. It was right behind me but it's nowhere. I WANT TO GET OUT OF HERE!   I'm okay. I think I'm alone right now. I hate being alone but...maybe it's better? I really really hope you're all friendly. Nothing feels friendly here. Nothing feels right anymore. Please stay!   I don't know, this computer is strange. Some programs are missing, others are...I'll see what I can do.   Oh god. I....I can't. I need more time. Something's watching. You might be able to see it too, I don't know. I'll post more later. I need more time. Please stay here.  	5
 Cub fucked my parlay.   CALM DOWN RABID PATS FAN!!!         I swear to god, I wanna see Vin Diesel in space, or underwater.   Machida successfully defended plenty of Weidman's takedowns.  But once he got him down, he kept Lyoto on the ground.   [for people not getting the reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GTzHd1h47o)   Weidman is a big middleweight.  So big in fact, that Rockhold might not have a size advantage.   Enough people have done it though. All you have to do, is be bigger and stronger than him.   You can be an innovator, or an imitator.   Serra takes off his NWO shirt to reveal that it's mike Tyson underneath!   We put all the pressure of Belfour's Stanley cup on Turco's shoulders, and for years gave him a defense that consisted of an elite Zubov and a handful of spares. The defense never got back to the Hatcher/Matvichuk and Zubov/Sydor era. Hell, even a slow plodding Ludwig/Chambers type pairing would have helped Turco a shit load.   Belfour seriously spoiled us.  We've been expecting too much from our G's since he left, without offering them any help along the way.   I have in in dynasty.  The twins will probably give him some time to re-adjust after surgery.  Maybe after the all star break?      STOP YOUR LOGIC RAPE!   THAT'S WHY THEY CALL IT WINDOW PAIN!   Auction draft is best draft. Eliminates the luck factor of draft position.   I thought everyone agreed that it should always be white lettering with black borders.      DON'T TRY PAWNING OFF YOUR FAKE SHIT HOMEOPATHIC MACHIDA PISS TO ME!!!   better post that idiot bear that doesn't confess anything   every week?  Let's tone down the exaggeration a bit.   Also, she would make a great mom.   Vote for Pedro and all your wildest dreams will come true.   What's to understand?  Hot latinas dancing in bikinis was the whole premise of the show, right?   Do either of you have proof?  Because that looks pretty famine like to me, and not really a war zone.   The dyed hair:  calling card of irrational attention seekers.   WTF?  That's seriously fucked up.   Print out that web page and put it [on his door](https://rearwindowethx.files.wordpress.com/2014/07/knife-in-door.jpg)   At all. You think Anderson gets bored in his fights now? This shit will drive him insane. He'll want to break his own fucking leg.   Hahahahahaha!  You're a riot, Maury   Man, this guy laughs at everything.  It would be awesome to work for a guy like this.         Gonna give up after one little resurrection?   how did you land that job in the US?   ERA?  One major constitutes the beginning of an era?   probably the whole country.  We're too sensitive to have any fun anymore.   but also the toes, right?   Stars aren't in.  Hate the redwings. Yoga pants it is!   This was my hardest cut in my dynasty league, because he's been the anchor of a solid rotation for me.  But seeing his fastball not get over 85 is just too much to bear.   RIP in peace, OP's shit.   Just stick something up there and post pics.   wow. you're obviously not an ordinary 15 year old.   le mayo         They were rolling with a joke being made by sports radio guys. Just like any other twenty something year old would do.   Well then   He's gonna sign with Bellator just to kick Kongo in the nuts.   He didn't do anything. He simply implied that his wife is also slow at things.   It's that easy, buzzfeed. All you have to do is ask, and properly credit the OP. This lady is a good example for every journalist to follow.            This is fucking solid.  Now, to get more attention to it, put it in an imgur link and post it to /r/funny, because that's where non funny stuff goes for attention.   He should move up to 185 and fight Lyoto in a Karate vs. Karate match.  Lyoto would probably still be undersized, lol.   Seriously. Thus is the most spoiled and entitled attitude he can possibly take. If this person is indicative of the current generation, thus country is fucked. Don't forget to complain that Mexicans are taking all the jobs after you refuse those jobs because they're beneath you.   that's pretty much /r/progresspics in a nutshell.  Fat guy loses 180 pounds?  200 upvotes.  Cute girl loses 15 pounds?  3000 upvotes.   haha. ok, now that's pretty funny   Never heard of coke belly.  Always thought it was HGH gut.      Uriah Faber anyone?  Sure he was WEC champ, but the UFC strap has eluded him a few times. I truly believe he is the second best fighter in two different divisions.  Which sucks for him.   That looks like a champion to me.   Lol, poor OP thought his [serious] tag actually meant something here.   Well, Lyoto is a champion, so that comparison is not exactly fair.   If there was no ref on that day of the fight  wut?  That's literally the stupidest thing I've ever read on this sub.   Can't really hate on Daron for wanting a more active role, though.  He also has a great fucking voice.  For me, they went from being a band with one lead singer to a band with two leads.   System really did a great job of blurring the lines.   so, typical AMA then?         C-C-C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!!!!         Yeah, I love that they chose the cleaviest pic they could find.  Like there aren't other pictures of her out there.   a relatively successful internet message board  Either you're trolling with intentional density or you weren't around when major events happen on Reddit.  The Presidents of the United States, as well as many other countries have come on to do AMAs on this website.  Politicians, movie star, musicians, and revolutionaries have used this site as a platform for launching bigger projects.  But yeah, Reddit is relatively successful, I guess.   Yeah, for comparison, check him out in Southland Tales.  He was probably 240 in that.  In this movie, he's definitely over 280.  [Southland Tales](http://www.canmag.com/images/front/movies2006/southland1.jpg)  [Pain and Gain](http://cdn.wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/the-rock-dwayne-johnson-2013-588x400-529x360.png)  A different movie, but still, you get the point.   Wait, so a job seeker can contact a recruiter?  I always thought it was the other way around.      This is interesting.  I had honestly not thought about it,  I always thought it would be harder to set up shop in a different country.   Wow, thanks.   Honestly, I don't know anything about NGOs.  Do I just google "NGOs in India" or something?  Is there an international organization that you have to apply through?   Sorry about that. I'm in the U.S., and honestly would look to move anywhere.  Third world countries are doable for me.  I'm interested in any kind of job, really.  I'm stuck in a dead end job at the moment, with absolutely no prospects of advancements, in one of the most expensive markets in the country.  I will not be able to save money if I live here long term.  My work experience is varied, but always with small business.  I started out with a small computer store, which did mainly tech support and custom machines.  I worked for a medical equipment company, and now am in the jewelry business.  Basically, everywhere I went, I helped the company grow by actively taking a management role with a lot of responsibilities under me.  I ended up leaving each company because they were family businesses.  The problem is, that this is all I know how to do now.  I have no corporate or government experience what so ever.  I speak English and Urdu fluently.  But I am only literate in English.  I would definitely be willing to learn a new language for the right opportunity.  Is age a factor?  34M   Will carrying the Humvees like that fuck them up?  Stacked together, with seemingly no barrier between them?   I have a degree in Economics, and I've worked for small businesses for the past 15 years.  Some of those, I ran on my own.  Is there any demand for someone with that kind of experience?         So no one is willing to consider that Kari might be over rated?   nepotism    Comments that ask to push other comments to the top are fucking stupid.   Post all the censored news stories about her here.  People will see the cross posts.   So, since the white bread was already baked, does the double baking not ruin or burn it?   I know nothing of bakery and am quite frankly disappointed that no one has explained how this happened.   Her best role?   Not a confession. This bear has been raped worse than that poor wolf.   Submit the request to /r/upvotegifs   That guy is married to a muslim?  Wow.   I'm a Cowboys fan, and I fucking loved that shit.  Later on, not then.   What is ritual nudity? I need picture explanations to fully understand. Videos if possible.   I hope she doesn't get off on some bullshit affluenza defense   But you guys like Jimmy Johnson, right?   TBLOP sucks now.  They took off the list of porn forums for some reason.  Porn forums are the best.   HBO's Deadwood thinks that's cute.   **WHAT'S THE FUCKING SITE, OP?**   Even worse is the retard brigade that gets this shit to the front page.   WHAT?      Jesus Christ.  I almost forgot.  Thanks for the reminder.   Yes, the ref and nick Diaz both saw the end coming at the same time. But nick didn't wait for the ref. It's like, just in case the ref wasn't gonna stop it, nick was.         shut up      Well, it was illegally redistricted in 2002 in a non census year.   What a fat fuck.  I'm supposed to believe that this tub of lard is supposed to keep society safe from the criminal element?  What a fucking joke.   Elderly driver?   I especially liked her more because she pissed off Ronda's team so much and beat the shit out of Bazler after all that shit talk.   The fight that's not gonna happen, according to Chael?   The most responsible decision a Diaz brother has ever made.  He saved his brother a ton of hurt, and possibly extended his career.   Even funnier is the defenseman portion of the curve.  Trying to branch off or something.      subbed.  amirite?   Seriously, I don't understand why Google nerfed their image and video search results like that.   Bruh, it's always been a thing.   Fucking GOAT!   He really should be the highest voted one, since he is a primary inspiration of this sub.   I'm actually surprised that it only has 112 million views.   A few games?  I remember when players used to get suspended for 20 game stretches that extended into the playoffs and the next season for shit like this.   OH YOU HAVE AN UNPOPULAR OPINION DO YOU?  YOU BETTER CONFESS THAT SHIT, HOMIE.   Same fucking boat.  On top of that, when we travel we work 7 days.   Sounds reasonable.   That's some fucked up shit.  You don't have to like a guy, but you have to be an absolute piece of shit to want to watch someone's career end due to a gruesome injury in the octagon.  Fuck yourself.   The harmless label is being peeled back a little on HGH.  It is after all, a growth hormone.  It causes everything to grow, including your internal organs.  Google "bodybuilder HGH gut" and you'll see how harmless it is.   It's not free anymore?  I used to use this a few years ago, and it was at the time.   This will be reposted to /r/funny by /u/gallowboob.  Probably.   That's my specialty.   I remember you on TMZ "did I say allegedly?  I meant definitely guilty!"  One of the funniest things I've ever seen.   Oh my fucking god.  I would not be shocked either way if this was true, or if this was a long troll being played by the Gangster.   You heard it here first, folks!   Doesn't get more real than West Lynn   Lol, yeah Ted Haggard was the best   That's definitely the one.   It's quite possible that every single Pride fighter used steroids.   Bruce is ten times the announcer that his more famous brother Michael Buffer is.   Wow. Calling on Cecil Peoples for help in this one.   We're regulated by the government!   I downvoted.  /r/conformity      What's the word on Hamilton's suspension status? Full year?  a month?   only dreams now   So now that Truecrypt is dead, what's out there?   You could watch it all day.  So perfectly looped.   Calling it a dress avoids the need for pants.   But then, how would you karma?   Quite possibly the best sub remaining on this sinking ship.   Is this the Odell Beckham Jr. of frisbee?   Ellen pao!   Specimen?   It's Bill Pullman, you idiot!   I don't understand why shitty comments like that are voted up when they clearly add nothing of value.   more Hugh Thompson's  No need for a possessive apostrophe.  	163
 [This!](http://www.ratemypoo.com/)   I like it. Then there's the issue of obscurity. The aldmeri dominion is the only "alliance" which remains after the interegnum. This is easily dismissed as it is known that the alliances fell apart when Talos took control but why were they never, ever mentioned in any lore book? Surely someone would have written about the pact or covenant.   I always here about full moons and new moons etc and yes the game does have a lunar cycle and from what I can tell it increases their chances of spawning but they can and do spawn no matter the moon phase.   I am a werewolf and was bitten by an npc wolf the night after a new moon. I have seen countless wolves and blood fiends virtually every night. Lunar cycles don't matter!   For example, it was said that Cyrodiil used to be a jungle province until Tiber Septim reigned and leveled it during his conquering of tamriel. Yet in the game it is just as it was in oblivion.     Don't get me wrong I love eso and I love the entire series but zenimax did screw up some of the lore, sure they tried to explain it but the only people that buy it are those that have never played any other games in the series.   If you played and completed Daggerfall then you will remember that there were multiple endings to the story, Bethesda made it so they all happened, technically. Using a dragon break they made it so it was possible that any of them could have happened.    Any way Bethesda could use a dragon break to explain the faults in the lore in the next game.    Do you believe that we are better than other species?   I wonder, if you believe in evolution, if web will evolve any further as we no longer have a need. When animals change climate etc they evolve to survive there but we don't. We, rather than say growing fur, build a house and put a heater inside.   I maybe wasn't clear. I mean are we above other species or equal? Read [this](http://www.scottishpoetrylibrary.org.uk/poetry/poems/basking-shark)   The poet questions if we're justified in thinking that were above all others and wonders this because we have done so much damage whereas animals, like the basking shark, don't cause any trouble yet we think we're better than them.   Do you think we're above all other species? Do you think we're too arrogant? Do you believe in basic human goodness? Are we all "evil" inside? Tell me your thoughts.   I am young but since I was younger than I can remember I always wanted to be a medical doctor. I was inspired by my doctors who I saw regularly because of asthma and my twins doctors as he has cerebral palsy (only slightly).   Anyway I truly believed that's what I wanted untill only recently when I sat and really thought about where I was headed in life. I considered archaeology as history is my favorite subject and I could talk about it forever. Then I spoke with archaeologists and spent time in their company it was... enjoyable but not for me. Then it occurred to me - - history teacher. And I'm now working towards that goal.    ENGLAND!   There are 10 types of people in this world: those who understand binary and those who don't.   "There are many fates worse than death". This can also be said for murder and crimes.   Take rape for example. Let's say a woman is raped she will likely have a very difficult time recovering from the physical and mental trauma and even then she will have a tough time getting intimate with someone. It can often ruin lives.  Then again look at child abuse-be it physical, mental or sexual. I read a book once about a young boy in the states. The name currently alludes me. I don't generally read these kinds of books but it came recommend to me by a family member and it was relatively short.   It told the (true) story of a young boy who's mum started abusing him. He stressed how she and his father had once loved him and his brothers but the father began to drink and the mother began to abuse only him. She would beat him, starve him, force him to do things no person, let alone child should have to do.   This is evil. To do this to anyone is wrong but child abuse is simply evil.     I don't care it doesn't hurt me but it gets annoying all of the shit on tv and the internet.    Oh I loved her this season. Especially when she was writing "space hump chronicles" :D   Oh, sorry never thought of that. Of course I'll do it now.   Oh I agree, I always wondered about her.   Victims:   Tell us what happened. Who bullied you (avoid real names). Did you and your bully ever make amends?   Bullies:  Why did you bully people? What happened? Did you ever make amends?    Awesome, I never even thought to check for that sub reddit.   God this has been asked a million times! I like xbox.   I actually haven't checked, weirdly cause I absolutely love it!!      Is it ok if I roofie you?   You can't play as them in the standard edition so it's more of a status thing.   Well they're special because they were playable in all past games but due to the storyline they're kind of different due to the fact that the three alliances are fighting for control over their land -- Cyrodiil.  As for you wanting to go to borrowings you will have to reach level 50. Since you chose the Daggerfall covenant you begin in their controlled area. At level ten you get cyrodiil and as you progress you get more of your own controlled land but at level 50 the entire Mao will become traversable.   Hey all, me and my friend play on the European server and would love some players to play with. We're both from scotland and are open to voice chat. Both of us have played plenty of elder scrolls in the past so we know the lore.   We play in the ebonheart pact. I am a female dark elf and he is a male nord. I mainly focus on magic (dark magic, daedric summoning and storm calling). He is a nightblade who focuses on close combat (siphoning, assassination and shadow). We would like a cleric of sorts but we honestly don't care what you play as or focus on we just want to have fun completing the dungeons and playing the game. Also we don't care what level you are.   If you want to play with us feel free to message me on Xbox:   Devlin Fr3w99   I hope some of you get in touch but if not I hope you have fun playing anyway.      Don't reset after a wet dream. You can't control them but don't continue after you wake  up. Just let them pass and they'll stop.   s. puedo cambiar mi acento cuando hablo en lnea con amigos que viven en otros lugares , por ejemplo en Xbox   You too friend :)   Ja, ja , eso es gracioso cuando la gente no entiende . A menudo sucede debido a mi acento   Escocia. De donde eres?   Buenas fiestas a todos!   Tres bien merci. Qu en pensez-vous?   Ha, ha I love how you guys can have bbqs year round. I have family who emigrated there around ten years ago and they absolutely love it.   Ha another scot happy eater :)   It's up near the top right. It says start a conversation.   Ha, ha oh my god that's bad. Good luck explaining to him.   And to you! :)   Hi, I can give you a pretty great one, in my opinion anyway. I was a kid when I heard of this and it scared me for weeks but not so much anymore.  It's called: "Kuchisake Onna". It's an urban legend about a woman who's husband became increasingly jealous of her infidelity, he thought she was cheating. So he decided to take her beauty away from her by slitting her mouth from ear to ear giving her a permanent "smile", much like the joker in batman. He then killed her and she became a ghost.  I read about it in detail when I was younger it's kind of interesting.  I won't write the whole story but if you think it sounds good you can read it [here](http://creepypasta.wikia.com/wiki/Kuchisake-Onna) but that version is pretty short.   Wow we like a lot of the same areas of history. I suggest you go down to your nearesg library and go to the history section. I still love doing that. You can find some great stuff on almost all of the areas you listed. If you want me to list books I will happily.   It's Easter here in Scotland.   Aaaw but at least she learned how to lock pick.   Even though this is funny your forgetting that 2013 was a prequel to all oth e  games so she's is older on the right and is looking at the left and saying it's hideous.   Ha, ha! :D I love tomb raider and don't get me wrong this is funny but it was not fast! She changed gradually and her peak was around underworld but in 2013 and rise of the tomb raider she looks amazing!   Ok that sounds like fun.   Or Passover or whatever you celebrate at this time of year. I hope you enjoy your day/week.    Wow. I hope everything turns out ok OP. Update us soon, if it's not to inconvenient. I know you have said on multiple occasions that you have renounced god and Jesus but, if it's ok with you, I  like to say a prayer for you and your daughter? (Don't worry I won't write it :) )    Thanks for that but I don't think it's that since that headache was very short and according to that they last pretty long.   I think I might've over reacted cause today it's not nearly as bad as it was. When I shake my head now it hurts a bit but I think it'll go away. If it doesn't go away within a couple of hours I'll go to a doctor just to be safe.   Why get the money in gbp?   Ha, ha I was sorted into ravenclaw on pottermore and every quiz and reading the books I always related to ravenclaw more than any other house.   That way you'd make it to 65 at least.   Northeast Africa, southwest Asia.   If you give up ten you would live up to at least 75, not bad.   So I woke up and I never noticed immediately but my left I was pretty sore. Yesterday I got a very short headache (incase it's related).   I can't stand up fast or move my head fast without pain. It's at the back of my eye and its pretty painful whenever I move too fast. It hurts the back of the eye and the top of my head.   Also earlier I saw some parts of my eyesight as blurry, kind if hard to describe. I had to really focus to see certain things. For example look straight ahead then very slightly down and to the right. I couldn't see there.   I haven't been to the opticians in a while but I'm going soon please tell me if this is serious.   No, I meant after giving away one year you get a total of one million after giving up two you have a total of two, not three if you know what I mean? I understand how you thought I meant what you did.    Ha, ha :) it would be hard to end your life younger than it should be for something as, fake? As money but you have to admit it's importance in our world so I'd give  up maybe one year.   That makes sense you get 4m and still reach 80 years or so. Pretty decent.   That's reasonable.   So what would you trade knowing you'll love to 85 before you gave away any years?   Yeah let's just assume you will at least reach 85 and you will still be ignorant to the date  and year   Ok that's reasonable.   45 is still pretty young and fifteen years is a long time. I don't think I could ever give that up.   It's absolute so you can't like invest it then buy extra years and still be to h. When the trade is done its done.   Let's just say you will reach age 85 before you make the trade.   Do you mean 3 years or 2 million?   I think I'd say that too. So much can happen in a year but maybe I'd give up one  of my older, older years.   Yeah sure, half a year = half a million. Not to bad.   Wow, that was... disturbing?   ***EDIT 1*** Lets just assume that you will live untill you turn 85 years old and then after that you can die at any point. So you could die straight away or live another 20 years. It is absolute so when you make the trade it's done for good.   Not black per say. They weren't white or black they were a dark tan shade. Closer to black than white but kind of middle eastern looking, which makes since they live in the mid east.    I believe so. During the Scottish wars of independence William Wallace fought for our country (please don't take  everything you know of him from the movie braveheart as it is very historically inaccurate). Here he was considered a hero. He helped rid the country, temporarily, of English rule. However, in England he was considered a terrorist.    So to answer your question I think yes but it's very dependent. I do think it's rare however as most terrorists are unjustified and cruel but then again it depends on what you consider a terrorist.      I think smart phones. Using face time or even just calling someone would amaze them.   They've all had pretty terrible deaths, sad.   Half of us (Scottish people) are gladly run by fucking English dicks! I hate the English government and want to be  independent but we're the only country to have turned it down while others die for it.   Look at the people in the background, it's a painting.   I know what you mean but everyone should be able to love their country without shame. When I leave my country for long periods I start missing it a lot. It's this love for a country and everyone deserves to have this. I don't run around shouting woohoo Scotland!! But I do like knowing that I can be and am proud to be from here.    Easter :) Enjoy your week    The other day I wrote a post which someone reposted an  I see stuff like this all the time. Why do you guys do it?   Yeah cause this isn't a repost   That's horrible. You've lived quite a life and I wish you many more years of happiness and joy.   I'm sorry you all have to feel that way for what happened in the past. It's not your fault nor your grandmas. I hope one day soon Germany will get its patriotic pride back.   That's sad. I've read of people losing their entire life savings. Can I ask, if you don't mind, what he felt, thought or said when the new rentenmark came to be and he knew his money would never be worth anything again?   Not German but I've studied this in depth. Her answer will be better if they get a chance to answer you since there are so many comments.  Many people were against Jewish people even before the war, they were thought of as "the old enemy of Germany". Hitler, being a master of propaganda, used this hate for his own good. He made the Germans and anyone who opposed him look weak, greedy and selfish, only caring about themselves rather than the greater good of Germany.  Hitler was also very good to the German people. He provided free day trips and helped end poverty in Germany almost every person of age had a job of some sort.   People never saw him as evil because he did things that were good for them and his speeches were very hypnotic, in a sense that he was a great speaker. You also have to remember that he came to power during a very tough time for Germany so they got on board with some of his more radical policies.   Many people were ok with what was going on with the Jews because of their pre existing hatred for them and the propaganda that they couldn't escape. That's not to say some people weren't opposed to what was going on but speaking out was dangerous.  There are detailed cases of people being against Hitler's ways. One woman who's name alludes me made brochures of sorts and handed them out but she was only one woman and brochures took a long time to make. Communists were against him but like the Jews they were imprisoned and anyone else who had any doubts kept them mostly to themselves for fear for what would happen to them or their loved ones.   If they wanted a peaceful life in Nazi Germany they wouldn't speak against anything. They would hail Hitler when they passed in the streets, they would have a copy of his book "mein kampf" on their table when they were having company and they would make sure their children attended the youth programmes put in place by Hitler.   Your grandma seems like a great woman. I only have a couple of questions:  Did she join/was she forced to join the league of German maidens  What did she think of the state of Germany post wall street crash 1929? And then what did she think after Hitler rose to power and provided the country with his new social, economic and political policies?   Wow. Great job she sounds like a real bitch. I love how you handled the whole thing.   I think your dead... to your wife.  Just kidding go and talk to her and see why she did it.   Wow. What a beautiful painting.   Are you from the US cause it's supposed to be very, very common there.      What the fuck! Jesus Christ that's just wrong! Tell them no.   Prostitute         Yes!! I knew it. I knew I wasn't a sleeper agent!   I've the idea but I think th  game would be better with your story and character creation etc but with maybe 4-8 player co-op rather than a full blown mmo.   I see a map.   I say bith. I just kind of say them as they happen but I think most commonly I say day-tuh.   Happy Passover to all of you who celebrate it :)   How do I know I'm not a Russian sleeper agent??    Ha, ha now I'm scared. How do you know I'm not a Russian sleeper agent?   Wow! They are so lucky to be alive. Hopefully they'll learn to drive a bit slower.   Ha, ha I guess I never thought about where you live :)   I always thought they were like earth popping a spot.   Oh yeah! I never noticed that before.   Not necessarily. If I saw you now and said goodbye then died on my own in my house it would likely be a family member who would see me dead first.   Ha, ha don't worry about it :)   I've always wanted to visit the US since I've  been all around Europe. I'd like to go to NYC, California (LA), Florida and a few other states.   Have you been anywhere outside of the US   It will never happen were they are all immune to antibiotics but if it did most of humanity would die out and the ones who survived would have stronger immune systems than ever before after years of adapting but still life would be a pretty huge fight.   No I just say a prayer at night time, oh I meant pray ha, ha autocorrect.   I go to chapel when I can but I don't force it, I prey in times of need and thanks (I normally prey every night). Online I try not to say or do anything I wouldn't do offline and then the rest of my day is just a normal day by all standards.   Those that know binary and those that don't!   Well quite a lot of them are younger gamers who weren't playing games when they were released and so they never played them. Then they see people doing it on the internet and they've heard of the game so they just go along with it.   I don't know any racists per say. I've heard people say a racist remark every now and then but they've straight away apologised and you can tell it is a genuine apology. I'm white but I have many friends of different races. Skin colour isn't a choice, the way you act is.   It's pretty incredible to see how far the US has come. This time 50 odd years ago black people were considered to be disgusting sub humans. I mean it should never have been like that but at least the problem has been mostly rectified.   Wow that's a great find. I can't imagine how horrible life was like for most African Americans in those times. It messed many of them up socially and economically for life and for their generations to come.   Yeah I love it here. Like most people my country is the best in the world ;) in my opinion. Yeah it's nice, good cities nice countrysides and it's a generally friendly country.   Yeah but when shortened it is common to put WWII for world war two as the II is the Roman numeral for two.   You are inconsistent.   Ha, ha apparently so. I'm from Scotland it's not nearly as common here.   Sorry that is terrible but why did you put IIWW rather than WWII?  	119
 This is a national security issue         Like Obama said, it goes beyond publicly calling people "niggers"   I like that.

He wrote about it in the Audacity of Hope. I even quoted it for you.      Gotta have "science" first   Hey Reddit, Looks like I found the white supremacist!

It would be pretty stupid to lose the presidency by not doing something like pretending to be religious.  its important to a lot of people   I'm glad you think millions of racist white supremacists are mentally ill   Amazing interview   You sure?  Something I wrote a while back when someone said I couldn't "prove" barack is an atheist, or at least really someone who is privately very liberally religious.   gt;***About his mother*** *"This isn't to say that she provided me with no religious instruction. In her mind, a working knowledge of the world's great religions was a necessary part of any well-rounded education. In our household the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology. On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church, just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple, the chinese New Year celebration, the Shinto shrine, and ancient Hawaiian burial sites. But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part. Religion was an expression of human culture, she would explain, not its wellspring, just one of the many ways and not necessarily the best way  that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives."*   His biological [father](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama,_Sr.)?

Quotes like this and that [speech from 2006](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvKX16Eygs0) he did where he espouses his problems with referring to the bible show me that hes a closet atheist/very agnostic person that is playing the game of political musical chairs.  Don't forget this: http://i.imgur.com/BVt0i.jpg   He "found" god @ 26 as a community organizer in Chicago and if you know chicago, theres a lot of black people there and you're not going to get famous there, as black man, without the black vote which comes from black churches. He had to play the game.  Grew up in extremely diverse settings, i'm sure having memories of madrasas allowed him to contrast that with the radical christianity in america....  Hes one of the smartest presidents, *on paper*, that we've ever had. Remember, they tried to make fun of him because he went to the best schools in the country? I mean come on as if being a biracial kid raised by a single mother (even though she used to work for the Ford Foundation...LOL) isn't a massive hurdle in life.  Every chance he gets hes always promoting STEM fields and human achievement. Not willy nilly passive goals.   He rarely says that prayer influences his decisions a-la Bush 1 or 2, or even the possibly closet atheist that clinton was said to be. Faith is never a member of his team of decision makers.  When he forgets to pray people blow their lids off and call him unamerican. He left god out of the verbatim recitation of various historical [documents](http://theydontfoolme.com/118/three-years-in-a-row-obama-fails-to-thank-god-at-thanksgiving/) and [speeches](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/25/obama-god-thanksgiving-speech_n_1113295.html) and [9/11](http://mediamatters.org/blog/2012/09/11/fox-omits-the-facts-to-politicize-9-11/189827)  Hes not religious **At all.**  Every time he opens his mouth about christianity it sounds [forced as hell](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/21/obama-religious-quotes_n_1292116.html).

[Obama has had more secular groups at the white house than any other president](http://content.usatoday.com/communities/Religion/post/2010/02/atheists-meet-with-white-house-officials/1) , a point verified by many fundie-right wingers; so i'm sure they'd be honest about feeling threatened.

He trolls religion regularly. Its obvious. Why else do you think all the fundies are scared they would lose their privileges under him? [He even campaigned on eliminating faith-based initiatives](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/obama.faith.based/) but after the backlash following his election he was forced to backtrack and reinforce the initiative with a "faith office". On top of that, don't forget him trying to get catholics to pay for birth control...

Obama probably only distantly knew the guy. He had to more than likely only show up for appearances to make him seem like he was in touch with the community.   Here is a point we need to talk about... Jeremiah Wright was caught saying "god damn america"...[but you really don't understand what he was getting at.](http://www.timwise.org/2008/03/of-national-lies-and-racial-amnesia-jeremiah-wright-barack-obama-and-the-audacity-of-truth/) He was saying how utterly fucked up this country has been to minorities. Its true. You can deny it all you want, but he was highlighting a truth, albeit emotionally. He just wanted to say that America should really recognize their ways if they want to embrace Obama. Its kinda that "hey, they don't like me? well damn them!" Jeremiah Wright is not racist. Not at all. But you have to remember the bias white/right-wing america feels to anyone who talks about [white priviledge](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3812249801848706206) or exposes their messed up of institutionalized racism, so of course the clip was crazy. [Obama had to throw him under the bus to move on](http://articles.cnn.com/2008-03-18/politics/obama.transcript_1_perfect-union-constitution-slavery?_s=PM:POLITICS).  Black churches are the greatest source of networking in most urban communities, especially if black leaders are known to attend. Its all a game. I know in ~~Atlanta~~ every major city with a sizable minority population that many times, elected black officials only show up to church in times of election or when they need community support. They adopt a church home only to show their relation to the community. Its all for show. They have to connect with the people some how. Thats what a "representative" (in his case Senator) does.   Name a president who says this in his inaugural speech:       gt; *"We are a nation of Christians and Muslims, Jews and Hindus, and* ***nonbelievers.*** *We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth."*  He's already the negro, kenyan, socialist, communist, anti christ, who hates America.

In her mind, a working knowledge of the world's great religions was a necessary part of any well-rounded education. In our household the Bible, the Koran, and the Bhagavad Gita sat on the shelf alongside books of Greek and Norse and African mythology. On Easter or Christmas Day my mother might drag me to church, just as she dragged me to the Buddhist temple, the chinese New Year celebration, the Shinto shrine, and ancient Hawaiian burial sites. But I was made to understand that such religious samplings required no sustained commitment on my part. Religion was an expression of human culture, she would explain, not its wellspring, just one of the many ways and not necessarily the best way  that man attempted to control the unknowable and understand the deeper truths about our lives."*   His biological [father](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama,_Sr.)?

Quotes like this and that [speech from 2006](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvKX16Eygs0) he did where he espouses his problems with referring to the bible show me that hes a closet atheist/very agnostic person that is playing the game of political musical chairs.  Don't forget this: http://i.imgur.com/BVt0i.jpg   He "found" god @ 26 as a community organizer in Chicago and if you know chicago, theres a lot of black people there and you're not going to get famous there, as black man, without the black vote which comes from black churches. He had to play the game.  Grew up in extremely diverse settings, i'm sure having memories of madrasas allowed him to contrast that with the radical christianity in america....  Hes one of the smartest presidents, *on paper*, that we've ever had. Remember, they tried to make fun of him because he went to the best schools in the country? I mean come on as if being a biracial kid raised by a single mother (even though she used to work for the Ford Foundation...LOL) isn't a massive hurdle in life.  Every chance he gets hes always promoting STEM fields and human achievement. Not willy nilly passive goals.   He rarely says that prayer influences his decisions a-la Bush 1 or 2, or even the possibly closet atheist that clinton was said to be. Faith is never a member of his team of decision makers.  When he forgets to pray people blow their lids off and call him unamerican.

He trolls religion regularly. Its obvious. Why else do you think all the fundies are scared they would lose their privileges under him? [He even campaigned on eliminating faith-based initiatives](http://edition.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/05/obama.faith.based/) but after the backlash following his election he was forced to backtrack and reinforce the initiative with a "faith office".

Obama probably only distantly knew the guy. He had to more than likely only show up for appearances to make him seem like he was in touch with the community.   Here is a point we need to talk about... Jeremiah Wright was caught saying "god damn america"...[but you really don't understand what he was getting at.](http://www.timwise.org/2008/03/of-national-lies-and-racial-amnesia-jeremiah-wright-barack-obama-and-the-audacity-of-truth/) He was saying how utterly fucked up this country has been to minorities. Its true. You can deny it all you want, but he was highlighting a truth, albeit emotionally. He just wanted to say that America should really recognize their ways if they want to embrace Obama. Its kinda that "hey, they don't like me? well damn them!" Jeremiah Wright is not racist. Not at all. But you have to remember the bias white/right-wing america feels to anyone who talks about [white priviledge](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3812249801848706206) or exposes their messed up of institutionalized racism, so of course the clip was crazy.

Black churches are the greatest source of networking in most urban communities, especially if black leaders are known to attend. Its all a game. I know in ~~Atlanta~~ every major city with a sizable minority population that many times, elected black officials only show up to church in times of election or when they need community support. They adopt a church home only to show their relation to the community. Its all for show. They have to connect with the people some how. Thats what a "representative" (in his case Senator) does.

Its about actual survival. A lot of people submit to white supremacy and racism because they're too scared to speak out against injustice.    It never ends.  We have racist cops participating in Klan meetings, we have racist cops shooting at paper targets of black youth for practice, we have websites dedicated to white supremacy and subreddits that condone violence and economic oppression against people of color, and we have a media that refuses to even use the word "terrorism" or use unbiased reporting when it comes to issues addressing overt acts of vengeance against people of color  As a person of color...its tiring to have to defend yourself against all of these barrages on your character, your community and your desire to just be treated as normal.   We've fought for every war. We've participated in every level of government. We've clawed for respect and justice.

Remember this when people ask why the US military is so large.  A lot of these countries don't really need to invest large portions of their GDP into military efforts and since they all live next to each other in the EU, they all rely on each other more than the USA does...AND militarily, the US agrees to cover them anyways...AND they have higher tax rates domestically than the USA does.   the US has so many more incentives to doing business than 99% of the world though      this is based on CDC data   Young and religious.

 Precisely.    Thanks for the explanation. That's why I believe this is the best subreddit. However, could you please explain what one ought to look for in a cash flow?   If I lose 60% now, wouldn't that mean that all the future capital I will have would be at least 40% less than what I potentially could have. Or am I over-exaggerating?   Quite what I am worried about. But from a smaller base, I am worried of the % loss I will have as it will continue to grow further.    Thanks for the answer! Quick question:  Can I get in trouble for things that 'those individuals' have agreed to. If they agree 'I understand I may lose all my money', and then I they try to sue me for losing their money, will I get in trouble?   Thanks for the great answer. Exactly what I was looking for. I have two questions:  1) In how much trouble will I get into if I don't do anything (assuming that this remains a small thing and I don't have anyone go and sue me).  2) Can I get in trouble for things that the other parties have agreed to. If they agree 'I understand I may lose all my money', and then I they try to sue me for losing their money, will I get in trouble?  3) What are the chances I even get caught if this remains a small side thing with no 'lose all the money'?   PS. I consider myself a value investor (risk averse, long term), not a trader (speculation, high risk, potential for huge mistakes).   Family would as my father would want to see me earn my own money. Friends would because they have nothing better to spend it on, and many actually do have faith in me (whether they should or not is not for me to decide). I must stress again that this is not a massive mutual fund that I am starting, just a small side thing.   "living in France". Updated.   Hey r/legaladvice  I hope I am clear enough. If I fail to do so, please tell me so. I will keep it short.   I am a 17 year old and I invest (shares and bonds). I live in Paris, France. My question is a more legal one. I am interested in selling 'shares' of my portfolio, which would allow my 'partners' in the to see their investment grow and fall in par with my capital gains/losses. The people I want to join are simply friends and family who would be interested. I don't plan to make this a big thing, but I am still curious whether this is legal or not, and whether this entails me to any risks if I fail (I plan on providing a document on this).  Simultaneously, I do not want to register anything if possible. My goal of doing this is to increase the amount of capital to widen my options so I can invest in more securities. I am not planning to do so until I feel more comfortable and knowledgeable investing.  TLDR; I invest. I want other people to give me money. Their capital will track my portfolio (eg. my value +10%, their money invested rises +10%). They become minority owners of my portfolio, owning 'shares' of my portfolio/vehicle. They can sell the 'shares' to me or other 'partners' and earn/lose the difference. They have voting rights to the investment decision using their 'shares'. They sign document agreeing to all of this AND that they understand they may lose all the money.  ANSWER: After reading every single comment, many of them of very high quality, which I thank you for, I have been convinced that this is a bad idea for many reasons which merely appeared good to my young naive self. I will continue to invest and will allow people to loan me out money, but not in the way described above. I will however consider this in a year or two when I (hopefully) will be in uni in (hopefully) London, hopefully (hopefully) in LSE, where I will be able to have more opportunities open. For detailed reasons of my decision, read this great thread for those interested. Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen!   That is certainly a possibility. However, doesn't the Shanghai Composite currently look like a classic stock market bubble? About the US, could you please explain why you think its over-valued?   Personally, I am 17 years old and am preparing to embark into investing with around 1000 euros in start-up capital.  I know that time is my friend and in the long term I should be fine, but I am just worried about the significantly reduced compound growth I will expect if I lose a signficiant part of my capital in the beginning of my investment carrier. For example, if I lose 25% early on, all my future earnings will be significantly lower than what I could have had (around 25% less). I put emphasis on this because I am just going to start investing now.  If my reasoning/logic is wrong, please tell me more. I do not believe I am right, it is just what seems to me.  PS. And thanks for responding so quickly.   Hey there,  Being a 17 year old beginner, my analysis of firms is based on the 'teachings' from the II, which I have built upon (hopefully improved)*. I now assess firms on many different quantitative and qualitative metrics, but still based on the II.   However, I feel like there is a gaping hole in my assessment as I make no reference or use of cash flow. Throughout the II, cash flow is barely mentioned (and mostly in comments by Mr. Zweig).   However, I believe it is important. I am currently researching about its use to answer my question, but I would love it if you could please tell me how and why it is necessary to analyse it, and how one ought to do so.   *To view it (this is just the template, it goes into much further detail. Furthermore, I have worked on it, so it may be outdated): http://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/2wvd06/the_intelligent_investor_handbook/   Hey r/investment! I am sure many of you here have an opinion on this question, so why not make a thread where we discuss this.   Is the market* overvalued compared to underlying metrics? If time in the market is more important than timing the market, does it still make sense to invest at these all time highs? Should one wait for a correction?  It would be nice if you could state you answer with some explanation (or links to explanation).   I believe this is very important for many beginners to know, as well as a great way for seasoned investors to help out with.  PS. I am aware this is the million dollar question and it is foolish to ask it, and even more foolish to expect a concrete answer to it, so keep in mind the point of this post is just to hear out some opinions of what people think, not make forecasts or predictions.   *By market I refer to stock markets generally. I guess more specifically it would be the US and European markets.   The Independent: independent.co.UK. Am I missing something?   Whether the data and facts show that the ttip is good or bad, this article is so extremely disappointingly biased, it makes me wonder how the independent is considered useful.   This is probably what you might call "Mapporn": http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-uk-election/ Toggle with 'show proportional map view'   Oh sorry, these are specifically BAD examples. OP explained that he was writing a paper why the veto is bad.   China's veto not letting Taiwan be a country. US veto not letting Palestine be a country. Russia's veto ...  The wikipedia page about the UNSC is quite good, especially the # of vetos per country diagram. I assume your're in uni, so I am sure you can do a better job than me (im only 17). Good luck   In my humble (and often wrong) opinion, I believe the veto is not meant to be beneficial, but is meant to allow the great powers* to have checks and balances, so that no one power is too powerful. And I believe that by not allowing any nation too much power / making compromise and dialogue effective, leads to more benefits to the entire world in the long term. It also gives the incentive to large nations to want to remain in the UN (eg. USSR in the 1950s). Look at the league of nations to see what happens when one power/one side is too powerful.   However, as you've mentioned, this has lead to numerous local mishaps at best, genocides at worst. Try looking at the bigger picture. Hope my answer helped, tell me if im wrong.   More than helps! Thanks so much! I realised (sadly) that companies have gotten into debt to pay higher dividends/buybacks. My question is, what is a high payout ratio in these current times? Should standard be lowered due to the low interest rates (what would that be?), or should they be heightened to prepare for (a long awaited/potential/maybe not) rise in interest rates? What do you consider to be good, satisfactory, bad and terrible payout ratios?  Thanks again :)   Hey r/dividends! I'm sorry if its a little vague. Please tell me so and I will elaborate. Thanks :)   Thanks for the insightful response    Is there a less shady way of describing 'investment vehicle'? :p   Thanks, will do. I thought being a mutual fund was limited by its size, but I guess I was wrong. I will look into it :)   Thanks for the great answer!  	25

We wrote a long paper at the beginning of the second semester (January/February) and did not get them back until the night of graduation.  Ran in to him at a party a few years back. He had moved to the same college town to get his Masters. Found out that the reason it took him so long to return papers and have everything graded was due to the fact he had severe depression and teaching was the only thing that kept him going.  He's now married and has a wonderful life doing what he loves.    Ryan. Every guy I have known with that name was a complete a-hole and douchebag.    Know this far too well. I have a tendency to pluck my own while nervous and/or stressed. My left eye usually has half the lashes missing.   $275.94   I was wrong about the location. It is on a college campus. I misread the event invite. Sorry   Forced labour is included in the statistics for KC.    Human trafficking for sex just happens to be the fastest growing form of trafficking throughout the US.  The groups involved with the event on Thursday focus on issues concerning  domestic human trafficking, modern-day slavery, and domestic violence.   Your reddit name should be dangerousassumptions not dangerousopinions.    For some reason they've tried to pull strings with the whole 'family approach'. Get the kids to watch and they won't see their drunken parents as a problem.    Event this Thursday at Marvin Hall from 7pm - 9pm  Viewing of the documentary "Sex + Money: A National Search for Human Worth" to learn more about the minor trafficking industry in the United States.   https://www.facebook.com/events/631246240312890/   LATTE meets the last Sunday of every month at the Lawrence Public Library. It is dedicated to reaching out to the community and partnering with local organizations to spread awareness of domestic human trafficking and modern-day slavery, in the form of public presentations, forums, and film showings.  If you are interested in learning more about the organization, feel free to check out information provided through the Facebook link.   KC is the 2nd highest city per capita in the US for human trafficking and incidents have been reported in the city of Lawrence.   National information can be find here - http://www.polarisproject.org/   Number one rule of photojournalism (pictures or videos) is that you cannot take an action of any form to help the injured, frightened, etc people in your story. Even if morally you know you should.      Polaris:  http://www.polarisproject.org/   Watching the documentary with people in the community next week at the local university campus. Our weekly discussions focus on human trafficking in our community. We live close to KCKS/ KCMO - KC is the 2nd highest city per capita for human trafficking in the US. Houston, TX is number one.    30 and 32. We watched that, too.   I get so giddy when I see that they're on sale. Then I realize I have a cheap one that still works.    Decided I wanted to try working as a SPED Paraeducator because it would provide insight for later studies of child and adolescent psychology. Anyway, I worked this position through a temp agency.   After the first few weeks it became clear that most of the teachers were younger than me and I'm 28.    The 'don't drink anything after 8pm' is a f*cking lie. My gynecologist is a liar.    I'm one of those people. I never quite understood why my brothers liked the show.       Unlike Bill Nye and Neil DeGrasse Tyson, he's very religious.    Too bad he wasn't in possession of pot.    I know, I know, because I'm closer to the ground.    Well I may have had that too...but that is really none of her business....   ~~It is nothing new for a guy trying to show off his strength.~~ I'm a petite female and needed the self-assurance that I wasn't weak for my size.  Edit: I made it less sexist      Limitless  Drunk at the time and still hated the movie.    Striving for the life you would like to live but after every successful part of the journey, something pushes you back to where you were before. Think of it as karma getting you because you wish to succeed, but the universe manipulates your dream and forms it into some sort of never ending torture for the sake of its own entertainment.    Someone should definitely start a company similar to JapanCrate, lets call it BritishCrate, that specializes in all of the delicacies we can't buy here in the U.S.   Unless Hershey's bans that as well, which would not come as a surprise given their current childish behavior.   I do this and still manage to forget my wallet.    I doubt I would qualify. I'm able bodied, but finding a job that won't make me sick isn't easy too come by. Loud noises, bright lights, strong odors...anything that can trigger a migraine should be avoided. I'm glad that I had the opportunity as a Paraeducator, but working with kindergartens was just too much. Loved the job, not the noise.   My health. Being dizzy makes being productive extremely difficult. As so I'm left feeling pessimistic on a daily basis. I lost my job last week, so that hasn't helped much, and it was due to being dizzy. I hope to go back to school in the fall, but I have spent the past week trying to get ahold of the admissions office and the administrator for the school, and so far nothing.   My job was working as a SPED Paraeducator at an elementary school. My dream job is to work as an Art Therapist helping children and adolescents.  Shitty health + losing job because of health + awaiting an important phone call = a shitty time  Edit: words        Had that happen last week. Worked at an elementary school as a SPED Paraeducator. Every Wednesday we had a collaborative meeting from 13:15-14:30. Right after it was over, I went out in to the hallway and waited for the teachers I usually helped after school - worked until 15:30.   My boss walks up to me and tells me that we need to go to the Principal's office to discuss the SPED department. Arrive at his office to see that it was just the three of us.  After the meeting ended, I continued to do my job as usual and helped the teachers as I had every day up to that point. One started to cry when she found out I was leaving. I really loved that job and miss working with the kids.  I was fired because of health reasons. I knew working the position might not pan out too well, so I decided to get the job through a temp agency. I have these wonderful things called inner ear disorders. Last semester was great because I was split between every grade. I ended up getting sick during the first week back and missed two days of work. My schedule had me working with a 3rd grade student most of the day, and when I wasn't with her, I spent my time with a kindergarten class. Those times included recess (of which all were indoor that week) and their 'choice time', which is like recess, but the noise level is 100x worse.    /r/oddlysatisfying   You're welcome   I did. I'd ask if they knew what it was. More often than not the answer was no, so I made sure I had the ingredient list ready.  When I was in Play Del Carmen a few years back, none of the bars sold whiskey. I ordered one drink with scotch as a substitution. I immediately regretted that decision and always stuck to the recipe.   I'm one of those people. More so use to be...I no longer drink. You'd be surprised how many bartenders have never heard of an Algonquin Cocktail.    There's no way to prove this unless that was the only thing they ate in several days. Food you ate a few days ago could just now make you sick.    The fact he was able to remove them all at once is quite fascinating.    Phil Hartman's sister-in-law and her husband gained sole custody of the two Hartman children.  http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/TV/9806/02/hartman/    Of all the tragedies in the past two decades, that is one of the few celebrity related events I recall the most. I was only 12 years old at the time of his death.    I have had family members and friends suggest I write a book. A memoir of sorts. I hope to do this, but I have not quite figured out where to start.   The afternoon of May 31st, 1990 I was walking with my babysitter. A teenage driver took her eyes off of the road and hit what she thought was a bump in the road. I was drug 20ft down a dirt road. Resulted in physical and mental impairments. Went from being a cheerful 3year old to someone completely different. Plus I looked...well not normal. People are mean and were mean throughout my childhood and early adult life. I under went 2-3 dozen facial reconstructive surgeries from the age of four until I turned 17. I'll need more in the future for structural reasons.   Everyone in my family is quite intelligent, except for me. Reasons for that are due in part to the head trauma. I'm not dumb by any means but I'm stuck with limitations that make it difficult to get to where I would like to be.   My life is great now, but only because I met people who actually cared enough to get to know me. I have two mottos to life: "Be who you are, not what's cool" - Chef from South Park's episode 'South Park is Gay'; and "I've lived a life no one can relate and few will understand."     My health went to shit back in 2008 and I have had inner-ear problems since then. Over the course of several years I lost hope of ever feeling better and stopped doing most things I enjoyed. Now I'm substantially better because I know how to control the problem (took all but 5 years), but I'm afraid to return to what I once loved. I do not want to have to relearn something that once came to me naturally. I also can't run without feeling sick. Running always helped me relieve stress. It hasn't been an option for several years now.     Loved this book. Sat down and didn't want to stop reading.   Not get hit by a car when I was three-and-a-half years old would be great. Boy did that fuck up the life I could have had.   They're nothing special. Went there once and was really disappointed.    The only thing as addictive as crack (excluding caffeine): sugar  A Starbucks Grande 16 fl. oz drink contains 17g of sugar.  A 8.46 fl. oz can of Red Bull contains 27g of sugar.  You would need to consume four cans of Red Bull to reach the amount of caffeine in one Starbucks 16 fl. oz drink....that would also mean you would consumer 108g of sugar.   I worked as a Paraeducator for students in a 5th grade class during their math sessions. One student in particular was a brainiac when it came to the subject and seemed to have really enjoyed the subject. Their class had a end of the year celebration on the last day of school and parents were welcome to attend. She played off like she didn't understand the same work she had just completed when her dad asker her about a problem. When I commented on this, her father said she often did this around him. I was left speechless and completely mystified as to why she did this. She has a younger sister in 3rd grade and I often wonder if her sister does the same thing.    I read it as noisy kitty and felt sad when the picture loaded.             Correct term usage or not, it would still be nice to receive some sort of compensation.    Have you tried vestibular exercises? I don't know the extent of the damage received from the stroke, but that would ensure your inner ear is intact and functioning properly.   Why just once a year? Every month should have one day where a city takes time to conserve energy for an hour. Smaller cities could extend the time or number of days, but it would depend upon what the city allows.    One hour to see the true night sky should be easy to come by. We can survive at least one hour with out unnecessary light.   The only limitations would be for planes flying. I do not know if that would disrupt their flying; by not being able to see ground lights.   We are all on the same boat. Maybe they will offer a minor degree for those who already completed the requirements...then again, that might be asking too much from KU.    edit: misuse of word      That does not mean I have to.    It does. Thank You!    Made these once, and I'll never settle for store bought oreos ever again.  http://smittenkitchen.com/blog/2007/05/my-kingdom-for-a-glass-of-milk/   Edit: spelling   Please post this in /r/lawrencelist, not /r/Lawrence. Thanks!    /u/frankwiles I have one question. Will the TEDxLawrence event be free to the public or will it require signing up online to ensure a seat at the event?      I know, but I wanted that moment to shine and be like "Ha! I caught you!"     How do you find the original posts? Came across a picture yesterday that I knew was a repost, but had no proof. It ruined my day not being able to do leave the comment.   The Jazzhaus is supposedly haunted, but nothing happens until after it closes to the public.   I knew a few bartenders and they often shared this. I asked to go upstairs and wait for a ride, but they said it was not allowed due to the 'ghost'.   A room at The Eldridge is said to be haunted, if not a majority of the rooms on the 5th floor.    If you visit Stull, you are bound to be arrested. A cop parks nearby and is always on the lookout for 'trespassers', especially during Halloween.    Lived in Sigma Nu for a school year...sorority bullsh-t...anyway, the room at the highest point in the house was creepy. I never 'experienced' anything, but the upperclassmen would do their best to scare the sh-t out of us.    Art therapy helped me get through my childhood and has made a difference in my life as an adult. So I have a reason to hope for the best when working with people in the future.    Maybe to you. I'd much rather do something I enjoy and help make a difference in someone else's life, instead of sitting behind a desk and hating my job.    So, I can buy a doctorate from some online "college" and be considered qualified to practice clinical psychology and art therapy just because I have a certification?    What's the point of all your education and research if your hard-earned MAs don't mean jack?    --------------------------------------------------------------  How did I miss the point? A PhD is not required for the field.    Who said anything about an online degree? It's a highly reputable state university.   How does that have to do with competencies? The job I hope to be certified for has nothing to do with working on a computer and in a timely fashion.   Let me explain myself a little bit more....  I am in the process of obtaining a masters in clinical psychology AND art therapy. My dream job is to provide aid to those who struggle through life by showing them the powers of art - through various mediums.   Why should I be judged for taking the test format you feel is necessary when it has nothing to do with my desired career?   People are often left with debilitating circumstances in their lives and deserve to be granted the same opportunities as the able bodied. I didn't ask to receive a TBI as a child and should not be held back by limitations granted through the testing procedures that you find are necessary; when I can qualify for testing that fits my needs.   Timed and computerized tests are difficult for those who have certain learning disabilities. When allowed to take a paper version - with or without time extensions - the test taker is allowed a better opportunity when taking the test.  I am one of those people and thanks for insulting my intelligence.   There are ways around taking the computerized test. If the test taker has a documented learning disability, they are allowed to use a paper version - this is what I know about the GRE.  If that is not allowed for the GED, then the system will reach a whole new level of screwing people over who wish to better their lives.      No news reports. Must have been fireworks or a car backfired.    Animated gif. would definitely help. Picture does not serve justice.  Also, if this cat does, in fact, have Cerebellar Hypoplasia, thank you so much for caring for the little fur ball.      Cosplay or slutty Halloween costume? Both?   It's the South Korean way of compensating for a small penis.    Righty-ho   Should have included NSFW...   Seeing how there are notebooks already opened on the table, your bag is most likely empty....    Holy sh*t, I did not know Lawrence had a butcher shop. Then again, I'm rarely on Mass.       Try the temp agency ExpressPros. If you find a job that you are interested in through their services, you'll be hired to start the next day.      The article has these wonderful things called links that take you directly to the sources mentioned throughout. Maybe if you actually read it, you would have seen them.   I agree and posted the link in disappointment. KU shouldn't be considered a party school. Our state education has gone to shit and the last thing we need is for our state colleges to seem like a complete joke.  /u/bret757 Manhattan/ Aggieville is smaller than Lawrence, yet we are still ranked #1.          She's an older cat and this was her first encounter with fleas.       I would have guessed you were in Mexico. Small lizards often scurry across the walls and floors. We had that happen at a nice home we rented for a week.    This never happens at work. We have a white board hanging on the wall right across from the toilet. If a male employee were to leave the seat up, they'd all know within a short time upon going to the bathroom. Plus there are pictures of the most strict of all the paras hanging around the school. One stares at you when you're in the bathroom.   tl;dr: use scare tactics or other means of communication to alert those who fail to make peace with the toilet gods.      Too many college students are still hung over from last night and wouldn't be able to read, nor understand the question being asked. *sigh*  	107
 Always and forever been my.jam    internet.com/downloadz   Damn yo, where yall finding chicks with names?   His raps are good, and the beats is dope    Shit, Zuckerberg barely squeezes in, he was 24 when he became a billionaire.   Oh, haven't been there in years. Your description was basically Souhtland mall as well tho   Holy shit, are you talking about Southland Mall?   Whenever a film gives me the option to make my own ending I go with the positive one. I like to think he won the match, found Cassidy backstage and made out with her as she cried. They then move to jersey together.   Why the hell wouldn't they lol   Do it next time you have spare time.    Past glory, family relationships, and love. Watch it, trust me.   Sadness is a great emotion tho. Give it a chance.   Or "The Stripper". Marissa Tomei character is basically a female Ram.   Never heard of it, is it good?   Might be a lot of young guns here who never seen it, it came out in 2008, but The Wrestler is a very good film by a very well respected director, that everyone, fan of wrestling or not, should watch.   Movies about a legend working the independent circuit in high school gyms and similar venues. Best/only good film about pro wrestling.   Read 11/22/63. Trust me    i hear the door start dividing itslef open. ahhh, the fire departments here "help!!"   The movie is fantastic, but not realistic   definitely not. maybe it defines certain sub cultures, but not the whole generation.    Internal monolgue: was that a Mitch Hedberg joke?     holy shit i didnt notice you, sorry   Sure! illl take some gum. ever been stuck in an elevator before? my first time   i imediately stomp the syringe and wonder if you will contine your attacks   i wave my hands around to see if you are still there   i throw my grocery bags at your face and reach to your syringe carrying hand   shit shit. *i try and remember if you look like a weirdo* "shit, hope they find us soon. Im luke btw"   in my head i wouldnt believe you. id feel like youre hiding the vodka from me. id call your bluff. "what type of soup"   something landslide? sorry, do you have cell reception?    do you have the bottle with you?   weve only been here for two minutes, cant you hold it.   Oh god what the hell   Um, no, why?   ***ring*** **ring**   I took the initiative and rang the bell for help. I look towards you and say "damn this sucks"   What happens next?   I feel like such a loser some days when on the previous night I binge watched something on netflix and my first thought during my wake up is "wheres the remote"   Any chance you're a hoarder? If you are, set up an eBay account. Sell some shit.   A second book. Education is very important.   Are their limits to distance traveled? Like if I'm stationed in Japan, can I go on leave to mainland USA?   I have never heard of ScholarlyYouth Letter Q   **The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay, by Michael Chabon**  Good book so far, only a quarter in. Reminds me of The Goldfinch a bit more than it does other Chabon novels. So happy I discover Chabon about a year ago   I already set up my navy fed account, would I be able to link it to a credit card and have automatic payments using the RTC payment?   I did say thanks first.    Yea, grateful that he insulted my critical thinking skills and called me a pussy. Great moderating.   Well done. Verrrrry well done. I like the outside black and the inside brown, if there is even of hint of pink I wont eat.    The Shield is one of the best tv shows ever and Training Day is one of my favorite movies ever, but I have never read a novel about dirty/crooked cops. Any recommendations?    Its not on Netflix, but please, please watch The Shield. Also, Mad Men is a masterpiece work, but its not for everyone.   Reading this thread and I must wonder if people here have never tried cookies and cream before.   Lashes out? lol   Why are you the way you are   I'm not in yet dude.. Thanks for the answer though, had to google what PCS was.   Cause Americans are really into watching their figure   Sign in, your password is the last four numbers of your account number and the last four numbers of your social, so its an 8 digit password. Then it will allow you to make your own password   Extensions are two or four years correct? And I can choose which?   Have you seen the documentaries on the training before? Shits crazy, make sure you are beyond 'in shape', im in shape, but id end up ringing the bell within the first week.   Contract length questions, Navy.  How do sea/shore duty rotations work? Rate I'm going in to is 36/36, so what if I have a month left at a sea command but six months left total in my contract, would I have to go to a new shore command for only five months and then separate or would i just finish out my contract at the current command?    Going in as AG soon as an E3, contract is for 4/4 years, my A school is only a three or four months long and there is possibility of going to C school at around the third year of service mark. My questions are:   Do the 9 months of C school count for the 36 month shore duty tour?  If I attend the C school with only a year left in my contract how much would I need to extend?  How strict are the 36/36 sea/shore rotations? what if I'm at the 35th month of a rotation and my contract is up six months, do I get sent to a new command for the last months of my contract or do I just spend the end of my career at that last command?  I'm reading a book right now and came across this quote, felt fitting for most of us here in DEP or about to do something new: "Forget about what you are escaping from, reserve your anxiety for what you are escaping to" Michael Chabon "The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"   No way these type of things aren't done on purpose   Are there really "Hooters" (I think that's hoe you spell it) in PA?   The millionaire?   The keys are great, imagine driving through 100 or so islands to arrive to key west and drink all you want. Mucho seafood as well. Miami sucks imo. All there's is is night clubs and beaches and the people are horrible.   Please tell me Antarctica is on the list   I forgot what wanderlust meant so I Googled it, and it is now ky favorite word.   I'm in the halfway point between Miami Beach and the Florida Keys, a smallish city called Homestead. Only thing to see in homestead is the ghetto and then the mansions. Odd how there can be such a wide discrepancy in wealth just yards away from each other. Back when I was a pizza guy I would routine deliver to a run down apartment building and then a large mansion in a huge plot of land within only minutes of each other.   Honestly the only thing to do in Homestead is to hop on the turnpike and travel south or north.  	62

 Isn't that what we did?    A very similar thing happened with my 3 month old cousin, only that lady didn't have to stop caring for children. My aunt lobbied our state legislature and got a law passed to allow a judge to prohibit an unlicensed childcare worker from working with children while under investigation for certain criminal acts.    What you just said won't be true until all of those groups and distinctions are protected under federal law. Everything you just listed is protected except sexual orientation and identity.    Yeah it's really disappointing that Republicans keep blocking this legislation that really should have been passed decades ago.    That's a trend that started just before the Civil War when the south argued that a state didn't have the right to refuse to enforce a federal law they didn't agree with (the fugitive slave acts), that the people of a state didn't have the right to prohibit slavery (because slavery should be an "inalienable right"), and again after the war when trying to whitewash what they'd done ("the Civil War was about states rights"). Kinda shows how far we've come. Up to that point the assholes always won.    You should have said wealthier parents with more and better connections.    They shouldn't. But then again, neither should rhinoceros horn.    Oh, is that all? So, soon you'll just need a conceal carry permit to be an armed teacher in the state of Kansas?   This is the back door entrance for the religious and ideological nut jobs who want to take over school curriculum.   Thanks anyway.    Foreign policy is primarily the responsibility of the executive branch. He's the head of state.    Got anything that doesn't come from an well known right-wing propaganda outlet?    That's what I was thinking. It could lead to peace and not war so therefore it's bad. How are the warhawks gonna drop their payloads if everyone keeps talking about diplomacy and peace?    Shhh, that doesn't fit the narrative that low wage workers are the biggest drain on our economy. Stop talking sense, man.    Yeah, when there's nothing to be angry about they make shit up.    What's bad about it?    I think I understand where you're coming from and some people on bikes can certainly be jerks, but I don't think it's difficult to be cautious around bicyclists.    I'm not pretending to make a positive identification, but [considering that it could possibly be this] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona_bark_scorpion) I would at least take it seriously and avoid interacting with them.    Considering the current political state throughout most of the world, yes they'd have to be evil.    My state, Missouri has plenty of sprawl and shitty drivers as well. If people want to bike they have every right to do so. It's a shitty attitude that hates on someone for being self-propelled.    No, they're not. Their status is [vulnerable] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_shark), not endangered.    That's terrible.    Yeah, there was some horrible shit that happened to that species, but there are* over 500,000 alive today.    No, it's only effective at infecting people when it enters the nasal passageways and sinuses. The digestive tract can almost always take care of it.    Is that supposed to be an argument? Did you realize that you were wrong and that's why you've resorted to senseless, ineffective personal insults?    Too bad it's from the Daily Mail.    Heh, this reminds me of all those years in which everyone blamed the president for high gas prices.    A lot of people feel that way.    Leave me alone.    Nice. Edited your comment to fit your argument. Please leave me alone now.    I never argued against GMOs. What was it you were saying about reading?    I should have looked at your history before replying to you. Have a nice night, child.    Seems like this is a spam account.    Bicycling can be a hobby, but first and foremost it's a mode of transportation. Bicyclists have a right to use the roadways and deserve the same respect and consideration as any other travelers, ya prick.    Yes this. He didn't even have cigarettes on him at the time.    Right. It was never dropped on human beings? It's not still contaminating the soil in those areas to this day is it? What do you think happens when you drop a potent toxin from airplanes? Smart ass.      It's evil when it's known to be terribly toxic, persistent, and the company knowingly produces it to be used and/or tested on human beings.    Yeah lol. Tell that to these [folks] (http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/suit-filed-over-government-test-spraying-in-st-louis-during/article_9bc1fc7d-7093-58a3-b557-0cbac5dc38ab.html) and the countless people affected by [this] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent_Orange). I'm sure you'll find all of that to be hilarious.    Every one of you guys thinks of yourself as a hero. If you need a source, go back to your sub and observe the egos and total lack of empathy for the people you hurt and the damage you cause.    It does, doesn't it?    I don't need any of that. I can be pissed off at Monsanto for the evil chemicals they've produced and helped the military use on people. No I'm not talking about conspiracy theories, I'm talking about facts that are a matter of public record.    Is that for real?  Edit: Thanks for the gold!   No it doesn't. If someone says that people with qualities a, b, c, and d are not considered to be x, it does not automatically follow that everyone without qualities a, b, c, and d should be considered to be x. That's faulty logic.    But they're not doing any of that. They're removing dissenting opinions or criticisms.    Oh, but they are. As well as their fellow cops, the media, and people across the country. Every time a cop shoots someone it's always the same excuse. "I feared for my life". Not only do other officers and police departments buy that shit, but they're offended when someone questions it.    I am not a public employee. I have the right to express whatever opinion I like. The police cannot silence me simply because they disagree.    Okay. But we're still not talking about public employees.    The killers of Tamir Rice, Aiyana Stanley-Jones, James Boyd, John Greer, Walter Scott, Freddie Gray, and so many others. Everyone who claims that the police are hero rather than just people doing their jobs or in these cases monsters committing crimes against the American people.    No one is stopping you from saying anything. You just can't link directly to the piggy-wiggy sub. That's not censorship.    That's public employees. Private citizens on their private time don't have restrictions on their speech. The government cannot abridge their speech.    While you're not wrong about there not being a binding legal precedent, a cursory Google search will show that quite a few police departments have deleted their comments section or Facebook page when confronted with this problem. The police are not known for backing down when questioned.    A hero doesn't shoot unarmed people. A hero doesn't shoot children. A hero doesn't torture someone to death. A hero doesn't need all of his buddies to cover up his actions and defend him in public.    All of the PD Facebook pages I've seen are filled with praise and adulation for police officers and the department. If they're going to have a forum that allows those kinds of posts then they need to allow people to complain or speak out against that with which they disagree.    https://www.reddit.com/r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/comments/3d4dc2/my_local_police_must_be_responding_to_a_pancake/   I can't imagine being in a position in life where I would find it necessary to demonize those who have less than me. People who hate on the poor and needy have their priorities all fucked up.   Edit:Changed a word.       A human body is larger than an inch or so in diameter. Do you know how they ultimately remove concrete in cases like this? Jackhammer and sledgehammers.       With so much disparity between the numbers of each population, that's just not possible.    I broke the metacarpal above my pinky and I had no idea. I was walking around like that for a couple of days before someone convinced me to go to the hospital.    On what grounds should there be leeway? What part of freedom of expression are you having difficulty with? The leeway that PDs have is to choose to not have a comments section. It's a public forum. If they're going to allow one type of speech they have to allow all of it.    Maybe you're right. It's still generally accepted that government Facebook pages are public forums and the removal of dissenting comments constitutes a violation of free speech. Those pages do not belong to private individuals, and while they may ultimately belong to Facebook, that company is not conducting the censorship. Public employees are selectively deleting opinions with which they disagree.    But isn't that the point? Trump can say all of the awful stuff that hateful Republicans are thinking and Bush can just remain quiet and look moderate in comparison.    Don't forget slavery and Jim Crowe!    I'm pretty sure that you're allowed to stone her to death if she's not.    It's happening! Muwahahahahaaaaa!   Something tells me that was purposeful.    I can think of a really good reason for advertisers to avoid the LA Times.    And why doesn't the bank have to pay taxes on the land their basically sitting on waiting for a profit?    http://www.hawaiifreepress.com/ArticlesMain/tabid/56/ID/12959/HPD-Ordered-to-Pay-31K-over-Censored-Facebook-Comments.aspx  There was another in San Diego that was settled for like $20 and resulted in the police deleting their entire Facebook page.    If they're censoring comments that they disagree with then they're going to have a bad time. It's already been ruled that government Facebook pages are a public forum and deleting comments violates the first amendment.    There is definitely a race problem in the US, and it's definitely present in our police misconduct/brutality problems, but really the police victimize everyone regardless of race. A closer look would reveal that this is deep down a class problem and unfortunately there are many communities where the majority of black folks are at the lowest level of income.    I believe that the position of police officer should require a professional license and professional liability insurance. Then if an officer fucks up their insurance has to pay. Lawless cops would soon find themselves uninsurable and therefore out of a job. If the public chooses to not do anything about this problem then they do, in fact, reap what they sow. Fix the system or learn to cope. Take from that what you want.   Now do you have a source on that? Here's an actual documented Lyndon Johnson quote:  "If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you." ~   I think so too. It, would put an end to this speculation, it wouldn't destroy the parking lot, and it would minimally disturb any evidence that might be discovered. A lot of people want to know what's down there and dammit those girls deserve justice.    I feel like there are going be some big bumps on the road ahead for Reddit. Along the way, there are some very aggressive implied promises being made to the community  in comments to mods, quotes from board members and theyre going have some pretty big challenges in meeting those implied promises.  I'd say. They just lost their head engineer.    This shouldn't be surprising. There aren't nearly as* many politicians and corrupt wealthy people as there are normal citizens relatively speaking. This information is misleading, really. A politician who works for the public should not be able to wipe away history. They're public employees and what they do affects everyone else.    I've seen an officer on Cold Case Files take a pole with him into a forest and push it into the soil where he thought there were remains. When he found them the odor was obvious and he then knew where to dig.   I'm not sure how common this practice is, but it's certainly better than not looking at all. It wouldn't necessarily be that disruptive to the scene.    That's not necessarily true. Search teams often use this method for finding remains in the forest. The hole only has to be an inch of two in diameter.    And the taxpayers should continue to pay until they do something about it.    The problems with the Catholic Church come from the fact that the organization did nothing to stop abusers and they require celibacy from their priests.    Couldn't they make bore holes in the areas in question? If it's nothing, fill it in and be done with it.    I agree.    Yeah, this is a terrible case of abuse.    Mathew 25: 46 Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life.  Is that not hell? Eternal punishment?   You too have a nice night.    [No true Scotsman eh?] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_true_Scotsman). True Christians don't believe in hell because you don't believe in hell.    I'm done talking to you as you have nothing to say.    What are you even talking about? This article is about exactly what I'm talking about. Treating people fairly and not excluding their for their private lives.    The majority of Christians don't believe in hell as an actual place? That's bullshit. I live right smack dab in the middle of Christian America and I can assure you that you're wrong. Every one of these people believe I'm going to burn in hell for eternity and they feel intense Schadenfreude at the mere idea.   No I quoted two* different parts. The big Mathew part was comprised of consecutive passages, granted the formatting sucked, but it was one part of the scripture. I don't think it's morally sound to turn your back on family because they don't believe the same things you do. The last part about losing one's life for Christ and achieving eternal life sounds an awful lot like the martyrs of islam.    I don't know. Maybe their partner drove them to a meeting? A neighbor kjew they cohabitated and gossip travelled. People shouldn't be expected to hide who they are in order to be accepted unless they're actually doing something wrong. Being LGBT isn't wrong.    They were expelled from the group for being homosexual. This isn't a non-issue. When the organization found out about their sexual orientation, they kicked them out.    22 Indeed I will cast her (Jezebel) into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, unless they repent of their deeds. 23 I will kill her children with death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches the minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.  Matthew 10:32-39New International Version (NIV)  32Whoever acknowledges me before others,I will also acknowledge before my Father in heaven.33But whoever disowns me before others, I will disown before my Father in heaven.  34Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.35For I have come to turn  a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law 36a mans enemies will be the members of his own household.[a]  37Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.38Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.39Whoever finds their life will lose it, and whoever loses their life for my sake will find it.   Let's not forget that all things are forgiven in Christ. So by your beliefs, Jeffrey Dahmer is in the kingdom of God looking down on us right now. As well as any child molester, genocidal maniac, murderer, cannibal, war lord, or any other monster who repents before death. But a Hindu boy who died of cancer at the age of eight is burning in the eternal fire.      You're right we did have a war over the institution of slavery 150 years ago. Those on both sides cited the bible as their justification. And in those actions they were both absolutely correct. The bible justifies and supports slavery. There are also parts of the bible that instruct followers to treat each other and even nonbelievers with fairness and decency.   In the time since, the god of Abraham has proceeded to kill off as many as 50% of human pregnancies in their first trimesters. Literally tens of billions of spontaneous abortions. It shouldn't be surprising though, as the bible came with its own set of instructions on how to perform a holy abortion. So gather the kids and open your bible to the book of Numbers chapter 5. It's holy scripture and the word of God, so it has to be good.    Forgive me, but what you're describing is like picking corn kernels out of shit because "it's really good corn". The new testament and even the teachings of Christ have blatantly immoral teachings and examples.    That doesn't make it any more moral. Thats called a rationalization. If you're killing someone in order to neutralize an immediate threat and to protect innocents, then that's obviously morally sound. If you're murdering someone after the fact in order to effect retribution, that's a rationalization.    The user in that link admitted it wasn't his photo. OP claimed he took it and even had some back story about how he had to do it quickly because he didn't want to start any trouble.    It's not, but historically the individual chapters are often operated by Christians and Christian organizations. They do require a belief in god or a higher power.    Okay I'll give you a few examples. Spring break, Mardi Gras, literally every other movie and TV show in the last fifty or sixty years, until recently the institution of marriage, sporting events, wet t-shirt contests I don't think I need to continue. You're complaining about a few parades that you're absolutely not required to attend.   No one is interested in being overtly sexual in the Boy Scouts. They simply didn't want to be excluded from the group because of who they are. It's a reasonable request.    I'm going to give you another chance. You're intelligent enough to use reddit and type so I'm sure you can think of a few.    I don't know. I think we can all agree that murder is immoral. I think we can all agree that slavery is immoral. I'm pretty sure that we all disagree with child rape. Do I really need to go on?    What? So by demanding equal rights LGBT people are flaunting their sexuality? Or did you see or hear about something gay that you didn't like, so now you have concluded that all gay people are pushing their sexuality on you? Did it ever occur to you that on any given population there is going to be a spectrum of different personalities, tastes, perspectives, and politics? Do you really have to think that hard to come up with a several examples of heterosexual people openly flaunting their sexuality?    I never said that I had the final say. I said that Christianity does not. It's not even close. And yes the bible is filled from end to end with immorality from both god and man, all declared divine and just.    It's disappointing that you despise people who simply want to be treated equally and fairly. You need to take a long hard look at yourself pal.    I don't disagree with most of what you said but I'd like to point out that while there may be decent little pockets in the new testament, there is plenty that is despicable and wholly immoral. I still stand by my assertion that the bible is a terrible source for morality.    All human beings want to live and wish to avoid death so it is immoral to murder them.    Not all morality is subjective. There are universal truths to the human experience. People choosing to ignore them doesn't make them any less true.    Probably. Or maybe someone who deserves it could end up in the Hudson.    Huh? So some of them have different taste than you and that makes them filthy and immoral?    I don't disagree. That has little to do with morality and more to do with Christianity and tradition.    I meant the United States since that's where I am and that's where the BSA is located.    What has stopped this from happening in the past? You don't have a valid argument here.    Well to be honest, after looking at it again, I was kind of opposing the idea that moral guidance need exclude LGBT people or nonbelievers. Maybe you weren't saying that it has to be that way, but you did seem to say that this was an unimportant part of the program. There are some moral guidelines that are universal to our society. Do not lie, cheat, steal. Do not kill. Share whenever possible. Treat others fairly. There's no reason that these things can't be taught without demonizing people because they're different.    It might if it bankrupts a department or two. It's possible that some jackass might get off his ass and do his job rather than his cronies and superiors losing their jobs. No one wants to end up in the Hudson.    I don't think you did. I was adding rather than arguing. Sorry. Maybe I'm a little wound up. Some of these comments in here are just plain old hateful.    I dunno. Maybe it's in the NYPD faq.    What's intrinsically good about a homophobe? What's intrinsically bad about LGBT people? Where do you get your ideas of morality? Why do you expect and demand all other Americans to be the same as you?    There's no "turning" here. LGBT people have been marginalized, demonized, and ostracized for as long as we have been a country. Demanding equal rights and treatment isn't an attack on anyone. It's an affirmation of their humanity.    Homophobes tend to be outspoken. I thought it was obvious that OP wasn't just talking about people who silently disagree.    But LGBT people aren't automatically immoral just by being who they are. Christianity doesn't have the final say on morality, and honestly the bible is a terrible source for morality.    I think you just wanted people to read a story about you pooping.    I see nothing wrong with a 40 year old father being involved with a girl scout troop. Correct me if I'm wrong but troop activities are almost always supervised by multiple adults who are usually parents. What difference does gender or sexual orientation make? Homosexuals aren't any more likely to abuse children than heterosexuals. You understand that men aren't all pedophiles right?    I remember them mostly being **a lot** of rain and wind. The article describes this one as being about as strong as a level 2 or 3 hurricane so just watch the news and avoid going outside when the news advises against it.

[The female mostly eats the male during mating when they're in captivity.] (http://www.snopes.com/critters/wild/mantis1.asp)    I don't know about that. I don't hear a lot of love for him from conservatives.    What the hell was on the jar?    Or, it could be because he's a rapist.    They could have at least employed an undercover police officer who was wired and armed.    Hate isn't a value in a healthy society.    I have a kid and I agree with OP. Homosexuals aren't child predators. They're just normal people and should be treated as such.   Edit: typo       I can't wait to hear all of the bitching and moaning about this one. They're going to have to get pretty creative to find a reason to be offended by this.    I'm sorry about the PMs. That's uncalled for. I disagree with people and sometimes used some very heated rhetoric, but I don't PM other users or brigade. If they keep it up, report them to the mods and admins. It seems like /r/BCND mods are at the very least interested in preserving this sub and they understand that subs are removed when their users blatantly break the rules. Good luck.    Same here. Sorry again for unloading on you.    Cars are transportation vehicles. They aren't designed for the sole purpose of killing people. Insurance companies do not call them "accidents". They're called collisions and someone is always held responsible. It's not a good analogy.    Oh, yeah. Thanks for turning me around. All I have to do is buy into Trump's disturbed narrative and I can hate too.    A lot of that depends on how their trial(s) are conducted. They're obviously guilty of some serious offenses. I personally feel that second degree murder is appropriate. I think all of them should be charged with at least something.   People see that video and they can't believe it, because it's so terrible. If we're going to have any faith in the system at all, then the men who committed those crimes need to be held accountable. This wasn't simply a case of a lack of training or a field mistake. This was actual malice.    What? Arrested and threatened with five years incarceration for an internationally acclaimed artist hanging a few posters in that rancid shithole of a city? Detroit and their fucked up police need to change. Their priorities are all fucked up.    I agree that more training is absolutely necessary. I don't want to see any more mentally ill people or police officers harmed. It's an obvious problem and blame is squarely on politicians and officials for not addressing it.   But the James Boyd case is something different entirely. They used their firearms and shot him, then they used their less lethal stuff and dog to torture him as he lay dying. What those guys did is unforgivable.    If the suspect is known to be armed and dangerous then the officer is obviously going to draw his weapon and order the suspect's hands in the air. If the suspect doesn't follow orders, it's not unreasonable that the officer would fear for his life. That's very different than an unarmed man. We're talking about two different things here.    There's no such thing as an accidental discharge. A weapon doesn't fire itself. The person holding it is responsible for what it does.    Oh, really? And how do you figure? How about instead, we stop attacking countries and killing innocent civilians that aren't threatening us?   	142

With Wahhabis, there's an ideological overlap. The idea with Obama is loyal to Ayatollah Khamenei is simply ludicrous and not true, while ISIS most likely has some followers in the Gulf.    Yeah, and the media doesn't realize it. His statements should be as important as any news on the conflict.   There's no Shia empire going town to town beheading people, taking slaves, imposing their own brand of law and destroying historical sites.    There's no Shia empire going town to town beheading people, taking slaves, imposing their own brand of law and destroying historical sites.    Yeah, it goes to show how much a lot of news agencies know about the region despite the U.S. being there for so many years. One of the leading Islamic scholars and he's just some preacher in the news.       Yeah, this subreddit covers a bunch of cities, you have to specify which downtown you mean.       /r/photoshopbattles   No, 60-90 DAYS!!!      I've never given a dime of my money to WWE, and based on the last few months, I'm thoroughly convinced that I've made the right decision. Heck, I'm not going to stream Wrestlemania or download it, either. There's no match I'm really hyped to see except maybe Wyatt vs. Taker, and even then, I'll probably come here to see if it's even worth watching.       Yeah, I saw it, but my question goes a little beyond that. What are they doing these days? I've seen them being allotted tickets at past games, but they are said to be dead. Is it an older crowd that was cannibalized by AO?    What about Sam's Army? I never hear anything about them.    Petke...   That didn't really answer his question. We know it's a militia, we want to know which one.    RemindMe! 6 days "radical"     Guess again.       You and I would possibly disagree on what constitutes evidence.    They don't, really. I don't think any of Alaska's routes conflict with Etihad's.   Geiger and Jair Maruffo are the two refs. who were on the World Cup short list, and Geiger ended up going to Brazil.    I saw Roger and was reminded of Torres, and now I'm sad.    *There was something at the game that night, the calls weren't right, Fernandoooo...*    This is all completely subjective, but you're treating the supposed non-existence of religion as a fact.   And religion has nothing to do with that? I'm pretty sure many religions put the defense and saving of the innocent as a noble cause.   You didn't say that, but you're making a false equivalency between Shi'a militias and ISIS/Qaeda. They aren't the same.   I'm no fan of Shi'a militias as they will often target Sunnis en masse, but they do not copy ISIS tactics nor have they taken slaves nor do they forcibly try to convert people. I can find numerous scholars preaching those things from the Sunni side, even before ISIS ever existed.   Show me a Shi'a scholar preaching that Sunnis are kafir or that enslaving them or forcibly converting them is ok. The worst you'll likely find is some cursing of the sahaba, which I would agree should be avoided, but even then that in itself is rejected by Iranian and other leading Shi'a authorities.     There is no such a thing as Wahhabi.  So the people who follow Muhammad ibn-Abd al-Wahhab are what, then, Salafis? It's just semantics.   And please find me an example of a Shi'a group declaring Sunnis to be kafirs, because all of the leading Shi'a scholars have straight up prohibited that.    So your proof is stuff that hasn't happened yet. I anxiously await the "Shia caliphate" that will invade the surrounding countries and execute the non-Shias. /s   In Lebanon, they are allied with Christians, and have pretty much refrained from sectarian bloodshed, even giving aid to Syrian refugees who aren't Shi'a.    Yes, because religious people aren't rational. Le redditor is SO brave.     recorded by an orchestra in Prague  What the hell? There are plenty of symphonies in North America that could record it!    Generally Jewish and Christian kids aren't bullied and vilifed.    Don't people like you wear bedsheets with eye-holes cut out of them?   Actually, they are the midst of a good run in the CONCACAF Champions League right now! They just upset Pachuca, a Mexican team, becoming one of the few MLS teams to have defeated a Mexican team in a playoff series. [They did so in dramatic fashion, too](http://www.rds.ca/vid%C3%A9os/soccer/impact/porter-joue-les-h%C3%A9ros-3.1117584) with help from [a kid only playing his second professional game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Porter) in front of 60,000 fans at Stade Olympique. This isn't their usual stadium but is being used in the CCL for a larger crowd because Stade Saputo only seats 20,000. They face Costa Rica's Alajuelense in the semifinals.   While they were in the lower leagues, they had a tremendous upset in the Canadian Cup and surprisingly clinched a berth in the CCL. Via [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal_Impact_%281992%E2%80%932011%29#The_Impact_and_Major_League_Soccer):    In 2008, the Montreal Impact won the Canadian Championship, gaining the chance to represent Canada in the CONCACAF Champions League. The tournament features the best teams in all of North and Central America and the Caribbean Islands. The Impact won two legs against Real Estali 10 and 00 to secure a spot in the tournament. Montreal competed then in the group stage where they defeated Joe Public FC of Trinidad 20 and 41 and CD Olimpia of Honduras 21 and 11. They finished off against Atlante FC of Mexico which they tied 00 and then lost 21.   On February 25, 2009, the team won the first leg of the quarterfinals match 20 against Santos Laguna from Mexico. The match was played at Montreal's Olympic Stadium in front of a club-record crowd of 55,571. The second leg was held on March 5, 2009 at Corona Stadium, in Torreon, Mexico, where the Impact led 21 at the half (41 on aggregate). With the Impact only a few minutes from a semi-final berth, Santos Laguna's Carlos Quintero scored twice in stoppage time to rally the homeside to a 52 victory, thus eliminating the Impact from the inaugural CONCACAF Champions League 54 on aggregate. Following the match, head coach John Limniatis commented that his side "should have done better", noting that it was "unfortunate to finish this way".  Since 2012, the Impact made the playoffs once, in 2013, despite struggling through the second half of the regular season. [They were eliminated in humiliating fashion by Houston 3-0](http://matchcenter.mlssoccer.com/matchcenter/2013-10-31-houston-dynamo-vs-montreal-impact/recap).   [They have a nice new stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saputo_Stadium), but their owner, Joey Saputo, is a bit impulsive, having gone through three managers within the team's first three years in the league. Saputo, an Italian-Canadian, also has a reputation for signing Italians, even older ones. Marco Di Vaio, Matteo Ferrari, and Alessandro Nesta have all played here.  The only Italian now is Marco Donadel, who is new this year. Right now their best players are him, Laurent Cimian (Belgian International defender who is also new), Ignacio Piatti (Argentinian, the team's lone designated player, which means he is paid very well) the underrated Justin Mapp, captain Patrice Bernier, new arrival Eric Alexander (also underrated), Jack McInerney and Dilly Duka.   The season has a lot of question marks as their chief offensive weapon, Di Vaio, has retired, and they already lost to DC United earlier today.* Judging by their CCL performance, they seem to be much improved from last season, where they didn't even make the playoffs. While I don't think they are title contenders, they do have a shot to make the playoffs and surprise some people. Their owner has a willingness to spend some money (he also owns Bologna FC in Italy) and their coach, Frank Klopas, is a veteran coach and player.   Hope this helps!   * - I mistakenly said they had yet to play. This has been edited.    It's the weekend, so MSNBC will catch on next week.    Fidel Castro?    You can request alternate flairs in [this thread](http://redd.it/2m05m9).   Since you're Brazilian, I'd normally suggest Orlando City, as they have a Brazilian owner and have Kaka. However, while they have invested a lot of money into the club and for all intents and purposes are "big," they are brand new to the league, so there's not really any history.   As for history, the original teams in the league are Kansas City, Dallas, New York (Red Bulls), Dallas, Colorado, Columbus, DC, Los Angeles, San Jose and New England. LA and DC are the first and second-most successful clubs over MLS's entire history, respectively. LA is considered the league's golden child, having brought David Beckham, Robbie Keane and this summer, Steven Gerrard into the league. They were also home to arguably the best American player of all time in Landon Donovan.   Seattle, Portland, Vancouver and San Jose trace their lineage back to lower level leagues and leagues from decades past. Seattle is the best-supported team in the league by numbers, drawing the most fans to their stadium each year, and is a very wealthy club despite only being in the league since 2009. Seattle, Portland and Vancouver maintain a regional rivalry where they compete for the Cascadia Cup each year, but the rivalry is fiercest between Portland and Seattle.   Montreal has long supported soccer, and the Impact have a lower league history as well, but have only been in MLS since 2012. Chicago, while not an MLS original, has been in the league since 1998, but has not been successful in recent years.   And like any league, there are Brazilian players scattered across different teams.   Hope this helps!      What are you on about? There are tons of Muslims all over Texas.    Try to attend as many games as possible, and if you can't attend, watch them in whatever way you can. If you attend, you can also try and join one of Columbus's organized supporter groups.     City's worst losses  They're new this year and have yet to play their opening game, so you'll get to experience their worst losses as they happen!    I think he's referring to BigSoccer forums.             That would be a glorious tag team.     It is an example of one of the many fears that are promulgated. "Men are just afraid of women" - I have heard this exact sentence many times. In fact, a modified version was on a front page comment yesterday. That is why it came to mind.  Not a sexist, but a "feminophobe." Ok.        I prefer TSN 8 - The Ocho.   Oh, like Omar Gonzalez.   Nickelback guy?    *Al-Sadiq Al-Amin    I am not sexist or afraid of women having power - I am more afraid of how they wield it when they do have it.  Wha-?

I don't think he'd shy away from it.   Was Bill DeMott "steppin' out?"         Egged on by the government. From what I remember from my visit to Dubai I saw a lot of Iranian influence/$$.   ...then you'll just repeatedly be the 4,999th....   Bradley, this is your Dad. Get a job already and stop masturbating.       It would be very bad to steal Jobu's rum. Very baaaad.    For those of you looking for some substance, here's the Orlando Sentinel's article on the subject: http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/orlando-city-lions/on-the-pitch/os-mls-players-avoid-strike-orlando-city-20150304-post.html   They don't do a lot of national reporting. They mostly focus on Tampa, Florida and its surrounding area, with some notable exceptions, like Politifact.       We'd still hate you, but just a little less.    **Submission Statement**:   A newspaper with an ownership structure that guarantees its independence has struggled to compete with its crosstown rival, The Tampa Tribune. It has suffered layoffs and buyouts to continue the fight and preserve its integrity, but questions surround how it will survive.       To quote a great man, "I don't hate Roman Reigns, I hate this idea that he's the best."    Ziggler was talking directly to him when he was mouthing off. Even if nobody else in the company does, Ziggler still wants to face Daniel Bryan. They're aren't going to do that, though, because that match would undoubtedly steal the show.    If Ziggler isn't careful he's going to have some big heat backstage.     going around licking women and being some sort of fucked up pseudo lesbian  They've done this numerous divas, starting with Mickie James, the Bellas, AJ, etc. It's coming from up high.   	199
 Just to play devil's advocate . . . it could just be an editing oversight, a plotting mistake in a long and complicated book that no one ever caught.  To demonstrate that this is at least possible, in high school we were assigned to read a book, in preparation for a visit of the author to our school.  Everyone in my class was upset about the death of a pet in the book; we spent at least half a class period discussing what the author might have meant by it.  Unlike most of these speculative discussions, we were able to "settle" this one by asking the author himself why he made that choice.  He laughed and said it was because he forgot that the pet was in the hazardous situation that causes its death in the book, and when he noticed during later edits, he decided to go with it instead of bothering to change it.   Oh sorry, I totally agree with that objection.  I just thought maybe it was a misunderstanding of the actual research.   I guess I'm asking more about how the quality of the original DNA compares with other DNA from ancient sources, and how much that might impact the quality/accuracy of the genome sequence that we have.  Are there potential biases in the sequence that would make phylogenetic comparisons more difficult?   How do the challenges of working with mammoth DNA compare with the challenges of other sources of ancient DNA (from either a technical or informatics perspective?)   If you think this research is neat, please go ask this guy some questions: https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3coa1l/animals_can_coordinate_neural_activity_to_perform/csxwvj8  Edit: Link to comment from a former member of the lab that did this work.   Part of the issue is that it's not necessarily the same link, but very obviously the same research/original primary article.  Plus with a research story this unusual, common sense suggests there's no way it didn't already get posted 24 hours after it was published.   https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3csby1/scientists_demonstrate_animal_mindmelds/csygoym  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3cosf0/neuroscientists_can_now_create_a_network_of/csxmer8  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3cohmh/building_an_organic_computing_device_with/csxlcnh  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3cog9k/animal_brains_connected_up_to_make_mindmelded/csxkf9k  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3colgz/scientists_demonstrate_animal_mindmelds_new/csxib6n  https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3coa1l/animals_can_coordinate_neural_activity_to_perform/  I know that fake internet points aren't the point of /r/science and maybe that's an argument why this shouldn't frustrate me.  But it's also an argument why people should do a better job of searching for prior posts before they post.  If the discussion of a research article is scattered across 5-10 different posts, it's probably going to be less awesome than if it were all on the same post.  By chance, a researcher who had worked in the lab this research came from commented on my original post.  I think that's really neat and I wish more people were asking him/her questions.   This research has been posted 6 times in the last 24 hours.   Frank McCourt, who wrote *Angela's Ashes*?  As far as I know, he was unknown before he wrote and published that.   *The Dog Who Wouldn't Be* by Farley Mowat:  [The pact of timelessness between the two of us was ended, and I went from him into the darkening tunnel of the years.](/s "The pact of timelessness between the two of us was ended, and I went from him into the darkening tunnel of the years.")       Thanks for pointing this out, this was a huge oversight in the headline writing.  The researchers in this study showed that the most commonly used antidepressant, along with several others, were not associated with increased risk of birth defects in their study.   Original paper: http://www.nature.com/articles/srep11869 "Building an organic computing device with multiple interconnected brains"  Edit to add a cool quote from the paper: "Our central goal was to investigate how well [different ways of linking brain electrode inputs and outputs between four rats] could be employed by the four rats to collaborate in order to solve a particular computational task. [They tested] discrete classification, sequential and parallel computations, and memory storage/retrieval. As predicted, we observed that Brainets [the four rats linked together] consistently outperformed individual rats in each of these tasks."      I think Dirk Gently is fantastic, and I've never heard of Last Chance to See!  I'm excited to go find it now.   Echolocation was not the ancestral state.  Bats became nocturnal before they evolved echolocation.  There are many ways that evolution could work; to discover and prove how it did work in a particular situation takes more than guessing.

Every good narration starts with that. :)   Sweet, thanks Blankekeke!   From a completely objective point of view, season 5 episode 2 was brilliant.  What's that? N-no. Not ... not because I have two stories featured in that one. Nope. Shhhhh. Being perfectly objective. Yup. TOTALLY OBJECTIVE FOR REALZ.  I'd say all the episodes are stellar and definitely worth getting season passes. What makes it so hard to pick one episode over the other is that the types of stories told varies greatly, so if there's one story that's not quite your cup of tea, the next could still send you into a frantic fear-spiral of doom.

I think that covers all the ones I know about.   Fear of heights is in there twice.  Unless it's secretly fear of repetition?! AAAH!   I should have known when the squad car pulled into the run-down police station that something wasn't quite right. The building looked old and abandoned. The police insignia lay crooked in a bed of tall grass, the letters 'PO' were missing from the display above the main doors, leaving only 'LICE' in their wake, and graffiti littered the outer walls. If not for the two other vehicles at the very back of the lot, I would have thought we'd pulled into the wrong place. The squad cars were in as pitiful a shape as the station. Their emblem and motto  To Serve and Protect  were faded with age and coated in dirt, their tires were deflated, and one of their tail lights had shattered. Yeah, warning bells definitely should have gone off in my head, but if you cant trust the police, who can you trust? I attributed the buildings poor condition to budget cuts. Since they could not go on strike, officers frequently and openly protested the citys cheap financial support by wearing mismatched socks and all sorts of inappropriate pants, ranging from army print to clown stripes.  Two officers escorted me inside. If the main lobby was any indication, then the interior was as poorly-maintained as the exterior. I waited by the reception desk on an old schoolhouse chair. Its green and cracked back did not match the colors of the other two next to it. While the officers traded a few words with the woman behind the desk, I couldn't help but notice how very much alike they were. It wasn't just the uniform, either. The three were the same height, had the same hair color and style, carried themselves in the same posture, and shared the same build.  "Excuse me," I interrupted, walking over to the trio.  One of the officers who'd brought me in turned towards me, "What?" he asked.  I motioned to a chipped mug full of pens, "Can I have one?"  "Yeah, sure," he replied, his tone barely registering emotion.  I pocketed the pen happily, and took a seat once more. If I was going to be stuck here all evening, at least I'd get a souvenir. The three continued to talk while I waited in the humid lobby. Couldn't they at least open a window to get a breeze rolling? The air was so thick and tasted so bitter that I could barely breathe.  Once the officers sorted everything out, they lead me down a dirty corridor. Dried leafs littered the ground, crunching under my feet as I walked. Surely, they could find room in their budget for a janitor? As we moved through the station, I began to notice more and more issues: missing doors, broken windows, and even a hole in the roof. Frankly, I half-expected to see a family of raccoons scurrying about. There also seemed to be a surprisingly small roster of officers on duty in the station. We seemed to pass the same two guys almost everywhere we went.  "In here," said one of the uniformed men, motioning to a set of doors, "well come get you when it's time."  I nodded and stepped through the double doors. The smell on the other side was even worse than in the lobby. It was a mix of sweat and the unique odor of slightly-burnt skin after a few hours under the sun. Unsurprisingly, the room was full of men with very similar features to my own. Aside from one old man in the corner, we also looked about the same age.  "Guess we're all here for the line-up, huh?" I asked, in an attempt to break the ice.  The others averted their gazes. The situation wasn't ideal, but I saw no reason to be sour about it. It was our civic duty, and being grumpy wouldn't change a thing. We'd all been cherry-picked to act as distractors in a police line-up. I hadn't been particularly thrilled when the police officers stopped me on my way home from work telling me I matched the description of a violent mugger, but I calmed down once they reassured me that I was not the suspect, merely a decoy. I was missing the season finale of my favorite show for this, but at least I was doing something useful for society.  The old man's head rose slowly, "Son, you won't be leaving any time soon," he warned.  When I saw his face, I nearly gasped. He was old, yes, but his facial features were remarkably similar to my own. We had the same green eyes, curved nose, and similar cheek bones. If we were to walk around town together, people would surely assume he was my dad.  "Oh, that's okay. I'm not in a rush," I answered cheerfully.  My gaze shifted from the old man to the others in the room. We all shared a remarkable likeness. Whoever the victim was, he'd have a hell of a hard time identifying the attacker. No one stood out. Even I would have trouble telling us apart. I thought the others would be as amused as I was, but they all kept to themselves. Unable to find a conversational partner, I took a seat so I could wait for the officer to return. The silence started making me nervous, as though everyone knew a secret I wasn't privy to. Every now and again, I caught them glancing at me from the corner of their eyes. It was unnerving.  Silence  it was so quiet that I could hear the hum of neon lights all the way down the hall. They played in peculiar unison, like instruments in a Bethovian orchestra.  The door creaked open. The others cringed and recoiled as an officer stepped inside. I honestly couldn't tell if it was one of the two that had driven me in, or a different officer altogether. It was only when I saw him next to the other men in the room that I realized something: he, too, could pass as one of us. The eyes, the cheekbones --- he looked like me. Like *us*. My skin crawled at the eerie realization that everyone I had seen in the past hour or so looked just like me. How had I not noticed sooner? I tried to shake the unsettling feeling away with a forced shiver, but I was only half-successful.  The officer lifted a hand, his index finger pointing to six of us, "You. You there. You two  you, and you, by the wall," he commanded.  I got up and walked over, while the other five gasped and groaned. They reluctantly approached. Though I did not understand their gloomy reactions, part of me felt the same way. Still, the quicker we went through the line-up, the quicker we'd get to go home. I, for one, was glad I'd been chosen to be part of group 1.  The officer handed out numbered boards. My board, #5, looked ancient. Its corners were rounded with wear, coffee stains coated the surface, and yellowing tape kept portions of it in place. The others took their boards with as much enthusiasm as a kid handed a plateful of steamed broccoli. I'd never seen grown men quite manage the childlike look of disgust and accompanying pout until that day.  Once we received our numbers, we were brought to a suffocatingly narrow room with doors on both ends. I could hear the door locking behind us, which made me wonder if the mugger was in the room with me. Fortunately, I was at a police station. If there was one place a violent mugger wouldn't try anything stupid, it'd be in the middle of a police station. The back wall was decorated in faded height lines like those seen in mug shots. They made me realize that, strangely enough, we were *all* the exact same height, right down to the half-inch. In front of us was a large glass pane through which we could see a pair of identical-looking police officers sitting on stools, watching us. *That's odd*, I remember thinking, *Don't they usually use double-sided mirrors?*  "Not me  not me  not me " murmured #3, his voice quivering with fear.  He wasn't the only one acting strangely. #1 and #4 were huddled in the corner, facing away from the window. #2 and #6 were fidgeting and whispering beneath their breaths. *Grow up*, I thought. Why were they all so nervous? Was I missing something obvious? Could we get in trouble if we were mistakenly identified?  The victim walked into the room on the other side of the glass. Even though he held his head low, I couldn't help but notice the similarities. He had my build and my haircut, though *his* body was covered in bruises and blood. I felt a chill run down the back of my neck, filling me with the same anxious dread as my fellow distractors. A feeling in my gut urged me to run away, yet I found myself paralysed with unexplainable fear. This was silly. There was no reason to be afraid, or so I hoped. My nervousness increased with every step the victim took. He looked pretty banged up. There was no reason to think he hadn't been attacked by a mugger, but I couldn't shake the feeling that something else was going on.  The victim's head turned upwards.  "Oh, god " I whispered.  I was looking at myself. He wasn't just a crude look-alike like the others. No, he was definitely *me*. Even through the swollen lip and black eye, I recognized every square inch of my face: the placement of my freckles, my childhood scar along my hairline, my right eye, which was slightly smaller than the left. He had them all. I didn't have time to fully take in the phenomena before the doppelgnger lifted his arm, an accusatory finger outstretched. I knew before he even did it. I knew he was going to point to me. I knew, yet it didn't, spare me the shock when he did it. It felt like being smacked in the face by a stray baseball. He pointed straight at me, an electrifying feeling surging through my body as he did so. If that wasn't bad enough, the others in the line-up suddenly calmed down. They looked like they'd just dodged a bullet, which sent me into a panic.  When I saw the police officers rise from their seats while looking at me, I knew I had to run. I bolted to the emergency exit. The door was locked. I could hear the sound of a key jingling in the door on the other side of the room. There was no doubt in my mind that the officers were coming for me. With a fair dose of adrenaline fuelling my actions, I grabbed a fire extinguisher and smashed it against the doorknob. It took three tries to get it, but it finally broke off, allowing the door to swing open just as the cops came in from the other end. I could vaguely hear them shouting, though I could not make out a word of what they were saying over the combined sounds of my heartbeat and blood gushing to my head. I ran as fast as my feet allowed, feeling myself drowning in unexplainable fear.  Lost  I was lost. Lost in the building, lost in fear, lost in desperate and unshakable panic. An alarm went off, practically paralysing me with its piercing shriek. More than ever, I wanted to escape the endless maze of run-down hallways and broken light fixtures. I could barely hear the officers' footsteps over the mechanical warning call, but my senses were just sharp enough that I could safely evade them.  I ran for what felt like hours, but could have been minutes. I ran until my chest burned with exhaustion and my muscles cramped. I ran until I came across the waiting room from where I'd been in earlier. Hoping to warn the others, I stepped inside.  The room was empty, but for the old man in the back.  "Hey!" I shouted, "We've got to get out of here!"  He didn't answer.  I walked closer, and noticed something on his head. My scar. *That's impossible * I thought, gasping in shock. I placed a hand on his shoulder to try and shake him, but he'd gone cold. His skin had become dry and pruny, like a tomato left out in the sun for too long. I recoiled in terror, a loud scream escaping my lips. Suddenly, I felt a pair of fingers digging into my shoulder with the strength of a crocodile's jaw. Again, I shouted, desperately swatting at the captor's hand. By twisting my shoulder uncomfortably, I managed to break free of the vice-like grip and turn around, only to be confronted with my bruised doppelgnger. A look of bitter contempt had found a permanent home on his face. I never realized how unsettling that look was when I gave it to others. My lookalike deliberately blocked the exit, ensuring that escape would not be easy. When he made a move towards me, I acted on instinct and felt my arm flying towards his face. The sound of broken glass erupted from him as my fist connected with his already damaged eye.  Pain. Sharp, blinding pain   I stumbled to the side, holding my throbbing right eye. It thumped and prickled with a thousand needles. My vision became blurry, but not blurry enough to keep me from seeing the other "me" run towards me. I had to defend myself. I punched, elbowed, and jabbed at him. Few of my blows actually connected  I'm not exactly a martial arts expert  but the ones that did sent pain flooding into me. My frantic blitz came to an end when I went for his stomach. The pressure nearly took my breath away. There was no beating him: I had to run. I shoved him aside, fully expecting him to try and grab me. To my surprise, he fell to the floor and didn't try to get up. Had I hurt him more than I thought?  My relief was short-lived. As soon as I stepped back out into the hallway, I ran into a pair of officers. Their expressions were strangely blank. An thought came to mind when I realized that I was covered in bruises. What if they thought I was the "victim"?  "He's in there," I said, mustering up every bit of calm that I could manage.  The officers, without hesitating, ran into the waiting area. I didn't know how long my ruse would work, so I took off towards the entrance. When I reached the lobby, the receptionist from earlier stood up and turned to me. I only looked at her for a moment, but my eyes caught sight of my scar on her head. *What the hell.* There was no time to think or try to understand. She started chasing after me, so I ran out the doors as fast as I could.  The air outside smelled so fresh, devoid of the stagnant after-taste in the police station. It was dark out, and I remember feeling hopeful that I could blend into the night and escape. I heard stomping footsteps behind me, saw beams of light pointed at me, and could hear sirens blaring in the distance. I recall running, but I confess, I don't remember how I got home. I have no recollection of reaching my apartment complex, unlocking my door, or getting in bed.  But I must have.  I woke up this morning safe and sound in my bed, albeit quite sore. When I got up to brush my teeth, my reflection sent a shiver down my spine. My face was bruised and swollen. The wounds were identical to the ones I saw on the victim at the police station. The busted lip, the black eye, and the cut on his cheek  they were all the same. My heart raced wildly, blurry after-images dancing in my head. Running. Police officers. My face. My face *everywhere*. As I leaned back, I felt something in my pocket. I reached for it and retrieved the pen Id taken from the police station, inspecting it closely. The city police motto was written on it, though half of it was scratched out. It read:  "To serve"   Congrats! :)   You rockin' that shirt like a rockin' horse.

Manen talks in the third person sometimes, but he's a very normal person, he assures you!   Lovely idea!   My coworker made me try [Blindscape](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gavinbrown.blindscape hl=en), which is a somewhat interactive app/story. It's really well made (considering all you see is a black screen). It's like listening to a NoSleep story. Pretty cool.   Thanks for the feedback, I appreciate it. You're quite right: the story would be much more chilling if it dealt with psychiatric issues rather than supernatural ones. (Though one could argue that the werewolf is a metaphor for her psychiatric issues. Hahaha, ok, no. I definitely meant it as a werewolf.)   Howdy,  I can't identify which episode it is, but I can tell you that it's not in seasons 1 through 3, as I recently listened to them and that story doesn't ring a bell. Hopefully that narrows things down for you.   No. xD  To put it diplomatically  the NoSleep Interviewer decided to quit NoSleep as a whole.   Y'know how your mom always used to tell you not to stare into the sun for too long? Well, someone found out why.   That's OK. I was a little shy when I first started coming here. Rest assured, we're happy to help. (Or grumpy but still willing to help!)   As team leader, I am contractually obligated to be positive in public. As a result, my comments about the story are as follows:  * It was a story. * It had words. * Sometimes, those words formed sentences.  GO TEAM!   Good job Grumpy Murder Sharks!  Good job Steve from Corporate, who just kept staring at us quietly the whole time. It was very  uh  motivating?   Well, I love you right back--- in a totally creepy way. ;D   Totally not a judgement, xandra, but instead of asking whether we wondered the same thing, why not flat-out ask where the ideas came from? A lot of the NoSleep authors visit the OOC and are more than happy to answer questions. Mind you, we're a comical bunch, so we might just tell ya our oven mits talk to us at night and give us our ideas, but it doesn't hurt to ask.  Hypothetically, if you ask, I'd tell you that my ideas just come into existence out of the blue. Sometimes, I see an object and a story weaves itself from there, sometimes I'm taking a shower and the voices in my head write a story. It all depends.   Are they for hire? I can pay in candy.   It wouldn't be Reddit's responsibility to enforce an author's copyright. Stories posted here are the property of their respective authors. Hypothetically, if someone wanted to make a movie adaptation, then they need to ask for permission and option out the story (usually at a certain price).   It's simple really [...]  It looks like some kind of formula to generate a wormhole or something. It makes my brain bleed.  But then again, I never did have any aptitude for the maths.

 I think it also depends on the size of your gaming group. If your gaming group is expanding and you find that sometimes 2 tables are playing at the same time, then I think it's very reasonable to purchase more games.   To give another perspective, you should also think about whether **your gaming group** is ready for Terra Mystica. You/your group seem to be mostly into interactive and thematic games but TM, whilst being an excellent strategy game (and my personal favourite), brings a different vibe to the table. As my friend once said, if he sees my game of TM with silent players hands folded, staring at the board intensely, he knows that we're having some serious fun.  Mage knight is really good as a solo game anyways so if you enjoy character progression and action point optimisation, and don't mind reading rules I'd suggest buying it.   There's a whole range of boardgames that could be played solo  available: [BGG link](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/search/boardgame?sort=rank advsearch=1 q= include%5Bdesignerid%5D= include%5Bpublisherid%5D= geekitemname= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Byearpublished%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bminage%5D%5Bmax%5D= range%5Bnumvoters%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bnumweights%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bminplayers%5D%5Bmax%5D=1 range%5Bmaxplayers%5D%5Bmin%5D=1 range%5Bleastplaytime%5D%5Bmin%5D= range%5Bplaytime%5D%5Bmax%5D= floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmin%5D=6 floatrange%5Bavgrating%5D%5Bmax%5D=10 floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmin%5D= floatrange%5Bavgweight%5D%5Bmax%5D= playerrangetype=normal B1=Submit)  Also, technically all fully cooperative games (e.g. **Pandemic**) can be played solo. You just have to take up the role of more than 1 player yourself.    What are specific details that made you appreciate the attention to details that board game designers have put in a game? It may be something subtle in the rule book, designs on the board, player aids etc.  For me, I have found the following useful:  1. Easy reference sheet on the back of the rule book (instead of credits!) to explain various icons so that you don't have waste time flipping through the book.  2. If money is open information and is used frequently, use a resource track on the board to indicate how much each player has. Also makes the game less fiddly.  3. Different icons in addition to player colours for the colour blind players.   Looks like you enjoy Euros so obligatory: **Power Grid**, **Keyflower**, **Eclipse** and **Lords of Waterdeep w/ expansion**.    The rules are on BGG already, and Rahdo plays through the game in his video.   I do agree with your point on stretch goals.   Have you tried the mini-expansion? It adds a few interesting element with the new engineers and bonus tiles. As there is a public pool of really strong bonus tiles there's more of an incentive to rush to get it.   Pretty solid month for me, listing from my least to most favourite:  **Machi Koro The Harbour Expansion** - Dragged the base game much longer, and in truth everyone is just waiting to buy the tuna boat.  **Ghost Stories** - Too relentless as a co-op, not much feeling of reward/satisfaction when you kill ghosts as more of them just keep on coming.   **X-COM** - Pretty neat asymmetric roles in a real time co-op. Maybe I'm just not a big fan of co-ops though..  **Xia - Legends of a Drift System** - A 4 hour game (with 5p) that depended on dice rolling....I did win by shipping goods (with Lone Drifter and Manchester it's really easy). It's fun if you like a lot of chaos and random outcomes I guess.  **Kemet** - The design is very solid and the tech tree is pretty interesting. A bit too vicious for me.  **Chicago Express** - Fast paced economic game with bidding mechanism. No variability in setup though.  *Summoner Wars** - Quick head-to-head battling card game. Getting to exploit your own faction's strengths is pretty fun.  **The Ancient World** - A nice little mix of mechanics but nothing really groundbreaking in this game. A decent gateway worker placement.  **Belfort** - Area control game with worker placement mechanics. It seemed harmless but the play style of each game is different due to the special buildings that comes out. I love worker placement with variable powers of workers so this fits the bill.  **Captains of Industry** - A (mostly) closed economy game where players produce, buy and sell resources to each other. Lovely interactions with a great simulation to micro-economics. Would definitely replay.  **CO2** - Very intricate Euro but once you get pass learning the rules it's very fun to build combos and getting what you exactly need in a round. I love games where there seem to be very limited actions (15 turns per player in a 4p game) but there are actually a lot of decision making required. Players also need to pay a lot of attention to what other people are planning and capable to do on their turn.   **Scoville** - a new game about planting and harvesting peppers. If you stand between two fields of red pepper and blue pepper...you harvest a purple pepper. You get points for planting peppers on the fields and spending peppers you own on recipes/quests.    In 4-5 player games, players need to make much tougher decisions:  1. Initial placements: obviously you will have to think harder when more players are present on the board.   2. Map is much tighter: Triple terra-forms, upgrading to 3-shipping, using priests as workers...you seldom see this happening in a 2p game but be prepared to do so once you get blocked in a 5p game.  3. Power generation is much quicker, but the good power actions are easily taken in the first action of any given round.  4. Cult tracks are much tighter - in a 2p game if you've fallen behind on a track you just don't bother moving up. Same for largest network.  5. Favour tiles and Town tiles. There are 3 of each in the level 1-2 favour tiles, and 2 of each for town tiles (in the base game). This means you could pretty much guarantee to get what you want in a 2p game. Definitely not happening in a 5p game.  6. Variability. It's just maths. The combination of factions present on the board becomes much more varied with a 4-5p game. You'll need to keep an eye on more player's special abilities.   Yup! I learned Caverna before I played Agricola so on my first play through I felt constrained and under accomplished.  Then I played Caverna about 10 more times and eventually got bored as there is practically no random setup. You don't need to plan that much ahead as there are way too many alternatives. I've switched back to Agricola and find it much more satisfying when a plan works out!   **Shadowrun: Crossfire** or **Legendary deck building games** to a Harry Potter theme.   Have played **Pictomania**. It's one of my favourite party games! The rules are very simple, basically there is a common board of topics on display and you are randomly assigned one of it to draw, but you have to guess other people's drawings quickly at the same time.  There's a variety of difficulty that players can choose, from easy ones like submarine, goat, gardener, to abstract ones like who, bored, insurance.   **Nippon** - from the designers of Panamax. Probably out in Essen?  **The Gallerist** - from the designer of Kanban. Should be on kickstarter soon.  **La Granja** - waiting for a reprint in the summer!   **The Resistance: Avalon**, **Game of Thrones (2nd ed)**, **BSG**, **Cosmic Encounter**,   Betrayal and backstabbing are just not within my definition of fun.   Not boring, but standard as in getting duplicate ingredients, testing twice, publish a theory. Sure the artifacts mix things up a bit, but you can't really plan too much ahead as it will depend on the test results.   Alchemists is a good game, but I don't think it is that replayable. Once everyone knows the procedure of crossing out boxes, the first two rounds become fairly standard.  	17

Jed York and Baalke are going to run this ship into the ground and it's so sad to watch. I feel the worst for Frank Gore. That poor, poor man. He deserves better than this!   What were the ramifications of getting busted telling your tall tale? I know you have some funny/crazy stories...  	50
 Bacon, garlic powder, and sriracha in split pea is my ultimate lazy meal.   Just looked at the website for the annual persimmon festival that occurs about an hour south of me, but the recipes were all for persimmon pudding or praline.  I've had some amazing persimmon breads and cakes, as well as jelly type things, pies, crumbles, and even had them on top of pancakes. But I've never had them in anything savory, although I think it could be done well.  The Mitchell, IN, Persimmon Festival is a wonderful thing.   That sounds amazing! Risotto is my go-to dish that seems fancy. Bacon, mushrooms, kale/chard, and parmesan is my personal favorite.   Glad my French isn't too rusty to understand that. Granted, this the first semester in 7 years that I haven't taken a French class.   What a beautiful memorial. So so so sorry for your loss, but now you will always have her. I think if my (not twin) sister passed before me, I would do the same.   Now that I know what's in the animal sauce, I'm ok with the fact that I've never been to In n Out, and probably never will.   Yeah, this is why I'm afraid of growing hebrs in my apartment. There isn't a single wind that they don't like to sit in.   States here, I've only had "Irish" stew from a local place whose famous appetizer is literally deep fried balls of cheddar mashed potatoes, but the stew there is good. Btown is known for ethnic food, but I bet most of it is still far from authentic.   Oh sewing injuries. This one didn't happen to me, but my mom. She wasn't paying enough attention using the machine and bam! Needle all the way through her thumb. That was a fun ER trip.   I'm drinking myself to death. I'm only 22. I know I have a problem. I go through two handles a week. I miss a lot of class because I'm passed out by the time I need to leave.   But I'm terrified of quitting. My family says I seem much happier, and I feel happier because I'm drunk. All the time. I have the worst dreams when I go to bed sober. Memories of the man who emotionally abused me and images of him with my former best friend creep up unless I drink them away. I don't start crying for no reason when everything seems funny.  I don't want to stop because I don't like who I am when I'm sober. But I know that this is eventually going to kill me. Whether it be physically or due to the fact that missing so much class will kill my dreams, it will kill me.   Like others have said, raspberries, but also a really good, dry red wine. Maybe some pistachios.   Hate to hijack a thread, but is there any way to do this with an electric range? It's all I've ever known, amd my current apartment has one.   Yup. Pound of sugar, pound of flour, pound of eggs, pound of butter, pound of something else, from my memory. Why they're called pound cakes.   It's a sign of psychopathy. But a mental disorder still doesn't excuse it, in my mind. Like, I have been diagnosed with more than one mental disorder, but hurting innocent creatures like this is despicable.   Roast beef and melted swiss with spinach, mushrooms, carrots, and green bell pepper on toasted rye with honey and red pepper flakes. A side of proper mac and cheese, the kind that is baked with gruyere, asiago, and parmesan.   I always order it "warmed through," or "as rare as is legal.'   So, my father has made what we call Lamb-o Bucco for years. It is my favorite dish ever.  However, my father has recently gotten sober, so having any alcohol in the house just won't happen. When he made it this past weekend, he used a mix of cider vinegar and grape juice concentrate. It was good, but nothing like how it used to be.  I don't want to trigger him by suggesting buying those tiny bottles of wine, since he would only need one, but they come in packs of four, but is there any suggestion y'all could come up with?   TL;DR: alcoholic father in recovery, how to replace wine in recipes.   That definitely happens. I made the unrealistic New year's resolution to make all of May family blankets for Christmas, and realized that I won't be able to do it. But good to hear that yours is coming together!   I'm working on my second ripple Afghan (and my third Afghan ever after making nothing but hats and scarves). Once you get in the zone, it will come together. Get some stitch markers, if you need them, put on a movie (I've been rewatching Matilda and Mulan a lot), or some show you like (all of the Star Treks are on Netflix, hint hint nudge nudge), and work for a couple hours a day. If you work on it a bit a day, it can come together in a couple months.   Not at all! I'm not really a "girly girl," nor a tomboy, but that color combo seems very neutral.  I'm working on an Afghan for my grandma that is about the same height by now, so good luck!   I never used to salt my pasta water, and don't really find much of a difference.   My family calls it a one-eyed Egyptian.  All of these other names make way more sense, though.   They're fine. As a poor college kid myself, I often buy meat the day before the sell by date and freeze it. Sell by usually means use by is at least a week and half later.   Haha, that's basically how my tiny high school made beignets in French class.   Yes. Cornflake chicken was a favorite of mine growing up, and now I just love non traditional breadings. Flamin hot fried chicken, anyone?   Earlier this year I decided to try a spicy strawberry risotto. I've had spicy berry dishes that I loved, but this was so awful. It had sriracha, strawberries, pea shoots, and worst of all, an entire bottle of Gewurstraminer. It was bitter and sweet and spicy all at the same time, and was still somehow fairly bland. Just awful.   Same, although I learned the hard way that it's a bad life choice to make a super garlicky dish for someone you intend on making out with. Even though you've both eaten it, it still tastes icky.   Ended up only making hats, but I was able to teach a couple people how to make sc scarves, one of them well enough to be able to teach someone else! Sadly, I was only able to stay for 6 hours, because I found out that drinking too many energy drinks is a bad life choice (I've now been up for 18 hours and don't feel tired at all, and Red Bull puke is a thing), but at least I got two and a half hats done!  The knitters got a couple scarves done total, and several people learned new skills! The experienced crocheters/knitters will be finishing projects that were started, so the children will be getting quite a few hats and scarves.  All in all, it was a very successful event. The host was excited to start Project Linus events, even though the nearest chapter is about 45 minutes away. We learned that knit/crochet a thons will probably work better for other times, like noon to midnight, but a lot of fun was had by all.

So sweet.   That makes sense. I'll look up a pattern or two for mittens, and stick to my hats for the beginners.  I only thought wrist warmers because they're just rectangles stitched into tubes with small holes, which is great for people who may be crocheting for the first time.   That's a great idea! I'll look up some patterns.  And yeah, this event is awesome. I always do it with my leftover yarn, anyway, but so far there are 13 people who are gonna be there for at least a few hours. That's a lot of hats/scarves/whatever for those less fortunate!   https://www.facebook.com/events/1521030161471079/  This is a great event! We will be meeting to make cold weather gear for kids at the Middle Way House, the local battered women's shelter. It's tomorrow 7pm to 7am, although you don't need to stay the whole time.  If you live off campus, like me, you can still come in through the veranda till midnight. And I bet some of the awesome residents will help you if you may need to go out for a smoke once in a while (again, like me).  There will be yarn, needles, amd hooks provided, along with free snacks. If you don't know how to knit or crochet, there will be people there who can teach you (myself included on the crochet side).  TL;DR: knit-a-thon tomorrow at Collins for a great cause. You can learn a new skill and work for the greater good at the same time!   Tomorrow night (7pm to 7am) a group will be meeting on campus to make cold weather gear for the children at our local battered women's shelter. A great cause, but I will be the only crochet expert there, in a slew of knitters (not that I have anything against bistitchuals).  I've come up with an easy, 2 hour children's hat pattern, but is there anything else you'd suggest? Wrist warmers come to mind, which I can also teach newbies in two seconds.   I'd especially like something to show how big a child's wrists or neck are. I've got a chart about hats, but I hardly ever see kids, so I dont know how big to make these things.   I've only recently gotten to where I enjoy cheese, so a mild one is better for people like me. Mozzarella and baby Swiss are my favorites, and I still can only enjoy them melted. So the mildness can be nice for some people.  That said, I hope that I will be able to taste bleu or brie without gagging soon. I'm on my way.   Roast beef and swiss on toasted rye. I usually add spinach and mushrooms, and always ALWAYS put a drizzle of honey and some red pepper flakes.   My choco chip recipe calls for water. I've been told they're the best cookies ever /brag   This. I have one crop top that I pair with a high waisted a line skirt, and only about an inch of my smallest bit shows. That's one of my favorite outfits.   My dad's answer to "do you want to pray with us?" is "sure! Let me go get my goat." Haven't been bothered in years.   This class sounds awesome. I have a dream of going to pastry school in France. Was the class in French? Do you already live in/near Paris? If not, was it worth the travel, and how did you feel about Parisians? I haven't spent much time there, and both times I went, we spent so much time doing touristy stuff that I got a kinda bad impression.   Livers and kidneys are the only things that gross me out, simply because they are organs that filter out toxins.  That said, I have mildly enjoyed foie gras, and cow's brain is one of the most delectable things I've ever had. And I love most things that freak out my friends (escargot and sea cucumber are two of my favorite foods).   ....I, I want to be a steak fairy.   Going in on it with several other people seems worth it. Personally, I won't do it, just because I remember the horror story that happened after my sister bought one with her boyfriend at the time. It came in about a week before Thanksgiving, when she flew back home. In that time, her freezer died, which meant she came home to two week old beef and its smell permeating a studio apartment.   I've had people actively thank me for looking away from my phone when crossing the street or walking through a parking lot. Like, really? It's so rare that you need to thank someone who isn't a moron?   Mini toga and makeup to look like my eyes have been stabbed out.  Slutty Pentecostal would be pretty easy.   Ok. This is kind of weird.  I hate the slew of slutty costumes, so I intend on mocking them this year. I'm pretty set on my two main ideas, but am unsure how to pull them off.  I will be spending Halloween night doing a bar crawl with some friends, including my bestie. My birthday is the 28th and hers is the 2nd, so we treat the whole thing as birthday Halloweek.  I'm torn between slutty Teddy Roosevelt and slutty Oedipus. With the former, I feel like I'd have to carry a big stick all night, which isn't conducive to bar hopping. I'm afraid that the latter may go over many people's heads.  I'm a 21 year old female (22 on the 28th), 5'8", and around 165 pounds, although I hope to continue losing weight until birthday Halloweek. I'm leaning more towards Slutty Oedipus.  Is there any way y'all could help me with either costume?  TL;DR: I'm torn between going as slutty Teddy Roosevelt and Slutty Oedipus for a bar crawl this Halloween, because I want to mock the slew of slutty costumes you see every year. Help?   Haha, if you can come down to Southern Indiana, they're free.   Good tip on the eggplant parm. That is also good, because one of the vegetarians also hates cheese, so I could just put less or none on top of a few slices.   And the step-dad's opinion clearly contradicts his Biblical argument. Turn the other cheek, hatred is bad; nope, some people deserve hate?   Yes! I'm a born and bred atheist, but I have read the Bible and bits and pieces of the Qur'an. Part of why I'm learning Arabic is actually because I want to be able to appreciate the poetry of the Qur'an. It's amazing how people identify as incredbly religious can be so ignorant.   I usually just buy distinctive ones. So I can see if someone is using a duck lighter of one with a sexy lady on it after the sesh, and know it's mine.   /R/tiltshift it's a photography style or an editing style that is designed to make big things look like miniature models.   He's just a big kitty.   Def the real ones.   Making croissants is one of my favorite things. Thinking about doing pain au chocolat for dessert and making them a day or two in advance,   Oh my goodness, that sounds fantastic. Definitely going to save this!   Good idea, although there is a distinct possibility that it will have already snowed by the time this is going on. Also, the only grill I have available to me is a mini one that was left outside by the previous tenant.   I would be so happy serving just a slew of seafood and shellfish, but I'm sadly the only one of my friends who likes it.  Coq au vin could be good, since it stews for so long it loses its "chickenyness," if you forgive my horrid made up word.   Good idea! And squashes are very easy to find around here, and the "health food" store a block from my place has them for months.   I've tried and tried to like them. In a stew, with rice, deep fried, baked, blended, I just don't like them. But at least I've tried. The two foods I will just not eat have gone through trying.   Duck sounds like a good option. Still just a roast bird, but so different from turkey. Plus, I could put my veggies for roasting under the bird. Vegetarian sides are easy, plus an entree.  I'll have to check out the lentil bolognese. Serious eats is always good, and I love lentils.  Edit:  I ADORE making pain au chocolat. When I make a batch of croissants, I usually do about half as pain au chocolat. And that way I cpuld make a not super sweet dessert a day or two in advance.  Pumpkin sage soup sounds really yummy, and serving it cold means I can transfer it to a bowl in the fridge, freeing up a pot for something else.   I get that. My vegetarian friends just always complain about how most big dinners are just that, and I totally understand.   I just see it as something totally different. Just like sometimes I just have an intense craving for Easy Mac, even though the proper, baked, three real cheese stuff is way better.   Ah! I'm planning on trying shakshuka for an extra credit dinner for Arabic class, anyway, so that's a great idea! I'll look into the pasta, too, although one of the strictest vegetarians invited also hates cheese.   That's a pretty good idea. I never even thought of using chickpeas because, personally, I have never found a way I enjoy them, no matter how I've tried (yes, including falafels and hummus). I'll look into this, and maybe try them out on the some people who like them before the big day.   Salad is a good idea. And I've been itching to make my own French Onion soup for a while. I'll keep both these in mind. Thanks!   All of that makes a lot of sense, especially about hor wellington really needs to be med rare. Idk about meats, but I know at least a couple of these people won't eat a fried egg if the yolk is runny at all.  As for roast veggies, I think that's now a pretty set menu item. So good and so easy.   That is a great idea! I will definitely be keeping that in my back pocket.  As for bread, I'm really lost. No one complained about brioche being top rich last year, even with the pound of butter and 12 eggs in the whole loaf.   I may very well just end up doing my ham again this year. It was really good, and then I can make stock for split pea soup, which is a must for me over the winter. A vegetarian lasagna or eggplant parmesan, or something with eggplants will probably be my veggie entree.  I'm trying to stay away from traditional Thanksgiving fair, as this will be after everyone else has gone home for it, anyway.   Haha, the weird jelly stuff from a can is one of my favorite Thanksgiving things, even though I've has the real stuff and that is the only thing from a can at home.   Ooh, fondue is a good idea, although I dont think I can fit another food gadget in my apartment.   For some reason, I really like cooking it all myself, besides a little help when I text someone a hour or two before because I'm overwhelmed. I think a big problem last year was that I tried making the brioche the same day.   For some reason, I really like cooking it all myself, besides a little help when I text someone a hour or two before because I'm overwhelmed. I think a big problem last year was that I tried making the brioche the same day.   Oooh, let's see if I can remember. It was pretty on the fly.  Prep your ham as normal (score in diamonds, put cloves where the scores intersect) and put it in the oven for about an hour, under foil. While that's going, throw and entire bottle of full sugar Dr. Pepper in a saucepan with sriracha, a touch of broth/water, a pinch of nutmeg, and whatever else makes it yummy. Let it reduce a bit. Take the foil off the ham and brush the glaze on the ham every 5-10 minutes till it's done.  Sorry it isn't the best recipe. I didn't follow one past what came up when I googled "how to cook a ham."   The main thing is that I'm trying to stay away from super traditional Thanksgiving things, because even a couple days after, I know I'm always so sick of turkey and cranberries and pumpkins.  Flank steak sounds awesome, as do stuffed portabellas. Thanks!   I love the idea of roasted beets and brussels! I'm nore looking for an idea for veggie entrees, but that, with the parsnips, baby taters, and rutebegas posted earlier will def be on my list of sides this year.  And yep, I love it, and I'm still in college. I always plan it the day or two before classes start back up after break, cuz at that point we have one week of normal classes, dead week, then finals week. It's good to start the final lap with good feelings and good food.   Oooh, I do love me some moussaka. I'll keep that in mind.   I don't know if that could be made big enough for an entree, but is def one of my favorite sides.   For the risotto, I used two packages of premade butternut squash soup and water for the liquid. Onions, carrots, celery in butter to sweat, then toast your rice. Add the liquid bit by bit while stirring. Add curry powder, red pepper flakes, and a dash of nutmeg towards the end.  The carrots I'm less sure of, but saute them in butter and oil till starting to get soft, then add honey, brown sugar, sriracha, red pepper flakes, and something else. I whipped those up on the spot, so don't know what all I added.   I fully apologize for the incoming wall of text.   I know it's only early October, but the one dinner party I hosted last year was for "friendsgiving," and was the day before classes started back up after Thanksgiving break. It was so fun and I plan on doing it again this year.  I figure that people will be pretty sick of turkey by that point, so a different type of meat, plus a vegetarian option would be perfect.  Last year, I had a huge Dr. Pepper/sriracha glazed ham, curried butternut squash risotto, mashed taters, green beans with almonds, and spicy-sweet carrots, then a berry-lemon cheesecake for dessert, and home made brioche throughout.  I'd like to up my game this year. I think I'll make croissants instead of a huge brioche, but I'm unsure about everything else. The ham was amazing, and I had leftovers for a week, but I'll be inviting a bunch of the same people. I'm toying with the idea of a beef wellington, but I know about half the people don't like mushrooms, and even though you can't taste them too much in the finished dish, some people are really sensitive to the taste.  As for the vegetarian option, I'm at a loss. The risotto would have been good, but my big pot was being used for the taters, and I couldn't time things right. I'd like something I can start before the meat and sides.  Sides are confusing, too. The carrots were a hit, but I had to cook them and the green beans right before the ham was done, which meant having to scramble around while the guests were getting hungry. I don't really want to do taters this year, partially because I'm supposed to be cutting my carbs. Maybe a soup and a couple other things?  The cheesecake was bomb, but I'd like a fallback option in case my friend who makes it has to work.  Sadly, I will definitely just be getting a big box of wine to be going with dinner, but at least my friends' tastes have refined in the past year to go past white zin.  TL;DR: working on the menu for my friendsgiving this year. Need meat and veggie entrees, sides, and suggestions for dessert. Thank you all in advance!   I love making several batches. I don't scale up the recipe, I just work on one batch while the other two or three are chilling. There isn't as much down time, which I enjoy.   The only thing standing between me and my annual friendsgiving is the state of my tiny kitchen. Dead week (2 weeks after Thanksgiving, hoping I don't dislocate my knee that week for a second year), but my menu is fairly set. Means waking up early and spending a day cleaning, then waking up early the next day, prepping and preparing homemade brioche, a nice roasted ham, butternut squash risotto for the vegetarians, plus multiple side dishes.  EDIT: actually, OP makes me want to make a Beef Wellington with home made puff pastry, then just triple the pastry recipe and make croissants this year, instead of a huge braided brioche.   Chicken livers are also sometimes used as a substitute, although I'd be squeamish of those. But I love mushrooms and can't get past the fact that the liver is an organ that fikters out toxins. The only time I've eaten something and kind of enjoyed it, then got squeamish when I learned what it is was a foie gras pate in France while I was waiting for the crab caught 10 minutes away was being cooked. Escargot and frog legs however.....   The mustard museum in Wisconsin. I'm not sure exactly where, although my mind wants to put it between Madison and Appleton. It's not a specialty local food, but it is a magical place to stop on your food road trip. Sadly, I haven't been since I was a child and didn't want anything to do with mustard, but my parents always made it a priority stop when we were visiting family outside of Madison.  EDIT: on a similar vein, the Boudin sourdough company/factory is San Francisco. Yeah, you can get good sourdough elsewhere, but going on the full tour is amazing. And their bread is still better than any other sourdough I've ever had. My sister, who lives in Berkeley, signs me up for their bread of the month club for my birthday every year. It loses some quality on the trip to Indiana, but is still heavenly for a base for a Jarlsberg and salami sandwich.   Cloudberries, man. Some people have a gene that makes them taste like heaven. But they're really good to the rest of us, too.   I'm so much in camp A. I actually prefer Voyager to DS9 and TOS. It's tied with TNG, and I consider Enterprise to be different, mainly because the Xindi war just seems like a long movie.  I grew up watching early sci fi movies/shows. Some of the best memories I have with my father involve watching The Day the Earth Stood Still, the Twilight Zone, and the very very old Flash Gordon serials. Captain Proton, to me, is obviously Flash Gordon, which I love so so much.  As for the social commentary, that's a big reason why I love Voyager. Why is a sentient being that happens to be a hologram any different than one who is made of flesh and blood. While he can be grating, the doctor is one of my favorite characters in the whole universe (although Garak will always and forever be my absolute favorite). He has the attitide of Bones (kinda), the empathy and roundedness of Crusher, the uniqueness of Flox, and the intelligence of Bashir.   Same here.   Convenience is important. Sometimes you're out running errands or have a short break between classes and find yourself starving, but can't go home for whatever reason.  Slightly different, but there is a food truck here that just makes grilled cheeses. They know the college town market well enough to post up outside three of the biggest student bars Thursday through Saturday nights. I get a plain old grilled cheese with orange cheese like petroleum product and fries every time I go out. Yeah, I could walk 10 minutes home and make an amazing roast beef, swiss, and spinach panini on rye with honey and red pepper flake, but then I'd go to sleep instead of staying out with my friends more.   Also bbq. And wings.   Yes. I usually go for just PB sandwiches, because that's my preference, but my thinking is that, if you can grill your sandwich, you probably should.  One of my friends in high school always had the same 1st period class as me, and I would often make an extra grilled PB sandwich for her when I made one for nyself for breakfast.   Kinda looks like American poutine. But this is coming from someone who's never had real poutine, so take that with a grain of salt.   Don't have one. She did have a bit of a habit of biting things that stick out to wake me up when she was younger.... Still have puncture wounds, although I bet those would be even worse on the lower half.  Edit: I think part of it may have had to do with the fact that she was so young when she came to live with me. Probably still thought "those things on your chest mean food," being a mammal and all.   From what I've heard and my minimal experience, you are sometimes backed up for hours out on California freeways. I was once stuck on I465 South of Indy for 90 minutes and only moved about twenty feet. We were good on fuel before that, but the stalling and idling meant that we had to go refuel at the next opportunity. I'm guessing that's an entirely possible situation on most highways, sometimes to the point where you run out of gas when you intended on refuelling.   Wet willy meaning she licked the inside of my ear. Super not fun in any context, but worst when it wakes you up.   We have that back home, and Tiny Lion loves to be on the vent. He also loves curling up on my grandmother's lap and going for wheelchair rides, haha.   As I said earlier, it might when they're turned to full blast. But then the cats the curl up next to the radiator. They don't get hot enough to burn immediately of contact, and it's actually one of my favorite things in the winter to lay my pants on top of the radiator while I brush my teeth and stuff, then they're nice and toasty before I have to go face the cold.   I can't mount any shelves, as I'm in an apartment. I put a pillowcase or towel down so there's a barrier. When it gets really cold and I have the rads turned to full blast, they know better than to sit on it. Right now, they're fine because the rads are turned to as low as they can go.   I also will often use this premade soup as part of the liquid in a batch of risotto. I like fusion, so curried butternut squash risotto is one of my favorite things.  Ninja edit: I'm sure you know, but a little bit of nutmeg goes a long way. I have one of those shitty preground bottles, and I often find even one tap can be overpowering.   Second least favorite way to be woken up. The Sorority girl 10am Saturday scream when you're ungodly hungover is the worst.      This can be bad even when they aren't chatty. Source: one of mine woke me up at 3:30 this morning for breakfast with a scratchy wet willy.   You could always borrow a lady friend's brown eyeliner or shadow. But I'm in your boat, too. Going as Slutty Teddy Roosevelt for a bar crawl.   I was part of the selection team for a literary magazine in high school (I know, I was super cool). Many English teachers offered extra credit to submit. One made everyone write five poems on the same subject for some assignment or another. The crowning jewel of horribleness (this kid should get a Ph.D. in it) was as follows:  Summer or winter  They are most likely somewhere  Animals are cool.   I'm a big fan of buying things the day before the sell by date and freezing individual portions. Means I can get a package of chicken thighs for $4 instead of $6-7. Just defrost, mix with some frozen veggies/rice (I have to cut down on rice myself, but it's dirt cheap and I believe makes a complete protein when mixed with the right veggies) and bam, easy cheap meal.   OP said he's using packaged soup. If you're making it from scratch though, these are all good tips.  OP, if you're ok with it, I love to add a bit of curry powder/paste. Maybe a smidge of nutmeg.   The only time I have ever actually looked for orange cheese like petroleum product was when I was in France. It was a thing to cook an American meal for your host family, so I figured an oclpp toastie and tomato soup was the way to go. Ended up with the ONLY orange cheese in the entire city and warmed gazpacho. Obviously better, but my host mom still didn't understand the appeal.   And it's pretty much pointless trying to get good real crab here in the Midwest.   Yes, someone else who loves giraffes!   This is one of those movies that should just not have a tv version. With how much they'd need to cut out, it coukdnt have bren more than 45 minutes long, right? It's like trying to watch the tv version of Showgirls. There's no point.  	109
 Ain't no one stopping you and I can get some work done.    Only because Muslim countries are third world shit holes at the moment. Wait, give them time to develop.    Thank you so much!  Edit: I truly appreciate your comment.    So much Muslim hate going on right now. Just try to remember that the actions of the few do not define the many.    The problem is not exactly with Islam. The problem is the situation in Middle East. Whats happening now is the aftermath of the fall of the Ottoman Empire, colonization by the French, British, etc. WWII, the Balfour declaration.

             He is actually garnering a significant number of republican supporters. I think everyone is pretty fed up with the corporate takeover of both the private and public sectors, and Bernie is the ultimate champion of reclaiming America for the people.   He just hasn't started campaigning there yet. Don't forget, he's only been running for two months.

I was banned for posting an article entitled "Republicans for Sanders" (which sounded relevant to /r/republican to me). When I asked them about it (very politely, I might add), they responded with cryptic threats (something about how they'll destroy me on the field of battle or something). It was pretty disturbing, to be honest.  No actual reason was given, which isn't surprising as I didn't break any of their rules and was always respectful (never negative or inflamatory). In fact everything that I've posted there has been received dozens of upvotes (except one post which sat at 1 point).   GMO labeling is one of the few things (2%, apparently) that I disagreed with, too. Pretty minor issue as far as I'm concerned.   98 here, too.                                                         In other words, stimpacks for married people.  This is the exact scenario that keeps me from even considering a stimpack:  "Okay, got my work done, all the chores are done, spent every moment of free time with the wife this week, nothing on the calendar... no reason why I shouldn't be able to play a lot this weekend. Stimpack purchased!"  "You're not spending enough time with me."  "Fuck."   Point people to something like isidewith.com. They're usually surprised by the results.                                                                                                                   Hillary brings the name, Bernie brings the politics.  Well put!                                         	200

 Some friends of mine are fans of Insane Clown Posse  They spray you with Faygo throughout the show, and at the end, poured fucking glitter on everyone.   They told me about this ^ and I decided I'd never join them on there journeys to the I.C.P. concerts. I hate sticky stuff and glitter. Nope nope nope nope.   That's great. I still have that bad experience. I'll attempt to quit berating the plasmas but I refuse to get one. IMO It's not a big enough difference in picture quality to rebuild my confidence in plasma.   I hate plasma tvs only because the first one I owned messed up. I watched history channel a lot and eventually the logo burned into the screen. I hear they don't do that or not as bad. I still have trust issues. I'll take a barely noticeable lower picture quality over worrying about burned in logos everyday.   Plasma... ha! LED smart tv by Samsung is the way to go. My next will be one of their UHD televisions.   I had the same problem. I turned 24 and FAFSA finally saw me as an independent. Now I have loans to repay due to the original issue. So until my loans are paid off, I'm not qualifying for a grant.   If /u/Sarcastic_Redneck went to school in Memphis, he could be tagged Girafica in Memphrica.   I always got picked on but the reason was unknown. The kids always just targeted me without any reasons as far as I knew. I never understood what I'd done to them. Now I'm very successful and quite wealthy. Joke's on them.   If it were up to me? I'd die on the battlefield during war in the uniform of the United States Army.   1. I am not in danger, (insert name here). I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks! 2. Yo lunchbox, hurry it up. 3. In a world gone mad, we will not spank the monkey, but the monkey will spank us.   Revenge:  1. Scoop the poop while he's watching 2. Drop it on his lawn 3. Make and keep eye contact during the next steps 4. Find something like a brick and smush it into his lawn 5. Scoop more poop 6. Sling it at his vehicle 7. Blatantly deny it as he confronts you  Alternative revenge:  1. Collect poop everyday. 2. Place daily poop in a paper bag 3. Set said bag on his porch/front steps etc 4. Light fire to said bag 5. Ding dong ditch 6. Blatantly deny it all 7. Repeat daily   I get calls from them once every 30 minutes from 6 am until 10 pm. Talk about persistent. I've told those leeches I'll get the money top then when I HAVE the money. You can't have what I don't have. Plain and simple. If I have zero, you can have exactly that! Zero.   Oh you poor sucker. I have an 04 Sebring. I had to get a new battery for it. That sucked. For anyone who doesn't know about some models of Chrysler, Dodge, and Jeep, the battery is behind the splash guard that's behind the front left tire. Most of the time you'll have to raise the car up and remove the tire and the splash guard just to change the battery. Inconvenient as hell.   Hell yeah! Mark the filters. I've known plenty of places to fuck the customer over a fucking $5 filter. I change my own oil. When I couldn't due to rules, I would mark my filter. Fuck those ripoff happy assholes.   I tried the Cutco thing a couple years ago. The only people in my "class" that had any success were from rich families that were connected to other rich families.   Saving this   I used to play tibia on Amera all the time. Made plenty money USD. People on that game pay lots for tibia gold.   Saving private penis   Arguing. It's quite enjoyable.   TIL I wasn't such a bad child.   I've got a solution to your "problem". Pay for my education, let me graduate, then I'll tell them to call me asking for donations and such twice as often as they call you. They just have to stop calling you. I'll add them to my automatic ignore list and BAM! Solution.      All I can think of is Ralph, from The Simpsons.   I don't wanna pick a best. I'll list a few favorites.  Disclaimer: these are my own opinions. They do not make me right nor do they make me wrong.  1. Scrubs - it outlines the base idea of the show. No one can work in such an environment on their own. No one should try to be "superman" and do everything themselves. 2. Ground floor - it's just really fun and that's what the show is. 3. Breaking Bad - it's very mysterious and tense while also mellow. It also has a desert feel to it, which is logical  since that's where it mainly takes place. I don't think anyone could have picked a better theme song for the show.   Not a pro cleaner but I have a great tip.  Mix 1 part liquid fabric softener to 9 parts water in a clean empty spray bottle.  Save money on that blue fabric spray. Use it on curtains and soft furniture.   This is my only cleaning product. It'll make everything brighter. Toilet bowls, sink, shower, white tile floors, tile grout. Great stuff.   I use shop towels. They're a few dollars for a fat roll of them at AutoZone or similar auto parts stores.   Disclaimer: this is my opinion which means it does not make me wrong nor does it make me right.  If you fit into one of the following categories, you are a completely helpless dumbass who doesn't deserve a computer:  1. People who can't disassemble and reassemble a computer for maintenance. (Removing dust, diagnosing power issues, etc.) 2. People who can't build their own computer 3. People who think "just turn it off then on again" will actually solve every problem with a computer  Reasoning: There are too many tutorials on YouTube and the rest of the internet for this simple stuff. I've contributed to a handful of these tutorials for those who don't know how to. You are a dumbass if you willingly decide to act as though you can't figure it out. There are text only tutorials, text and picture tutorials, and video tutorials.   I have my own personal favorite. Jack and Jack. 2 oz Jack Daniels over 2 more oz Jack Daniels. Never chilled, no ice. Perfect.   I'm a cheapskate. Payless and Wal-Mart    You see.... Everything comes down to poo! From the top of your head, to the sole of your shoe We can figure out what's wrong with you by lookin' at your poo!   The only way shoes will be worth $3000 is if there is $2950 cash in the box.   I'm the same way.   /u/theobscure was half right. It's one of the two he/she guessed. My wife grew up in north Mississippi.   Anna Gunn. Why the fuck not?   Well this thread adds another layer of boring to my user name. I guess I could confuse people on how my user name is pronounced (without the "j")   Unemployment-man   I'll check him out.   I'll check them out.   Really funny guy. I've seen his Netflix special though.   Thanks. He's really funny.   I've seen Louis C.K. on Netflix. Great comedian. Thanks for the response. I'll check out the other two.   Life with Martin Lawrence and Eddie Murphy. It's barely 15 years old but I like it... I found out about it when I was working at MSP (the penitentiary in the movie). *whites only pie* (proceeds to burn mouth trying to inhale pie).   It's *leave*, you idiot! "Make like a tree, and leave." You sound like a damn fool when you say it wrong.   Over the years when I'd try to watch this, something would happen to interrupt this movie. I usually wouldn't get past the boat scene. Well, the other night I downloaded and watched it. I love war movies and this one is one of the greats. I hate that I'm so late to this movie. Still a great movie.   Omg. I sometimes forget how old that movie is. Geeze, I feel old.   Me too (watched it this past weekend and know it line for line and still enjoy every minute). I have all three on Blu-ray.   Forest Gump. Saw that movie when it came out. It's always a great movie. I watch it about once a week.   I would've said something similar "the movie theater near me... wait there isn't one". Damn small town.   I'm looking to watch a good stand-up comedian preferably available to watch on Netflix. I love comedy and wish to watch something right now. I like John Pinette, Ralphie May, Fluffy (I can't spell his last name), Katt Williams, Kevin Hart, and others like these. If any of these has a special on Netflix, I've seen it. Any serious suggestions are truly appreciated. I either can't do the serious tag from the app I use or I just don't know how so please keep the answers serious.  Edit: I received a lot more responses than I had expected. Thanks guys. A lot of suggestions were new names to me. I should have thought to mention that I've seen Louis CK, Bill Burr and Jim Gaffigan. Thanks again and keep them coming.   Late too this thread but: Apple for scale   You're half right.   Same here. I never have been comfortable with my wallet anywhere but my front pocket.   My wife grew up down the street from two current nfl stars who happen to both be brothers. She didn't know them on a personal level but did know them. I'm aware how boring this is.   Ha! I wish. Unfortunately, no.  	54
    If all is working properly, you should be able to breed Mushroom Spores from Pam's using AgriCraft. I'm also going to add a Blood Altar recipe for them, as it is a little difficult   Explosions.   Explosions.   And I'll add here - the last time they made a pack and took mod suggestions (Monster), it was largely considered one of the worst packs they made. I don't speak at all for the FTB Team here, but I don't want that to happen again. It's better they stick to what they know best than try to build something off of any suggestion they are given.   It's a kitchen sink pack. They said they were making it because they didn't have one for 1.7, so here it is. Not only that, but look at the list. It has a bunch of great new mods, like AgriCraft, RFTools, Draconic Evolution, and more. They're catering to the most popular mods found in their most popular packs. It's a pack made for what seemed like the community wanted.   First of all - What?!?  Second of all, in order to make them "the same," you'll need to add them to each other's ore dictionary. You can obtain the oredict information by doing "/mt hand" whilst holding the item.  Then, just place in, say, if I wanted to add an vMC apple to a copper ore dictionary, "ingotCopper.add(minecraft:apple);"  ingotCopper being the oredict entry. If you add each crystal to every crystal's ore dictionary, they can each be used in every recipe requiring the others.  Now only one question remains: Why would anyone ever do this?   What pack? As well, do you have logs?   You could use Mob Properties to make anything spawning in the overworld have an insanely high attack   As for making the overworld unlivable, you could enforce a void in only the overworld using Ex Nihilo or YUNoMakeGoodMap. You could also just enable "All the World is Superfun" in TiC and that would pretty much eliminate any need to leave the Nether.   "This paste has been removed!"   Resurrection is being updated very soon, [as stated by tfox](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/ftb-resurrection-1-0-1-update-info.60834/)   The config is very distinctly sorted based on the section of the mod. It is divided into sections based on the part of the mod, so it's easy to see what is part of the Dimension Building system or the Shield System. There are very clear headers :P   I don't believe the results were released publicly anywhere, but I would be interested in seeing them.   It adds the features with the express purpose of making them RF-Based. McJty's not adding Magic Wands, he's adding a device that you need to power to create dimensions. If you want a magic-based Dimension Building system, you've got MystCraft. Sure, RFTools has Dimension Building, but it's in a completely different sense than MystCraft. Complaining that it has the Dimension Builder it is like complaining that EnderIO adds item transport with its conduits when ThaumCraft adds item transport with its Golems.   You can't restrict a mod based on what is, at best, a general and vague description. It says it adds RF based tools. That does not restrict it to a power monitor. Adding additional utilities does not have to restrict a mod to a simple block. I would call a shield or teleportation system a nice utility, as there (AFAIK) is no other RF-based mod that adds such customizable RF-based teleportation. As for the shields, there's only one or two mods (if you count both MFFSs) that do something similar, and both are either high-CPU intensive or not very well maintained. It adds a nice, customizable, and low cost alternative. Yes, Dimension Building is stretching it's definition as a utility, but it's nothing that Extra Utilities hasn't done before. And besides, there's only one other mod that adds dimension building in a similar sense (MystCraft), and that lacks frequent updates and many customization features. Honestly, it's just adding utilities that are lacking in much of Modded MineCraft.  Plus, if you don't want any of the "bloat" in the mod, why are you complaining? There are very simple config options to turn everything off. Or what if I just wanted the dimension options for a magic-base pack, and didn't want to deal with RF dependencies?  Not sure why you'd be adding something called RFTools to a magic-based pack, but all you have to do is disable everything and set the power requirements for the dimension-related devices to zero. Not that difficult, if you'd look at the easy to understand config file. How about simple forestry tree farms without the insane amount of extra world-gen?  If a couple ores and bees is considered insane, I'm not surprised you're attacking a dimension building mod.  RFTools is a nice example of a mod that creates nice tools and features while still retaining a large amount of customizability. It innovates and creates new ideas, while at the same time building on already created ideas and making them more compact, customizable, and lag free. I'm really amazed at all the work Mcjty has done on the mod, and I'm even more excited for the things he's planning on adding in the future, such as the Modular Screens.  I could understand if you were attacking such a mod if it had no config options to turn it off, but it does. Many mod authors add in things because it's very likely that, unless their mods are used in a kitchen sink pack, many of the other mods that do the same things are not in the same environment as their mods. Many devs code with only their mods in mind, not any others. And if they aren't, well, they've got config options. You can turn off Forestry's "insane" world gen, or Bluepower's logic system, or RFTool's various systems with a simple change of true to false.   Reposting because the original was deleted, and this is big.      I'm shaking with excitement right now. We're partnering with FTB.   It's basically done. As of right now, we're just updating mods, fixing bugs, and adding EMC to things. It should be perfectly alright to start a world. Most of the bugs that were in the pack have been ironed out at this point, so it's pretty stable.   Late game is sort of arbitrary. It varies depending on the modpack or the mods you are playing with. In some packs, late game might be killing the Ender Dragon or being able to combat Taint or killing those Botania bosses. It might be creating a Tier Six Altar and summoning a Demon Village, or it might be having the ability to create your own worlds.  [Phoenix Reborn](http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/1-7-10-phoenix-reborn-tech-magic-progression-ores.59301/) implements a sense of progression and the tiers of the game by sort of restricting things behind dimensions and such. For instance, you could consider the overworld early game. In the overworld, only Coal, Iron, Lapis, and Redstone spawn (although in exaggerated amounts). You'll be forced to use certain mods in order to progress, such as Blood Magic and Botania, until you reach the Erebus. You'll then have access to metals such as Copper, Tin, Aluminium, Lead, Gold, and Silver, which will grant you access to a lot of the early tech mods, which in turn will allow you to create a Nether portal, and give you access to Diamond, Sulfur, Saltpeter, Emerald, Ruby, and Sapphire. This lets you access some of the later game mods, such as a few things from ProjectE or late game Thermal Expansion. Once you've obtained Platinum from the Deep Dark, you'll be able to create the Energy Condenser and automate the creation of items via EMC, and once you've created your own dimensions using RFTools, you'll be able to create things like Energy Collectors and AntiMatter Relays with Dimensional Shards.  Although it's certainly not as grind-like as GregTech, it does have a set type of Progression. Each dimension basically represents it's own part of the game, whether it's early game in the Overworld, mid-game in the Erebus and Nether, or late game in the RFTools Dimensions and the Overworld. Everything is basically set into tiers based on the dimension you're in, and it does take some time to get from one to the next.   I tried it without Factorization if Forge 1277, and it did not work. Adding the latest Factorization, it did. Looking at the changelogs, this does not appear to be implemented in any Forge version, but it sure should. It worked brilliantly for the few things I tested it on.   I can confirm - this works.   Now *this* is amazing. I'm adding Factorization to my instance just to make sure this works.   Here's what we currently do: http://forum.feed-the-beast.com/threads/team-member-positions.59861/#post-876355  Unfortunatly, we don't really have time to chech each pack, due to the sheer amount of packs being updated every day. Even with out now huge team, we're having trouble keeping up.  However much we'd like to do robots, we're not really at that point yet.   We're limited by the forum technology and the money we have available. Hopefully in the future we'll be able to do something similar.   We're trying our hardest. Sometimes things just go wrong. We get hundreds of pack submissions, there's bound to be plenty of errors.  	26
 socialism is a big mean scary word that most americans have no clue what it means.  we as a country are mostly functionally retarded. WE got people on medicare(gov provided healthcare) protesting the idea of socialized healthcare.. its like what teh fuck do you think medicare is.. they dont fuckin know, all they know is socialism sounds similar to communism so it must be the same and evil. heck 40% of us think man lived with dinosaurs.. how the fuck we got to the moon is anyone guess.    yeh no different than the one last year... and the thing is.. THEY SUCK.. even on the special surface.. the lack of friction just ruins your abilities to really do anything.  you would need little jets in it, to help with tricks and movements and yeah that seems odd since they want their wheels to roll as smooth as possible but you need friction for the cool shit.    I cant speak for others.. and am white, but i didnt like it at the statehouse. I have zero problem with people buying it.. displaying it.. what ever. You cant make people like you, the point is to not make it institutionalized by government.  and part of the point is WHY the state put it up.. it wasnt for history it was for bigotry, i dont think the dukes did it for bigotry, it really is and was prevalent around the south and not everyone was bigots that used it.. it the intentions.  There is also a black dude here who calls himself the black confederate. i dont know him, or his intentions.. but have seen him a few times. heis car has all kinds of little confederate crap all over it.. little confederate flag door locks and crap.     I do find it so amusingly ironic that this little bigotshit wanted to start a race war and instead is going to end up doing something for black people the naacp hasnt been able to accomplish in decades of trying.. and they even did economic boycotts that did cost my state millions.. no one gave a fuck.  Not that he deserves any praise for all this, it is just more than delightfully ironic.    wake me up when the klan flies a robert e lee.. manikin or something   hmm i was sure fake but now not so sure  [here are more picts and an article.](http://www.dezeen.com/2014/06/01/mirage-house-kois-associated-architects-rooftop-pool/).. and there is a home under the pool, behind that outdoor deck under the pool is a door.   [here is the guys who allegedly built it and they have some other unique designs and those are definitely real.](http://www.koisarchitecture.com/) (warning website sucks)  so to all the people who say fake... you might want to double check   ~~like the invisible skylight lighting up the couch under the pool.. yeah they could have a super bright light they leave on all day..~~  eh.. looked at builders site.. marking this plausible.  [here is the guys who allegedly built it](http://www.koisarchitecture.com/).. they also did build some very real and verifiable things.  it does include a floor plan.  [here is an article on the house with more picts](http://www.dezeen.com/2014/06/01/mirage-house-kois-associated-architects-rooftop-pool/)  and it was [picted up by other archi sites](http://www.designboom.com/architecture/kois-associated-architects-mirage-residence-aegean-06-02-2014/)  idk a lot looks like cgi but some picts dont, and while they say imagined, they say its on the north side of the island.. there are no good recent google earth views.. so idk.  edit: yeah that is just [designs by the firm on a house they are commissioned to build](http://www.luisaworld.com/a-pool-with-a-view/#more-8855)  but i do wonder how they are going to get to teh pool.     anyone have any ban emails we can check out?  I'm not doubting and such but here we have an extreme problem with BS. Once again.. not doubting.. but you hear all the time in like the perk subs and bing subs of people all following the rules and getting banned and it causes all kinds of outrage and people freaking out but then you look and well none of it is true.. they were cheating but it ends up creating all kind of crockery where you see on here "if you bing make sure you cash in from a different ip than you search from"  as if that wouldnt actually set off a flag cause  normal people wouldn't do that.  or in perk its 'dont watch just the app trailers or get banned'  or 'dont play the perk quiz in lightning mode or get banned'  and well you see more bs about the ways to get banned than actual helpful info.  and yeah i know they can be vague, as they dont give a fuck about us.. but any kind of communication on the subject would be helpful.    its crazy we have to create a fake religion to show the religious how stupid they are.. (and sorry but most satanists are fakers)..  but i think we need to flood the south with new religions.. give the people some choices, and give state houses dozens and dozens of fights over displays until they say they have to stop all religious because they cant have that many displays.  but one important thing, we got to learn from the religious(and sorry but its mainly the religious right) and get insanely upset at even the slightest thing that we can even slightly twist into an attack against us. Spell satanist with a low case S.. you are oppressing me. But we got to get really upset all the way to the sole.. (not a mispellin) like they fake they do to get their way.  you know how they are.   dumbass "gays are evil pedophile bastards and should be put to death"  me "man thats a bit harsh, didnt jesus say love thy neighbor and shit"  dumbass "why are you oppressing my freedom of speech with personal attacks.. i cant even talk about my faith anymore without you hateful people attacking me."   Your question reminds me of a convo i had with a very right wing christian on reddit.  he tells me that many of his friends think the new pope is satan. That kinda shocked me to hear. Obama ok.. or chenney or someone else but the pope? Basically hes been saying the worlds got to worry about the poor more.(ok i get some things he has said are anti-right wing.. but then again anything not pro right wing is anti right wing).  you might disagree with him but you know he sneaks out at night, and washes the poor feet, and shit like that that jesus used to do. he seems like an ok dude.  dude came back that satan would fool the world by being a good dude... just like the pope.(which basically they have their bases covered cause he can be anything from insanely evil, to a really good dude)  But to make a long ramble have a point...  Even if some christians might think what they are doing is good and noble, they might still think they are actual satanists... er worship some dude called satan cause being good is exactly one of those dirty rotten things satan might do.   sounds like a constitutional scholar.  /s  edit: actually  the title isnt quite correct  If the couple does not want to have a religious wedding then they are free to simply file an affidavit attesting that they are married, Courser said. They can do this without ever having to have a ceremony.  A lot of states are mostly like this.. even the ones that are already legal. No one forces the priests and if you cant find one you get a notary or some witnesses and sign an affidavit...IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT A CEREMONY.. and you send this in and get your license. IF YOU DONT WANT A CEREMONY.. you can just go down to the county offices where you get the licenses and get married by a justice of the peace. This is the part he wants to change. Its still retarded and probably not legal.. but its not quite how the title makes it out to be, cause 90% of it is how it is already.. the only part is the removal of the justice of the peace for people who dont want a ceremony with friends.. people who do .. do an affidavit.. thats kinda the point of the affidavit over the justice of the peace. And i actually married some friends legally in SC being a notary. it wasnt a same sex wedding but it was a legal wedding.(its easy to keep judges out of weddings, hard out of divorses)    sorry its late.. gotcha you see the icon but it says disconnected.  really starting to sound like hardware failure. it can happen without having other problems on the pc, kinda rare but yeah it can happen, you can look arround the pci port you installed the card in for any damage to the board.  it really sounds like you hit all the bases from the software standpoint.    ok, this might not be you, a lot of people dont see this at all.. but some of us have a reaction like you.  I used a vamo forever and 12 mg like you.. its comparable to your spinner in power. No problems, never a problem.  i got a istick50 and kangertank.. and exact same as you. it killed me. now someone else on youtube had this problem but cant find the link.. looked for someone else.. he was just a random reviewer.. it was the pg.  i switched to 100% vg, and i can vape 18mg at 30 watts(i was making someone else some juice when i went as high as 18) no problems.   its weird cause i heard of people sensitive to pg, but it never bugged me at the lower watts and higher ohms.. i can do 20% but at 50 it kills me.  but yeah also if you didnt prep the coil with liquid before you hit.. and sometimes when its flooded it can be kinda harsh.   in device manager, make sure 'show hidden devices" is checked under view.  and did you just try reinstalling the realtek drivers from their site?   my sennheiser's are the same way, except they actually hide the metal in a sheath(beats might too but from the pictures in the tear down it doesnt look that way) and sennheiser ARE quality.. so.. who wrote this shit.   yeah your both right wtfoosball and oldstinkfinger.  if you click [through to the actual tear down the first pict, shows it plainly](http://i.imgur.com/edjJbiQ.jpg)  both the hinge and the slide. They arent even hidden from the user it doesnt look like. Beats do suck, but this isnt why.   sennheisers have the same parts..    spontaneous dancing' is illegal in Sweden, and owners of bars, clubs and pubs without a special dancing license face fines if their patrons decide to take to the floor.  In March this year, politicians voted in the Riksdag to lift the bizarre ban - but it failed to pass, and Swedes still need government permission if they fancy a dance.   whoa what the fuck swedes    so how does this bode for open source world? they dont exactly have to be reversed engineered. i know clamav isnt that popular but there are a lot of open source security tools.  also isnt a lot of this done by the private markets and  then sold to the nsa, i seem to recall that one browser challenge where that group that cracked all three, didnt accept the winnings because they would have to say how and they make more money selling that info to governments.   wait.. did they remove it?  [abortion is illegal under any and all circumstances in chili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Chile)  I dont see where it is legal even after 3900 weeks.  (and no i am not anti abortion.. just for clarity.. just a sardonic joke)    I agree with you in principle but  when citizens united got ruled, its hard to deny that the amount of money spent on politics in the us went up dramatically. And while it might not be due to the same issues, its also hard to deny how far right the right went when it came to corps.(though most of this is probably due to the left moving right, making the right move further to distinguish itself)   i got a wheel from daniel.    well i didnt doubt the facts were true. It just is more helpful if they actually adjust the dollars if they are talking about rising costs.  I don't recall any game changing medical technologies between these two timezones.  really? did you click? it goes from 1960 to 2014  MRIs were invented in the 70s// increases in cancer research, fuck we got better eye surgury and bionic limbs... that can be controled by the brain.. and kids that can hear who were deaf all theri lives.   our life expectancy in [1960 was 66 years for men 73 for women.](http://demog.berkeley.edu/~andrew/1918/figure2.html)  [today our life expenacy is 76 years for men, 81 for womn](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/10/08/us-life-expectancy-hits-record-high/16874039/)  thats an added decade in the most medically expensive time frames.  In summary: US healthcare is expensive due to predatory insurance.  dont disagree.. but there are caveats you cant ignore. IF we mislead on the other side of the spectrum we are doing just as wrong as those that pretend the insurance markets are doing us right. meaning while most of the increase can be attributed to predatory insurance, not 100% can be.  There weren't any monumental technological innovations between the two numbers It's, at best, the same as always.  but if we are looking at the same graphs you cant be more wrong on that point.. cause mine starts in 1960 and is very different than today.     fixed a link.   well thats why i made the point of heating it up..  but hey.. everyone in this thread says metals dont cause cancer so go ahead and downvote all teh proof they do.  and chromium can cause cancer if it was dissolved. as the first study shows. thats why i suggested a solvent in his mouth.  so while the doctor said it was possible.. he would have to take a fuck ton of heat to the mouth and have his pick vaporized or dissolved.  you also ignored the nickel part.. still its the same as the hexavalent chromium as far as cancer is concerned.. vaporized or dissolved.   no where was i suggesting holding a pick in your mouth with a magnet caused cancer'     you're in cordcutters what do you care if cable tv goes up?    i would love to hear how he came up with his theory. Did it have a crazy path, or did he just choose the picks and magnets right off and added a little em in there for extra measures.    well if they were [chromium or nickel](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9498900) .. they could cause cancer, though its a bit hard unless you heat them up a lot. (not a doc but know those are known to cause cancer with workers who make shit out of them and there have been picks made of chromium though kinda rare) maybe a solvent in his mouth.. lol. [But there are also worries for us e-vapors as our kanthal often spews a bit of chromium and nickel. Though there hasnt been definitive proof yet.](http://www.medicaldaily.com/e-cigarettes-emit-levels-nickel-and-chromium-4-times-higher-tobacco-smoke-300704)  i kinda figured it was the tortoise shell he was going to talk about.. friend of mine used to jam.. i set him up with picks with strike anywhere match head crap glued to it and a matching sandpaper on his guitar so when he played solo it looked like he played so fast his pick caught on fire.. but anyways that smoke is pretty nasty.  edit added some sourcing.. this is skeptic after all.  edit, i guess some people missed the heating and solvent part.. i did include sources, for skeptics yall seemed to miss that too. I wasnt justifying him.. just that metals can cause cancer in certain conditions. if your going to downvote, at least tell me which words you think are false.. to vap chromium you need heat.. to disolve it you need a solvent, the link shows it causes cancer. we are hear to learn, not saying I am write, but yall havent proven me wrong by saying "it needs to be vaporized" sure and that takes a lot of heat. which is in my comment already.     yeah you can.. and [there are a few vertical rebuilds.](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=kanger+occ+vertical)  for the burn, a couple things yo can do. get a tiny safety pin and put holes very gently in the side of the cotton, or use a higher pg mix which thins out the joose. also dont let juice get below the coil head. this [guy does a good video on various subtank fixes, including the dry hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3JwHQ9OYwVw)  and [you can get new heads a little over a dollar a piece at fasttech](https://www.fasttech.com/search?occ).. for generics,  $2 for authentics.   I'll do one more. I hate the stupid bigoted flag. i dont think it should fly at the sc statehouse. its not even historically accurate for sc.  I have zero problems with people buying that flag, flying it at their own home, while dressing in a klan uniform and burning a cross(depending on fire laws)  i have zero problem with walmart selling it if they wanted to.  edit:so yall disagree? what part? that i called the flag bigoted? it wasnt used in sc besides by the klan and to protest the civil rights era, sc used the palmetto. or do you just disagree that bigots should be able to buy it? Just downvoting and not explaining yourself besides against reddiquette is pretty low effort in debates.     At first i was going to dismiss this out of hand.. as there seems to be little relation and i have been through many loses and i have never been stimulated by the loss.  however, when you win, you often go otu to celb.. if you arent already out watching the game. when you lose you go home.. or stay there. So i can actually see their conclusions as a scientifically valid guess.(i am not sure they accounts for all variables like perhaps a well known uab college girl had some pron post up or maybe she broke up with half the people at UAB.. eitherway that would probably increase views)   two points i made in a different sub.. with this post.  1. you can partially blame documentaries that call ostriches living dinosaurs.. and that fish i forget the name of atm.  2. 1/3 of the country does not believe in evolution at all even "god guided evolution"  but do believe that dinosaurs existed and some believe in the time scales.. they 'simply' dont believe in evolution, so humans had to exist at the same time.  this isnt a justification, just a look at the areas we need to work on.  but really i would like to see a fuck ton of work on how we do science documentaries. IF you say living fossil or living dinosaur you best let them know you dont actually mean an actual live dinosaur, just that this creature resembles its ancestors a lot.  also get rid of all the anthropomorphism when talking evolution.. you are making things worse. No animal plans evolution and yet EVERY SINGLE SOLITARY Documentary suggests they do. the corpse plant didnt decide to smell like rotten meat.. the corpse plant doesnt even fucking know or have any way to know what rotten meat even smells like. If there was any planning.. it was done by the fucking flies.   no fucking animal said, hey them low leaves are all getting eaten.. wouldnt it be better if we had long ass necks to eat the ones on top? no the ones with short fucking necks died out quicker than they could breed and the ones with the long necks didnt so rthe fucking necks got longer.. no fucking planning. Its hard to really blame the religious when it comes to the shit state of our evolution reporting.. we make it sound like an intelligence is behind it.. just a scientific one.. that sounds a lot like what the religious claim and its not anywhere near the accurate.  the only time an animal 'decides' its evolution is through sex display but even then, their isnt a lot of deciding going on, on the evolution side.. you know we might like big tits and tits got bigger but we didnt decide to make women have bigger tits.. ok mans a bad example cause we can do that now.  but the point is there is no conscious decision to evolve. God or not.    8.1     500,000 years? eh.. pretty much do everything we do here on the planet earth rn now would be good enough.  edit: take it back, I'm not quite sure that would be enough, the pressure is way low and i dont know enough about all we add to the atomosphere.   yes unplug it so it boots to windows over the usb stick   name the boner killer/.  next week, the friends of these 13-14 year olds who have trouble getting condoms of their own but seem to invent new ones... are going to invent the prank version that changes color when it contacts any pussy. Ahhh good times good times     "It has nothing to do with the flag, nothing at all," he said.  well except the flag wasnt ever used in SC except by the klan and to fight civil rights  100 years after the civil war.. it is solely a symbol of bigotry.. unlike the african american monument.  Plus the man sorta admits his bigotry.. its one thing to not support the removal of the flag but the fact that he wants to remove an african american monument as payback for removing his, shows he is overly bigoted. when both sane black people and sane white people want it taken down.   "My great, great, great grandfather and ancestors fought in this war for this state," he said.  and lost. Yall keep forgetting that part. YALL ROSE UP AGAINST THESE UNITED STATES THAT YALL CLAIM TO LOVE SO MUCH... AND FUCKING LOST. and it wasnt put up on the aniversity of the civil war. It wasnt put up to honor the civil war. It isnt even accurate to sc's position in the civil war. It was put up to fight segregation and the people who put it up said it was due to the north wanting to force desegregation despite god always intended the races to be separate.   there are people here who emigrated from germany after the war.. should we fly nazi flags for them?   You heritage freaks dont have a leg to stand on.. it wasnt put up to honor heritage and if we wanted to honor heritage we would have used the SC confederate flag over the virgina one. It was put up for bigotry.  PS challie chapin had a tooth brush mustache, but wear one today, and people are going to assume you are a nazi. Is that fair?  probably not but like it or not, people are that offended because the last person to use it was a raving bigot. Same with that stupid ass flag. Douche bag knows damn well why it was put up.  and even.. lets just say this asshole is dumb enough to believe it is soley heritage and states rights.. this assholes rose up agains teh US, killing many us citizens and lost.(many in texas fought for the mexican side.. of that war.. should they get to put up the mexican flag over government buildings in theri town? FUCK NO.. THEY LOST). you can argue if it is right or wrong we still have that land today, but you cant argue it isnt part of the US. Same with teh south, lose the flag of the enemy.    well while i dont doubt it is still true.. for a bunch of reasons. that stat is meaningless unless adjusted for inflation.  hey i could be missing it but i dont see anywhere it says it is listed in constant dollars.  But also healthcare gets more expensive as we learn new methods of keeping you alive for longer and will go up regardless of inflation. As well as the fact we live longer.    That being said people are really hard for robots to work on. They move quickly and are all unique.  not as big of a problem as you think anymore. WE have robots now that are learning to be smart enough to deal with totally unique, never seen before situations.. like the differences in humans or the differences in folding random clothes tossed in a box.    I'm not sure if this is totally true. Well maybe from a data standpoint but darwinian evolution says giraffes where had longer necks survived because they had more access to food.. etc.. where id says god decided he wanted some long ass necked animals.  the main difference to me.. scientifically is one is semi predictable, the other isnt.  i know that on small landmasses animals tend to be smaller.. where in id, you got to guess that god wanted some cute smaller versions of certain animals and decided to place them on islands.   or the all female lizards that clone themselves.. darwinian evolution says they will most likely have problems and that its not a good evolutionary strategy to live as clones.. god guided says nah, if god wants to the lizard to survive it will.. doesnt matter its evolutionary state.    I dont have the data on hand, but yeah this phenom is well studied and if i remember correctly the percent of snarks seems to be rather steady. But it is a well known problem and if you look at certain gallup survey type polls(not so much on do you approve of such and such job), and read their little disclaimer on the bottom they specifically mention things like this. And that the poll is adjusted accordingly.  sometimes as simple as asking the same questions over with different wording, as snarks often forget what they said to the last one 20 questions ago.  also, you cant really blame them to much.  Documentaries often call birds, especially ones like the ostriches as living dinosaurs. [Though i highly suspect it has more to do with our beliefs in evolution where 1/3 fully reject the idea, most believe in god guided evolution, where only 15% believe in darwinian evolution.](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/08/060810-evolution.html).. see they might accept creatures die out just not that new ones are created, "therefore man must have existed in small pockets with dinosaurs"..   the [difference between sun and shade in teh vaccuum of space is about 275 degrees ](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nasas-spacesuits-allow-astronauts-to-work-in-an-extremely-tough-environment/2011/09/12/gIQA37SsfK_story.html)  this is with no steps, this is front and back of the suit.    someone more artistic than me needs to redo the reddit logo for this sub to have that haircut.   unfortunately just looking at the username.. i suspect not.  And i will take this time to mention that this is a systemic and wholly republican problem. And part of the divisive issues at hand.  They talk about real americans.. versus..  they are patriots .. versus..  they need to take back this country... versus...  and dems generally dont do that. We dont question peoples patriotism, besides we think patriotism is stupid. we believe in right versus wrong, not blindly supporting government actions which seems to go away as soon as their is a dem president. And we definitely dont pretend even the craziest of republicans arent "real americans" Thats not to say we can hurl some bombshells. I do al the time.. but its a bit different with the GOP as they do seem to see anyone not GOP as "not a real american".. "not a patriot" and someone "we need to take out country back" from.    get what you say but when they didnt have voting rights its kinda meaningless.  yes considering blacks less of a person for purposes of representation cause the southern states to have less power.. but how about considering them 3/4th a person as far as representation but then no vote.. well in that case you are really giving the slave holders more power, per person they owned. because the slave owner was the only one with the vote.. so each white slave owner in teh south, had more power than each individual white non slave owner in the north.    or i didnt have any trouble so no one else should have.  (and really everyone over 50 you can say fuck off with this..[in 1978 a summer job at min wage could pay for a year of tuition](http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/politifact-the-meme-about-the-summer-of-78-and-college-tuition/2192477) they dont even know what a hill looks like much less walk up one both ways. And raising min to $10 isnt the same because some things like college rose faster than inflation)    well i take some exception. While he literally wouldnt care after the fact of his death, before death, i might have some cares about my body being used after my dead to further some of these bullshit things.  Like i am an organ donor.. i will be dead and wont give a fuck at that time.. but while i am alive i think of good things being done with my discarded parts and it would disturb me to think bad things were done.. yeah its just a baptism, but it still supports and furthers their nonsense even if it wasnt my choice.   it is bizarre  even for the religious right, to see them trying to claim they are actually the victim.  Silence or indifference would have been a ton better than claiming.. no really it wasnt anti black it was anti christian.  thats like saying hitlers goal was to rid germany of germans.  its hard to see anyone willing with a straight face to go on the press and say these things and yet we seem to have a line of them.  i guess over the past decade or so they have learned they can say pretty much anything with impunity in the media.    they [having issues atm](http://status.perk.com/)  working on it i guess.   [perk status](http://status.perk.com/)  dont tell you shit but  normally when shits kinda fucking retarded it will say shits ok.  right now it says shits not ok, thats why things re extra fucking retarded right now.    and the multi tier justice system still exists.    sorry but if wearing underwear.. even without moving it to the side, you can actually have your anus penetrated.. underwear stretches a bit.. its not an iron shield.    it can be automated... something this huge would take a lot of cpu to do it, but it can be automated fairly easily.   after the political winds changed.    Sorry but shes a raving opportunist.  She first tried to say we wont ever be able to explain why he did this despite his own words.  when directly asked about the flag she said the people of sc had this discussion already and i suspect we will have the discussion again... nothing about it being bad.. matter of fact she did the politician thing of avoiding giving her view on it.  it wasnt until it became an issue to have the opposite view did she come out to ask for it to be removed.  Still I will take what I can get.  Its good she is calling for it to be removed even though she is only doing so for political reasons. And sorry but thats a fact. She was leading the charge in the right winger denial machine until teh GOP started taking heat for pretending it wasnt to do with racism.    luckily some of the worst of them are dying off. not wishing ill will or celebrating their deaths, just the inevitable march of the human race.  but since i am dissing my state, theres a lot of good hearted kindness down here as well. my aunt moved to a small town here and i swear pretty much the entire town stopped by over the first 3 days welcoming her there and dropping off food gifts from their farms.    I'll tell my one story that bugged me. Working in a resteraunt this young man came in, rather timid looking, for some lunch. There wasnt a lot going on so i talked to him a bit. He was from a small town in nowhere sc and had never been out of it before, but he had managed to get a scholarship to usc, was put on a bus and sent to columbia and he was kinda overwhelmed by the entire place and being their alone. To him columbia was a huge intimidating city. Well some of my bosses friends came in and they were sitting at the bar and started to crack racist jokes plenty loud enough for that kid to hear. And he actually cried. I paid for his meal felt bad as fuck for the kid. and as typical my boss and his friends would always claim to not be racist in the least. my boss would normally "no one can call me a racist i hirer a bunch of them" and things like that.. sigh.  the bigot has since passed on. idk about his friends.  and if you dont know about columbias infamous racist, [maurice bessinger, its an interesting story. man gave up millions just to keep being a public asshole.](http://www.charlestoncitypaper.com/HaireoftheDog/archives/2014/02/24/maurice-bessinger-bbq-baron-and-unrepentant-racist-dies)  he's also passed on, different bigot though from the first story.    well see, its not even [historically accurate to the war.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America)  the only flags the actual confederacy used liked it, was a white banner with the modern confederate flag, similar to where we put our stars.(and yeah people thought it looked too much like a surrender flag, but they said fuck it and used it anyways)  it was the flag of northern virginia regiment and tennessee regiment.  it you look the SC confederate flag, is quite different.. the palmetto confederate flag. The only time the flag in that form came into popularity was when it was adopted by bigot groups. Thats its history in sc. Not the war.. in the war we used the [palmetto confederate flag](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a0/South_Carolina_Sovereignty-Secession_Flag.svg/440px-South_Carolina_Sovereignty-Secession_Flag.svg.png)(besides it is based on the confedderate flag it is probably the coolest one). If it was about heritage and not hate, why didnt they use that one?  now I am not saying it hasnt evolved some to mean something to some people who arent bigots. but its based on a bastardization of history.     well thats not necessarily a bad thing, that was about the stupidest stache you can grow.   sounds like before, since they nabbed him in his truck in line to get into the event. Which makes me wonder if he will get out with a truck still full of trash. I dont really see them doing the work for him..so i suspect so.   that had to be a fun roller coaster for him.  "ooo cool a new miley interview"  "hey, dude with the record... omg shes talking about me!!!!!"  "FUCK"    because they didnt read either.    Though your comment is probably a legitimate compliment, this is the net, so i cant be sure. However I am quite sure he was being purposefully ironic, since the only uncommon word he used was the one he used to describe _leftist. And yes it is quite humerous.     Hes been spotted at a craft brewers conference, with several laptops going at once, processing multiple beer labels simultaneously. Ive never seen anyone working as hard as him, said Scott Newman-Bale, who works with Shorts Brewing Company.  idk, sounds like they found a real aspey.   i need to see the other side   i am am not sure she can say there is no tipping point..eventually you can actually get enough where it is a chore to try to spend it.. not sure how you could say that more would make you happier when you cant spend what you have.   but yeah anyways the first study never claimed that it stopped at 75 but that that was the peak of happiness gains in changes of income. that after 75k each 10k more is less changing than under 75k    i agree but unfortunately i dont see it coming down this time. The legislators have already said they wont be able to take it up til december.. when many people are more concerned with holidays than politics. and due to the agreement last time.. it will take a 2/3rd majority to get it down.   nah that things staying up. By december they wont have the political will.    really?   honest question, would you find it unusual to read a story about a holocaust survivor burning his neighbors nazi flag? i mean would you think the jewish guy was mentally unstable and not of the norm of society for doing such an act?   i recall fox news getting upset at a mexican flag flying over a post office in a mostly spanish town in the us.. despite that town used to be part of mexico and it was part of their heritage(personally i agreed with fox.. it had no place flying over the post office)  and [then is this lady who stole the mexican flag from a e mexican grocery  because this is america not mexico](http://www.rawstory.com/2015/02/muslim-hating-mexican-flag-stealer-delivers-bizarre-anti-tyranny-prayer-to-the-tenn-senate/)  so i suspect people can and do get upset at symbolism especially if they think it is designed to offend them.  it might just be a flag to you, but perhaps it offends some a bit more when its presented by the government.    wow there is a concerted efforts by america conservatives to discredit and downplay the pronouncements of this pope despite he follows up with action every time. Heck one guy below says the pope is the antichrist because he does good things and thats just what the antichrist would do to deceive us.   he'd much rather have a pope hate and gays and muslims and say wealth is a god given blessing and poverty is god hating you.     they cover commercial sellers at gun shows. Please stop with the NRA talking points bullshit.  [Generally, gun control advocates want to extend background check requirements to private sellers at gun shows. Gun rights advocates say there is no loophole, and believe any federal law requiring background checks for sales of secondary market firearms between private citizens, whether at gun shows or not, would exceed the government's authority, be a prelude to gun registration, and endanger gun owners' Second Amendment rights.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_show_loophole)  HEY WE CAN HAVE THIS DEBATE, but if you want to act like a dumb ass while claiming I dont know what the fuck I am talking about then their is no fucking point.  there is a gun show here.. I can go there and buy a gun with zero background check as long as the seller is a private citizen. However i cant buy a bottle of liquor from my neighbor as a minor. ITS A LOOPHOLE.. AND YES I DO KNOW WHAT THE FUCK I AM TALKING ABOUT.   here is a [FUCKING MAP of the places that allow you to buy without a background check from private sellers at gun shows](http://www.governing.com/gov-data/safety-justice/gun-show-firearms-bankground-checks-state-laws-map.html)  YOU SIR ARE A SHILL OR IGNORANT.. take your pick. .i come with sources.    ahh so jesus was an antichrist.. got it.  i mean he did good things.  obviously the only way to not be the antichrist is to not give a fuck about the poor. and be as greedy as fuck.  seriously dude, you are covering the entire human spectrum with your antichrist comment. he can be pure good and then turn evil.. thats what satan does. LOL  you friends are still idiots dude.  he sounds more like jesus,, than ted cruz does.. sorry dude but its true.     did he make the sword or buy investments in the sword manufacturer?? well you cant read either,.  sure good at coppying quotes from the bible, why cant you copy the quote from the title of this submission?  **you know how easy it would have been for him to include weapon owners in his quote?**  strange he didnt huh,.    old testament doesnt count.. well until we say it does and then it does and when we dont want it to count it doesnt counts again. magic.   he said investors and manufactures, not soldiers or owners.. but hey.. its ok if you cant read.    so rand paul cant denouce war because the us has made a lot of wars.  got it.  also didnt know germany was still so nazi and anti jew.. cause obviously nothing ever changes.    no one said you couldnt own them.  but apparently yall cant read.    anti christ? for cleaning the church of pedos, saying to help the poor, and saying we should make war less? Yall have a strange view of christianity.  and funny yall all seem to kbnow what jesus said, but yall never seem to be able to actually read WHAT TEH FUCKING POPE SAID.  he didnt say you cant own a gun.  and seriously anyone who says he is the anti christ is no christian.. they might disagree with teh dude, but come the fuck on.. he said help the poor, and has brougth pedos to court, cleanign up the church.. he has slapped down teh super rich bishops.. hes actually doing shit to help people.  people who say he is the anti christ sound like some evil ass motherfuckers.    well except he is actually putting his money where his mouth is. people keep screaming pr when he opens his mouth and then he goes and does something like set up a pedo court and start sending high level preists and those who hid them to the court.  its a bit more than PR.. is a progressive pope.    what weapon war?  but yes christians in the past and today are hypocrits.. wahts the point? do you disagree with his pronouncement?   no they are not.. that was an internet lie.  beretta is solely family owned, and believe it or not people buy enough guns they have never needed investors. fucking crazy i know.    and he didnt say dont own a gun. Some of you conservatives have a hard time reading.  did you make that sword? did you help the sword maker find money to open his shop? no? he wasnt talking to you.  NO WHERE DID HE SAY YOU CANT OWN A GUN.  if he did he would say "who manufacture weapons or invest in weapons industries AND GUN OWNERS are hypocrites if they call themselves Christian"  nice failure with the bible verse.. maybe if it had something to do with what he actually said.    you have a source that it was illegal by the catholic church for catholics to not invest into weapons manufacturers before this? this is the first i am hearing about this and I really would like to read it.   either way, you do know the church still says shit like "gay marriage is bad" I'm quite sure most of the religious know how the church feels.. so why do they still repeat it?   Why? Ok so you are going to comflate the pedo thing with the gun thing?  or are you talking about reparations for a war before most peoples births?  sorry but I disagree. This pope speaks, people like you come every single time and say bullshit and every single time he proves yall wrong by actually doing something about what he said he was going to.  I guess you mean the catholic church needs to return the shit it got from the musollini during wwii.. or he is a hypocrite. cause musollini used guns?  if rand paul is elected president, can he no longer complain about war? I mean america has a bit of a history with war? maybe we need to give recompense to every nation we ever .... um freed against theri will.. before we let rand denounce war.. cause you know america has a history.  I agree with you, we need the debate about the ILL GOTTEN GAINS of the church. 10000% you are fucking correct.  But him being a hypocrit until he fixes everything we perceive wrong with the church before he is allowed to speak? nah thats just crazy talk.      he did.  he even has made drastic changes to the church to stop that.  I dont get why so many of yall are ignorant about this.  It was like a year of posts on reddit.  1. [he admitted the church had pedos at the highest level.](http://www.religionnews.com/2014/07/14/pope-francis-raises-eyebrows-saying-pedophile-priests-include-bishops-cardinals/)  2. [he is trying to end celebecy DUE TO PEDOS.. he thinks it will help.](http://www.catholic.org/news/hf/faith/story.php?id=59123)  3. [he set up a special court to bust the church pedos](http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/06/10/pope-creates-tribunal-to-hear-cases-bishops-who-fail-to-protect-kids-from/) and THOSE WHO HIDE THEM. says [ZERO TOLERANCE IS THE ONLY WAY FORWARD.](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/pope-francis-calls-u-s-churches-stupid-article-1.1295178)   the church is full of pedos and YES THIS POPE.. that yall keep trying to find gotchas to.. is actually and IN REALITY.. trying to fix that. This was pretty much his day one shit dude. It was realy his first pronouncements as pope. It what got people talking about him in the first place.    we could ask, but i suspect it would depend on the situation.  and then their is the whole render onto caeser thing.. where he might realize that they dont have much of a choice and that the government cant force you into sin.    you mean the fake berreta story? cause you know it was fake? they dont have holdings into berreta.   but so far this pope has put his money where his mouth is.. people said the same thing when he came out and admitted the church was chock full of pedophiles at the Highest level. People on reddit said .. yeah sure thats good and all(it was a fucking amazing first step fucking admitting it) but where is the action.... and then he set up a court to start trying them fuckers and restructured the church to stop shipping them off to the infamous pedo churches and such.  believe it or not this pope seems to be the real deal. I still dont agree with everything about him, but i like what he is trying to do and he is ACTUALLY TRYING TO DO IT. its not just feeding people what they want to hear.  and I'm a total atheist, so i have no pro catholic bias here.      This is our problems with right wingers like yourself.  WE say.. "hey it might be a good idea if those background checks also cover gun shows.. seems like a huge hole to us"  you come back "LIBERALS WANT TO TAKE MY GUNS AWAY"  no one said that.  The pope didnt ask you to get rid of your gun.  did you make it yourself? NOPE.. he wasnt talking to you.  do you sell guns? NOPE he wasnt talking to you.  do you invest in the makers of guns? nope he wasnt talking to you.. and no just buyign a gun isnt an investment into the makers not by how he is using the term.    you hunt deer with a hand gun?   then you shouldn't be called a "hypocrite" no matter what religion you go by.  I dont make the rules for catholics, and he doesnt make the rules for all christians BUT HE DOES MAKE THE RULES FOR CATHOLICS.. so if you happen to be one, I suggest you either accept it or become something else.  Its hypocritical in his eyes for catholics. TO INVEST IN MANUFACTORS OR BE A MANUFACTURER of guns. Which neither you claim to be. so Even if you are a catholic, it sounds like you are ok.  you should read what he says and not claim he says something else.   **Absolutely no where did he said you cant own a gun as a catholic.**    nope.. total horseshit.  its a totally family owned business.  They really have never needed investors.    well except them rich liberals.. raised min wage, gave us the consumer financial protection agency and while it isnt single payer, they gave us much needed health reform which the right is dead set against and slowly but surely liberals have been forcing state governments to stop arresting its citizens for smoking a dead plant.  and liberals a little bit less gun hoe about sending boobs on the ground to fight stupid wars.  but other than that your right, they are exactly the same.  PS a third party is idiotic, until we fix the very thing that causes them to not be function. see DUVERGERS LAW and the problem with first past the post voting. Oh we might successfully vote in a new liberal party or a new conservative party and in 4 years it will look like the old one. See duverger.    sorry that was found out to be complete horseshit.  [bereta is soly family owned by the beretta family..](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Beretta) wikipedia  you will notice you wont find your info anywhere besides non mainstream sites, they all use the same source, which no longer exists.   i dont doubt there is shit in their investments we can attack.. this isnt one.   not more than catholics. But yeah we like the new pope, hes better than the old pope. but you do know the republicans would be quoting him to high heaven if he said wealth is a sign of blessing from god, or that muslims must be stopped from getting a nuke.   edit; downvote but no debate.. you dont think catholics follow this pope as much as reddit? or do you disagree that republicans would have less of a problem with him if he spewed republican talking points?    Romney was probably [the only republican calling for it to be removed back in 2012](http://www.mediaite.com/online/mitt-romney-denounced-flying-of-confederate-flag-while-gingrich-defends-it/). i give him extra points, despite being an obama voter, because he took this stand in the face of his party and their was no shootings going on at the time.  its something the GOP get asked about every election. its just not as big of news outside of sc.   bulls dont get asked before we take their semen..  cows dont get asked before we artificially inseminate them.  I get one is done from a clinical mindset and one is sexual mindset.  but what if the farmer enjoys it? How do we word the law?    well thats what the article suggests.. that all she did was get on her knees   Well people arent all the same, have the same views or cultures. And frankly, even you have admitted you cant successfully argue why it is wrong, though you blame a lack of coffee. The people you are talking to.. they dont think its right, they just demand a coherent argument on why it is wrong to justify the laws. laws shouldnt be made on feelings.   before he died for your burger... he had a different life.

The question posed to you, is what is the difference and can you make a legal description of the difference between a girl jacking off a dog, and a farmer jacking off a cow.  its a fair question     can you jack off a horse?  perhaps it isnt coffee thats failing you?  and no one said it was right, just that perhaps it shouldnt be illegal. The two concepts arent synonymous. I dont think it is RIGHT what Westboro baptist is doing, but i dont think it should be illegal.  see?    while that might happen in those cultures, it didnt happen in this one as the state of the media was in decline long before the net became popular.    idk, [does that turret only shoot defensive bullets?](http://boingboing.net/2008/09/02/south-carolina-sheri.html)  I know i know i will look so foolish when the russians invade columbia sc.    yeah thats the point.. there were restrictions added.  But try to close the private show loophole or reinstate the assault weapons ban and they pretend you are hitler.   I'm glad i am not the only one.. i used to think i must have really strangely shaped ears. now I just think their is a conspiracy and everyone else glues theirs in.  I finally got some with different size ear things.. i thought FINALLY.. but naw they all fall out, unless i am totally motionless and in the vacuum of space.  did the rest of yall evolve like little ear fingers to hold onto them things? I mean i read on questionable sites that people actually jog wearing earbuds. This is totally implausible.  I may try some of your ideas, but i'm not really sure yall all dont work for the secret anti-headphone consortium, trying to ruin peoples experience with headphones by flooding the markets with these earbud things and giving everyone a bad experience making them go back to stand alone speakers.     I'm not sure "fool" is the perfect word here. Luxury doesnt have to mean quality, it can simply mean something others cant afford. Case in point, the people who bought that $1000 iphone app which put a crystal on the display. No one was fooled. No one thought it was coded by stephen hawkings. No one thought eh crystal graphic was designed by banksey... so why did people buy it? because most people couldnt afford it.  fooling people is when they say those special hdmi cables play audio better and crap. Those people are being lied to.     its a lot easier when you are in slow motion like that.    Have we had a conversation to know why people respect this icon enough to have it displayed so prominently?  we can but they wouldnt like it. It has exactly zero history with SC besides the klan and put up for opposition in civil rights era.   might have a point if we used the sc confederate flag and put it up like say 200 years after fort sumter.. but no.. it was put up to protest integration. It was 100% put up there for racist reasons. Anyone who invokes heritage is lying.   here is the wiki on the confederate flags of america.. notice there is no THE CONFEDERATE flag...and not once did the confederacy actually have that as a flag. 2 regiments had that particular flag as the flag.. yes it was part of the design of the confederate flag.. but it wasnt the flag. So historically they arent even being accurate.   bigotly, they are.   you sure get riled for someone with no opinion.. who dont care if it stay or go. You say it will have no effect and yet people here are obviously offended by it. So you should have no problem... that is if you really dont care either way. I sure  wouldnt. And normally when i dont care either way..  i dont even say anything because.. i dont care.  I'm sorry if you can grasp that state sponsored racism my effect society. But hey symbols have zero power so lets put the nazi flag up in jewish areas all over the world.. they cant be offended cause its just a symbol  **PS when the bigots lost SA.. they took down the flag.**   so you would be ok with a region of germany putting up the nazi flag after a group of jews moves in for "history and heritage"   got it.  this from the same groups of people who actually punch salvation army volunteers for saying happy holidays to them  how is it yall seem to get offended at the smallest things like people wishing you well, but cant seem to understand that people can be offended by a flag that has been used by bigots and hate groups for 100 yearss?     No group of white people thinks its okay to go into a troubled northern black community and try to convince them that maybe they're doing something wrong to produce a generation of kids who idolize the thug life.   really? turn on fox, tell me how many times they mention the thug life in chicago a day.   like Christians have done with the WBC  they really havent.. not from a christian perspective.. most of the protestors have come from people like the hells angels.      I asked my Dad (history buff) why they keep the flag on capital grounds. He summarizes and tells me that's it's a reminder of our past. That we once held a belief and fought for it. And blood was shed to defend our lifestyle.  your dad, needs to work on his history.  First that flag was never a flag of the confederacy.. it was the flag of only two regiments one in va and one in tenn.   now the [palmetto confederate flag does have some history in SC but we didnt use that one.. we used the one that was NEVER ADOPTED BY THE CONFEDERACY.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flags_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America)  now yes most flags of the confederacy did incorporate the design into their flags but IT IS NOT A FLAG OF THE CONFEDERACY.  So it was mainly used by 2 regiments.. and nothing big of famous about them. IT got wide spread use by the klan and other hate groups after the civil war. THATS THE ONLY HISTORY SC HAS WITH THAT FLAG.  it wasnt part of the confederacy.  Now.. when did we embrace this history? When the federal government told the south they had to desegregate in the 1950s.. and the south decided to threaten civil war by putting that flag up all over the south..   It wasnt put up for history or heritage.  it was put up for bigotry.  SC has no history or heritage with that flag  the confederacy doesnt really have a history with that flag.. it is a small part of the design  the only places that do besides va and tenn is the klan.  So i respectfully ask your dad to rebuff his history.   it is was about heritage we would have had the palmetto confederate flag out there, but it wasnt, its about bigotry, which is why it was put up during the civil rights era and also why we couldnt make mlk a holiday without making confederate day a holiday, as if the two things have anything to do with each other besides race.       freaken amazing all the terrain that walls goes over.. and this was all built without massive trucks hauling all that material to people.   wow he is correct.  but perhaps it isnt 'screw you over and limit"  but good knowledge of their equipment and once you reach about 20 devices people would start having problems.  And the problem with this, is people often blame the wrong thing. Like if theri phone is dropping net.. they might say "this google internet is complete shit.. web sites keep timing out"  when it isnt the net, they just have overloaded the cheap router google gives out with theri fiber.  so they arent trying to be dicks, they are sorta trying to be like apple. They are protecting users from themselves.  ahh from google.. yeah this sounds like what it is.  The Network Box supports a maximum of 16 wireless devices. As the number of connected devices approaches 16, however, performance degrades dramatically.  after 16 the router is probably complete shit.. like some people experience here in perk with 15 phones.   most crashes, freezes seem to be server side.  with the ups and downs of perk, its kinda impossible to make proclamations or find things like this without real scientific testing and not "i feel" or "yesterday my phones crashed and today they didnt"  not picking but its too variable.. you need to do longer tests. And your hypothesis is missing a why this might work.  i suspect there were other reasons for your successes.  not trying to be a jerk or come down on you, but the entire /r/beermoney network is full of BS and sudo science and well it gets tiring weeding through the snake oils to find reality.(not that random fixes is as bad as ..dont watch app videos only.. or you will get banned.. always redeam your bing from a different ip than you searched.. and other totally 100% bs things that actually make it in the faqs and crap)   at most it should help bootspeed.  thats it.   well i wonder if that part has more to do with people who have an entire farm and never touch the computers.. versus most of us who do this on our own computer.. not sure if you have to actually interact with the site.  bear with me.. see if it was for ALL OF US.. to make it really not passive.. all they need is a 'are you still watching" pop up. Its kinda easy. The fact they are going to do this by behaviors suggests they arent trying to stop all of us, just the mega abusers. I could be wrong but thats how i read it.    well not sure about that.. most beermoney things start off a bit loose on the rules and with high payouts.. they have to get a critical mass of users as quick as possible so they can charge big bucks for ads.  every single one will slowly tighten the rules and slowly reduce payouts to a point where they hope to balance concerns of advertisers and keeping users.   certain areas  isnt the same word as certainty.. but I suspect you knew that but didnt want to respond to the guys actual comment.

And no one accused you of lying.

Its a little known fact that teh guy who invented scissors did so to get a pair of scissors out of the packaging.   well hopefully they will learn how stupidly offensive it is and how it was never the actual flag of the confederacy and only gained real popularity after the klan and other bigot groups started to use it and then was put up all over the south during the civil rights era.  its only true history, besides being on the dukes of hazards is bigotry. well that and it was the regiment flag of virgina and tenn.. the SC flag was the palmetto confederate flag which would have been more appropriate even though i still disagree with that one.      why is he holding a gun to that flowers head.. what did it do?    same here.. all moto g's .. several crashes a day. in the past couple days.

Sorry anyone who says there is only one solution to just about anything is wrong.  one notice the article is about america and yet a lot of democracies dont have the same problem. INTERESTING.  so i guess we are a special species of human with such unique genes that we are predisposed to this nature where other people in other countries arent?  WE can culturally push back against the anti intellectual ravings of the right. How they spit out that being educated it elitist. Where they have a high school drop out edit the world of a doctorate to tone down the warnings on AGW.. and really we got to do something about the anti science folks who keep gettign americans killed by screaming "liberals only want lead out of gas to help catalyitic converter donors.. its not bad for you".. "liberals just want to control people, cigs arent addictive and tobacco doesn't cause cancer"... "there is no way cfcs could cause the ozone hole, tis a natural thing and man doesnt have that power".. "so2 isnt a problem and cap and trade of it will destroy all of society"(if you look when we did cap and trade so2, not only was it cheaper than the most optimistic view but more effective as well)  sorry man, but their is no ONLY Solution.. we can pull back from this VERY MODERN anti intellectualism from the right, without going to a scientific oligarchy. (they werent always like this, nor as fascist, just go back to nixons day.. its the birchers and the radically religious that took over the party since then.. that is the problem.. they need anti intellectualism because neither sides ideas are supported by science)    Just say what it is.. the right wing is radicalizing.. mainly as a means of staying alive as some of their ideas fall out of favor.  its the same reason they went after the bigot vote in the first place. Progressives are populous, its why they dont have to play these games. Where the right has to win votes.   yeah no one is going to seize money from bill gates even if he is driving with a pile of cash. The forfeiture laws are extremely class orientated.

You want to give them money for an ad... send them an email, you might get a human calling you back, ready to answer all your questions. They will know absolutely everything about the service. CS will be stellar.  It doesnt mean they are going out of business when they seem totally retarded dealing with.. people they pay. Its quite standard. Because their most retarded employees are assigned to this side of cs.    and not a single solitary republican vote.  REMIND ME WHY RAND PAUL IS A REPUBLICAN? but always runs on the liberal side of libertarian? legal drugs, no boots on the ground all over the planet, no spying against the TPP  and yet he lives with the party that is wholly anti legalization, will put boots on the ground at the slightest whim.. went against the dems and supported obama in both the patriot act and the TPP.  its almost like he only cares about right winger libertarianism or uber republicanism.... low taxes, and less regulations.   Just remember people the small gov conservatives, want you to go to jail for doing something recreationally to yourself that has never been shown to kill a single human.    dude you can smoke up in your own home.. they can smell the shit from your front porch and cant get a warrant to come in now.  YEAH NOTHINGS CHANGED FOLKS.   the articles a bit click baity  but as long as you arent in public YOU CAN POSSESS IT.  and even if they can SMELL IT.. they cant break into your home now.  IT is also only a ticketable offense, if you smoke in public.    well thats kinda the point.. if you decide "hey they loosening up lets go to the park where all the families are and smoke out at the picnic tables".. and have a big bag sitting on the table. He can come by and take it.   its also still illegal, so they can still use the same probable causes they have always used.

WOW.. whats next they going to steal your money?   so you would rather go to jail when the cop finds your weed. HMMMMM  are you serious.  Before: cop smells weed, finds weed, busts everyone in the car. The guy busted will probably lose his job, if he is a visitor, he can stay in jail for months before trial because they dont know you well enough to let you out. And you can lose college scholarships and grants.  now: cop smells weed, finds weed, takes weed, yall continue on to your concert you were heading to.  you say it sucks worse now.

IT WAS A THINLY VEILED THREAT. Its impossible to deny, when you know the history of the flag at our statehouse. It was put up for purely 1000% bigoted reasons and nothign to do with history.   AND EVEN, if you buy the lie it has to do with history, it is the ENEMY FLAG TO THE US. It has no business flying. How would you like mexican flags flying in certain texas towns? Oh wait they do and right wingers flipped.. as they should. Its not mexico, its america, no matter what it used to be. WEll this isnt the confederacy, its south carolina of THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.     hes side stepping the issue because he wants the debate to be about something else. Both these guys damn well know why that flag is there.. why we didnt get mlk day until we got confederate day. They know it is the flag of the enemy and no other nation would let them fly it. And they know they put it up not due to heritage but due to hate. They know this, they just would rather talk about something else.    the flag of our enemy.  do you think german towns shoudl still fly the nazi flag for heritage sake?  how about east germany still flying russian flags?     here is the witchdoctor aisle...    and whats bad, that would still probably be more effective than the homeopath aisle.    yeah it will work but looks like you are using up all your sata ports.  if you have an sata dvd/cd burner w/e then you will be short one.  wouldnt get those drives though.  you can get a twice as large, just as good(but faster due to size) ssd for about the same price.  and you can get a good 3tb hdd, for about the same price as that 2tb  I would check out /r/buildapcsales     comcasts sells your data as well.

I honestly think this practice should be illegal, but I can understand it to a point.  nah you were right on the first half.  this is one of the many flaws with the "freemarket". Yeah you cant have 100 cable companies, phone companies laying cable.. so you need regulations that say the infrastructure and boxes and things have to be open to competition at a FAIR and reasonable rate.  Much like they already are required to do with over the air.    and verizon telling customers they have zero plans to ever bring it to them...  nah sorry doesnt fly.  also they are blaming unions..  seems like verizon has a lot of excuses on why they cant do it.     actually NYC does.  they are nearly their own country.    by far most people who practice abstinence dont do so willingly.       Yeah we get it, some white dude killed a bunch of black dudes, so we got to dilute that by bringing up stats and suspect interpretations of them.  Want a stronger correlation than race? sex. Men are EXPONENTIALLY more likely to be violent than women. WHy isnt that talked about as much as race. I mean if you want to pigeon hole the killers into neat little boxes for discussion by far the one, most fit in, is the MALE box.   problems with some interpretations and suggestions.  asians are more likely to have immigrated from far far way.. even if it was the parents or grandparents.. this suggests they had some economic or job opportunities. And looking at the h1b1, and how many come from asia versus africa, this seems true. SEEMS.  Where blacks are more likely descendants of slaves.  little different starting points in this race huh?  also as for race beating out poverty. So the author kinda suggests that race is the deciding factor. This is a bit low effort. There is differences in poverty and impoverished living. LIke the same poor black, versus poor white guy, the black guy is [MORE LIKELY TO GET SHOT WHILE UNARMED](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/black-americans-killed-by-police-analysis), in dealing with cops. Both criminals.. both interacting with cops with blacks more likely to get shot. Now you can say but they are also more likely to give trouble.. but since both those concepts feed on each other.. blacks getting shot might make them more afraid to get caught and more likely to fight getting caught.. etc  then while both can be poor their can be differences in opportunity to not be poor.  and there can be differences in how you are treated as a poor person.. which is definitely on display with the police.  just saying you cant dismiss poverty as the overriding factor just because the correlation isnt as strong, when you ignore other aspects of life that can actually raise that correlation. Meaning poverty combined with racial treatment might correlate even higher than simple race.    nice graphs though.        sorry thats just a bullshit stat cause every race is like that.. its promoted that way to try to dillute the very real issue.  Another stat you cant sweep under the rug so easily.. blacks   [Black Americans are more than twice as likely to be unarmed when killed during encounters with police as white people](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/black-americans-killed-by-police-analysis)  FBI stats that show [Most whites are killed by whites and most blacks are killed by blacks](https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded-homicide/expanded_homicide_data_table_6_murder_race_and_sex_of_vicitm_by_race_and_sex_of_offender_2013.xls)  hey but if we want to pigeon hole the MOST killers.. Race isnt best, sex is.. MOST KILLERS ARE MEN.  [we can also divide it up in different ways](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/14/nine-facts-about-guns-and-mass-shootings-in-the-united-states/)  the south is the most violent region in the US, most murders are southern.  Places with gun restrictions have less homicides than places that dont.   **Anyways while your stat is correct, it is misleading at the very least, when you fail to note it is the same for white people.**  and is mostly used by bigots to justify those in power and authority killing unarmed black people, because black people dont protest murderers as if that is the same. (PS white people treat their perceived authority failures the same way as blacks and treat their criminals the same way as blacks.. they protest the former and just cry about the later)   hate the title..anyways   But it also makes sense that the name would be Googled before it was tweeted; news organizations that had the name in-hand would want to do initial searches to validate the likelihood of his being the shooter before releasing the name publicly.  basically reporters getting the info from the cops immediately went to google. So before it was even reported.. google trends had his name trending.   kinda cool if you could harness this power and report things before they are actually reported.(ok i just broke my brain writing that sentence.)      Heritage? horseshit.. so was slavery.  If it was only heritage, the right wouldnt have held martin luther day hostage  until we make a confederate day.. what does a black mans birthday have to do with the heritage of the civil war? unless you just want to show your a bunch of bigots?  No other nation would let the losing aggressors, keep their battle flag flying in theri country, even incorporating it as part of their flag  I think right wingers could grasp if, if areas in germany adopted the nazi flag and complained it isnt bigotry, its heritage.  but some how they are completely oblivious to the hate the confederate flag brings(they arent oblivious at all, just like the southern strategy, they damn well know they are telling black people to fuck off)    from /r/build a pc? thats odd.. not sure what i could have said here.   they are some sick fucks.  he extraordinarily referred it as a hate crime, because it was a white guy at a black church.  it is extraordinary as south carolina doesnt have hate crime laws.. cause we dont believe in them.. and please ignore the terrorists aspect of targeting a specific group.  But, Doocy continued, Bishop Jackson made a great point about the hostility towards Christians, suggesting that the attack had a religious instead of racial motivation.  well besides the comment about raping our women and taking over.. which proves it was about race... he wasnt wearing anti christian patches on his clothes.. he was wearing white supremecist crap.  The main reason they want to claim he is anti christian is they want to paint this as a problem with the left. When the right are riling up these insane people. WE have fox news day in and day out, telling the craziest and most unstable people in our country, that their insane beliefs are reality.  That obama is not a legit president.  that black people do want all your money and feel entitled to it.  and they are stealing elections through the lack of voter ID  and the only real racism today is anti white racism.   and so on and so on and so on.   it fuels the insane.  like one congressman put it.. it doesnt matter how you meant it, what matters is how the least stable person in my district takes it.  The right need to stop peddling fear and hate.  its what drives these people.    I agree partially.  The pope is not saying YOU HAVE TO pass legislation.. and his report is directed at the people  the pope also isnt directly attacking any groups by name.  And thats what gets me, shouldnt the pope, wrong or right, be able to announce how he feels on global warming? legislation or not?  I have a feeling that bush would be agreeing with and maybe even touting anyone denying AGW. Does it matter if he is a pope(as far as opinion goes), or a grocery bagger.. hes allowed to have his opinion.  it strikes me as a bit hypocritical for them to say "i'm not a scientists but I dont believe in global warming and btw the pope isnt a scientists and he needs to shut the fuck up"    and then they try to make religious based laws.  and bush is going to be asked every time about his comments to a catholic group about how he lead by his faith.. and actually passed legislation DUE TO HIS FAITH.   the right is in a conundrum, they NEED to attack the pope, and yet they also need to attack dems as secular and anti christian in order to rile up the evangelicals.(yeah they dont give a fuck about a pope but a lot of the republican base does)  what i really want to see the pope do is respond to the catholics attacking him and remind them of the churches teachings on the pope and maybe even threaten to excommunicate people like Bush its not UP TO BUSH to dictate what the church considers important.  (PS as far as economic policy.. bush might want to check out the stories of sodom, also when jesus threw the merchants out of the temples and the story about rendering unto caesar... NAH the church actually SINCE THE START OF CHRISTIANITY, has weighed in on economic matters and taxes)   you [can find them cheaper than $5](http://search.focalprice.com/search?keyword=wifi+dongle orderby=low)  they work but of course the antenna is small.

HUH.  This is the problem with republican science.  it snowed somewhere therefore global warming isnt real.   Looking at actual stats.. we have one of the [worst records for mass killings](http://www.statista.com/statistics/248845/number-of-victims-of-mass-shootings-in-western-democratic-countries/)  this isnt cherry picking a cold day and saying global warming isnt happening.  this is looking at stats.. and mass killings are more common in the US than other modern western nations.   SORRY DUDE. ITS TRUE.

ASIA beats out the americas.. but individual countries, there is no competition,  **WE ARE SO FUCKING ABOVE #2 THAT THEY CANT EVEN SEE US ANYMORE.**  It take only takes some rudimentary research to discover that rampage killers, acts of terror (as the Charleston shooting most certainly is), school attacks, spree killers are not unique to the United States.  and it only takes a very rudimentary search to show Obama was correct.   HEY DUDE.. how about stop with the knee jerk reactions to disagree with every word Obama says, cause yall just look dumb, when yall cherry pick data like that and call it science. IT ISNT.    If you ask perk if your device is ok to use CS will probably say  "I'm sorry you are having problems with perk, Please try the following.  1. clear your cache.  2. reboot your phone.  3 try uninstalling the app and reinstalling."

Fairly sure that if they did answer your actual question the answer would be no.      wot am i looking at?    I'm more than against the crap we do around the world, but if any country on the planet needs regime change, there can be little argument on NK. Yeah i know nukes makes it untenable but damn that place is fucked up.   Riots generally happen to real or perceived miscarriages of justice and not to crimes no matter how heinous.

Its the first thought of everyone who sees a poll and thinks of the population size... "NO WAY". You think of how diverse the country is and they only talk to 1060.. (most polls arround this many). I was the same way, until i took stats class and saw the math. The real key to it all.. is the random selection, it has to be as truly random as possible to make it work. because obviously if they only polled men in the south.. the numbers would be different.    hes taking away a lot of teeth from them. But yeah i dont think there will be an inquisition. There could be some excommunications, depending on how badly some catholics treat the planet.     This is the problem with republicans.  See its how all things liberal, every idea obama ever had, even when he adopts right winger ideas, is evil.  all because Obama said supported it.  I hated bush, but he did great things for aids in africa.. yeah he fucked up a bit with the abstinence crap.. but not all of it was abstinence and he literally helped reduce the aids rate. Now he is a republican, who does all he can to make sure our kids dont have access to condoms and birth control.. So how the fuck can I support him on his aids efforts in africa? BECAUSE I DONT FUCKING DISAGREE WITH EVERYTHING SOMEONE SAYS JUST CAUSE THEY ARE THE OPPOSITE IDEOLOGY. And almost no one do i agree with every word they say, even if they are the same ideology.  REPUBLICANS NEED TO LEARN THAT.  are their things I think are backwards as hell about this pope.. yep.  But he has made a fuck ton of progress in areas that I dont think are backwards as hell.  How to I justify supporting him in these areas?  **CAUSE I CAN FUCKING THINK FOR MYSELF.**   actually you are wrong.. but what ever.  He has done a shit ton.  I know yall wish he hasnt.  But he has.  he changed the way they move priests arround, pretty much shutting down the pedo underground railway..and set up a court system to punush them.. and oh yeah ACTUALLY ADMITED THE CHURCH IS FULL OF PEDOPHILES ALL THE WAY TO THE TOP.  but hey.. hes done nothing.. right? all talk .. right?    he told the church to quit harping on birth control. soooooo  fox news is also anti birthcontrol and regularly promotes the idea and cheered the hobby lobby ruling.. sooooo.     WEll yeah, he cant change world policy, he isnt king of the planet. But he can AND HAS changed church policy. I wonder why so many of yall failed to notice. SPECIFICALLY in these areas yall are attacking him in.    and helped people justify their hate and oppression. this one will actually get more people to change their tune. it isnt the fact that they believe that most of us give a fuck about. fuck all kinds of people believe all kinds of crazy shit. I dont give a flying fuck my neighbor thinks ouji boards work.  But if my neighbor got political power and started to say all policy has to come from the ouji board, well then we have a problem.  the problem with the religious isnt their beliefs, it is that they want to impose those beliefs on us.    and they are wrong.  He told the church to quit obsessing on contraceptives.  made all kinds of changes to prevent the moving of pedophile priests.  and set up a tribunal to punish them and those that protected them.  And yes you can mention someones good qualities and ideas while disagreeing with others. Like I like rand pauls anti spy shit.. I dont like pretty much the rest of rand paul. I think republicans have this idea that if you disagree with a single issue that someone takes, you have to disagree with every word.   **Either way they were wrong about the pope in this case.. so while everyone else did it.. HE ISNT.**    WEll he announced they had a pedophile problem which included the upper levels of the church. and [started a tribunal to punish them and the people who protected them](https://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2015/06/16/tribunal-pope-francis-rich-barlow)  and yess he is against contraceptives, but in his climate change report coming out, he said [catholics need to harp less on abortion, gay marriage and CONTRACEPTION.](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/world/europe/pope-bluntly-faults-churchs-focus-on-gays-and-abortion.html?pagewanted=all)  care to rethink your comment?     their margin of error is at 0.5% with that sample size.. thats pretty close to reality.    Sigh. No you are not wrong, but your comment suggests you dont understand statistics. it is counterintuitive but all you need is a sample size of 1067, for a margin of error of 3% with a 95% confidence level. Its not quite this but you can read this as your 95% sure you are within 3% of reality.  and total population size DOES NOT MATTER.. we can do the same in china... yes if something is rarer than 1 in 1000  you might not pick it up.. but as long as it is a sizeable percent you are.   Really the science of stats is sound, and while it sounds counterintuitive, AS LONG AS THE SELECTION PROCESS IS RANDOM.. and the questions arent biased, you got yourself a good poll.   btw the margin of error for this poll would be about +/-0.5% so its right on the money so to speak.   The Trump campaign says it used the song legally  through a licensing deal with ASCAP, the musicians' copyright group. But as Rolling Stone notes, ASCAP's rules are different for using music in a political message; they require a campaign to reach out to the song's owners.  unfortunately, [he still violated rights.](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/06/17/415158962/neil-young-is-displeased-that-donald-trump-was-rockin-in-the-free-world)  see muscians tend to be kinda sensitive about this, so .. its in the contract.   whats funny is this song was actually written as a protest of republicanism, specifically a protest of h.w bush.    whats bad is his base is so absolutist these days, that he actually has to say things like that after doing the right thing.   i wonder if att could package its grandfathered unlimited users into a sub company and then let that company go under. not advocating, just wondering what shenanigans they can get into   yup.  half on 2.40  half on 2.4.1  2.4 doesnt seem to crash as much but thats just a few data points and not enough to say that.  if you 2.30 guys are crashing.. i'm thinking it is perk and not the app   um they already have drones.  they have already showed it working.  and they are lobbying to change the laws and working with nasa to update the air traffic control system.  sorry man... you dont go through this trouble at the alpha stage.  **these things will be in flight this year if amazon has its way.**  mind you... like the google cars.. it will be in one single city to start... and then it will spread.. but this isnt bar nap ideas, this is something pretty much finished, now we need a real world city tests.     you can get a similar effect from looking at objects through an index card with only a small opening allowing light through  I have done that to find my glasses that got knocked off bed side table by my cat using your index finger.. wrap it up like it would be in a fist and look through the little hole.(keep other fingers flat.. like an ok sign but shrink the o as small as it will go)  its very cool, how i can read things,  that are impossible to see without my glasses, even with some mega squints going on.   they sure are spending a fuck ton on this PR stunt, it would almost be better to just get an ad. They are fighting regulations and lobbying congress and working with nasa to set up a better air traffic control that could handle drones. For a practical joke, they are going the extra mile.  also you may be right, this might never work very well.. its not like tons of money have been put behind things that havent before.. segway. Either way it looks like they are serious.  and they dont have to all be 5 miles from a hub, they could rent spaces on towers and buildings for quick charge and battery swaps.. drop off the dead in the charger, pick up the new and continue   well i question if that happened or was an excuse.  and what they recorked it?

Ostensibly, the dad is trying to entertain the kid, but the look on the kids face suggests that he has been through/survived this before and is not amused.   the problem is people dont understand the scale is exponential.   	199
 Sweet n Vicious in the Lower East Side shows games in the back patio.    The flow of the game changes when Dray is on the floor.  He's always at the right place at the right time.   Kerr is a package deal.  He's only mentioned these days b.c of his relations with Phil.  If Phil were G.M of the Warriors, I'd do in a heartbeat, bc you're getting the Triangle Offense.  Kerr by himself is not as appealing.     This will not go away quietly.  What does "forced to sell" actually mean?  All this while he still will get paid, fans will buy tickets and merchandise, and Clippers players will still be associated with this.     Feel like there's alot of "what if's"  What if Sterling appeals?  How much does California law come into play here?  Pretty sure Sterling and his team of crony lawyers was expecting this, and how to counter.     I cant' help but wonder how tonight's game will play out.  Of course this whole topic is bigger than basketball and life, but if Sterling receives a lifetime ban, I've got a feeling it's going to fuel the Clippers.     This feels sorta passive/aggressive on Doc's part.  If Sterling still remains owner after today, why not boycott immediately?  I get that he still has a job to do.  However, by principle and moral obligation, shouldn't you voice your displeasure now, and stop collecting paychecks.     I'm curious of all these rumors of assistant coaches not talking to Mjax for weeks at a time.  Malone was reportedly one of them, although he says his relations with Mjax are OK, and now Scal.       People are bitching b.c its not sounding the way they're used to hearing it, or the way they "want" to hear it.  And then you get a bunch of folks on Reddit that try and pick apart every little fault.     I think it's gonna get worse as this drags on.  These players listen to the radio, read the papers, watch ESPN, etc.  Pretty sure their friends and family have already voiced their opinion on this matter making it a  major distraction for them.           So as Redditors, is this going to be reported?     I know this is totally fantasy land thinking, but if Lebron wants the most rings, GS should be close to the top of the list.  He can play point, allowing Steph to be 2 guard, or play the 4 and let Bogut be the middle.    I can't see too many other teams that could compete with that line up.  It def is a better upgrade than the current Miami squad.     wow internet tough guy      Really would like to see what a Festus and Draymond duo can do together.       And that is why I have full confidence in whatever our front office decides this off season with Mjax.  Also, highly recommend reading his book, "West by West"   Always loved Chris Henrys game, if only he stayed away from drama.     Spock without a doubt   Nyc dubs fan here.  Word is phil Jackson will be hiring Kerr, as the two of them have been in discussion for months  http://nba.si.com/2014/03/17/steve-kerr-phil-jackson-new-york-knicks-coach/   Singletary 2.0   Staying angry and bitter takes more energy than simply letting the past go   Isn't this "statement" more of a formality in some ways so families can start the insurance process?     IMO momofuku didn't come close to hide Chan or totto.     I was thinking that as well, or that the terrorism job was botched so badly that the group did not want to come forth and admit responsibility   I'd pick up Smith simply because he would neutralize Dick Sherman.  Might be a waste of roster space, but the dude can still ball and would probably give Seattle a bunch of fits.     Japanese American checking in.      How difficult would this be for be satellites to pick up?  Surprised submarines haven't been deployed yet either?  We have the best military technology and it's hard to believe we haven't found the plane yet      Heard about this trend happening in NYC.  Basically run aways go to "gift" parties to get infected bc in return they get free housing and also eligible for scholarship education    Is u miss him, then post on the lakers subreddit.  Better yet start your own r/bazegod.     Quit jocking...Brandon rush was 10x the contributor, no love for him?    Agreed, basketball is one of the few sports where the better team wins decidedly.  A few years ago, losses like this would have been ok b.c the Dubs were so mediocre.  It's no longer acceptable.  Our roster was is better this year, but our execution was 3x better last year, esp playoffs   I think other teams have studied us on film and are prepared for us.     He shit in his own bed   How is it we hold the bulls to 24% shooting in the 1st quarter, and then the rest of the game they blow up?  Simple, Thibideau made adjustments, mjax didn't    Think he's still figuring out his role.  Barnett had a good assessment of Dre during the Pistons game.  I almost think next year he might be better of the bench where he can be 1st option.   What's most frustrating is that Klay doesn't drive enough.   Everyone knows he's going to pull from outside, but he seems content jacking up shot after shot.     Very excited to see how tonight's game is going to play out, esp with Mark Malone knowing our team so intimately.  It will be a good test for MJax to see if he can out "chess" Malone.     Hey check out "Internet Tough Guy" over here   And Pouncey himself is bi racial   Looks like a scene from Walking Dead   No love for [Bohemian?](http://www.playearth.jp/)  If you decide to check it out, don't forget to stop by the japanese butcher next door.  Hands down some of the best cuts you'll find in this city IMO.     The other night we were up by 10 with 2:30 to go, and he was still jacking up shots.  Why not kill some clock?     Pretty sure the front office is thinking the same thing.     Our schedule was pretty brutal compared to past years, and it hurt us especially since we missed out on home field advantage.  It's almost as if all the stars need to be aligned for us to go to the big dance, i.e no injuries, winning the division, etc.    Remember, we also lost Cully, Ian Williams, B. Miller   DAE think a flea flicker would be useful early in the game to keep Seattle's defense honest?  Seattle swarms the ball so much that a little trickery would make them play off balance.  Either way, Roman has to call the game of his life today   Pretty sure the front office is keeping a close eye on Bogut's lack of playing time.  If this keeps up, Jackson will be on a shorter leash.  Our window to win a title is small, so all misques by coaches and players are magnified 10x.  Really wouldn't be surprised if Bogut speaks up if he is benched again for no particular reason.        He's had more than enough chances to prove his worth and couldn't do it.       Hennesey and ginger ale   This is a commercial regarding the respect of your elders      Help us out a bit more.

He didn't practice well last week, and with Cox back the coaches felt more confident with him   Interesting, Bowman's a lefty      http://imgur.com/ZlJhzy0  As promised, noodle pic   No they're fucking biased   Dishes were as follows.  Mixed chicken salad (skin, cartilage , meat) Beef soup, Scallops with butter, Tuna, Fried chicken cartilage, Broiled salmon collarbone, Braised pork belly, Grilled shrimp.             Noodles were some of the best ever.  Up till this point, I only liked thin (hoso-men) style noodle, but these bad boys changed my view.  They were chewy, and absorbed the soup real well.  I'll post a noodle pic later on.     It tasted like fish powder, but very subtle.  The broth itself had a strong fish base to it as well.  Same restaurant from Mind of Chef David Cheng episode 1      I never understood why they sprinkle salt on the brisket before serving you at Quinns.  The brisket I had was dry and tough   Damn you called it, this one was in Ueno   I think my phone camera settings were wacky, plus the interior was kinda dim   [ichiranramen](http://www.ichiran.co.jp/english/)  This particular one was by the Ueno station   I know it's Barnes gameplan, but these days he's been making more news  then past years.  Let's not be so quick to judge by a single comment I make of a player.     Matt Barnes is becoming a little bitch, always trying to scuffle and get into shit         There's times I listen to m Jackson, and it sounds very Singletary-esque.  Lotta cliche quotes with substance, but no real explanation.  I think the loss of mark Malone hurt us more than we thought   ESPN has become the TMZ of spots these days.  Just a bunch of satire, and over paid analysts to stir shit up.  Good for Merriman   Hardcore 49er fan that's looking for a bar in or around Shibuya this coming Sunday.  If you're a fan as well, more than welcome to join!         Will there be any prosecution to this?  I ask this because a similar topic was brought up in a earlier thread how drivers in the US don't get criminally prosecuted if they kill/hurt a pedestrian accidentally.  Basically, if they didn't see the pedestrian/biker, no fault.     this is also what i think when i'm hungover, have the flu, hungry   It's not your problem.  I'm pointing out that your remark regarding getting a education is not an option, it never was, and it's easy for guys like you to throw those opinions out there.    You can spin this whatever you want, wasn't meant as an attack   Riiight says the guy that probably was encouraged to attend college at a early age from parents that most likely went to a 4 yr institution.    Shit doesn't work like that in most of America, let alone NY.  You'l be lucky if either of his parents have a H.S education.    Toothbrushes...from a dentist.  Secret Santa       felt like right after his mom passed suddenly, he starting going dumb.  real dumb   I just called the restaurant to find out whether they had fired Dana, but the person on the other line said she could not answer my question.     Their Facebook page is pure [gold](https://www.facebook.com/gallopasianbistro)   Wondering all year why we don't go no huddle more often.  Plus, isn't the first 25 plays supposed to be scripted?     Still confused why Jackson didn't put bogut on Randolph from the beginning of the game.  Lee was getting torched every time    I for one can't wait for Ezeli to come back, but we desperately need a dependable PG.  Baze played himself out of the rotation tnt with his play.     I'm doing a price comparison between StubHub and NFL ticket exchange.  Felt as though StubHub prices were a little higher.  I was wondering how close to face value are the seats on NFL ticket exchange.     But do you think Harbaugh is willing to risk his job to be that loyal to Roman?   Things get real dicey if they start losing more games and reporters start questioning the offense.  The Ravens fired their O Coordinator mid season last year which could have totally back fired.         I don't get why we don't do no huddle more often.  Isn't the first 25 plays supposed to be scripted.      No Keane's or Minetta Tavern?     I have a Santoku knife that I bought from Japan that needs repair and sharpening.  It's got a small chip in the blade and I'm hoping there's an experienced craftsmen in the city that could help.        You guys have consistently been in the playoffs for the last decade and have a culture of winning.  This year isn't panning out, but there's a trend and it's designed by luck   Exactly where did I mention off field issues?  I'm referring to the article, and that contending teams would never conduct a meeting at a strip club.  You're bringing in an entirely different topic.     Perhaps because a lot of the players were involved and are now desperately trying to do some damage control   Is it no surprise that a mediocre team ala Miami has these problems? When you know going into the season you have no shot at winning the Super Bowl, how does that affect the make up of the team? Teams such as SF, Pats, Steelers are focusing on the championship, and nothing less.   Is it no surprise that a mediocre team ala Miami has these problems?

 My wife is Korean.  We've been married 29 years.  She still can't say "I love you".  She can say "love you", or "i love", but not all 3 words.  She said it's a Korean thing.  I had to teach her how to hug and kiss the children when they were young.  She said her father never hugged her growing up.               I suspect this is an education campaign.  There's no way to enforce it.  But it sets you up, so if they catch you with out of state wood, they can fine you   It's a good idea.  Implementing it must be very difficult.   I watched it.

One is a Hora, made in Romania.  Not very nice, about the same price as the truly mediocre Trinity College.  The other is a Big Muddy/Mid Missouri which is a little better, but not much better.  Look around on Craigslist, sometimes you can find a Gibson mandola for around $1800 or so.  I've seen them as low as $900 with some slight damage.  Another idea for you is mandocello.  Of course it's significantly different than a mandolin in every possible way, but closer to a bass.   I did.  I talked with her mother.  There is no father anywhere.

I don't trust this guy, Dahboo.  He posts on GLP and 4chan and most of his videos have no documentation to support the wild claims he makes.  Pretty sure Alex Jones and Gordon Duff at least provide some evidence for THEIR wild theories.   Right, and as I've stated, I'm a medical professional, hence my interest in the subject matter.                  I think they were part of a DHS grant back in 07 or 08.  Most small departments took the money to upgrade back then.   It was discovered in Saudi Arabia, not in the US.   We all were issued a release from the CDC when the outbreak was first announced.  I don't have a pdf of it as it was printed and handed out as part of a packet of UP documents at the hospital.  Also, in answer to your other question: I'm not in Korea, so no.  But it is on the news here in western Mass, which if you think about it, is pretty incredible.  I mean, we're a tiny fraction of the state...yet we get coverage about the MERS situation in Korea.    ------- if the mods are watching this thread, can you find out why I keep getting an 8 minute block on my comments in /r/korea?  I've been a member for a long time.  It's frustrating.   I'm an ER doctor in western Massachusetts (USA).  This outbreak was caused by someone with an attitude like yours.  This man, an elderly doctor, didn't follow universal protocols when he returned from a trip overseas, ignored his own symptoms when they began to present themselves, and was part of a system that preferred to ignore/hide a potential threat rather than treat it seriously.  Is it warranted to say that the Korean culture is largely responsible for this outbreak?  Probably not, but it certainly is a contributing factor.

The problem is, it has a 10-15 day incubation period, which means most of those people could very well have already infected someone else.  I think they've quarantined most of the exposed people, but some have slipped through the cracks of course.  I suspect if you stay out of the hospitals, was your hands and don't touch anybody else you don't know, you'll be fine.

Because we have this thing called "affirmative action" where if you are of an ethnic minority, you get preferential placement in most publicly held positions (police, fire, education, hospital, government, etc).  I don't mean to sound racist here, but that is why most of the people you see working in government offices are black women, two categories given priority over every other one.

 Throw the horse over the fence some hay.   This is why crime stats in general are difficult to impossible to compare geographically: Different jurisdictions classify things different ways. I think another example is "drug-related" crime: Some places count a robbery to get drug money as drug-related, others only if drugs are actually directly involved.   I once saw a newspaper story about some guy facing hard times (completely forget the details), and there was a pic of him at his house with peeling paint on a window frame. I realized that I had seen lots of peeling paint in person but never in any form of mass media. It seemed so strange in that context.   You can find hard tacos if you try (I'm speaking only from Fort Worth experience; never been to Azle). I preferred them too, till I moved here. I'm a convert. Don't be surprised if it happens to you.   In FW there's a stretch of Magnolia street that has a bunch of good restaurants. There's even a vegan place that for my money has the best food in the area, and I'm not vegan.   If you can find a taco place that makes its own tortillas, go to town. There's nothing like a fresh taco on a tortilla that's only about a minute old. (Soft tacos are the norm; I'm not even sure where you could get a crunchy taco besides Taco Bell.)   And when it does snow they don't plow; a two-inch snowfall can paralyze the Metroplex for a couple of days.  A friend of mine moved from Iowa to the Austin area, and on one of her first visits she saw the lane reflectors sticking out of the roads and asked if they interfered with the snowplows. Bit of a cultural change there.   This was on *MASH* years ago and it still cracks me up.  Knock knock.  Who's there?  Abraham Lincoln.  Abraham Lincoln who?

"There was also a large horse in the room, taking up most of it."   I've heard the horse's reply as, "My alcoholism is destroying my family."   Yesterday I met some friends for coffee, and someone had written on the coffeehouse chalkboard, "Word of the day: Sonder." I looked it up and *sonder* is exactly what you said: The fleetingness of our minuscule presence in most others' lives.  So it's kind of cool that you came up with the same concept shortly afterward and then I read it.  Well, see you around, or probably not, actually.   I can whistle the usual way but not the two-fingers-in-the-mouth way. Totally perplexed how it could possibly be done.

Indeed; there's so much space between actual activity in baseball that they have to have tons of random stuff to say while waiting for the batter to get back in the box, or whatever.

[Here's a study](http://www.theatlanticcities.com/commute/2013/03/do-texting-bans-really-prevent-fatal-accidents/5104/) that found that bans like Denton's usually do nothing; in some cases they make things worse, because texters just try to hide their phones and take their eyes off the road.  The upshot is that the texting ban has to accompany a ban on all mobile-phone use or it's effectively impossible to enforce ("I wasn't texting, I was dialing!"), and the gains only last a few months without strong enforcement.

Later in the someone said the word to me in conversation, in context.   *BundleOfSticks*   It sounds as if you want to say "The experience has made me a much better person" but you don't feel that way. It's OK, it's early in the process. Reading some of the stories in this thread, some of them sound as if the light just came on and they were cool people all of a sudden. I can assure you, it didn't happen that fast. It never does. We all have to *learn* to be good people, over the course of weeks and months and years.

Like hating being tall (can't fit into airplane seats, hard to find clothes that fit, people stare at you), maybe.   I found it easier in Spanish because so many nouns end in -o (masc) or -a (fem); in French there are fewer cues. I remember in France hearing parents correct their kids when they learned a new word and got the gender wrong; I guess even the native speakers just learn it as they go.   I've visited family in Chicago and had tacos there. If you know where to go you can get good ones.   I would guess that if they had guaranteed reserved seats, people would re-sell them and make money with none of it going to the show itself. The lines are a hassle, but you know you're not enriching any middlemen.   Go. It only takes a few minutes to learn how to play, but you can go years without really feeling as if you understand what's going on.   Take over the world.   I read somewhere about a study where they put some top athletes (NFL, I think) with some little kids and had the grownups copy the kids' activities exactly, and they couldn't keep up. The kids wore them out.   There's no "real" difference between running and jogging; it's mainly how you see it. I don't call what I do "running" unless it's faster than 10:00/mile, but that's entirely me and applies to no one else; it's to motivate myself to get faster.   Other folks will say jogging = recreation, running = trying to do well at races. Or (my favorite), fancy multifunction watch = running, otherwise jogging. Really, though, it doesn't matter what anyone calls it. We're all just doing what we can in the moment.   One reason to do long training runs is to find out which body parts chafe enough to need lube.    OK, best guess is you just need to keep at it and build endurance, since your pace doesn't seem to affect it much. Stick with the slower pace but try to go a bit farther this time than last time before resting, then repeat next time. Or think in terms of time instead of distance, and try to go a minute longer, etc.   I haven't run distance in a while, but I remember running some 5Ks and 10Ks and they were so much work, then I ran a half-marathon, and the slightly slower pace made the race seem to fly by.

 This is an ELI5 for the purpose and findings of the paper only, as with most ELI5 a lot of the nuances are left out.  Background: High fat and/or high sugar diets are known to be associated with increased risk of numerous diseases. Some evidence suggests that high fat/sugar diets causes oxidative stress. Oxidative stress basically means that there is a sustained increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are oxygen containing molecules that can react with/modify/damage DNA, RNA, proteins and lipids. This in turn can lead to diseases as cells stop working optimally. ROS levels are controlled, in part, by antioxidants (e.g. superoxide dismutase, catalase). Antioxidants don't stop ROS being formed but convert them into non-reactive molecules (such as molecular oxygen) which stop them from damaging the cell. In theory, if you increase antioxidants you can prevent the negative effects of high levels of ROS.   Soybean is a protein source that is rich in certain antioxidants and casein is a group of proteins found in milk. The authors wanted to see if: 1) soybean can increase antioxidant levels/activity in rats better than casein, and 2) if rats are fed a high calorie diet, can soybean or casein still increase antioxidant levels. They're interested in the 2nd point because if soybean or casein was able to increase antioxidant levels in a high calorie diet then, in theory, it may be able to reduce the negative effects of high calorie diets (e.g. cardiovascular disease).  Results: 1. Soybean increased the activity of most antioxidant enzymes compared to casein when fed a normal diet.              2. When fed a high calorie diet, soybean was not able to increase antioxidant enzymes as much or at all.              3. Soybean decreased oxidative stress (by GSH:GSSG ratio) compared to casein, in both a normal and high calorie              diet.              4. Soybean was less able to decrease oxidative stress in a high calorie diet compared to a normal diet.  Meaning: Soybean was better able than casein to improve antioxidant levels with a normal and high calorie diet. However, it was less effective at increasing antioxidant levels when fed a high calorie diet.   Take home message: Soybean can increase antioxidant levels but does not fully prevent the negative effects of high calorie diets on antioxidant levels.  Note: As this is an ELI5 answer, I've not gone into the specifics of changes in different measures of oxidative stress and antioxidant levels and talked about the general trend.   No need to apologise, you weren't intentionally misleading anyone and they did allude to that in the paper, it's a common misconception that IGF-1 increases muscle mass automatically which given their bone background is not surprising that it's in the paper.  Having said all that, what you said is most likely correct - dairy protein is likely more beneficial for muscle growth compared to meat. The main reason is that digesting meat takes time and rapid increases in amino acids seem to be better at maximising muscle growth and protein synthesis rates both at rest and following exercise.   A couple of papers to support what I said, minced beef is more rapidly digested than steak (increased surface area  for stomach enzymes to breakdown when it's minced). Protein retention is increased but not protein synthesis at 6 hrs  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23636241  Whey hydroslate, which is more rapidly absorbed than casein, increases protein synthesis to a greater degree and max protein synthesis occurs within 90mins of ingestion  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19589961  I don't know of a direct dairy vs meat comparison in muscle (there most likely is one)  but most of the data suggest a rapid increases in amino acids results in greater mTOR activation and thus protein synthesis and potentially muscle mass. Dairy would likely be the better option due to it being digested more rapidly.    Whilst IGF-1 is known to be important during muscle growth during development, the role of IGF-1 on **adult** muscle growth and prevention of sarcopenia is debated.  For example:  1yr IGF-1 supplementation in elderly women to those of young women has no effect on muscle mass or strength - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11297574  IGF-1 overexpression doesn't prevent unloading induced atrophy - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9725801  A functional IGF-1 receptor is not needed for muscle hypertrophy - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17974583  Transgenic overexpression increases muscle mass at 3 months but no further growth compared to wild type mice at 12 months. Shows that IGF-1 increases muscle mass during growth or regeneration (with dystrophic mouse) - http://jcs.biologists.org/content/123/6/960.long  Overexpression of IGF-1-Akt/PKB pathway accelerates aging -  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686362  No correlation of IGF-1 levels and resistance exercise induced changes in muscle mass and function - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22105707  That list is obviously biased towards those showing no effect of IGF-1 on muscle growth in adults but is just to show that increased IGF-1 does not always mean more growth. Additionally, the increases in IGF-1 in animal studies are typically induced by getting muscle to overexpress IGF-1 (i.e. it's a localized delivery and very high levels around the muscle). Increases in IGF-1 with nutrition will be much smaller than IGF-1 increases seen in animal studies with viral overexpression or transgenic mice.   Overall, increases in IGF-1 won't hurt muscle mass but it doesn't mean that it **will** increase muscle mass. It's something being studied a lot as are the nuances of IGF-1 induced muscle growth in adults or sarcopenia.     The .gov really has no influence on the paper, the website is a database where peer-reviewed journals upload abstracts and links to accepted papers. Journals from all over the world (i.e. with no government affiliations) use the database as it enables researchers to easily find new or old papers.  The paper is a review paper, summarizing the findings in the field so no new findings or physical study was performed. The paper is also peer-reviewed by experts in the field who would/should ensure that a fair reflection of the literature was provided and discussed.   It's a review paper not an actual study, so it discusses previously published papers. The review paper is focused on bone health/growth, which is what the authors specialize in and not on muscle growth/hypertrophy   To view the article just hit view on the righthand side of the page, it's a peer reviewed article just presented this link to get around the paywall. The pubmed link is here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25857846  A lot of studies have looked at mRNA changes with electrical stimulation in vitro and seen changes there but never really seen changes at the protein level or measured function. This paper measures both protein and function and provides a electrical stimulation paradigm that induces shifts in a wide range of contractile and metabolic proteins -this will allow researchers to study the processes that lead to slow muscle development and if tissue engineered muscle ever reaches the clinic enable a slow muscle to be implanted (big if, and once implanted it may lose the phenotype if innervation is poor or muscle not used). The big thing for researchers is that the protocols typically used don't cause a shift in myosin, which is a traditional marker of fibre-type, but they identified a protocol that does.      A couple of points about the study:  "Based on previous findings, the researchers had predicted that whey protein would be better at facilitating an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in fat, but this wasn't the case"  1. This is an acute study looking at one time point - 3hrs post-ingestion. No change in muscle or fat mass would be able to be measured, so they're looking at markers which might extrapolate to changes in muscle or fat mass. The long-term studies in humans that are cited in the paper show that over prolonged periods (8-12wks) whey induces increases in muscle mass but egg protein does not when combined with resistance exercise. Whey protein given to elderly or ill patients (e.g. cancer, ALS) seem to benefit from whey alone without resistance exercise. If whey alone (i.e. no resistance exercise) in a typically "healthy" person has positive effects on muscle:fat mass I'm not sure.  2. The key here is the 3hr time point, in the rat model they use it's been shown that leucine (thought to be the key amino acid in the beneficial effects of whey protein) increase maximal levels of protein synthesis but not the duration following feeding. The max occurs at ~90mins but is back to basal at 180mins (norton et al. 2009) and is seen in humans too (Tang et al. 2009). It's interesting that they still see an increase in anabolic markers at 180mins, perhaps due to the longer fast (18hrs vs 12hrs) in this study. Anyway, my point is that changes in protein synthesis may only be detectable/significant before 180mins.  3. Figure 1E - the pure whey and 70whey/30egg are significantly higher than control but the 50:50 and 30:70 groups are not. Also, all the protein fed groups are not statistically different from each other. However, you're interested in maximizing protein synthesis to control which from the data shows that the high whey content would be a better choice.  Also going off the puro blot, the pure whey seems to be a lot higher than the other groups - indicating higher protein synthesis (obviously it's a presentation blot and might not be the most representative sample). All the blots aren't from the same gel and the loading controls vary a lot which brings up an important point with the phospho data.  4. It seems that all phosphorylation data is not presented relative to the total levels of the protein which is how it should be done, as it is the ratio of phospho to total that you're interested in. No loading controls are presented and given the puromycin blot in figure 1g it's hard to imagine they have consistent loading in any of their gels. Presenting the data as phospho-to-total helps overcome that limit and normalizes the data more consistently between samples.  5. I don't know much about satiety so I can't say much about it. The only point I'd make is that they looked at mRNA only and not blood levels of leptin, ghrelin etc. Many mRNAs are also regulated post-transcriptionally - that means that though mRNA may increase it doesn't mean you get an increase in the protein. I don't know if leptin mRNA correlates well to changes in leptin levels.  Overall, I wouldn't say it's a good paper due to the one time point, poor presentation of the blots, the fact the phospho-blots aren't normalized to the respective total (HSL is normalized to GAPDH which is a loading control, which though not ideal is better than not normalizing it) and not measuring circulating levels of satiety hormones.    You've dealt with poor doctors from what you've described. I've had similar experiences with some doctors too with regard to my dads cancer treatment, my mom's chronic pain treatment and my own back issues.  "Once one enters into a practice, the primary focus is to pay down student debt and accrue frequent flyer miles to attend pharmaceutical company sponsored seminars in locations both sunny and sandy". I'm a research scientist and have worked with medical doctors in taking treatments from the bench to the clinic and never seen the primary focus of any doctor to be to pay down student debt and accrue frequent flyer miles, again some may do but not all. That may be due to being involved with university/research hospitals and being in the UK, where the NHS system helps prevent (again not saying its flawless and pharma influences will have an influence in some cases/treatments) doctors from being influenced by pharmaceutical reps. I've just moved to the US for a clinical translation (i.e. basic research to clinical use) project so it'll be interesting to see the differences.   Anyway, I hope your diet enables you to stay independent and relatively healthy for the next few years.  	9
             There is a community at /r/battlebots .  Should grow fast in time for the new series on abc.      There is a new series starting soon on ABC.  We have a community at /r/battlebots           I find that last part of the title ludicrous and looking at the article they never make the assertion anywhere that it can be successful just because of it's timeslot  Yes well done!  That is why the title says it has  "every chance of success" rather than aserting that the show will be successful for its time slot.     A show being show at 8pm on a Sunday on BBC TWO does NOT guarantee any popularity for the show.  Yes! You sure speak the truth!    Making this ridiculous suggestion that Top Gear was popular because of that timeslot is just stupid.  Yes that would be ridiculous.  Hence no nobody said that!     There was only a suggestion that the timeslot for this series isn't a dead one and is one which might inherit top gears audience. The articles says "Airheads is likely to appeal to the same male audiences as the car show".    Stuff like that actually happens and is something tv schedulers think about.   I think the fact it isn't on a childrens tv time slot like the early robotwars is significant and a good thing.      Partly posting to advertise /r/battlebots which should be a good place to discuss that television series as well as the upcoming series of battlebots.                            This is the time for companies to either shit or get off the pot, the transition to electric will open the door to a lot of new players that the public will accept as car makers, but they have to do it sooner rather than later while the major car companies are still twiddling their thumbs with no intention of making a push to EV because of risk and lack of competition.                                                          As long as its framed as reasonable network management." I dislike the vague and undefined nature of "reasonable". To them, reasonable, in terms of the legality of file-sharing would be zero file-sharing, right?  The FCC is smart enough to know it would be difficult to force ISPs to take action by law in terms of demanding that they willfully damage their own business, so now expect to see pressure steadily applied to the ISPs, so they voluntarily choose to "do the right thing".  We have already witnessed the MPAA abusing any law that helps them shut down piracy and I see these loopholes in net neutrality being heavily abused by the MPAA as soon as they can get started on that.  Sure, Net Neutrality does have its good points, but doesn't feel like its good for our way of doing things. The main problem has always been their continued failure to see downloads and lost sales as two quite different things and so they pursue file-sharing doggedly to ensure that we rush out and buy their products. Frankly, if TV broadcasting was better and not full of shows for dumb people and as many commercial breaks as they can squeeze in - I wouldn't even need to download.  I also dislike their notion that you are not entitled to your privacy, unless you're willing to pay for a service to ensure you get privacy.   Reasonable Network Management needs to be explicitly defined such as the ability to counter a DDoS attack. Throttling unlimited data customers on mobile networks because you want to get more money from them or using man in the middle attacks on BitTorrent traffic have been the result of the vague reasonable network management definition.   But at the end of the day, it is weird to even suggest that the economy revolve around "hollywood".  Since when did that happen.  Basically the article  says that all innovation and technology that could be disruptive (outside of their ownership) can be considered illegal. It took labels TEN years to consider digital files as "legitimate". Independent content is never "legitimate". They always consider streaming services as "illegitimate". Every new technology has this hurdle and it's just been given the go ahead.  And penalties for abuse?  This copyright loophole is an end run that invalidates everything net neutrality was intended to do. It's useless.  There is nothing to increase competition. Nothing to reduce rates. Nothing that will immediately speed things up or increase service. Nothing that an average person can use to fight bad behavior or abuse of DMCA (which is more likely than pirating). Nothing to repair damage when whole domains are blocked erroneously. Now they approve of blocking technology. What did "we" win?            Is it time for the BBC to let the fracas-prone Clarkson and his mates go, and to reinvent the shows format with fresher talent?                        People don't switch the light off or wear headphones to play games.  So they are already opting out of immersion.                                     When the US is adopting something the Europeans are now dismantling tells us a lot, does it not?   You know Washington is on the wrong track with a regulation when even Brussels has a better idea. Witness the latest net-neutrality proposal from European Union leaders, which is smarter than the 300-page blobfish recently imposed by President Obamas Federal Communications Commission.  In response to demands from the European Parliament for net-neutrality regulations, EU member governments are discussing a Latvian plan that would leave the marketplace scope to set rates for different types of data transmission. While the proposal from the governments would require Internet-service providers to equally treat equivalent types of traffic when providing internet access servicesa big nod to proponents of net neutralityit would also allow providers to enter into agreements with content companies to ensure a specific level of service quality.  This isnt a full-throated commitment to letting market forces work on the European Internet. It would be better if the EU werent imposing any new rules on the telecommunications industry. Nevertheless, the provision opens the door to differential pricing, the bane of the net-neutrality crowd but potentially an important market tool for stimulating future investment.  Its also a major improvement on what the FCC did last month when it applied early-20th-century utility rules to the Internet. The key insight in Europe is that there needs to be some market involvement in pricing. The European proposal also waters down a plan to further limit the roaming charges mobile operators charge customers using services outside their home countries. Roaming already is subject to Brussels-imposed price caps, and the European Parliament and Commission are agitating to ban roaming charges.  Any final regulation will need to survive the European Parliament, where support for activist regulation is stronger. What Europe really needs to boost investment and pro-consumer competition would be a single market for telecommunications services, coupled with more reasonable antitrust enforcement to allow the consolidation Europes telecom market so sorely lacks.  Still, this climb down on net neutrality raises the prospect that the EU could end up with a more pro-investment business climate than the U.S. Not everyone wants to follow Washingtons lead in tightening governments grip on the Internet.  ------------  From http://www.wsj.com/articles/europes-net-neutrality-sense-1426030850 (paywall)                              Check out /r/test_subject3185 .  I did not make that subreddit but someone seems to know something!   You guys should collaborate   I get lots of happy faces and that is reward enough for me.      Yep.  i thought the title that would get me some internet points  as everyone is losing their minds over some rumors    they changed it.  "steal" is still in the url.     http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/utorrent-downloading-client-hijacks-users-computers-to-steal-bitcoins-10091567.html  good job independent.  I thought it was bit shit for them but at least the put it right         I wonder if AMD or Nvidia will fight to be the official partner of Vive. That has to be worth something to them.   The only media source to have tested it themselves is beta news and they called the rumour  crap.     http://betanews.com/2015/03/06/reports-that-utorrent-silently-installs-bitcoin-crapware-are-crap/  I don't think others wanted to sacrifice their tasty titles.    Some really shit journalists just copy and pasting from reddit.   You see how the story evolves into one that cannot be confirmed or denied.  Then it is left to reddits circlejerk to vote up a scandal and hide the uncertainty.  Shit like this always happens when reddit and isn't helped by low quality journalism    No you didn't do that.   You just gave your opinion as a TL;DR and missed out key facts.    Hence it is safer and more fair just to have rules that specify exact title.  This means people can get  upset at the media source rather than accusing OP of bias   My title is from the article.  That is my point.  You should direct your complaints to the article and not to the OP.  I just posted a link and followed subreddit rules.    Your TL;DR is misleading because it does not accurately summarise the uncertainty of the article and how it uses a flimsy single source for which there is no evidence and something that the company has already denied.   Thanks that is interesting.  But what about TF own testing?   I'd be interested in what they actually believe.  They are just reporting what people are saying.   Why are there "sides" in this producing evidence that people cannot replicate for themselves?  There is a lot of hysteria around this now and it wouldn't surprise me if people are being devious or whatever.     I'd like to see some of the trusted media test it for themselves and not just report on internet rumours.   It isn't that hard to get the installer and see what happens.  Instead they are just making headlines.   e.g. betanews test if for themseveles and call the rumor "crap".   http://betanews.com/2015/03/06/reports-that-utorrent-silently-installs-bitcoin-crapware-are-crap/     Your TL;DR is also misleading and based on an unfounded internet rumour.  Lucky this is /r/technology and not the ministry of truth.                          Giving BitTorrent the benefit of the doubt, there are three clear scenarios that could have caused this situation. Either the users are collectively mistaken; there is a lack of transparency in the software installation, leading to confusion amongst users; or there is a software fault whereby users are experiencing issues not otherwise intended     Update: BitTorrent has stressed that the Epic Scale software is not a "silent install," and we've confirmed it ourselves. The post has been updated with that information.  misleading to call it stealing   LONG LIVE THE KING               Hey, I like the banner.  I hope we can use it for /r/vive.  If not now, in the future.         Sounds like it could be a user error    We design our software to ensure that partner software downloads don't occur without approval by the user. But given your report, weve also double-checked this particular offer, and have determined that it cannot be installed without user approval.  This unconfirmed rumour from a single user should not be on the top page of reddit.   Great comment.   It sums up why there is little public reaction to it the net neutrality debate unlike the US drama.    Also EU corporations already volunteer a lot of their conduct because they fear the regulator stepping in .  It wasn't like they were even trying to be evil     "We're building tools and hopefully they're valuable to hardware partners who want to do it. In some cases, we'll take the leadership role in shipping stuff. But we're really just building tools for other people to continue. So you'll see more headsets."  Gabe Newell     The HTC Vive is a virtual reality platform that's shooting for the moon. It will likely be expensive, or at least more expensive than its competitors. Even if you're not walking around, you're waving your arms in 3D space with the controllers, and that's going to require a decent-sized area that's clear of obstruction   This is just the opening salvo for Valve.  Valve likely doesn't care that much who "wins" the virtual reality game, as long as people buy games from Steam.    http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/5/8150605/htc-vive-valve-vr-gdc-omg                                       Short answer is that it will depend  on the game.     Some discussion here http://www.reddit.com/r/Vive/comments/2xn19r/am_i_the_only_nearsighted_who_is_kinda_upset/  I think it is a yes but whether it is less optimal is unclear.  People need to keep asking about this.    Also welcome to some more new moderators.  /u/TheBunneh  /u/NextPerception   /u/wingzfan99  I added them on the basis that they seem to like battlebots and have some first-hand experience .          We have a community at /r/Vive  .  There has been a lot of positive reaction to many aspects of the hardware.  Things are looking good.

Yes.  It is very much just HTC's implementation and device.   There also looks to be a lot of non-steam content on the vive via HTC.  I don't see it as valve hardware but it is their flagship for now.     Check how steamvr is seen as a platform for different hardware in the same way that steam and android are platforms.    https://steamdb.info/static/img/blog/53/steamvrplatform.png   I created /r/vive which is focused on the HTC device but fully expect /r/steamvr to have a lot of content that won''t make it to my subreddit.  As things are so early, there is a lot of overlap right now and people are not seeing the difference.         Good post.   I suppose some people were reading it  as *Vive la France !*   I'm not entirely clear but some people are calling it "reVive" as that is what the logo says with "Vive" being the trademark friendly word.   So if Vive  is a play on 'revive', we can see the dictionary meanings.  * as in to activate, set in motion, or take up again; renew: * to restore to life or consciousness: * to put on or show again. * to make operative or valid again. * to bring back into notice, use, or currency: * to revive a subject of discussion. * to quicken or renew in the mind; bring back: * to revive memories. * to reanimate or cheer   which might make sense for future marketing campaigns.     	138
 Forget satisfying, this is downright fascinating. The planes all look like individual games of Snake swerving around the storms.     Correct, it's going to be at:  Burke High School 244 President Street Charleston, SC 29403  I can't wait to be there!         People who are saying that the United States doesn't have any business getting involved with FIFA are dead wrong. Loretta Lynch and her team absolutely pressured him after their indictments of the other FIFA executives. Thank goodness we're starting to cut out the cancer.    Oh yes, that was a very well conducted interview. I've always been a fan of her.   I think he did a really great job of sidestepping questions where Katie was trying to get him to take a shot at Hillary. I know that as a reporter it's her job to ask those questions and I don't fault her for that, but I'm proud that he was able to address those questions by keeping the interview about his policy views and his campaign rather than focusing on where another candidate stands. That's the kind of honest, clean campaign that all of Bernie's doubters need to see.   	7

 That's surprising given your username.         I was just about to ask if you broke even with the record company or if they had to recoup their advances? Or if it happened some other way?

 you're welcome :)   there could be a solution, im just not aware of it   Snippet - http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/39yf9n/how_do_i_restore_my_firefox_page_to_the_original/     i use ctrl+T and start typing away.   My New tab opens my about:newtab page. So i stay in the URL bar and can type away.    And yes you can type keywords in URL Bar and it will search for what you entered with a search engine or previously accessed URL's   i think its a WIP:   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=820679   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=878288    Hope someone knows a temp solution.   Some more info of your situation(not real solutions though):    http://fedoramagazine.org/how-to-get-firefox-looking-right-on-a-high-dpi-display-and-fedora/   http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23099849/stop-firefox-dpi-scaling-when-windows-setting-is-at-125      EDIT-   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nosquint/ - FOR Text   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fxdpi/?src=search   https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/autohidpi/?src=search      it'll go away soon, new announcements happen there from mozilla's side to create awareness.    in about:config "browser.aboutHomeSnippets.updateUrl" to empty value should do it(DISCLAIMER - ive not tested this personally so not sure of the consequences and dont blame me :) )   i meant the OS theme, Windows Classic possibly, but anyway small thing   ah im really not sure on this, maybe you've switched system themes or so?    If im not wrong, its implemented by the OS so probably some theme is causing the trouble; orelse the only other possibility is that the CSS rendering is different for different browsers.   http://www.marioaraque.com/html-css-checkbox    Im on Linux currently, and im subject to the OS styling.    Bug related - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=605985   the '!' mark shows thats its not enabled, and thats the way it should be as default for now.    When webM gets properly implemented you'll have an awesome video experience on YouTube.     I don't really understand the tick boxes situation, could you please post a image/screenshot somewhere?   in case your youtube is working fine then, i guess its okay.    If you're still having problems its better to start off with a fresh new profile.    Since you said webM is enabled on the youtube.com/html5 page, i thought it would be better to have a refresh/new profile created.   WebM is still under development and as such you'll run into issues with video playback.   You can disable it in about:config "media.mediasource.webm.enabled"  in case its still enabled.      I'd recommend you to still refresh the browser and if that doesn't work out then create an a new profile and use Firefox.     https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles  Mostly likely the old browser which is based on firefox has left some settings enabled and that's causing all your troubles.   Your YouTube video problems are most likely happening because you have webM support enabled     visit youtube.com/html5 and report here how many boxes are ticked and unticked.    If you've used FF before and then stopped using it, i'd recommend you start off with a fresh profile. If you don't want to do that then you can reset Firefox in Menu-Help-Troubleshoot Information    This needs to be stickied!   Also info on HTML5 playback that webM is still under going development and its better not to turn it manually for normal usage.      The State Bank of India tells me I need an international card since purchases made in the Play Store count as International purchases. Whatever that means.  You'll need to activate your card for international purchases. IIRC Cards before 2013 Dec have this On as default, new cards need to be activated for international purchasing.    Contact the cards dept of your bank and they'll walk you through the process.     Boooooob the builder! Can you build it?    and better not to, its still under development - webM that is   you were talking of targeted advertising all the way down along with the data collection/usage etc.    Marketing by advertisement will require some form of data without which no marketing will work.   As long as Personal identity is not revealed or stolen, im fine with with being show products etc on my way based on things i find interesting.   If i like something ill buy or else chuck it off.   Humans aren't dumb to go on a purchasing spree because they see ads.    And atleast these are not some click-bait ads that lead you to some data theft/survey/questionable site.     Ah not really, you can buy don't know how far you'll go to achieve your results.    It's better to stick to gimp for that purpose    Hehe you're paranoid.     good ads    Oh look the TV has ads! They are tracking you as well. Oh look at that street, it's filled with posters and ads. There are ad spies tracking what you look at O_O   /s   And the Web is always expanding and it's future not limited.   Being prepared is the best option.     People can keep complaining and criticizing.   Unless it's constructive, or contributes to a better future/implementation, there's no use for one.     Even in case of ads Mozilla, could and possibly I hope, will make ads less intrusive.   There are good ads and bad ads.   Good ones are far better than the bad.  There's absolutely nothing wrong in advertising unless you profit from unethical/unlawful use of user data.    To be a leader you have to start preparing now or else you play catch up till the end.     Here are a few things you could try:   Go into safe mode in Firefox and see if it's fine. If it's fine then Check troublesome addons.    Create a new profile. Remember to back up old Firefox data if you need them.   Use pipelight for flash on Linux. Yes this causes the browser to get stuck for a second or two as it loads pipelight but you'll have a much better flash experience.    It uses the latest flash version available on windows instead of the outdated Linux version of flash    I suspect VR will definitely come to the Web in the future.   Everyone is investing on the tech right now.   Google showcasing the ability of cardboard on android could also mean that one day in the future we would have streamable VR content for maps, street view, movies, YouTube etc.     It's better they do put in resources now, than suffer a similar backlash that's happening with Electrolysis, MSE in the future.    Fire marketing completely.     Cut down on product portfolio.   Maintain 3-4 global devices.    Get the specs, camera and design right for the flagship.   The rest should be priced lower in the mid and low range will the best specs possible at those price range.  Let blogs/social media do the marketing job for you.       I'm afraid, I disliked Australis.. and immediately installed the Classic Theme Restorer addon.  Its looks more like AutoCAD tabs than chrome/chromium tabs    works pretty good.   Shipped with Fedora 22 , gtk3 as default.   Issue's with readability on dark themes. Light themes works as good as the gtk2 port.   Not sure of the underlying tech but visually things are improving! :)     Since you're on Linux, I'd recommend you to get pipelight.   It uses the latest version of flash available instead of the old Linux version.   And yes when you load a page, it'll feel it's stuck for a second or 2 but it's pipelight loading flash in the background.     For html5 videos, you can enable MSE in about:config.    Enable everything except webM support.    Check the status of html5 on YouTube.com/html5   Thats strange O_O   For me: "The HTML5 player is currently used when possible."   There should be an option to switch on that page itself.    Also you could resort to some add-ons to force enable it incase things don't work   Also this to true: media.fragmented-mp4.gmp.enabled   the youtube.com/html5 should use html5 as default player by now hopefully. You can right click and check stats on video's   webM is still under-development.   Try keeping everything except webM enabled   Strange that    Set these to true  media.mediasource.enabled   media.mediasource.format-reader.mp4   media.mediasource.mp4.enabled   media.fragmented-mp4.exposed   media.fragmented-mp4.ffmpeg.enabled   I have everything except webM enabled on YouTube.com/html5    I'm happy with the adaptive streaming.   If you need some more control I think some add one works perfect, it's mentioned quite a lot here. You could search the previous posts. YouTube control center or something (development version).      webM still under development, so you'll encounter into issue.   Best option is to leave webm false untile later.   Ah thanks for that info, updated the bug to gtk3 since this affects wine and others too.     filed a bug - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1227826   filed a bug - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1227826   Filed a bug - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1227826   for me using a sennheiser HD202 on my laptop i was able to uncover the 320/Uncompressed from the 128 quite easily.   Differentiating between the 320 and uncompressed was a little more difficult since the instruments play in the background.    Tom's Diner was quite easy to pick out, there was an airiness and depth to the voice on the uncompressed version.   yeah thats possible, a trail before a complete launch.   Witness Me!     Battery life is best addressed by installing the correct Graphic drivers of your Mac. Don't really know how it works. Google will definitely help.    In-case they have the hybrid tech like Optimus(Intel+Nvidia) i think you'll need to go for bumblebee. Be sure to read more on the internet!     Get gnome-tweak-tools.     Don't forget the HTitle extension for Firefox if that's your browser choice.   Avoid the dark-theme mode in Fedora for some time.  Firefox is still improving on the gtk3 support. The light themes work fine! :)    Free advice- try getting used to gnome without changing it at first. You'll love it. Incase you don't go for the Gnome extensions to suit your needs.    And remember to improve the fonts with Freetype-freeworld package or Infinality.(Check prev. post's on /r/Fedora for more info)     you've enabled Testtube feature https://www.youtube.com/testtube   the end of Candy.   Other ones that hit me are The Great Gatsby and Seven Pounds endings   on linux gtk3-dark is pretty nice. Could definitely use improvements though.   I wish i knew a way to put australis tabs on the dark dev theme. love the dark look it has.   Happens to me on Linux if pipelight flash is enabled. Try disabling flash and loading the page.   On windows it mostly loads smooth for me.    "lspci |grep -i VGA" single line output with only intel no worries.   Double-line output then bumblebee(if nvidia)     Install the graphic driver if you have an nvidia or ati.   if you've got an intel+nvidia combo (optimus) install bumblebee.       Where did you find this?    It seems more of a bug to me.    kinda yes, mostly wine, but my "open with" list is flooded with krita :(    voted on some of them :)   Done it :)   I tried to open a file with another app and noticed the same app repeating over and over again in the "Open With" Section.   Can be accessed by FilePropertiesOpen With   Edit: Filed a bug - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1227826   Tabs that are selected have this white light gradient that is highly contrasting with the entire black/dark look.   Something in this shade would be much better for selected tabs - http://people.mozilla.org/~shorlander/private-browsing-mode/mockups/australis-pbm.png    YAAAY!    The obvious interpretation of 'Kids today' is usually a comparison to 'Kids of some other time'.   Hence the difference   I assumed it to mean a couple of things   "then things become unfair."     But you original line seemed to indicate that you think awareness has decreased.    Your interpretation. I never mentioned it decreased, just info not being spread as it should, so largely unchanged.    You didn't answer my question at all.     O_O No thank you means - No.   So no to paying for a software just to type an essay in a paid software when i have a Free(in all its sense) software available that does exactly the same job.      Orders of magnitude difference actually.  There is a difference since curious people are on the internet researching/doing stuff. As a nationwide initiative, i feel it still needs more work.     How much would you pay to type an essay in a word processor?   3000+ bucks for MS Office(1Year validity) and 10000+ for the OS? No thank you.    I can LibreOffice that export it to PDF/docx on Fedora for free.        You seem to be more worried about price than freedom.  I'm worried on both instance.    Kids today are hardly aware/taught that there are alternatives to proprietary software.   A notion that choice exists isn't being propagated.   Many are falling for marketing schemes. Its not just Microsoft.   eg. Look at Chrome and the way the marketed themselves on the road towards domination.   More people using an Android tied to Google than an untied version like CyanogenMod.   Win-Intel systems in schools when kids should also be exposed to Linux, Mac's, Raspberry Pi's and Aurdino's.     The illusion that it works makes it the best. Back in the old days you had to do some work to get things to work. Today not a bit. And its quite a knowledge black-hole when you don't know how things work in the background or the steps involved in making them work.     Also the beauty of free software, that you can view code, contribute to the project(Artwork/code etc.) and use it as well, makes it a much better source of practical programming and a robust source to gain knowledge.    On note of price - yes worried there too.    * A RaspPi's is much more affordable and does pretty well for general computing purpose.    * Open Hardware is the future as well.    * Free(cost) software means people can use apps/software without being hindered by money. Not all of us can afford the license cost to install a legal Windows copy, a cost to install MS Office, a cost to install Photoshop etc. on top of the cost required to buy the hardware.     Good things come at a good prices, some are worth the money! But if i end to empty my bank to type an essay in a word processor, then things become unfair.     I do. Been a linux/FOSS user for 15+ years :)    Got nothing against proprietary unless they sabotage standards, open formats and kill people's freedom.   This needs to be in /r/Fedora    I was playing around with Nightly GTK3 and thought i completely 'TIFU' firefox gtk2 on my system XD   Totally surprised that F22 ships with GTK3 :D   if you've got WebM enabled try disable that and see   Everyone uses a Linux device directly or indirectly :P    Insert android/Internet xD   Will take the example of school:    Being taught that Microsoft Office is the best and only tool that can do word processing etc. And that the competition is useless.    Children go home with the same mentality and are indirectly affected in buying paid software without being aware that there are amazing free alternatives like LibreOffice that do the same function at 0 cost.      Need to take a look at Europe who's encouraging Free Software growth and usage any where possible; especially in education and government adoption.    True, but things like this shouldn't go unchecked.    Having to feed capitalism at every end of your computer needs is bad.    Competition should be fair.    Not without money. No lobbying happens without money.    This article is more awareness than lobbying though.      These settings are the best for me: $ xrdb -query  Xft.dpi: 96   Xft.hinting: 1   Xft.hintstyle: hintslight   Xft.lcdfilter: lcddefault   Xft.antialias: 1   Xft.rgba: rgb   Xcursor.size: 24      dangerous bijness for the future.     it'll take time, Intel releases their version after quiet some time       i think the problem is that liberation sans font is coming and overtaking all the proprietary fonts in the browser. The default liberation sans font has jagged edges.   Try changing the browser font settings instead of the system wide font settings   Try freetype-freeworld or infinality for improving font rendering.    Chrome has comparatively bad font rendering for me. I use Firefox.   Perhaps you could check that out and see if it works out for you!     True, Microsoft have mysteriously been trying to be nice to other OpenSource projects now.   hope it doesn't end up on the "embrace extend extinguish" plan   GIMP is pretty okay, Try the old versions of blender! O_O    Love the new blender though :D    despite  KDE has changed the entire experience now.   i personally love GNOME.    Best thing ive ever used it terms of speed/productivity. Switching between widows with the mouse has never been easier. i hardly reach for Alt+tab.     Get hang of it for a hour and your good to go!   yes but what if i need to work offline and not interested in making another account for online work?   I get a full office suite with this app on desktop without much hassles/cost   Still cant understand why MS would keep office away from Linux now, Libre is also coming out with an online version too.      Linux was also being told off with this statement; suddenly the entire world uses it, directly or indirectly ;)   agreed!   Corporate mentality comes to home as well   you still have to pay for MS Office on desktop.    Libre is cross-platform ( for me a Linux user this is important)   Nothing is completely free with MS - only an illusion, strings attached somewhere or the other.    On another note:   It depends on a person's mentality, If he/she stands up for a brighter future then Open Source is better in the long run and more users means better development and contributors as well.     Export is much better now that in the past.   At least with Writer and Word the export is pretty good!   I mostly export to PDF from LibreOffice and it serves better.    The problem is proprietary formats, if you don't want to be an open standard then it is time to move on. People need to realize the fact that they themselves are breeding the source of evil.   They will mostly improve on it with time. They've recently updated the look on the desktop. Once things get the required pace, and look 'n feel update will come.     First priority is to get things running and a bug-free experience :)      Method 1 : http://www.reddit.com/r/Fedora/comments/12jetj/you_dont_need_infinality_for_pretty_text/  Method 2 : http://www.webupd8.org/2013/06/better-font-rendering-in-linux-with.html    had to Google around to figure out how to use GNOME Tweak Tool to make my fonts look better.  Also Infinality for fonts if you dont like freetype-freeworld   Use the browser in safe mode. Check if it occurs there. If it does not, an extension is your problem     Why hang onto Flash? Chrome, Firefox everyone is trying their best to kill it off. Chrome already enforces it on YouTube.     Menu  options/preferences  advanced  general  uncheck use hardware acceleration    try the disabling HWA only if the problem doesn't go away after the update   try disable HWA and check.   Do update FF, lots of improvements have come in.   update firefox and enable html5 at youtube.com/html5    Affordability. Usability. Need.    * I dont find the point in getting the high-end when a better high-end comes out the following year.   * If a mid-range can work and do all that i need then why bother with a high end?   * Plus all the high-ends have a huge price tag that makes it over-rated and inflated value.   * Probably the only good thing on a higher end device to me would be the camera, but if you can spend so much on one why not get a DSLR?    * Updates are still slow unless you are on a nexus.     Doesn't justify the cost for me personally.    Spending so much and getting outdated with a newer product in a years usage feels like a waste.     600MB is quite odd. i hope they check out the crash reports.  Hopefully you aren't using extensions.   I think lollipop might be better suited.     Valhalla Awaits :D   Edit:  Tried it out and i love it! It works fine as well as the gtk2 version for me.   Looks pretty neat on Non-Dark GTK themes.    Few Issues:     * There are few readability issues on the Dark Theme versions(Numix; Adwaita) on GNOME like the drop down boxes on booking.com and initial loading of google.com shows the search bar as black before turning white.     * I wish we could get rid of the BIG FAT title bar, but HTitle add-on is quite the savior.   * And in "Get Add-ons" there is a big white space at the bottom  * Amazon tab keep stopping and showing the spinner every second before it completely loads.    * Scroll bars disappears on booking.com drop down boxes while scrolling from bottom to top - Date; Month.    Typed the edit on gtk 3 :D      for gmail i think it auto open them in new tabs, you'll have to normal click them   You can right click and open in Private Window on Unity Ubuntu.   As far as GNOME based linux distro's are concerned, it does not seem possible.    I think it'll be addressed in the upcoming GNOME releases.   Not sure but do try out Gnome Shell extensions, there could be one for this purpose.   Menu - Preferences - General - Uncheck "When I open a link in a new tab, switch to it immediately"    Use middle mouse button to open links in new tab or Ctrl+ left click on laptop ;)   glad it worked out for you :)   i hoped it would work out, because i also experienced sudden closing of the browser before but im able to browser way better with recent than before.   stable does support extension.     It can't even render pinch zooms properly after five minutes, and crashed multiple times.  Try reinstalling   If you have time do file a bug report   I've been using FF beta on moto g Lollipop,   And seems fine, I browse for 20-30mins at a stretch and it doesn't randomly crash like before    Use ublock, lighter extension    Facebook app uses the built it WebView of Chrome on Android.   You can open links in external browser like Firefox by changing the app settings inside the facebook app :)    I hate both of them help each other track people x_x   do you have WebM enabled in youtube.com/html5 ? If yes, then try disable it in about:config   I am so sorry for your loss     I'm sure Kitten's blessings and love will follow you forever.      You sir are an awesome human being!   Thank you for sharing this story.   I hope good things and good times come to you!     Yes! It should be on the affordable side though.   Low price and good specs can be achieved these days!   I wish Mozilla comes out with more mid-tier phones that function as good as the others if not better   Best strategy would he like Motorola  3 phone lines like the moto e, moto g and moto x  Everything shall work out good afterwards    [new profile](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/profile-manager-create-and-remove-firefox-profiles)  Edit: id suggest you update your graphic drivers(intel/nvidia) and then turn on HWA. HWA should speed up video performance   That's surprising, I felt the opengl version to be much faster and smoother. Running into stability issues though with opengl   i think yes, without it its Basic OMTC and with it you get OpenGL OMTC   for google + privacy use [startpage](https://startpage.com/)   Its better to use different engines from time to time.

I've searched around but i find technical stuff, can someone help me understand if this'll help in a performance boost or so?  	113
 They occasionally go to $50 on sale combined with the usual 30% off gets you $35. If you are very lucky they drop to $30 sale which means less that $20 after discount but they sell out quite quickly at that point.   I also wear a slim small in J. Crew. If you wear a Slim Small in J. Crew you are a slim small in Uniqlo. Be warned though, I found Uniqlo's fit to be far inferior to J. Crew's - so much so I returned them. YMMV.    J. Crew are definitely one step higher than Uniqlo's. Fit is more on par and quality is definitely higher. Just feels like a more quality piece to me.   I usually grab my J. Crew's at around $30, so they are well worth the $10 difference to me. Whether they are $30 better is up to you.    Pretty sure these items at TJ Maxx and Marshall's are lower quality lines produced specifically for these stores. There are hundreds of these socks in the ones in my city.   I think the general rule of thumb is if there's a only a few items in a single size it is a mainline, normal quality item (American Eagle and some Levi's washes come to mind); if you see a ton of an item in multiple sizes (pretty much everything else), it's a low quality item. Compare this to [mainline](http://www.divisadero.us/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/ww-socks.jpg) [packaging](http://thumbs3.ebaystatic.com/d/l225/m/mBPjOCzQo5_zDWe8TIl9H2A.jpg) and you can see a big difference.    Do a quick search for skin tone charts. It's true that there are certain colors that look best with certain skin tones, and skin tones usually correspond to race.   I think MFA doesn't talk about this much because the colors that are recommended here (light blue, light pink, charcoal, navy blue) are colors that work pretty well on everyone. And I do think that how you wear the colors matters more than how the colors look on you.   Texas  Y'all   Checks out.    I'll take the Armani Code!   I think it looks good. I would not wear it with a crew neck undershirt though.   I think your definition of "punchable" is based on facial features alone. And that's totally okay.   Here's my take. I think punchability has less to do with the facial features and overall attractiveness and more to do with the attitude that is carried by the person, and therefore the face. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2e8b94/this_fucking_twat/) [are](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2kdn6z/i_cant_believe_this_cunt_isnt_the_top_post/) [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2atzgu/vine_star_and_little_brat_nash_grier/) [examples] (http://www.reddit.com/r/punchablefaces/comments/2hlmv3/the_doucheness_is_overwhelming/) of people that I think most people would consider attractive; however, the facial expression and attitude they carry make them extremely punchable. The phrase that is thrown around for this kind of effect is "douchey." If the pictures were of them smiling nicely (or just without the smug looks on their faces) they might be less punchable. For instance, I don't think people think [George Clooney](http://www.phootoscelebrities.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/George-Clooney-smile.jpg) has a punchable face even though he is attractive and many people are jealous of his aesthetics. It's because he carries himself with a certain poise that makes him seem likable and kind - definitely not punchable.  I think people with unfortunate facial features sometimes makes them look like they act like a douche or have a smug attitude even though they really don't. The male you linked above is one of those faces for me, as is [this](http://i.imgur.com/YJYSstG.jpg) face. Just something about the nose and the hair makes me want to punch this kid in the face. He's not making any particular facial expression, or acting a certain way, but still, the urge is there. Most people's faces aren't the most attractive or desirable, but I don't go around all day thinking that everyone's face I see is punchable just because their nose is a little big or their eyes a little small. I know plenty of less attractive people that I would never dream of wanting to punch in the face because they are nice and pleasant to be around and look nice and pleasant too. Those girls fall into this category for me - they look pleasant to be around, not punchable.   I'm sorry you're being downvoted for stating your opinion, OP.     We circlejerkin' but their supima cotton shirts are amazing. Got a few at $7.90 over black friday.    If you're worried about how they hurt your ears, just keep wearing them for a few days. Mine hurt like a bitch the first 10 hours or so but now I can wear them all day with no discomfort.   Another alternative would be to turn them into around ears with a pair of G cushions. I have heard they are substantially more comfortable.    Yes. I wear 30x32 in 511s and 30x30 in 484s.    They will definitely stretch. If they are a tad too tight brand new they are perfect.    Christ I just bought these at $1.90 a pair earlier today. I mean it's less than a dollar difference... but... *frugality...*   I wear size 9 in Sperrys and 9.5 in athletic shoes and 8.5s are great in CDBs.    American Eagle jeans tend to run very large. If AE fits a little large on you I would definitely go for the 31/30, but if they fit a little tight or just right I would stay with the sizing.    You turn it on it's side...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JalAf3yMiio   This list misses the two top recommended colognes by this poster: Acqua Di Gio and Armani Code. I have tried both and I really enjoy them.   Most people think they are really played out, and I agree. I have definitely smelled people using Acqua Di Gio before I even knew what it was. If you go to a more fashionable college that has a lot of bros using it I would steer clear but I go to a nerd school where no one uses cologne so I thought it was a safe bet.   [Original comment here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/2iiwxb/what_cologne_should_i_buy/cl2ms6f)   It sounds like Macy's won't have much in terms of clothing if you are already shopping at Brooks Brothers and Barbour. I would suggest using it to buy some nice cologne or some appliances/house items. Or you could always sell it for cash at a discount.    Just bought a nice bottle of the stuff and was wondering how you all personally apply it.    Look up your skin tone online. Generally there are four main skin tones that correspond with the seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter), and a warm/deep and cool variation of each (occasionally a neutral). A quick Google search for determining your skin tone will get you on the right track.   If you are Asian, I can almost guarantee that you are some variation of Winter. Whether you are warm, cool, or neutral is up to you to determine.   Each type of skin tone will have a color palate that looks best. Again, a quick Google search of your skin tone + color palate will give you a good indication of which colors will work well for you.    I think they are most definitely a step higher.    Yes but it's Levi's. Just incredibly inconsistent sizing.   Wow they really do look like chinos. Just bought a pair! Thanks!   Same here bro. Same here.    Eh they're no miracle shirts but they definitely help imo.    It looks like you might be able to use a seam ripper to remove them.   I'd try something underneath. A Uniqlo heattech undershirt works great for the cold.   This infograph is a two roll cuff, which is very difficult to do, as the fabric that is normally around your forearm is now around your bicep. Try doing it so there's only one roll (don't pull the cuff so high in step two and then skip step three and go to step four). The roll should now be around your elbow/upper forearm, and should be much easier to do.  When I roll up my sleeves I tend to shift the entire shirt over to make the sleeve I'm rolling up longer. Then when I'm finished rolling I recenter my shirt. This way my forearms don't get in the way. Sorry if that doesn't make sense.   Either way don't sweat it. As long as you roll up your sleeves neatly it will look good any way you do it.   I just recently got a pair of the heattech gloves and I love them. They are as thin as a pair of those crappy 100% acrylic gloves but they are much warmer. The plus side of them being thin is that you maintain nearly 100% dexterity for things such as fiddling with keys or checking your phone (they are touchscreen compatible). I no longer have to take off my gloves to change the song on my phone!   If you are out in the cold for a very long time you might want something a little more substantial, but these are so thin that they would probably fit underneath a bigger glove. Definitely worth it.   I'll take the heathered cotton OCBD!   I have an Asus R9 270X I am willing to sell for $90 shipped. Negotiable.   I think it looks great provided the tops aren't too vibrant. Stick to soft faded and pastel colors since the white will already be very bright and vibrant.   Off-color white shorts might be the more versatile option if you want to wear both vibrant and faded tops.   They are very thin but fit incredibly well and are the softest shirt I have ever worn. Great as a layering piece.   Note that the cut varies a lot so if you aren't satisfied with the fit try another one.    "Unique Clothing"   I got my ultra light down parka today and it absolutely blew me away with how thin, light and yet warm it was. I wore it out with only a heattech undershirt and an OCBD in sub-freezing temps today and I was very comfortably warm. Definitely worth it.    Holy hell that is so skinny.    That's kind of the appeal of pullover hoodies, I'm afraid. I like the way it bunches up because it gives me a more muscular look (I'm pretty skinny). Maybe consider zip-up hoodies? I find they tend to fit straighter.    American Eagle is slowly moving towards simple and minimally branded items. While some of their items still have flashy logos, you can find some really nice two tones or color-blocked sweaters and shirts.   Also, most of the brands you find recommended on here (J. Crew, H M, Uniqlo) have no branding whatsoever.    It's for a college class.   Hi everyone!  I have an assignment to interview an entrepreneur for my Intro to Entrepreneurship class. Problem is, I don't know any entrepreneurs personally, so I decided to come here for help! Below is a list of questions that form the guideline for the essay I need to write (copy and pasted directly from my assignment guidelines).    Idea selection  individual or team    How did the market and customer research effect the decision to launch?   Describe the process of making the go/no go decision  what other alternatives were under consideration?   How accurate was the market research?  What changes were required after launch to reorient the business or venture?   Describe the company culture.  How did the founder set the mold for the enduring culture?  What, if anything, endangered it over time?   How do they balance time between work, family, and personal pursuits?   Do they remain as passionate about the product or service as when the company launched?   Learn about the early business plans.  How useful were they in making decisions?   Being a CEO/founder is a lonely position.  What steps have they taken to surround themselves with trusted advisors, board members, family, etc.?   How have they financed the venture?  What lessons can they convey about financing options?   How actively do they think about selling or exiting the venture?  Why?  Any help would be greatly appreciated! Even just a short summary of your startup or venture would be awesome.   P.S. I won't be copying down your responses word for word, I need to write an essay based or your responses, so don't worry about that. I have also looked around the IAmAs on the sidebar but the question asked there aren't really focused enough and don't really form enough of a cohesive story for what the professor wants for this assignment.     I think it makes a lot of sense to get a suit of your own right now. There are plenty of situations (applying for an internship, pledging for a frat, dates) that come up frequently enough that it is nice and convenient to have one on hand.   That being said, I think spending a lot of money on one right now is a waste. It's not going to get a whole lot of use, even in the situations listed above, and your body will most likely still change in college (freshman 15 woooo!). Blowing a lot of money on a suit that will be worn only a handful of times before it doesn't fit anymore sucks.   My suggestion is to buy one reasonably priced and reasonable quality suit that is extremely versatile. As said previously, there won't be a situation where navy is acceptable but charcoal isn't, and vice versa. The JCP one looks like a great choice, especially if you are patient and wait for a sale.   I would go with a charcoal suit, but that's just, like, my opinion man.      As someone who also has broad shoulders and thin everything else, I would have some caution with Uniqlo's OCBDs. I found that even their slim fits were too billowy at the waist when I fit the shoulders right. Great quality, but their cut left a lot to be desired.   I have found that J. Crew OCBDs fit me absolutely perfectly everywhere. If you can afford them, I would definitely consider them if you find that Uniqlo's don't fit you quite right.    I have the same issue, and I have found that American Eagle shirts are great. Very comfortable around the shoulders and sit perfectly at the waist. Their v-necks are my go-to shirts.   For dress shirts, you pretty much have to tailor.

He did say in the Foreword:  The country in which I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was ten, in days when motor-cars were rare objects (I had never seen one) and men were still building suburban railways.  Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last decrepitude of the once thriving corn-mill beside its pool that long ago seemed to me so important.  I never liked the looks of the Young miller, but his father, the Old miller, had a black beard, and he was not named Sandyman.   [Gravestone _](http://i.imgur.com/Lu8GepE.jpg)   Well I guess it comes down to where we define boundaries in a world of spectrums. Which seems somewhat arbitrary. Lions and tigers can produce viable offspring, and you know the others. There seems to be similar issues between the categorisation and cllassification of anmals and planets. We grow up with a black and white understanding, but it's all really rather grey.

Well there's this:  But in a win for iiNet and the other Australian ISPs, Justice Perram ordered that any letters sent to alleged illicit pirates must first be seen by him. He said this would "prevent speculative invoicing", which under Australian may not be lawful. ([source](http://www.smh.com.au/digital-life/digital-life-news/dallas-buyers-club-slays-iinet-in-landmark-piracy-case-20150407-1mey38.html))   Here's what one law firm has to say about it ([link here](http://www.iplawwatch.com/2014/11/downloaded-dallas-buyers-club-the-bill-is-in-the-mail/)):  "While speculative invoicing or pay-now-or-else letters are common in the United States, it has rarely been seen in Australia.  Such letters are often pro forma documents that rely on foreign copyright principles and possibly mischaracterise rights and remedies available under Australian law. For example, some speculative invoicing letters we have encountered commonly demand payment of an unauthorised use licence fee far in excess of the licence fee that would have been payable had the content been reproduced lawfully. Under Australian copyright law, damages for infringement are compensatory and not punitive in nature. In the context of unauthorised reproduction of a film, damages are likely to be calculated by reference to lost royalty the copyright owner would have received for the infringing copy had it been licensed. While exemplary or additional damages are available, these are discretionary and would be unlikely to be awarded where the alleged infringement was made for the sole purpose of private or domestic viewing only."      [yey!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Np0mNstndxU)   http://i.imgur.com/himZD0M.gif   Highlight column, hit Ctrl+Shift+#.   I don't even like almonds..    Put 'How do you possibly expect me to remember?!'   In a letter in which Tolkien first named Alatar and Pallando, also called Morinehtar and Rmestmo, he wrote concerning them:  I think they went as emissaries to distant regions, East and South, far out of Numenorean range: missionaries to enemy-occupied lands, as it were. What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.  However, in The Peoples of Middle Earth, written by Tolkien in the last years of his life, he said that the Blue Wizards had succeeded in turning the tides of conflict in the East during the Second and Third Ages. Whether this is a revision of what he previously wrote, or whether they were initially successful and then fell, is not known.  The quote from The Peoples of Middle Earth is as follows:  The other two are only known to (have) exist(ed) [sic] by Saruman, Gandalf, and Radagast, and Saruman in his wrath mentioning five was letting out a piece of private information.  The 'other two' came much earlier, at the same time probably as Glorfindel, when matters became very dangerous in the Second Age. Glorfindel was sent to aid Elrond and was (though not yet said) pre-eminent in the war in Eriador. But the other two Istari were sent for a different purpose. Morinehtar and Rmestmo.

Do you have any plans to spread internationally, because my country could really do with what you say you offer.   Legit.    Means nothing if he can't get fast track (which looks doubtful), and enough popular anger becomes apparent. Don't give up, the only way it is sure to pass is if everyone believes it cannot be stopped (or more likely doesn't know about it and how it's likely to affect so much of everything). That said, I'll be going down in flames trying in my country to ensure it isn't ratified if it gets the initial nod. Educate the voting public. This is by far the worst we've seen in recent yearsm which is impressive because we've seen a shit ton. This basically enshrines the rights of corporations in international law superceding national law. Yes it may bolster the US economy in a changing world, but to the detriment of us all. I never in my wildest nightmares envisioned President Obama envisioning this as crown jewels in his legacy. There is scope certainly for sections of it, but everything we see when it gets leaked is so flawed. The participants in drafting it are not representative of the populations it affects, they are by and large corporate interests. This is not a platform we want to enshrine in international law. So get mad now, or regret later.   Mass contacting via tools such as those listed above is precisely how CISPA, SOPA/PIPA, ACTA, TAFTA to name a few were stymied. It truly is the most effective way to make a difference, contact your representative and make your opinion clear. Most of them don't even read the damn legislation, too busy fundraising for reelection. Fair enough, they like their jobs. But whilst they rely on donors to fund their prospects, their fate is in the hands of you the people. According to staffers and interns who have commented on this in these threads, they do pay a lot of attention to numbers of constituents who actually chime in on particular issues, because they do not usually get that much traffic, so when they receive an avalanche of angry calls they extrapolate from that to the voting population and pay attention. And whether it passes does not depend on Obama, but on the votes in Congress. Yes, we can kick it's ass, with online participation. There is strength immeasurable in collective action. Apathy and the false impression of powerlessness kills it. There is already considerable disgruntlement with it amongst progressives and libertarians.

[Wiki article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bored_of_the_Rings) for background.   In a letter written during the writing of The Unfinished Tales, in which Tolkien first named Alatar and Pallando, also called Morinehtar and Rmestmo, he wrote concerning them:  I think they went as emissaries to distant regions, East and South, far out of Numenorean range: missionaries to enemy-occupied lands, as it were. What success they had I do not know; but I fear that they failed, as Saruman did, though doubtless in different ways; and I suspect they were founders or beginners of secret cults and 'magic' traditions that outlasted the fall of Sauron.  However, in The Peoples of Middle Earth, written by Tolkien in the last years of his life, he said that the Blue Wizards had succeeded in turning the tides of conflict in the East during the Second and Third Ages. Whether this is a revision of what he previously wrote, or whether they were initially successful and then fell, is not known.  The quote from The Peoples of Middle Earth is as follows:  The other two are only known to (have) exist(ed) [sic] by Saruman, Gandalf, and Radagast, and Saruman in his wrath mentioning five was letting out a piece of private information.  The 'other two' came much earlier, at the same time probably as Glorfindel, when matters became very dangerous in the Second Age. Glorfindel was sent to aid Elrond and was (though not yet said) pre-eminent in the war in Eriador. But the other two Istari were sent for a different purpose. Morinehtar and Rmestmo. Darkness-slayer and East-helper. Their task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of Men that had rebelled from Melkor-worship, to stir up rebellion ... and after his first fall to search out his hiding (in which they failed) and to cause [? dissension and disarray] among the dark East ... They must have had very great influence on the history of the Second Age and Third Age in weakening and disarraying the forces of East ... who would both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have ... outnumbered the West.   http://i.imgur.com/hsrlD.gif      Decent political representation for the country?

(And hey, it's only $10 for each charger, compared to $75 for each new cable, so, that works.)   Hi all. I apologize in advance if this is a dumb question. I have a 17" MacBook Pro from early 2011 that is dying. Sadly, it's out of warranty now and the logic board is going. A $350-500 repair did not seem to make sense, so I bought a 15" MacBook Pro that should be arriving early next week.  I'll still have my power adapters for my 17" MBP that I was planning on using with the new one as my travel power cord (lives in backpack) and my alternate location power cord. BUT-I was in the Apple Store the other day and saw a box for a Magsafe to Magsafe 2 adapter, and the picture in the back looks like the power cords I have currently (no pun intended!). I asked the salesperson if I'd need these to use my old power cords with the new MBP, he looked at me blankly, went off to ask someone else, and told me no, I wouldn't, but I'm a little hesitant to trust his answer.  Thoughts? (And thanks!)   I wouldn't necessarily rely on your home insurance. Not only is it a 1k deductible, but a claim could lead to your insurance getting canceled. You might want to ask your insurance company if you can get a personal article policy. That might be what you already asked about and were told was only for camera gear? I have one through State Farm for about $70 a year.   I'm afraid I don't recall if its possible to focus on more than one, I think it is? But one does it based on course selections...   You can focus in areas like international relations, political thought and theory/public law (my area), American politics, Comparative politics, and political analysis.

They knew that there was a big demand (no pun intended) for a 5.5" screen, but that for a sizable portion of their would-be buyers, that was too much. 2 phones means both markets are satisfied.   The WSJ and NYT articles this piece links to are worthwhile reads too.   Relevant as evidence, maybe. Probable cause or even reasonable suspicion? No.   I'd point to some of the oral argument in Wurie last term as an example of the Supreme Court being incredibly out of touch with technology and the real world. Chief Justice Roberts made it clear he thought having multiple cell phones was a sign of being a drug dealer, and Scalia's quip supported that notion. (page 49 of http://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/13-212_86qd.pdf )  Which I suppose means that every Big Law and government lawyer I know with a work cell phone and a personal cell phone are suspicious in Roberts's and Scalia's eyes.   Annelise Orleck is teaching History 19: US Political History 20th Century this Fall. I found her classes to be pretty easy, but very interesting. She's a great lecturer!   There are a lot of people in this thread castigating the sheriff for his mistake. I suggest that before you call the sherif a murderer or evil or cruel, etc., please read Gene Weingarten's piece from 2009 on parents who forgot their children in hot cars. It's not a black and white issue of good and evilthe importance of a human or canine life does not make our brains any better at remembering their location or condition than it does the keys, phones, and wallets that people lose on a daily basis. The tragedy of these situations shouldn't be compounded by criminal charges in instances where it was a genuine, awful but genuine, mistake.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/fatal-distraction-forgetting-a-child-in-thebackseat-of-a-car-is-a-horrifying-mistake-is-it-a-crime/2014/06/16/8ae0fe3a-f580-11e3-a3a5-42be35962a52_story.html   No, it's a reasonable question. If a smartphone or watch ("device") is tied to the same account as a smartcard, it would be possible to use a device to enter/exit the station that is part of the pilot, and use one's smartcard to enter/exit at stations that are not. This would expand the usefulness of the test program.  If, on the other hand, payment via device is treated as a new, separate account, the way a separate smartrip card would be, that's unhelpful to most of us.   I didn't botch the title-they changed the headline!   OP isn't the white hat. This seems like a law school hypothetical: spot the potential civil actions and criminal charges. Civilly, there's potential defamation, tortious interference with contract/tortious interference with business relationship, fraud, and civil cause of action under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). Criminally, there's the CFAA and fraud.   Ack. Thanks!         *gasps* Really? I really like the Veggie Patch, and have never seen any of their stuff at the Costco I go to in Virginia.

Do these tracking systems apply to both GSM and CDMA phones, or only GSM?   This.....is not true. The exact specifics differ from state to state, but generally, defamation (of which slander and libel are subparts) is a untruth about another person which harms the defamed person's reputation.  Actual malice is only generally required if a person is a public figure. A supermarket manager is not.  The question isn't whether OP could sue for defamation. He could. The questions are a: whether he could prove it (probably); and b: whether there was any actual harm to his reputation to the point that he could recover enough $ to make it worth his while. That's a question for a local attorney familiar with the laws of his state, should he choose to pursue it.   Horse pucky. The FAA case didn't involve some nebulous concept of "guidelines"it involved the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), a federal statute that applies to the actions of agencies if there is no other statute controlling. It's essentially the default if no special procedures, forms, hearings, etc. are laid out in an agency-specific statute. And it is entirely a federal statuteit has no direct bearing on state administrative agencies.  New York has its own statute, the State Administrative Procedure Act. It certainly embodies many of the concepts of the federal APA, but it is by no means a mirror. (See Bonfield, Arthur Earl, "The Federal APA and State Administrative Law," 72 Va. L. Rev. 297 (March, 1986)).   Wayne Brady talks about this during his interview with Aisha Tyler on her podcast Girl on Guy: http://girlonguy.net/podcast/girl-on-guy-45-wayne-brady/   Depends on the state... In some states, the existence of a complaint is in public, and in some, the proceedings themselves are public.   Perhaps this is naive of me, but how haven't there been announcements of bar discipline yet? At this point several Federal judges have referred Prenda Law lawyers to the disciplinary bodies, and there seems to be an allegation that Steele commingled his personal funds in his IOLTA account. Shouldn't disbarment proceedings be well under way?   This is not the right subreddit for what you are looking for. This is a relatively small subreddit for legal education, not for legal advice.

Power strips are cheap enough that there's really no reason not to have one. Worst case scenario, you'll have something on hand if a couple of friends visit campus, crash in your room, and need a place to charge gadgets.   As Breez_E said, every house is different. Some houses are very alcohol focused. A few are drug focused. Some revolve around a sport. Some are LGBQT friendly. There are the coed houses. Some are rumored to haze, others stay far away from anything like that.  For the most part, you don't need to join a house to go to its parties.  People have given good advice in this thread. The things I'll add are: (1) Half of people at Dartmouth don't rush, and there is still plenty of things for them to do. You can still go to parties, as I said, the Hop brings plenty of amazing performers to campus at a student price that makes alum cry when they pay to see the same performers in the real world, there are a thousand clubs, intramural sports, the DOC, etc. (2) One benefit of joining a house is that it's a way of staying connected to campus. When you visit, you'll have a place to go with people you can connect with, even if you graduated years and years ago.   In high school, I took Algebra I as a freshman, Geometry as a sophomore, and Algebra II as a junior. Then, senior year, I took extra history electives.  Never took precalc. Never took calc.

As someone relatively new to Virginia, can I ask for a fuller explanation of the Commonwealth's unique City/County arrangement, or a link to a good explanation of it? :)   I'd say that's an incomplete list. One can be jailed for not paying court costs, including private probation companies' fees, a situation that many have called the new debtors' prisons. See https://www.aclu.org/blog/criminal-law-reform-racial-justice/court-sanctioned-extortion-private-probation-companies , for example. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/14/opinion/return-of-debtors-prisons.html too.   Assuming I live in Virginia and on my way home from work, I purchase a good in MarylandI'd be paying Maryland sales tax. Being a resident of Virginia, I'm not represented at all in Maryland. Do you believe it is wrong for me to be taxed by a government I have absolutely no ability to persuade how much sales tax it decides to charge?  The internet versus brick and mortar doesn't make the answer any different. And the Constitution doesn't enter into either of our scenariosthere's not a single line in the text or any case law that would support the argument you made about constitutionality.   Amazon already doesAmazon collects sales tax in the states where it has a physical presence: Arizona, California, Georgia, Kansas, Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Texas, Virginia, Washington, and West Virginia.   I don't believe it would be as apocalyptic as you portray. Technology makes filing taxes a heck of a lot easier than it used to be. Businesses, some run by millennials, would develop software that would make compliance workable.  But if your argument is based on compliance costs, that's the argument you should have made. Instead, on the radio and on your website, you relied on a bogus claim that the act would be unconstitutional. I like to think millennials value truth as much as we value cheap shit online, and your argument was just buzzwords thrown together. *edited to fix spelling of one word   Sorry, but the arguments here were absurd. GenOpp keeps using the word unconstitutional, and it does not mean what they think it means. There is nothing unconstitutional about the Internet Sales Tax. A: It's not taxation without representationother than the people in D.C., we have representatives in Congress that are the folks trying to pass the bill! B: There is absolutely nothing in the Constitution prohibiting taxation without representation, otherwise people in the District of Columbia would be exempt from paying federal taxes.  As was pointed out in the clip but seemingly ignored, this isn't a new taxit's an enforcement mechanism. People are supposed to be paying taxes on internet purchases, but nobody does. An internet sales tax does not create a new tax, it just requires people to actually pay what they were supposed to in the first place.  This isn't about fairness. This isn't about technology. As the guest and host admit halfway through, this is about Republicans wanting to do what they always docut or eliminate taxes. Trying to approach it from the angle of protecting the internet marketplace is just transparent pandering towards young people.   It's a sweet thought, but there is no one law magazine that would be helpful/good/popular. Since the laws of each state are different, there are different law magazines/newspapers for each one.   I'd think the Morse v. Frederick case might be controlling, along with Hazelwood v. Kuhlmeier.   His counterpart, Rob Paulsen, was Pinky and Yakko Warner on Animaniacs, Snow Job and Tripwire on G.I. Joe, Gladstone Gander on DuckTales, Gusto Gummi on Gummi Bears, Steelbeak on Darkwing Duck, Pete on Goof Troop, Hadji on Johnny Quest, Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey's character) on the animated version of The Mask, Raphael on the original animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Donatello on the reboot, Throttle on Biker Mice from Mars, Arthur on the animated version of The Tick, Major Glory on Dexter's Lab and on Powerpuff Girls, Carl Wheezer on Jimmy Neutron, and Toodles on the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse.   Maurice LaMarche was Chief Quimby on Inspector Gadget (but does an amazing Don Adams/Inspector Gadget impression-it was on the Super Mario Bros. Show), George Wilson in the animated Dennis the Menace (and did the voice of Ruff the dog too), the voice of Egon on The Real Ghostbusters, Destro on G.I. Joe, Zoltan on the animated Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, he's the voice of Dizzy Devil, he did several voices for Captain Planet including Duke Nukem and Verminous Skumm, he took over Yosemite Sam from Mel Blanc, he's done Pepe Le Pew, he was Pasha on Jonny Quest, he's Foghorn Leghorn, he was the voice of the garbageman on the animated Dilbert, he was Mortimer Mouse on House of Mouse, he was Dr. Freeze in the Batman: Arkham City game, Dr. Doom on the Ultimate Spider Man, Kif Kroker and Morbo on Futurama, and a little-known character from Animaniacs named the Brain.   That's absurd. Argentina made a choice to set NY as the place with jurisdiction to hear disputes over its bonds because doing so gave it lower interest rates. Doing so waived any claims of sovereign immunityArgentina made the choice to accept US jurisdiction and it received a benefit at the time for doing so.      I find it to work well. Unlike cabs when I've found them to often not show up (and at best, the dispatcher will give you a time range of 10-30 minutes for someone to show up), the Uber app shows exactly where your driver is and gives an ETA as to how long it will take your driver to arrive.      Call Cannon Upholstery in Bethesdathey pickup and deliver for a reasonable fee.  http://www.cannonupholstery.com  They reupholstered my couch (handed down from my grandparents, so it was important to me), reupholstered my wing chair, and they've fixed some of my kitchen chairs. David and Evelyn are really, really nice people and they'll do right by you.   Yes-Ebola carries a 50-90% mortality rate, but this treatment has not been proven effective. Nothing has been proven. Those two relief workers were the very first human beings to ever receive the drug.  It certainly cannot be said that this drug could have been provided to anyone else sooner.  Nor is it appropriate to start sending this out to Africa en masse now. Two people are doing better on this new, untested drug. (Two people is not a test.) We have no idea what factors led to it working and might lead to it killing or causing long term effect. We have no idea if it works differently on the young versus old, white versus black (primaquine is an example of a drug that works differently on certain races), weight, diet, medical histories and conditions, all can cause drugs to impact populations differently.  There may be a point before final FDA of a drug where it is nevertheless appropriate to supply it to those in need. This serum is nowhere near that stage.   When searching Reddit to ensure it hadn't been posted anywhere, I saw this thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/jlkk6/governor_rick_perry_refused_cameron_todd/) on /r/politics from two years ago that got a lot of comments, so I assumed that this new article would make for a good followup. Since the rules require the title to come from the article, I couldn't explicitly say as much, but I figured it would be okay.   Sounds really good! :-)   The already horrifying case of Cameron Todd Willingham, who many believe was wrongfully executed in Texas in 2004, has gotten worse.   Previously, the forensic "evidence" against Willingham was shown to be complete and utter bunkthe arson investigators' testimony was riddled with supposedly scientific testimony that turned out to be utterly untrue when tested.  Now, there may be evidence that the jailhouse informer who testified against Willingham received leniency for his testimony, and that Texas prosecutors conspired to conceal this leniency (and in court, denied there were any deals).  I may not be able to say 100% that Willingham was innocent, but I can say that he was railroaded in a rigged trial. His execution was a travesty of justice.      2 years sounds light for assaulting a faire employee, tbh.   Good value at the theater and the people working there are really nice. It's a good kickstarter if any of you have the extra scratch to give.   Slightly ridiculous, sure! Ignorant, certainly. Racist? I don't see it. Through movies, novels, etc., ebola has been portrayed as an ultra contagious disease, and West Africa is experiencing one of the worst ebola outbreaks ever. It's ignorant for people to be concerned about being exposed to ebola from this summit (ebola is highly infectious-it takes a tiny amount to infect someone-but it is not highly contagious because it generally does not infect anyone through the air), but I don't think people are saying "eek-black people!", I think they're saying "eek-there's an uncontrolled ebola outbreak in West Africa!"   An excellent question, and for Colorado, I don't know. As a theoretical matter (removing it from the sphere of jurisdictional-specific case law), I could see a potential case against both. The facility for failing to notify its employees and the police for failing to ensure participants were aware this might occur. (The odds of an unknowing person being affected by this drill seem higheven if the home warned its nurses, what about delivery people? Patients' families? Other visitors? This points to possible recklessness on the part of the police.)   You'd be right in some jurisdictions, but I believe in Colorado, it is enough for the act itself to be intentional with reckless disregard for the emotional health of the affected individual(s).  Depending on what the nursing home and the police agency involved knew and disclosed to the appropriate people, it is possible that either or both could be liable.   Sounds like it could potentially give rise to a lawsuit for intentional infliction of emotional distress. (1) The conduct seems sufficient to cause emotional harm in the average person; and (2) If the nurse was not given notice that this sort of drill was occurring or might occur, it would seem to be reckless disregard of the emotional harm such a drill could cause.   (Standard disclaimer: Not a Colorado-licensed attorney, not your attorney, not giving legal advice, etc.)   Good grief...In some jurisdictions, this situation would make a nice test question about negligent infliction of emotional distress.   It's a chicken and egg problem. DC isn't as transit-dependent as NYC because DC's transit is not as dependable as NYC. Metro is a commuter rail system because weekend service sucks. If trains were 10 minutes apart instead of 20 minutes apart, you'd see a lot more people choosing Metro over driving or taking a cab.   Thanks! :-) It's not a combination I'd have come up with on my own, but it sounds good!   Cement? As in the stuff that Hamas is using for its tunnels instead of using to build housing, hospitals, schools, etc.?   Welcome to the family, MurderingOcelot. As doublesecretprobatn said, the River is far and low on amenities compared to some other dorms, but it tends to be more social than some of the other dorms too.  When you pick your classes, don't forget to factor travel time from your dorm. It's about a fifteen minute walk from the River Cluster to the Life Sciences Center on the opposite end of campus. If you're not a science major, you might want to think about taking a 9AM bio class your sophomore year instead.   Except in this case, it hasn't worked out too well.   Executive Orders aren't binding on the Executive, just subordinates. If the Executive gives new instructions that are in conflict with a prior Executive Order, the new instructions hold.  Think of it as a New Years resolution. It's all well and good to make a resolution that you aren't going to have fried food and dessert in the same meal, but when you're at the Cheesecake Factory ordering fried mac and cheese and the Dutch Apple Caramel Streusel cheesecake, you're going to get what you ordered.   Israel allows fuel, water, medicine, etc. to go to Gaza. The one thing they do ban is concrete/cement, on the grounds that it would be diverted for terrorist purposes like tunnels.  Given the elaborate tunnel network that Hamas put in place even with the restrictions, Israel was right. And note that Hamas is in control of the Gaza stripthey made the choice to use what cement they did have to build terror tunnels instead of infrastructure.   Israel's blockade? A: If anything, it's Israel's and EGYPT's blockade.   B: Is there any doubt that if there was a naval and air blockade on Gaza, Hamas, Fatah, and other assorted groups would have sent terrorists by sea to blow up civilians. and flown planes into buildings?  C: As far as controlling who and what goes in and out of Gaza by land on the Israeli/Gaza border, that's not a blockade! It's a right of any sovereign nation to determine who and what goes through it. Does controlling the Israel/Gaza border lock in the people of Gaza? Absolutely. But it's not an illegal blockade, it's geography. Even the 1948 borders didn't have Gaza and the West Bank coming close to intersecting (didn't matter then because Gaza was part of Egypt and the West Bank was part of Jordan, but nobody seems to think of that as an occupation).   How much of each item do you put in those smoothies, /u/baked_potato_ ?   Preponderance of the evidence is more probable than nota greater than 50% chance of the claim asserted being true. This is the standard of proof required in most civil cases.  Clear and convincing evidence is between preponderance of the evidence and beyond a reasonable doubt. It's a term of art to be sure, but generally requires a greater degree of certainty but total certainty in the claim asserted.   Only Zuul.   I'm not challenging you or being contrarian, but I'm curious why you think there isn't a government shutdown threat this year? It's almost the end of July, Congress takes off August, there's still no deal on a budget or a continuing resolution yet, and as you said, Sept. 30th is the deadline.  I find it hard to imagine either party allowing a government shutdown to happy so close to the midterm elections, but I also have a hard time imaging the parties coming together on a budget deal without strife.   Frustrating seeing the Youtube comments saying that pedestrians shouldn't be on the "cycle-path". That's no different from jerks arguing that bikes shouldn't be allowed on the road. It's not a "cycle-path"it's a mixed use trail!   This...seems strange. How would a fake driver know where to go? Moreover, the app tells me the name and license plate of the assigned driver so I can find the right car.   Down near Pentagon City. :/ I tried calling, and was told by the automated system that the wait time was over an hour, so I figured that there was either a widespread outage or Verzon's customer service staffing was abysmal. Could be both, I suppose.   It was a replica. Who cares?   On the first day of my BarBri classes, the instructor told us that every point we got above passing was time we should have spent pursuing outside interests, pursuing outside people, or at the beach. While I'm not quite as cavalier about it as him, the general point stands.   The bar exam is incredibly important, it's hard, but it's pass/fail and you're a smart cookie to have gotten as far as you have. Do the preparation, don't freak out if you come across an essay question where you don't know the answer (take a deep breath and think like a lawyer), and you should be fine.   I use pasta to thicken soups. You can use a smaller pasta, like ditalini, if you don't want it to distract from the main ingredients of your soup or stew.   A genocide in which the population has grown every year?   You're rightIsrael does not have the worst equipment ever. So why is the death toll as small as it is? The Gaza Strip is a tiny slice of land and Israel has powerful weaponry. If Israel treated Gaza the way Russia leveled Grozny in 1999/2000, they wipe Gaza off the map in less than 12 hours.  Destroying everything is easy if you are willing to commit the sort of massacre that people are rightly condemning Moshe Feiglin for suggesting. Either Israel is not deliberately engaging in an extermination campaign against civilians or they have the worst equipment ever, and we agree that they do not have the worst equipment ever.  Avoiding civilian casualties is hard, regardless of the quality of one's military might. Bad intelligence, an 18-y-o kid at the weapons controls with an itchy trigger finger, or just the dense nature of the Gaza Strip, there are lots of factors that can lead to civilian deaths. Every military conflict has had tragic errors similar to the kids on the beach. (The wedding party the US blew up in Yemen in February comes to mind.)   Did you put on blackface and do a minstrel show dance while typing that racist drivel?   Israel controls the land border because it borders with Israelno country is required to allow people from another state or territory to enter their own. (And Egypt controls the border between Egypt and Gaza, so why is Israel seen as occupying Gaza but not Egypt?) Israel controls the sea and air space because nobody serious disputes that if opened, it would be used for terrorist attacks against Israeli civilians, akin to 9/11 (air attack) or the Hamas frogmen (sea attack) that attempted an attack earlier this week.  The biggest thing that isolates Gaza is geography, not a discriminatory Israeli policy.   Looks like Hannibal Smith (from the A-Team) in one of the disguises he used to investigate potential clients.    I agree with almost everything you said, /u/Ice_Clown. My one addition would be to suggest offering to write a generic letter of recommendation now AND write tailored letters of recommendation upon request later. People in government positions sometimes move around and in two years when OP's intern wants a recommendation for OCI or other positions, she may not be able to find OP.   Very nicely done! :-)   In Bethesda just over the MD/DC border, the folks at Westbard Citgo II are fantastic. It's at 5335 Westbard Avenue. They're very honest and conservative (repair-wise, I mean, not politically)-they won't tell you to replace something unless it really needs it.   Lawyer2Lawyer has been really good. http://legaltalknetwork.com/podcasts/lawyer-2-lawyer/   Heh. About six months after turning 21, I went to a NH restaurant and asked for a cocktail. The waitress looked at my ID, went off for a manager, and I was told that I could not get alcohol. Why? Because my ID said under 21 until XX/XX/XX. Even though it was after that date, because it said "under 21", they wouldn't serve me.   At the risk of sounding disrespectful, it seems as though you're missing the point. There is no need to justify a termination in Virginia. So long as the termination isn't for a prohibited reason, and "retaliation for questioning the 'eyes of the law'" is not a prohibited reason, employees can be fired for any or no reason. Someone can be fired because their new manager doesn't like redheads. Or because he doesn't like names starting with the letter M. Or for no reason at all.  Since my prior post has been down voted a bit, let me note that I'm not defending the decision to fire him, nor am I happy with the at-will doctrine. I find the lack of basic protections for employees abhorrent. But it is what it is (as so many things are). It's not something that's going to be changed based on a court challenge-it would require a legislative change. I'd support such a change. But until then, his performance, whether he's had any disciplinary or corrective action, or how long he's been with the company, all of that doesn't matter. Target could fire him at any time and they chose to do so.   *nods* :-) Crystal City has the benefit of more restaurants (some really delicious ones), being able to get around underground to avoid the elements, wider bar options, the Synaptic Theater, etc.  Pentagon City has the benefit of more outdoor space (including the soccer field/baseball field and public park), the mall (which can be good for shopping, getting electronics repaired, etc. but bad in that it often has gaggles of roaming middle and high school student grounds), and Harris Teeter in walking distance.   I'm in RiverHouse, and I think it would probably suit your needs, /u/Smitty2k1.   Same story as one posted in /r/music two months ago, just with Neil Young swapped in for the Stones.  To quote what I said in the previous thread, "[Roger] Waters has repeatedly played in China and Russia. He played in Venezuela while Hugo Chavez was in power...I agree that Israel, like any country, does things one might criticize, and that criticizing Israel is not a sign of anti-semitism. If one only criticizes Israel, anti-semitism may become a reasonable inference.  Russia's genocidal policies towards the Chechens eclipsed anything Israel has done towards Palestinians [*coughs* Grozny *coughs*], and yet Roger Waters voiced no criticism of them and indeed, continues to perform in Russia. (Not to mention Russian persecution of homosexuals, current actions towards the Ukraine, the invasion of Georgia, the murder of journalists (such as Anna Politkovskaya, Anastasia Baburova, and Stanislav Markelov), etc.)   China's human rights violations are of such a scale, it is difficult to choose a place to begin. Given that Waters has invoked apartheid in his criticism of Israel, however, perhaps a good starting point is China's discrimination towards it rural workers as part of the hukou system. Many have described the hukou system as apartheid (see http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4424944.stm , for example). China's actions towards Tibet could be said to be analogous to apartheid. And yet Waters voices no criticism of China. And Roger Waters performs in China."  http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/24m8b9/pink_floyd_asking_rolling_stones_not_to_play_in/ch8t9jc   Hydrox cookies. I know, I know, it's a terrible name for a food product but they were absolutely delicious. By the 90s, most consumers thought they were imitation Oreos, but in fact, Sunshine Biscuits first sold Hydrox in 1908. After seeing the Hydrox's success, the National Biscuit company (now Nabisco) came out with a knockoff version in 1912: Oreos.   What made Hydrox superior to Oreos was the cookie element. Hydrox had a harder cookie  not break-a-tooth-tough, but sufficiently stiffer that Oreos seem mushy in comparison.   A case for what, exactly? I'm not sure why /u/MostlyBullshitStory has been downvotedthey are right. It sucks, sure, but Virginia is an at-will state, so employees can be fired at any time for any reason, or even for no reason. The exceptions are that federal law protects people from being fired due to age, race, religion, gender, national origin, or disability, and a Virginia statute protects people form being fired for filing a safety or health complaint. (Shoplifting is not considered a safety or health complaint.)  It does not matter if the employee has being doing something for 8 years without issue-the employee can be fired at any time so long as it doesn't fall into one of the exceptions above.  For more information, see: http://www.doli.virginia.gov/laborlaw/laborlaw_faqs.html   *rueful look* The Chipotles around here are SO busy, there's usually not time for a question. :P   Is it too personal a question for me to ask how high your temperature was? (I was running around 103.0 two months ago and felt utterly horrid. If it went up any higher, I would have gone to the ER, but thankfully, the OTC meds FINALLY kicked in and brought it down...)   Cool-thanks so much!   Cool-thanks! :-)   Thanks! And just to confirm, both black and pinto are vegetarian?   My understanding is that if it's scud, it's not rotating, and if it's rotating, it's a funnel cloud. How can people be so confident it was scud based on a photograph? As OP said, Boston was under a tornado warning, so, it's not exactly implausible that there was rotation.  EDIT: (I should note that I'm not trying to make an argument that it is a funnel cloudthis is me genuinely asking the question, not knowing the answer.)   As a non-meat eater, I like Chipotle's sofritas bowls. BUT. I always get them without beans because I know at one point, there was a kerfuffle about some of the beans being cooked with pork. Do all of the beans contain pork? If not, which ones are safe?   The Celtic band Gaelic Storm would say that he has "alligator arms"his arms are too short and his pockets too deep. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vYMF5N_TVyY   It's wage theft and morally equivalent to employees shoplifting.  You should contact an employment lawyer in your area. A consultation should be free and does not commit you to an action, it just ensures you are fully aware of your rights and options.   I wonder if Cooley will be refunding the application fees of the incoming 1L class that is being dropped.  EDIT: Huh. Never mind-Cooley doesn't have application fees.     	110
    I just saw this last weekend for the first time. I loved it!   Exit Through the Gift Shop   Unclear why this is in personal finance.  It's hard to give you advice without understanding the gravity of what you have done. Let's say you were snooping around the internal systems and deleted a bunch of critical files that could create significant financial issues for the company. What should you do then?  My take - come clean. Tell them how you stumbled on those files and the mistake you made, and the ramifications. Offer to help rectify the situation. Offer to make it up to them financially by working hard.   They might fire you. If what you did was of the sort that I suggested, then they should reassess their internal policies and security. They might be glad that you came forward and just reprimand you.  I think you will be glad you came forward and came clean. Assuming what you did was not a criminal act, but the mistake of someone with little work experience, then it's not the end of the world. Find someone you trust at this work place to be a reference, and start applying for other jobs.   Leaving without owning up doesn't help them, and doesn't help you (unless what you did was criminal).   Good luck.    I did 5 years of long distance across 2 continents. I then moved in with her 5 years ago and married her 2 years ago, and feel like the luckiest guy ever.   3 pieces of advice: 1. Use every piece of communication available. We used text message, FaceTime, Skype, email, written mail, Facebook pokes, everything...if we could send smoke signals, we would have.   2. Have a routine to talk to each other every day and make an effort to be available.  3. Depending on where you are, traveling to see each other can get expensive, so plan in advance, and try and make the visits equitable.  Good luck!            Keep it simple. Rent / borrow a projector and a good sound system, invite all the fun people you know - have a movie marathon, or a board game night - or both. Host a giant pajama party   You could:  1. Cook an elaborate meal without people getting in the way / asking you what you are making, etc.  2. Host your own "The Real World" reality TV show and put it up on YouTube, and try and become an internet sensation  3. Spin on 2 - use it to make your own music video  - or MTV cribs episode  4. Make a haunted mansion, charge folks admission - make some dough  5. Start your own pop-up store. Try the idea out with your free real estate, if it works - you know what you can do over summer  6. Epic game of laser tag  7. List the place. Have an open house. As potential buyers inappropriate questions.  8. Get pets!!        Has to be the Trojans losing. People are still talking about it 1000s of years later.                In my awful bachelor apartment which I shared with 2 other guys.          Santa Claus.   But seriously - history is the biggest lie I've ever been told cuz we are told it over and over again. When I read "People's History of the United States", I was blown away. I don't think that Howard Zinn's version of history is necessarily right, but the idea that there is a single narrative that explains how we got here is definitely wrong, and everything I learned and believed in was based on a homogeneous narrative. So history is the biggest lie I've been told.       I just went ahead, bought another apartment and another car. Have TWC at home but got Fios there - you can't be too careful. My fapping routine involves changing into my fap  clothes, driving my fab-mobile, to my fap-apartment, firing up my new modem, watching it on my fap-puter, taking a shower, and then heading back to the wife. You just can't be too careful with these things. If I get caught, it could be so embarrassing.    I would generally disclose a range where the low end of the range is where you would settle for a job, and the high end is potentially 10-20% above that. Don't disclose your current salary unless you trust that headhunter or staffing agency, but giving a range of what you would move for (which would be typically higher than your current comp) is normal.  To other questions - I would be generally honest, with a grain of salt. If you are really unhappy at your current workplace, don't bitch to the headhunter. Be somewhat candid at your reasons for looking for a new job and the type of job you are looking for, but don't say anything that if it came back to your current employer would leave you mortified.     This was the original flash sales site and was always so much fun. The site still exists but its just not the same any more. Ever since Amazon bought it, there is no witty writing, no punchline, nothing. No bags of crap. I know those guys started another site that is similar to woot, but its not the same. I miss woot.       I used to be on the West Coast and now am on the East Coast for many years. Shake Shack is not an in-an-out equivalent. Its a much higher end product at a much higher end cost. Agree with you that its much better than Five Guys but In-n-out is much more "for the people". Also Shake Shack recently IPOd so its too early to say that it has the reputation of quality over money relative to In-n-Out.   Also In-n-Out has a secret menu that puts everyone else to shame.    In-n-Out is a good example of a company forgoing long term growth so they wouldn't compromise their product and user experience. There are other such examples - Basecamp / 37 signals from which Ruby on Rails came out of. Craigslist is another example where he could have sold for a massive amount but chose not to.  There is Quora that for years on end has run with no monetization and it is unclear if there will ever be monetization.   Finally - there are "B-corps". Benefit corps that are for-profit companies that are also specifically focused on sustainability and community values. These are companies like Easy, Warby Parker, and many others. I am not 100% sure that this doesn't end up mocked like Google's "don't be evil" clause, but the B-corp certification from B-Lab is fairly difficult and intense to get.        One of them would be the Russian commander during the Cuban missile crisis who prevented the launch of nuclear missiles and saved the world: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov  But part of me almost believes in the Psychohistorian approach proposed by Isaac Asimov in the Foundation series where historical figures are all actors in the evolution of the world. If they didn't exist, someone else would step into their place. Hitler the man was a catalyst in a country deeply impacted by WWI and with a deep racial divide. Gandhi was a leader who united a country but it only hastened the weakening of an already weakened colonial state.     Shakespeare developed art, and language almost single-handedly but his absence would have led people to read other great writers of that time and language would not be impacted, just different.    5 things go into any good cover letter: First para: A short 2 sentence about you and how you heard about this opportunity Second para: Why are you excited about this role Third para: Why your experiences in comedy are perfect for this job - you are both a writer but have standup experience so understand the delivery as well as comedic writing.

Keep it simple. I have never applied for a comedy job so I am guessing it might help to be funny, but have someone else (not you or your gf review it) so you are sure the humor travels and isn't misconstrued.  Good luck and get on that television!   Thanks for this. I was scared out of my mind when I had my first fender bender. It was a light one but it felt like a massive accident, the way the car shook and the whiplash.  The crazy, disorienting part was when we pulled over and the lady was shaken up and apologetic - someone came and offered her a phone number so she can call them as witness in case I tried to extort her for money. Granted my car was an old beat up one, but I was just so upset that I got rammed into and then I was made to feel like the person in the wrong.    Sure thing, and good luck. If helpful check out tapwage.com which has a lot of junior software / IT / MIS jobs at non-tech firms.  Feel free to ping me if you have any follow up questions      If you have an interest in pursuing MIS work as opposed to IT / software engineering work - then you are better off going to a non-technology company. So a bank, hospital, healthcare company or any other type of regular large company is your best bet. You will get a chance to learn about more than just software and systems and actually see processes. You could even go to the finance and reporting team at one of those companies  - since many such finance roles exist and that expands the potential scope of your career into data and analytics type roles. If your IT skills are primarily in Microsoft products as it seems to be, this is another indicator that you are better off applying to a large and medium sized non-tech firm than a tech firm.    Salary depends significantly on where you are based and what specific development experience you have. It sounds like you have  a number of skills but perhaps not a lot of dev experience. So unless you are in SF, LA, NY - chances are your salary range is on the lower end of the range you provided. In those cities, you can sort of expect a salary in the middle of that range but it really depends on your actual dev experience.   Finally - certifications again depend on where you want to take your career. If you see yourself in a IT / tech role at a non-tech company, Microsoft certifications can help get your foot in the door but not a lot of value beyond that. You are better of investing your time doing internships or projects that let you actually get dev experience.   	34
 bills FTFY   your eyes are so dreamy!      ops didnt realise this was posted already!   Oye paaji tussi great ho!   I think the typo is the main reason this post is getting up voted!

 I want to create a website and I would like to hire other web developers and designers to help make this website. Also the money will allow me to let local business's spend less money on the website for advertising. This opportunity helps not only other web developers/designers but the community as well.    gofundme.com/thistown   I need a simple drawing (preferably black and white) of a hellhound or Kerberos(hades hound). I need it for a logo. Doesn't need to be big. Thank you very much.   	2

 This. I'm straight, and I still ran around telling straight people the good news, because it's good news regardless of your orientation.   !RemindMe   OP pls deliver   Sun Tzu said that!

If you leave this alone, then it could have repercussions for your reputation. Talk to your parents, the principal, or if you don't trust either party, talk to a teacher you can trust. Edit: Spelling   I think OP is asking if you can calculate how much faster than c you would have to be moving. In a theoretical world where you can move FTL, what would the escape velocity *just inside* the event horizon be. e.g. 2*c   Tagged as Dick-Man   U   *Your balls are my balls, and my balls are your balls*   That's beautiful.

 The thing is...as far as the job search goes, it's not your responsibility to see if you're eligible, it's the company's. It doesn't matter what you think of your abilities. If you want the job, apply for it.  Then it's up to them to see if you're a good fit. For example, the entry level developer is a pretty broad position; they might have a particular position in a particular team in mind which requires a more analytic frame of mind which your EE degree would have kindly blessed you with.  So, go forth and be brave. Don't reject yourself. Let them reject you!   I just took that interview last month and got an offer...Will be glad to answer questions...though I can't deal with specifics of the questions since I signed an NDA.  It's an all-day coding project and you work with what seems to be a simplified version of a real-world problem. You can (and should!) ask questions of your teammates and the employees in the room with you. You can ask Google (I mean, the internet..you'll have access to internet) for help if you want... but basically don't hesitate to ask anyone questions.  The problem really tests your basic coding skills -- whether you can drill a problem down to what it requires, design a data structure for the problem and then use it well to solve it. The one-on-one is very relaxed as well and has to do with the problem itself and make sure you ask him all the questions you have about the work and work culture at Amazon at that interview!  It's a lot of fun and much less stressful than the process at other companies...Good luck!   And ask away if you have questions...   Nah, it's One two three One two One two three..  It's the same beat structure that Coldplay uses in Clocks.. much, much more going on here:)   I'm more familiar with an Indian Classical style of counting. So, it's a beat of 16 split up as 3-2-3-3-2-3 ... which works out to 4/4 really.  The (3-2) part is what sounds like 5/4   Thanks!  What are "affirmations"?   I do go to the gym (/r/Fitness to the rescue!) and am working on clothes and grooming step by step...  Great advice in the linked post!   This may be slightly weird... but whatever, I'm counting on anonymity, even though I'm not using a throwaway.  Here are the facts: I'm 29, only been in one relationship. The sex was bad. I was/am quite bad at it too.  The constraints: I am Asian (Indian) and will soon be under extreme pressure to get married.   So say I have two years left.   I've been reading seddit for a while now and have gone from complete AFC to slightly AFC. I can now talk to girls, #-close, but nothing further. I have cultural barriers in addition to confidence barriers. In addition, I assume every girl is racist even though I've mostly found that it's me being racist about myself and everyone else is fine...if that makes sense.  So yeah, say I have two years left and I want to get good at seduction+sex, the whole process.  Plus, I'm moving to Seattle from a really small town in four months.  I want to hit the ground running there. What, specifically, should I do before then to ensure that I have the courage to go out and screw up or screw someone whenever I want to?     But doesn't 'halal' in fact exactly refer to the processing of the meat and the way the chicken is killed, etc?  I always assumed that halal food implied a better quality of meat.   I'm a drummer and I'm in college. Get an Electronic Kit (I have the Yamaha Express and it's really good!) and you can play with headphones.  You'll think the electronic kit sounds good at first, then you'll think it sounds like shit when you play on an acoustic kit (esp w.r.t dynamics) after two years and then finally, you'll see you have no choice because of where you live.  As for where to learn, I would strongly recommend taking 2-3 hours of lessons (more if you can afford them) at $20 (or whatever)/hour. It's really worth it and to this day, I regret not taking lessons when I started. It really lays the fundamentals for everything that follows.  If you need any more advice, PM me...This is a subject I love talking about :D   Some humans can beat all horses. All horses can beat some humans.   So the best long distance runners are *some* humans, but *all* horses are competitive too.   I just reopened the book at a random page to find something (and then re-reopened at another random location so that I won't give you spoilers):  "Kid's in the shower", he said, motioning a cigar towards the sound of water hissing in another room. The room in which we stood (we were standing because there was nothing to sit on) seemed as though it were just being moved into; you expected to smell wet paint. Suitcases and unpacked crates were the only furniture. The crates served as tables. One supported the mixings of a martini; another a lamp, a Libertyphone, Holly's red cat and a bowl of yellow roses. Bookcases, covering one wall, boasted a half-shelf of literature. I warmed to the room at once, I liked its fly-by-night look.  It's not that he's describing something special. But as a writer, if I think about it, there's absolutely no way I could have gotten such a strong impression across to the reader in so few words. He knows exactly what in the room (the scene the sounds, the objects...everything!) is relevant to get a feel for the place and the time and the people involved.  Amazing stuff to learn from.   Whoever writes it, if the only thing you have to prioritize over the article is a youtube video, then read the article. Else, use your judgement before reading.  If it's a writer you respect, read anyway. Follow the advice. Use your judgement.  For example, this one's advice from Neil Gaiman. I think he knows more than me and I love his stories and trust that he will give practical advice that will still make it seem like you're following your dream and being awesome.  So I read it and when his advice contradicts mine, I trust his.   I just read Breakfast at Tiffanys by Truman Capote. That guy can write!  I'm really trying to understand his framing of sentences, the way he says just enough about a scene so you think you're there...he's brilliant.      And there are people like me, who don't have to prove anything. Ha!   I did not know that. Thank you, kind person on the internet!   I ran 5-6 miles on off days for two months along with SS. Didn't kill my gains at all.   In general, for me, SS makes me sleepy after while running makes me energetic. Is it similar for you?      Many thanks for that...His version is very cool indeed.   Sprint training...60 minutes...Wow..that's hard!  I'm a long distance runner. 7 hours a week is no problem at all. But 60 minutes sprinting is crazy.   Any sprinters here? I used to do short-distance (200 m and 400 m) and really, 2 sprints of 400 m took everything out of me. That's less than 2 minutes of sprinting and my day was done! What does "60 minutes a week of sprinting" really entail?   There's an excellent subreddit for classical music: /r/classicalmusic . They're a bit pretentious, but in a good natured way. The music is great though, and that's what really matters!   No No. I like the original look much better...Well, maybe I'm the only one...or maybe it's just a personal opinion of the second style, but there's more personality in the first look.   Huh...that would be dumb of me to not notice that. I rarely use A-mode...it's mostly used by people who borrow my camera. My shooting is mostly Auto, then Manual, Manual, Manual, Manual.... (for the same picture!)   Ha...I didn't take good care of it at all.   The thing is, metering seems to not work only A-mode. It always chooses a value that's too dark. What setting might be causing this?   I'm not sure, actually. I will check and let you know. I rarely use the only other lens I have...thanks!   I've had a Nikon D40 for 5 years now which I've used extensively. She's been through a lot, poor thing... Snow, ice, rain, wind. She's been dropped and thrown and swung.  Anyway, emotional speech over. These days, I've noticed the camera doesn't focus properly, it doesn't meter properly (especially in Aperture mode...why is that?) and I was just curious what happens to the camera as it gets old?  What gives way first, in a technical sort of way?   That was awesome!   Don't know why they felt the need to say "Freakin'" though... Hate that.      Yes yes. But it's the getting to the point in his life where he can climb Everest without legs that's the story and the struggle.   Even for people with legs, the actual climb up the mountain is a very small part of a very long struggle and planning process.      Oh yeah. I was on Linux last year and man, IllinoisNet was a constant pain with Broadcomm drivers...   Was on my end too. Funnily enough, it was all good on the third floor.  Maybe it was just a bandwidth issue...or something.   Sitting in siebel, unable to connect   Thanks a lot!!      Education without wisdom is like a hot lesbian to a heterosexual male. Nice to look at, but pretty fucking worthless.  And the heterosexual male to the hot lesbian is a pretty worthless fuck.   He's one of my favourite drummers. I first heard this song a few years back, then found out he played for Sting, and then that he had a a few albums out with his own name. That's about it from me :)      I have a quick question for you. I hike and snowboard, and have always wanted to do both together, especially since I went to the Mono Lake area. Some of the mountains there were awesome!  Silly as the question maybe, do you carry your boots and bindings along with the snowboard? Or is there some cooler way to attach the snowboard to your feet wearing your hiking boots?  I ask, because if I have to do all of that, backpacking may be a bad idea...Car camping/Dayhikes+ Snowboarding would be the way to go...   Ahh! 10 + 9...Makes sense now :)   Okay I can't really decide if it's 21 (10.5 x 2) or 10x2... My brain can't keep up with the song...Any drummers here care to chip in?  EDIT: http://www.jazz.com/music/2008/2/5/mahavishnu-orchestra-celestial-terrestrial-commuters  It says it's 9/8 :(          No man...read the comment. Girls can't be dudes. That's what she was sayin'   Sounds a lot like Miso...except miso doesn't come in a shallow bowl...and it's on the English menu too...   But it is delicious, if you want to try something else!   I'll be out for dinner. I will join you guys later. Could you PM me a number I could text/call so I'll know where you guys are?  EDIT: *Facepalm* Just saw the date...never mind... I'll be there the next meetup!   Very nice!  What camera/lens/settings did you use?      Ironic that I'm asking on reddit, yes. But this is where I come to for a lot of my questions.  However, I want to try and stay off reddit for a few (at least two) weeks. I've tried the following and couldn't keep up:  1/ Restrict reddit usage only to specific subreddits 2/ Use StayFocusd 3/ Use a time tracker 4/ Pure will power (this never works for me anyway)  Any ideas you guys have will be greatly appreciated.  The reason I'm doing this: I just went through a really bad time the last few months where I lost a lot that really mattered to me. This has made me realize that unless I make some drastic changes to how I live, well....I will continue living how I live, and I'm not happy with it.  To this end, I want to take out everything till I see myself for what I am, and then let things in one by one. I'm not sure that makes sense (or is even relevant to this post), but reddit is one of these things. So, ideas welcome, even if all you say is "Suck it up and try your ideas again"!   Kraken by China Meiville. I'm reading because I really, really liked The City, The City.  But Kraken is crap in comparison. Very disappointing.         The pretense is necessary because I'm not good enough to be able to express myself without it :)    Ah I guess mine's slightly different. I'm mostly very emotional while writing these poems and find that punctuation only spoils what I'm trying to say.  But if/when I edit, I will keep your excellent advice in mind. Thank you :)    I'm on Week 10 (approximately) of Starting Strength and my Squat is at 215x5x3 (My height 6 ft, my weight 171 lbs).  For the last three sessions, the right side of my groin has been hurting when I get to the heavy weights. Today, I finally asked an experienced bodybuilder what I might be doing wrong. He said that it's on one of these three:  1/ I don't warm up 2/ I don't drink enough water 3/ I don't breathe while squatting.  While I do warm, I found out that he was absolutely right about 2/ and 3/. I don't drink water at all and I practically hold my breath. That's why I get dizzy too, supposedly...Who knew? So that's the PSA!  I need advice on what I should do about the groin pain. I find it doesn't interfere with the weights, though it hurts quite a bit on the last few sets.  Should I reset to a lower weight?  Should I not squat for a few days/weeks?  Are there some specific stretches I can/should do?  Thanks!   Well, to paraphrase from Oscar Wilde:   I was working on the proof of one of my poems all the morning, and changed an 'E' to an 'e'. In the afternoon I changed it back.  Really, that's how it happened. I wanted a smooth transition from the shaving gel to the knob to the mental fucking. Somehow, I felt it wasn't smooth till I capitalized the 'E'. Then I thought the capital 'E' was pretentious. Then again, I thought if pretentiousness is what it takes to get my message across, so be it :)     Thank you! You said it much better than I could.   With poems where I'm basically rearranging and adding makeup to my feelings on paper, I feel that punctuation only gets in the way of what I'm trying to say...   Espresso Royale is okay...Their self-named blend sucks, but the Guatemala and the Peru blends are quite good.  Columbia Street Roastery has a few good blends: The Escobar blend comes to mind. Needless to say, the coffee at Escobar is awesome!  Strange as it may seem, I prefer Caribou Coffee's blend from county market to all of the above! It's available in the coffee aisle by the pound. Best!  If you french press, you should try Aeropress... At least equally good and less mess to clean!    And in the basement...quite nice there too.      As I came out of the shower   I saw two bottles of shaving gel    Next to each other by the sink    Blue and Orange. And foam   Between their mouths    I dried myself and opened the door    The knob turned slowly in my gentle hands   Surely Erotic  I turned the lights off    And for a moment   Fucked you in my mind    But I usually forget to turn the lights off   So before getting out   I turned them on again   Thank you Ma'am...that made my day and made me look forward to when I have a kid!   What do I need to buy now, to be able to run in the cold (10-20 F)? I run about 6-7 miles at a time.  Recommendations for tops, pants etc. all welcome! Thank you!   Ah...that's cool...Thanks!   The thread was very informative, thanks!  Seems like the tl;dr is that I'm still a beginner and am far away from causing problems with the amount of stuff I'm doing.   Yeah, that's what I thought...what does it mean to "allow" though, since Enterprise is open to everyone?   A prof told me I'm on the "unofficial waitlist" for a course. What does this mean and how does this work?   Thanks...that's exactly what I was hoping to hear!   Thanks..Hadn't even thought about that!   I put on 35 lbs on either side of the deadlift instead of 25 by mistake. So I was lifting 205 instead of 195.  Man, those 8 reps were painful! My face was contorted like cooked spaghetti...   But I got through them!! And only when I was reracking the weights did I notice.  Victory by chance...but still a victory!   So I used to run long distance, but then stopped. I restarted, got up to 12 miles again, and then stopped again when I began the SS program, because I was told that running would interfere with my SS progress.  8 weeks in, my goals have changed:  I want to continue SS, but am no longer too worried about the numbers, as long as they go up somewhat (I'm still on Linear progression and haven't plateaued), but I would like to start running again and training to run really long distances on trails (50 miles or so).  I like SS, so I was wondering how I should modify it so that I can do running on rest days and still not hurt myself or make myself too weak to perform in the rest of my life!  Are there any diet modifications I should be making?  Details... Height 6 ft: Weight: 171 lbs.  Squats: 95 - 195 lbs    BP: 70 - 115 lbs   PC: 45 - 85 lbs   OHP: 45 - 85 lbs   Deadlift: 95 - 205 lbs     Oh I completely agree with this article.  Well, sort of.  I don't know about it becoming a movement and all, but I like thinking and clicking. Sometimes, I put the camera away and try to experience the sight BEFORE clicking away like a madman.  The experience comes first for me. Always. The experience of getting a good photograph because I thought about it comes next.   Then I click away like the son of a madman and a tourist, and who knows...one of these random clicks turns out better than the one I thought about for an hour. But it's just not the same.     Hello /r/photography,  I've been thinking and clicking away happily for a few years now and wanted some tips on the quick, bad world of snowboarding photography.  I'm going this weekend and wanted to get the best snaps I can. My camera (an old Nikon D40) is not particularly valuable any more, so I'm okay with it getting a little worse for the wear.  I have an ND filter to allow me to take some interesting things during the day... But any tips and tricks from you guys, some of whom I'm sure have done this before.  I'll be snowboarding AND taking pics of my friends...so no equipment or extra lenses other than the camera kit lenses this time for me!   Iron Post always has good live music on.   Don't know why you got downvoted :-/ but I chose to give you an upvote.   I'm on Starting Strength...Well, I thought I'd read the book...Shit.   It's like a student reading a textbook with me!   Quick question: How much do you reset by?  For example, I got stuck at 195 lbs on Squat (did 2x5 + 1x4), so I went back down to 185 the next workout and then managed the 3x5 the the time after that.  Is that reasonable or should I reset by a smaller/bigger amount?   Oh I love that woman!! It was love at first sight -- the live video of her performing *Old Castle, by the River, in the Middle of a Forest live* (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=614eHycjJfw)   Just wanted to add to the Sweet Child of Mine cover list:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXI7odSYLkI  I just wish they'd sung the whole song :(        TIL subtitles can make for awesome QuotesPorn posts!   Kind of like "terrible", wouldn't you say?   I was listening to Lush Life (the whole album) and I just lost myself in it...That stuff is gold!   Portrait in Jazz on repeat for today, Thanks!!   Man, that song is amazing!!   This song made my morning...Thanks!   Could someone recommend for me a good piano jazz album?   I am not looking for something like Hiromi or Chick Corea, which will keep me bouncing on my seat all through the album, but more like John Coltrane (but on the piano!).   Music that I can listen to, chill and think.   EDIT: Man, lots of suggestions here...Thanks a lot, guys! This is going to keep me occupied for months...exploring...relistening :D      So today evening, I plan to attend a jazz concert a bar, on my own with the hope of meeting someone interesting. Any tips on how to approach?  Never approached before. That's about it.   I know that I should just do it and all that. But if that's too hard (and so far, it has been), any simple tips to help with all the tension?   That really scares me. Having conveniences would be good. But the peace that comes with the lack of these conveniences is far more important to me...   There should be stores, but hopefully they will be far enough so you don't see their lights and hear their sounds, but close enough that you can drive there if you need something...   But if I *had* to choose, I would choose no convenience close to where I go backpacking. Every time.   I agree..Really love the warm feeling from this picture, except for that glaring Sun in the top left corner.  But hey, it's the sun. When the sun's in the picture, it's on the sun's terms!   The title says it all...  I will be there with a friend.. Come along and bring yo' friends!   True that. All I'm saying is that you can't expect Science to prove/disprove God. God has to be believed/disbelieved on the basis of faith, which of course, not compatible with the Scientific method.  So you're exactly right. Science and religion don't mix.      Yup yup.. You said it better than me!    It doesn't disprove God. It can't disprove God. Because in Science, there is no god.  You can't disprove something that is unfalsifiable.   Man. Isn't it ironic that that subreddit doesn't exist?   Ooh. Makes perfect sense.   Thanks and apologies!   True that. I looked for the "reddit" subreddit, and it doesn't exist any more...  Here's a question: Which subreddit would my post be relevant to?   I was hung up on one woman, and now I'm trying to open more social avenues, but can't seem to find any avenues.  Man, I need to get out of grad school. I'm old (relatively) and my friends are gone and there's nothing left   Because the right half will fall down, string, hammock and person included.   The system "Hammock plus person" needs to be held up, not just the person. For this system, him holding up the hammock is an internal force, so it cannot produce acceleration.  You need an external force, i.e. the reaction force of a tree to counter the other external force - gravity in order for the hammock to not fall down.  More generally, you have to be self-reliant, but you have to know that sometimes you need help.      Sorry for the link the title...Umm Not a masta of the copy pasta, evidently!  	99
 Yeah, why can't he just wear clothes made of old curtains and shit in a bucket like all the other world leaders.   Modi probably used it for a couple of seconds and threw it away saying "wtf is this shit!'   There's no way we beat white people to animal fucking   It's simple really. I think if you wake up early you get extra hours in your day and can perform better. I have had accountability buddies in the past and it went out quite well for a few months.  I try to wake up at 5 am everyday which requires sleeping on time too.  If you aim at waking up at 6 or 7 am, it's fine by me. I know 5 am is a bit freakish.   How the accountability shall work -  The moment we wake up we take a photo of our wrist watch along with a piece of paper on which we write "I am awake"  Why? Coz it generally means you're out of the bed now.   If interested let me know.   Oh okay, just saw that   Like a podcast   Yeah like a podcast      For Ford's sake this book deserves more upvotes!   I think it's been a year since I broke up with my ex-gf. I have a tattoo of her name on my body which I intend to remove as soon as I get my finances right. It was a bad decision to get it in the first place, but...eh...mistakes happen.   I have suffered a lot in the past few months. But having no contact with my ex has helped me a lot in moving on. It would have been even better had she not messaged me at all. She used to message me like once a week or something and I could see the display pic of her hugging her new boyfriend. She moved on very quickly after we broke up. That fact tormented me a lot.  Anyway, I'm in a better mental state now and it's been a life changing experience. I just want to say that if you're suffering right now then, just know that it will end one day and you will be able to breathe.   There will come a day when you won't wake up in the morning with the thought of your ex in your head and the memories will begin to fade away. Just hang in there. Also if you focus on reading and some outdoor activities, it'll just help more.   Both good times and bad times end one day.   	10
    Depends on what and how one attributes value to their personal circumstances and how they apply it throughout their lives.    I agree. I was speaking to the differing interpretations and perspectives that people apply to meaning of value     I don't believe that to be true. People are still going to college; they wouldn't pay for the means to pursue higher education, they would just get a job or learn a trade. Value does not have to produce tangible objects like jobs or money--I would like to think that value is a little more intrinsic than just an outcome. Like I said, value is something that can be perceived and applied differently for everyone. For some it can be just getting a job, while for others it can be simple fact of loving to acquire new knowledge.    Value is based on personal perception; my view definitely does not align with yours, at least in this case. :)      Lmao, if they had mentioned Putin or Russia then you have a point. But when you have a show where Russia nor Putin have any editorial power it makes your argument/rant simply inapplicable to the circumstance--mainly because it's about Putin and Russia and not Thom or Bernie. Again, just my opinion.    I saw her on TYT a couple of months ago, but nothing other than that.    We have very different perspectives, to say the least. When I value an opinion of someone I don't let a watermark dictate whether or not to share it with the Bernie community. As I see it there are two choices: I can not post it and some may stumble upon the video on their own, but on the other hand, many won't--and for me the most important factor is sharing what I perceive to be as valuable content. I obviously chose to post it for the reason that it may help someone to understand why Bernie is downplayed in the main stream media. Some may hate it, like it or even love it--but the notion that this may open up a dialogue or introduce different perspectives to other people trumps the fact that RT licenses his show (at least for me).      Research his affiliation with RT before citing their past news coverage because once again, RT has no editorial power over Thom's show. They LICENSE it to run on their network and in turn Thom is able to use their studio. All employees are under Thom's company and have zero connection to RT other than the equipment being used which also means Thom decides what will be on his show and he has also said in interviews that he wouldn't have made this agreement if they wanted to dictate what was on the show as well as having any editorial power. Since that isn't the case, RT does not have any power and this is the only reason why Thom agreed to have them LICENSE the show--Larry King has also said the same thing about his setup with RT.       You obviously don't understand that Thom runs the show and the employee are listed under his company. RT has no editorial power because they only license his show to run on their network and in turn they let him use the studio. Furthermore, this show also airs on free speech TV where Thom does his radio show. Please do some research before concocting outrageous claims. On top of all this, Bernie and Thom have been doing brunch with Bernie for 9 years so I really don't think your claim holds any strength. Lastly, Bernie did an interview on politicking with Larry King which is also licensed by RT so, I think he knows and I think you should know the *facts* as well.          Yeah you're right. She supports a minimum wage increase but didn't [endorse](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/hillary-clinton-support-fast-food-workers) $15/hr      Thom licenses his show through RT and they supply him with the studio--however, Thom employs all of the workers and has the editorial power. Therefore, RT is not allowed to dictate what Thom talks about nor do they supply him with employees (Thom pays his workers under his company)--it's the same deal that Larry King has with his Politicking show. Check wiki to fact check everything--although I don't think I'm very far off. Sorry @ work in between patients so I can't double check everything now.    Totally thought I was the only one that had that feeling!                               Yay, seems like Hillary is feeling that rug^bern hahahahahaa.                               sorry about that, didn't notice--still early in the AM for me :)   yes! you are awesome, thank you!

 You're original comment regarded the mass of the Earth being crushed into a black hole. That is what I was addressing. Are you debating a different point now?  Also this comment doesn't make sense out of context. What black hole is he talking about? Does it have an original size? Either way it doesn't really support your argument. He's saying that if a black hole was crushed it would have more gravitational pull. That would just extend it's event horizon, not change the force exerted on it.  Either way everything I said earlier is still relevant. The event horizon has the exact same force on every black hole. Being outside one of a small black hole will not put you under more gravitational strain than a large one.   If they hit pass by each other they will probably slingshot each other away. If not, there are black holes that actually orbit one another. If they come even closer though they will collide and from a single larger black hole. It would release an absolutely insane amount of energy. They would release huge gravitational waves into space. An event like his has never been observed before.   Oh, I understand what your saying, but the event horizon is a fixed point that has the exact same gravitational pull on every black hole. The event horizon on a big black hole is the same as one on a small one. That could only change if the singularity of a small black hole somehow had the mass of a large black hole, which is impossible. By definition they have already reached their smallest size.  Correct me if I'm wrong but here's what I understand you saying: an extremely small black hole would tear you apart before you reached it's event horizon because it's small size provides more distance between the furthest extent of its gravitational pull and the nearest. That's an interesting way to look at it, but it's not really the way it works.  An event horizon is the point where the gravity is strong enough to prevent light from escaping. The force of a large black hole at it's event horizon is exactly the same as one from a small black hole. And the gravitational pull extending outwards from the event horizon may extend further for a large one, but the ratio for distance away to gravitational pull is directly proportional, no matter how large or small the black hole.   That's a subject of considerable debate. Bear in mind that this is all theory, not law. We could never actually prove any of this.  Some say yes some say no. There are actually theories that if things could be sucked into a black hole and survive, they would remain there forever. So if I star could be sucked in, it could supernova itself and created another black hole within the first, and so on, and so on. An entire solar system could be created within a black hole, an entire galaxy, an entire universe. For all we know, our universe is inside of a black hole, which could be inside of another black hole and another. And many of the black holes around use could house their own universes and universes within them. This is one of the many multiverse theories. If it is true, it could even contain parallel universes. If there are an infinite number of universes, you could eventually find one that is exactly the same as the one we live in in every way. A parallel universe.  Black holes themselves are basically a product of dead stars. So if the universe didn't contain any stars before its conception, it couldn't have had any black holes. But who knows if there were stars when all of this happened?  Based on the Big Bang Theory though, nothing existed before, or at least not enough to create a star. Following that logic, black holes could not have been around. Our universe is not even old enough to see the first 'dead' black hole. The way black holes' radioactivity reduces as it's life goes on implies that they eventually fade into oblivion. We haven't even been around long enough to see one die though!  To answer your question, nobody knows, but there are plenty of theories.   Your nerves would eventually become disconnected, but I would think so up until that point. It would probably happen rather quickly though.   No it would actually be significantly more than that. How big would you consider a baseball? Ten inches around? That's about seven times more than the black hole you used in the event horizon calculator.  And you could absolutely not stand next to such an object without feeling considerable gravitational pull, but again you would most likely not be pulled  apart until you had passed the event horizon.  Think about it this way, you are feeling the mass of the entire Earth right now. Even if you were to tunnel down into the mantle of the Earth, it's gravitational force on you would not increase (in fact it would decrease but lets not go down that tangent). Your argument seems to be based off of Earth's consolidated mass creating a stronger pull, a pull that could effect you as you got closer to it. While it would eventually do that, it would not really happen until you were extremely close to it.   The two don't seem mutually exclusive. You could very well be spaghettified and then crushed!   It goes both ways...   [You're the best.] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/72dfc38636c9175f78dff498af34ea2f/tumblr_mqg385B0IR1qz581wo8_500.gif)   Oh yes, it would be like swimming against a much much stronger current. Once you go through the event horizon though, you fall off the waterfall at the end of the river. Even if you could overcome the current at this point, there is no getting back, not matter what. Unless you could go faster than the speed of light, but that the point where the laws of physics break down so lets not go there.   Think about it from the prospective that at any moment, all of your problems could be instantly destroyed and rendered meaningless!   An event horizon the size of a baseball would be absolutely tiny. So small in fact that while it could theoretically be created, it could not occur naturally. Anyhow, depending on it's exact specifications, it's gravitational pull probably wouldn't strongly extend all that far. You would probably break up someplace within the event horizon.  Gravitational pull doesn't increase as size decreases.   They probably don't all get their energy the same way, there are many ways it could happen though. When two things pass they each exert a gravitational force on one another. When an asteroid flys by Earth for example the Earth pulls it significantly closer but the asteroid also pulls the Earth very marginally off of it's orbit (we're talking immeasurably small distances here). If something went by a black hole it could get it moving extremely slowly the same way. And they usually don't have an orbit to stop them, once they're moving they don't stop. The bigger the object going by, the more it would move the black hole. If a moving black hole was to eventually pass by another object close to it's size (another black hole for example), they could slingshot each other flying into space at very high speeds.   No, the spaghettification doesn't happen until you pass through the event horizon regardless of the black holes size. I think that was what he was referring to by 'pulled apart'.   If **ANYTHING** even attached to you touches it, you're done. I saw an article or something that used a shoelace as an example. If so much as an aglet slipped through, there would be no escaping.   I don't think so, they don't each move at the same velocity. How could that happen if say two black holes were moving away from one another? Regardless, everything is moving. The galaxy the black hole is in for example be moving, so the black hole inside of it couldn't exactly just not move while staying in the same place within it.  Either way, the general theories of cosmology, which usually follows the big bang theory, prevent there from being a center to the universe. Even though it's all theoretical, I personally don't think there is one.   Sorry, where? This isn't easy on an iPhone.  EDIT: Fixed.    I'm not exactly sure what you mean I guess. What is the difference between dying and ceasing to exist? I don't think it matters though, you certainly wouldn't live through it. A big black hole would pull you apart just as much as a small one. If anything it would even do it faster with its extra gravity. No one knows what would happen at the singularity, but you would probably be broken down into pieces so infinitely small that we couldn't even come up with a measurement for them.  I haven't read the article you're referring to though, I could be completely 100% wrong.   Absolutely, we're pretty safe though. The nearest black hole is about 6,000 light years away, not close enough to ever do any damage. Even the closest stars that could potentially go supernova are far enough away to be completely harmless. Personally, I'd love to see Betelgeuse explode, but that probably won't happen in my life. Or if its already happened, I probably won't be around to see it.  What's **really** scary though are rogue black holes. As the name would imply, rouge black holes don't have much of a fixed position. They wander around the galaxy aimlessly swallowing up anything in their path. Anything unfortunate to somehow resist a black hole's intense gravitaty and get close enough to touch it's event horizon would be immediately swallowed up never to be seen again. Well that's not exactly true I guess. Theoretically, you'll actually be able to see someone go into a black hole, or at least right up to the very edge of it. As gravity slows the speed of the image escaping though, it will appear the object getting sucked in will move towards the event horizon infinitely slowly until it almost stops moving completely. Eventually, the image will fade away long before it actually disappears into the black hole. Whats really happening that you can't see from the outside is called 'spaghettification'. I've just realized how much I wrote, anyone still reading please know this tangent has gone very far from 'black holes are terrifying'.  Anyhow, spaghettification is pretty much as bad as it sounds, and not nearly as delicious. As you are standing right now, or probably sitting, your feet are experiencing stronger gravity than your head because it is closer to the source of the gravity (the central Earth). The same thing happens in a black hole but to a much much larger scale. So much larger in fact that if you were to go into a black hole feet first, you would be stretched out with your feet stretching further than your head because they are under more gravitational strain. Spaghettification. Eventually you would be stretched out soooo far that what used to be your body would now be a single file line of atoms. In theory, they would keep spreading apart until they reached the singularity, the center of the black hole. Any theories regarding what happens at the singularity have very little to base off themselves off though, so its hard to know what happens next.  There are supposedly hundreds of rogue black holes bouncing around our galaxy. Although the methods of detection are getting better, they aren't perfect. A black hole could be flying at us right now and we wouldn't even know it. Personally, I'd rather have it that way. There is nothing we can do to stop or get out of the way of a black hole, so I'd rather not know it was coming than know inevitable spaghettification was looming around the corner.  TL;DR: Supermassive black holes=scary, rogue black holes=potential spegitification for the entire Earth (but probably not :) )  EDIT: Sorry about the rogue, rouge confusion, I'm on my phone, this isn't very easy to fix.  EDIT 2: It *is* rogue! I looked it up.  EDIT 3: Thanks for the gold kindly stranger!

I *highly* recommend literally anyone try it.   /r/humblebrag   I regularly watch the History Channel.  I'm like a genius.   Wait...you guys don't do that?   Wtf dude you left by far the biggest spoiler uncovered.   Inspired by [this] (http://youtu.be/).   Woah, cleavage.   Galifinaski. Plural.   The one and only.   Last comment I posted was "You know you're famous when your dick shows up on the front page in an hour and a half".  I'm so sorry Mr. Rogers...   Wow, you know you're famous when your dick to shows up on the front page of Reddit in an hour and a half.   ...you expected sarcasm. Sarcasm is what you expected.   If you're trying to come up with an example of one of their badly written songs, you've chosen a terrible one. What is this supposed to prove anyways? That your weak attempt at scat was somehow comparable?  If you actually take 20 seconds to understand the lyrics, its far from badly written. I'm not even sure why you'd need to take 20 seconds though, it's pretty easy to catch them as they go by. Around the World is definitely not my favorite, even a little overrated in my opinion, but still, not sure which point of yours this supposedly backs up.  Aside from all that, why judge a band solely off one characteristic? Even if you don't like the writing, the bass work is phenomenal, Flea is one of the best there's ever been and that's simply not debatable. The guitar has kind of been all over the place, but John Frusciante who played the majority of their albums was fantastic. The newer one is okay, but he's more of a filler now. Chad Smith is obviously awesome. Extremely talented, I honestly can't think of a bad thing about him. He brings a lot of order and direction to a band that's otherwise all over the place.  Apart from the performers, the production has always been done in precise minimalist taste by a number of talented producers. Rick Ruben, Danger Mouse, George Clinton, etc. All legends. Not many can say they've had a line up like that.  I could go on, but I won't. My point is, there are plenty of bands I don't like certain characteristics about. I don't let those few flaws ruin them for me though, instead I look past them to understand what really makes them great. The Red Hot Chili Peppers have never been about the writing. In fact they've been known for *not* being about the writing. To say they suck because their songs are badly written is like saying Bob Dylan sucks because he has a boring voice. It's completely missing the point.  Again though, what point were you trying to make with the link?   Nothing says hair bands like The Beatles, Pink Floyd and Michael Jackson.   A: That is the most inaccurate mocking of anything in the history of ever.  B: I would totally buy that single.   It was one of your classic 'who would win in a three way Battle Royale, James Spader with a graphing calculator, Joe Biden with a can of Febreze (Fresh Linen) or Nicholas Cage with this years Yellow Pages?' situations.   "Nah man, I'll take Nick Cage and a phone book any day"   Oh fuck you, now I gotta click  EDIT: Phew, he only did an AMA.   I'd say that was fairly relevant considering the part where you mentioned it...   Met someone who had a confederate flag jean vest once. The relationship was short lived.   Season 1 of The Office.

I bet they taste as good too"  Anddd that's how he ended up licking bath salts.   Not taking enough pictures.  EDIT: No, not NSFW pictures, just things to keep the memories from fading.  EDIT 2: Okay maybe a few NSFW pictures.   /r/humblebrag   Porcupine, do doubt about it.   Did Dany ever get to Westeros?!   I used to have a teacher named Mr. Dangler. Mr. *Harold* Dangler. Yup. Harry Dangler. Unluckily for me, he was a second grade teacher so none of us understood how hilarious it was to have a teacher with a name like that. Anyhow I was walking by his desk when I saw something with his first name on it. "Congratulations, Harry!" or something. I couldn't hold in my giggles, this was second grade, knowing a teachers first name was a BIG deal. The next time he called on me in class, I made sure to address him as 'Sir Harry of Dangler'. We were putting on some mid evil play in class, this was perfect. Apparently when I said it he thought I understood the hilarity of his name and sent me straight to the principals office. As a newer principle, she couldn't understand how a second grader had come up with in insult like 'hairy dangler'. It probably made it a little worse when I told her I had seen it on his desk.  TL;DR: Called a teacher by his first name, got in trouble, probably go him involved in some sort of school investigation.   I'd rather just give you some recommendations than my favorites. You would probably like them better.  OutKast is kind of R Bish rap. [Ms. Jackson] (http://youtu.be/MYxAiK6VnXw) or [The Way You Move] (http://youtu.be/xI5NQ-0Ubfs) are both geeat.  The Heavy are awesome. Some kind of magical blend of soul, indie rock and even a little rap put together in one significantly underrated band. [Same Ol'] (http://youtu.be/4OAkUelXoVY), [How You Like Me Now?] (http://youtu.be/sVzvRsl4rEM)  Ever listen to the Beastie Boys? They're style is a little underproduced by today's standards (yes, I know, Rick Ruben. Still too 'acoustic' for today's audiences), but some of the newer mashups with them are awesome. Try [this one] (http://youtu.be/XL0YWTPDMUI) on for size.  Rage Against the Machine is probably my favorite rock-rap band. You may or may not have heard the hits, but [Guerrilla Radio] (http://youtu.be/H0kJLW2EwMg) and [Now Sleep in the Fire] (http://youtu.be/w211KOQ5BMI) are awesome too. Audio Slave is basically the same band with a different (and in my humble opinion better) singer, Chris Cornell. [Like a Stone] (http://youtu.be/7QU1nvuxaMA) isn't my favorite, but it's up there.  Redlight King is okay, he takes some pretty cool creative risks. A [Neil Young rap cover] (http://youtu.be/lGt54Ozo8LQ) for example. Not exactly a cover I guess, but still pretty cool.  How about early Snoop Dogg? Like Doggystyle early? [Murder Was the Case] (http://youtu.be/Do4fA8tONY4), [Doggy Dogg World] (http://youtu.be/En3IgstEmcU), [Gin and Juice] (http://youtu.be/0Cxr1-b6Xkc), etc. The whole album is awesome, somehow both ahead of it's time and nostalgic simultaneously. Probably my favorite by him.  I think you might like Sublime too. They have a cool chill style. [What I Got] (http://youtu.be/0Uc3ZrmhDN4) is good, [Santeria] (http://youtu.be/AEYN5w4T_aM) is better.  Bad Religion is probably one of the best-of not, *the* best-punk rock bands of all time. [American Jesus  (http://youtu.be/12kcpP-8jfM), and of course, the sacred [Los Angeles Is Burning] (http://youtu.be/BxoD9zWY9Rg). They even released a Christmas album a few years back. I would recommend it to anyone that loves punk and Christmas.  Wolfmother anyone? Awesome band, they're one of the last bands that play a lot of older classic rock styles. [Joker and the Theif] (http://youtu.be/3afXXsJwYZo) is definitely my favorite song of theirs. Literally everyone I've ever shown it to has liked it. And then theres [Woman] (http://youtu.be/GN7syX6tz18) obviously. Their entire last album was good too, 'New Crown'.

EDIT: After seeing some of the theories in these comments and reading the actor quotes again, I wouldn't be surprised to see a couple huge twists instead of just one. In fact there are two I'm like 75% sure could both totally happen in that episode 10. The hype train has officially left the station.   Phew, what a relief!

Not at all, I even got ahold of a lot of their b sides and bonus tracks to try and get into their edgier less mainstream stuff. Some of that was okay but an overwhelming majority wasn't.   Not even...Riders?   Glad we could get an expert opinion on this one.   Drake/Jay Z. I don't understand how they got so far. Jay Z is okay, but he has absolutely no flow, it's like listening to someone read a book. And nothing else about him really stands out as above average. Drake is just...boring. He raps about cheesy shit that gets him radio time. "Started at the bottom now we here". Really? Such a lame line that somehow became so popular. I'm getting off topic. There's a few songs by both Drake and Jay Z that I like, but they're both insanely over rated. Countless rappers out there not getting any recognition could put them to shame.   I like to play with little things I'm holding. I can spin and twirl my keys like a true professional. I can flip and twist my phone in the air like it's an Olympic figure skater gently gliding over the ice. I just like to toss and catch the things I'm holding. I know where you think this going but trust me, it's worse. Anyhow, I had just got out of the shower and was brushing my teeth and combing my hair. Normal morning stuff. I picked up a little Axe spray bottle and did a few toss-flips. I then decided to do an extra high toss. It was ambitious, but I was feeling good about myself. I bent down and gently sent it upwards sailing towards the heavens. It spun just inches below the ceiling, a perfect throw. I readied myself for the decent, hand out, knees bend, eyes locked. This was it, this is why we play the game. The Axe was spinning too fast to attempt a right-side-up catch, I would just need to go for the hail mary. The unpredictable spinning reception. The bottle came back down to Earth with more force than ever. Two feet away. One foot. Six inches. Contact. The bottle hit my hand held directly in front of me. The force proved greater than I had anticipate. It was enough to press the specially designed Axe release valve down, and send a fine mist of deodorant directly into my open mouth. Try and picture how dumb that must have looked. Tossing a bottle up, catching it upside down, it sprays into my mouth at point blank range.

 Hi all,  just bought a new ASUS laptop running 64-bit Windows 8.  The problem is, I cannot connect to anything via ssh ftp sftp etc...  I've tried connecting to a few different servers using putty, winscp and fireftp all with the same result: "Network Error: Connection Timed Out"  I can't even connect to one of the websites I manage via the cpanel ui for the same reasons.   I've ruled out router or ISP problems, as I can do all of these things on both my phone and old computer on the same ntwork.  I have also tried disabling Windows Firewall completely, but still get the same network error.  Very frustrated, any help would greatly be appreciated!    yeah, that sounds about right.   You know what? I call bullshit. Or at least gross over exaggeration. Or I am misunderstanding the full time college part.  168 hours in a week. You average 75 hours of work and 40 hours of school.  We're left with 53 hours for the week.   You need 35 of those to sleep (5 hours/night). I suppose that you could crunch this down by going with some alternative sleep cycle, but I'm going to assume that if you work around 75 hours a week, you're schedule doesn't allow for it.  So now we have 18 hours left for the week. I figure, hey, you live decently close to school and work. Assuming that you have a day where you do not physically have to be at either of these places, you do not remain sedentary, we'll average a 15 minute one-way transit time. And that you are in transit for approximately 1 hour every day (to and from, to and from).  What remains is around 1 and a half hours of unscheduled time left in your day. Let's say the math is fuzzy and that you have 3 hours of unscheduled time. You need to do laundry, pay bills, eat, clean your house, buy groceries, get dressed, bathe etc.   If that were you, you wouldn't be on reddit right now.   An insignificant amount   Hey, I do this too. But check it out, make some bread pudding every once in a while. Super easy, delicious and will impress people. You can even eat it hot or cold.

Honest question:  Why would you use one of these image specific services when you can automate this entire task with something like grunt?   "striped" is an impossible color for single gallon of paint.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snipe_hunt   The sous at my last job got this one dishwasher really good with "oh shit, go grab the gallon of striped paint downstairs!"

With a good foundation in logic and cursory knowledge in every little thing the modern world provides us information with, I would play off of the ignorance of the time and make it look like I was a gifted wise man.   this sub is my favorite    Is it worth a life? What about if it was your stuff? Your computer? Your car? Would you kill someone who was taking your entire life savings if you knew it was the only way of recovering it?  A computer is not equal to a car, but are very much similar compared to your entire life savings.   None of which the young man was likely to be running away with.  But either way, the reason why none of this should be happening in the first place is that we operate under a justice system.  What's actually absurd is the fact that people go through such lengths to defend murder by means of vigilante justice. Because, no matter what position you take in terms of whether or not the store owner had the proper motivations, the store owner committed a murder.   Even more, the store owner murdered a young man for what was presumably petty theft. So not only did the he murder someone, but his arbitrary punishment far outweighed the crime.  And further still, I seriously do not understand why people really want to reserve the right to shoot at fleeing burglars. One would think that it was a) bad to kill another human without the absolute necessity, and b) that absolute necessity requires extreme duress or life threatening danger.  So, no. It is in my mind never ok to blow someone's head off with a shotgun because they were taking property from you.    jesus, I've seen you everywhere today   they turned into super heros   why?   * China invented shit Europe didn't have to make porcelain cups * Europeans thought that those cups were totally fucking rad * some people said "brohonestly, I can't afford those cups." * "well maybe I can interest you in these shittier cups that look the same." * "ooh no, my cup broke... better add milk first." * "lol look at that guy adding milk first, he can't even afford the good cups."

Here's how it is:  Are you ready to be a chef?  Absolutely fucking not.... but  Are you ready to be a line cook?  Fuck yeah dude! You will find your place depending on your current skill, general kitchen intelligence and aptitude for getting crushed on the line. If you are not confident in these last two qualities, you'll most likely find your self on the fry station.   But don't fret! Thats good. If you work hard and are diligent about cleaning, putting out good plates and have a good attitude, you will find yourself getting more shifts and the opportunity to move to other stations. You'll also get an excellent idea of how that kitchen works, who the main guys are and any of the sous and actual chefs quirks.  Work there for *at least* a year, preferably two if you think its a good fit. If you absolutely hate working the oine after a year/year and a half.

It was aule's creation of the first dwarves that drove yavanna to ask for beings to represent her creations in middle earth.

So can you give insight as to what it would be like to walk on said "super earth"?   only in /r/geek are you going to get downvoted for this.   As embarrassing as it is, at one point it was my extensive knowledge of lord of the rings.   When I first saw the ring, I was terrified for MONTHS!

I've seen so many people get fucked up from avocados and cheese.   I refuse!   Every time I watch that movie I just want to fall for Romona Flowers.   I laughed.   Please can someone explain this video? I am unable to watch D:D:   My mother was convinced that playing video games was evil.   I have experienced sleep paralysis for most of my life. When I first started to experience it, there were no visuals, just the inability to move.   Now every once and a while when I get it, I open my eyes and see what looks like spiders crawling out of corners in the walls. It is slightly alarming, but I quickly realize what is happening. I've found that it's actually a great way to drift off and get into a lucid dream... I just kind of "succumb" to the paralysis, and just be aware that I'm dreaming.   I've also had the feeling of shaking on the bed, like what's characterized in those "possession" type of horror movies. Which, needless to say, was *very* alarming the first time.   Awesome, thanks.

I'm an east coast transplant and am silly and ignorant about the pacific ocean in general... Is it going to be too chilly to sit around on a beach towards the end of February?   Thanks in advance for any input!   To be honest, in the first shop I ever developed, there is a comment at the very top of some javascript code that says:  /* *I'm really sorry, this is a horrible mess.  *I know if you're reading this, you'll hate me, but I had to get it done.  *this comment is written in retrospect,  and can offer you no help, but know that my future self apologizes that this code happens to work.  */  	85

Every job i've had let me choose when to take my breaks, didn't even matter if i went out and have a quick smoke whenever i wanted. I've never actually tried to quit. The longest i went without a smoke was 2 days after 15 years, and that was because i was in jail.   I have a computer in my garage for i can smoke n surf the web. Just rearranged my room to fit my desk and computer in there earlier. Desk and computer are going in tomorrow and will try to quit cold turkey.

At first thought they were those pens you get from conventions that have string to hang around your neck.   HOWEVER, the video does show several other people attempting to either get the girl off the ground (interfering in police work), or something a bit more nefarious.  Would agree the actions leading up to that point would warrant a show of force, but think he should have defended himself with pepper spray instead. He was putting himself in danger trying to detain someone that was "running their mouth."  The good news here is that no one was hurt.  Couldn't agree more                Even if you respect bikers when you drive near them.   Even if he is right, just shows that this community and HOA have views that go against the grain. Yes it might be private property and they had every right to call the cops. The way it was handled was the opposite of what the nation saw as right.   The blame really comes down to the original person to tweet out that there was a pool party. A young inexperienced promoter decides to turn a private pool party into a rave and have a DJ show up? Would seem most of the blame would be on the original graduate, that lives in that community, that invited a couple friends over against the rules of that community.

 TBH, I always thought that TPM was the most "Star Warsy" out of any of the prequels, in terms of setting, design, style, and tone.   JJ said he doesn't like it when movies do that - and I get that that's basically all that the Star Trek reboots were, but keep in mind that he A) didn't write those, B) had less creative control over those, and C) was never a big Trek fan.  Kasdan and Abrams are both competent writers, and I'm confident they know which direction to take the story in.   We also have Kathleen Kennedy, who does her job of producer very well. We have an excellent cast, and I'm sure every other aspect of the movie is in very capable hands.   Wait, *Roger Christian* directed that? Famed creator of Black Angel (soon to be adapted into a feature film), and set decorator on A New Hope? Seriously?   The two trailers we've seen? The great director, screenwriters, and producers? The great cast? The possibility of being able to redeem the Star Wars franchise?   I know :(   So does the Empire's logo if you think about it..   Age 75: Get me a kitchen counter to do the osteoporosis dance!   4edgy6me   Actually, this sub is satire, FYI.   Because what you don't like is sorta the point of this whole subreddit.

Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate....     Eh, I don't think Universal and Spielberg would have much of a problem with it having a *cameo* (R2 did in Star Trek), but I think that would be a little stupid having it as a main character.      Back to the Future  The Empire Strikes Back  Aliens   Totally different style, characters, and ideas. Empire had meaning behind it, and was well written, while Trek was really just a cool action movie with a good cast.   Sorry to disappoint you, but Rogue One isn't a Rogue Squadron movie. Instead, it's about the group of Rebels that stole the Death Star plans in between RotS and ANH   16th   Why? That's a weird assumption to make off a pretty vague title.   Something tells me that little references like that will be scattered all over the new movies      Exactly - he enjoys it, and that's all it is. I *enjoy* eating a donut, but if I hear that there is some scandal involving the management at my local donut shop, I don't immediately go and interfere with people I don't know, have no emotional connection to, or really don't affect the quality of my donut.   Aww man it's like banana bread but better!  EDIT: okay, *just* as good as banana bread   General Grevious, probably   Super Mario Brothers.   Oh wait that happened and it sucked.   I agree - this is the problem I have with movies like Man of Steel and Skyfall, not saying those were bad movies, but Superman and James Bond aren't really dark characters.   Yeah, definitely next friday   I'd love to try it   Honestly? I'll I care about is being able to get the same content.   Is this the end of reddit as we know it?

Other than Star Wars, there's Bridge of Spies, Macbeth, Steve Jobs, The Good Dinosaur, The Revenant, Spectre, Creed, The Martian, Mission Impossible 5, and a lot more that I can't remember.   Im sure everything will be back to normal within the next week    I agree   Episode VI wasn't directed by Lucas either    It wasn't GL who decided that, it was Disney   Star Wars - Episode VII: The Force Awakens  Star Wars - Episode VIII: An Ancient Fear  Star Wars - Episode IX: Rise of the Republic  Had a little trouble with the last one, as we really have no idea of where the series is going.   Hmm... Something tells me they wouldn't use any words that they've already used in previous titles, e.g. "New," "Sith"   You know what I find particularly ridiculous? Is that incredibly small subs, some with as little as 30 members, are shutting down. They have very little, if not nothing to do with this. It's a problem that should be left to the people involved, and maybe the major default subs. Why should the people who don't know what's going on be permitted from enjoying content on subs they want to be on?   That actually sounds pretty cool...   Fuck you Rick Berman!  All jokes aside though, I just think there's this thing in movies today where movies with dark tones generally have darker colors. The Empire Strikes Back is the perfect example of having a dark movie, but still being able to have a vibrant color pallet. This kind of makes TDK look a little dull.  I get that they're good performances, but the character of Bruce Wayne has very little emotional depth. He's a shallow character, and his intentions can be very easily understood. Same goes for Alfred.   I see what you're saying      y   NX really needs to appeal to the Xbox and Playstation market - it has to have a proper controller, like the Wii U Pro, good third party support right from the start, and the specs of any other competing console.   Or the Nintendo Wiii   Seriously? You ask the question like its gonna be hard to find good movies from that time period.  Star Wars Trilogy  Jaws  The Godfather I and II  Alien  Rocky  Blade Runner  Apocalypse Now  Back to the Future  The Shining  Indiana Jones Trilogy  The Sting  Amadeus  Taxi Driver  The Elephant Man  Monty Python and the Holy Grail     It's in the rules   Can't ask stuff like that dude. Could get banned.   Yea   The Star Wars fan base includes millions of people over the globe man - pretty big in terms of size and influence on popular culture   To be honest, I'm glad. I would be upset if Michael Keaton (JK Simmons too) only had a few great dramatic roles, and then went right back to stuff like a King Kong prequel. I want more Birdman and Whiplash!   Read about it man. I went, and it was incredible. It's not just a film, they've recreated scenes and sets right out of the movies, and everyone is in character. You can trade with people, have food and drink, and go on different quests to find things - if was fantastically well done, and very very fun. A must-go for any Star Wars fan.   I don't know what time zone you're in, but it's at 25 right now.   Have you seen the episode? It's the same model PEZ dispenser   You might be in trouble. Just went from 25 to a 26...   There're plenty of PG-13 movies that are the story the director wants to tell. A rating shouldn't automatically mean the movie isn't the best quality.   She made the point of how they keep changing the way you play their consoles, with styluses and WiiMotes, and how it goes against what you grew up with and what you loved.  Is she familiar with the idea of time moving forward? Of things changing? Of people innovating and doing something different?   It won't happen as a remake, but more likely a sequel or reboot - if anything, I can almost guarantee you that Colin Trevorrow will direct   Ornithologist   Philatelist  Philanthropist    [Family Guy's Seinfeld Parody](http://youtu.be/ZPJSJPkpU1s)   No problem   My personal favorite    Serious tag, man.   As a reminder, those bills are $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100.   But it doesn't need it    Stanley Kubrick's Lord of the Rings starring The Beatles   *Raiders* of the Lost Ark is the full title   Shelley Duvall in The Shining. Not *horrible*, considering Kubrick basically tortured her.   It's a toy. And don't start complaining saying Disney is going to ruin Star Wars with stuff like this, because similar merchandise existed way before the purchase of Lucasfilm.   Well obviously you haven't seen enough... It's hilarious, with a lot of memorable characters.   Look up Magic Leap   What do you mean?   It's similar to what HoloLens is, the idea of virtually altering your real environment   I guess so    Seinfeld is not popular? Dude, the series finale had 76 million viewers. That's like a third of the country.    I thought I read it was Borat   Just curious, but what would be an example of pretentious commentary?    Ripley is the better character, no offense.    Not when it turned out to be an actual thing - HoloLens, Magic Leap...   A DeLorean, Uranium, and a vest   There was an episode of the show where Karl essentially invents the concept of Augmented Reality, and both Ricky and Steve say it was the stupidest thing they've ever heard.   In the original movie I meant   Why? Because there wasn't a constant stream of action and dinosaurs? Because it developed the characters and story?   Yeah I guess so. I'm more expecting just a trailer than anything, this was only an idea.  By September, everything will have a "OHMYGOD LOOK ITS STAR WARS" kind of feel, once all the toys and new books and games come out.   I saw it in regular IMAX with Tomorrowland and that alone made up for all of the movies flaws   Newman!  Known on reddit as jake4545   Trust me, they do not.   It's not *that* crappy. You can still tell what it's supposed to say...   What about that comment above that you have 7 down votes for?   Why?   Spielberg as potential director maybe?   TIL you don't have any common sense in knowing that it is not a reboot   Why not? Up and Toy Story 3 did, and I'd argue that Inside Out is just as good as those.   Definitely - I think this is Michael Fassbender's Oscar year, whether it's for Steve Jobs or that.   Me and Earl and the Dying Girl? Inside Out?   Not gonna happen.   Buddy you won't find any way to read Star Wars until December. I bet you less than 8 people have actually read the script in its entirety.   He might've been the cloud guy?   I like them too - what's so wrong with them?   Definitely - whatever it is, it's gonna be big news   I would think Disney would want a high quality version of a trailer to be released as opposed to 15 low quality leaks.   Lenny and Carl   Jake fucking Lloyd was in the background at 26:59 waving his arms at the camera. Oh my gaaadddd.   How is it a reboot when 6+ characters are returning? And it takes place 30 years after the last movie? And is a sequel? And is referred to as Episode 7? And takes place in the same timeline as the other films?   	109
 Yeah, in your case, you might be better off farming wolves in the orphinarium or whatever the hell the place is called (as the wolves have a higher drop rate than gargoyles) just to get the last few chunks you need to get your BB to +9.  You can probably obtain the chunks you need for that last upgrade in 30-60 minutes.   You don't belong here dude.  You need to be way more reactionary, cynical, and unnecessarily aggressive over the most inane shit, then defend your angry, insecure delusions till the bitter end.   Yep.  I turn 30 soon myself, and while I do get in and enjoy an occasional binge, my time isn't free, and it's definitely worth more than what it once was, and I'd prefer not to have to spend it mindlessly killing werewolves over and over so I can get this one last chunk to finish this upgrade so I can play competitively with a new weapon... but, ya know, fuckin casuls.   Let's have a bloodborne playdate sometime, and while we're busy with the important shit, maybe the old ladies can talk about shoes?   One useless line of text, and neither have you, or any number of the other numerous complaints in this post.   Hahaha.  Funy that you mention that.  I had actually taken that exact same screen shot awhile back when I accidentally found that angle.  Purely horrifying!   Shaman bone blade the maiden and laugh with glee as she gets raped by spiders wielding spiders as weapons!   Troll is troll?   I appreciate your sensibilities, and the fact that you didn't decry the changes as the end of the world.   The game is already limited in builds, PvP, diverity, replayability (since it is fairly short is easy), and opening it up a bit to reward players where it's due (chunks from bosses, etc), and to allow people to have fun with each other is just fine with me.  Plenty of people don't co-op at all, and just because it is available, it doesn't mean every new or inexperienced player is going to call in a level 200 toon to beat the cleric beast for them...   This game is already short and easy, and the PvP is severely limited and very samey due to a lack of builds, armor (that is more than fashion) and weapons (which brings creativity and more diversity).   A few changes to open the game up a bit isn't the end of the world.  Blood chunks were stupid anyhow - unless someone out there really enjoys mindlessly farming the same static mobs in the same location over and over?  At least we can see some more diversity as we hunt for them.  Having too few chunks available only limited the game more than it needed to be and already is (and weapons you could play with competitively on one of the four to five available builds). There is no reason that they shouldn't drop as rewards from bosses and be available at a high price.  Whether it was for the same reasons or not, FROM apparently agreed.   As for co-op, well, not everyone co-ops, and not everyone seeks to have a high level come in and kill their bosses for them.  The game has been out for a few months now, and plenty of people have already made plenty of progress or beaten the game, and if players don't really know anyone to set a password with, they are out of luck there anyhow.  It's not like you can give newbies +10 weapons and blood rocks, and just because they made a wide range of co-op possible, it doesn't mean everyone will be rushing to have a level 100-300 beat the Cleric Beast for them.   As for the PvP, well, it's already very limited, and most fights feel fairly same-ish, as we only have four or five builds to really choose from.  Invasions were already put on the back-burner in this game via the mechanics FROM chose and intentionally put in the game:  clearly they wanted red invaders to be at a disadvantage (unlike every souls game in the past), and they wanted to give them a real challenge, at least, more so than griefing PvE players.  The crux of the problem here is they gave us no better alternatives a la covenants that are worth a damn, arenas, and in general, more PvP and multiplayer options.  This was a real step backwards imo, and aside the general lack of diversity and builds in the game, this is the biggest thing limiting the game at present, and as other people said, aside some major over-hauls, I don't see how they can fix it.   Both you and Hydrall make some great points.  Whoever downvoted you had no good reason to do so, especially since you said what you said so matter of factly and friendly.   BB's covenants are shallow and lacking, the PvE is very well designed, but also very short, it needs more multi-player features, and in general, between the lack of armor (and armor actually having function as much as fashion) and weapons, and thus creativity and variety, I really do believe that BB will have a much short shelf-life.     I put BB down for a bit and started playing SOFS a few weeks ago myself (along with vanilla to play with my brother), whereas, when DaS1 and DaS2, I couldn't put those down or play another game for a minimum of four to six months, and even then, I'd always come back for more PvE, PvP, and to try some new builds and ideas, like I couldn't get enough, compared to BB, where I have already made all the builds available, beaten the game+chalices with each toon, PvPd with them, and already sort of been sated, as it all feels so samey.  BB is a master-piece to be sure, and the story is cool as shit, and the mechanics are tight, it's just not the best game FROM has made, specifically when it comes to multi-player :/    And I agree with you there, though it makes co-op more player friendly in general.  If someone were to ask me to help, I'd just use an un-upgraded weapon to level the field :D   Wow.  So much cynacism and gloom and doom here.  Just because you hold an opinion about the reasons behind the game changes, or anything else, keep in mind that IT IS possible that FROM made these changes for reasons other than what you assume.   I keep seeing comments like:   *"This is the end of the series,"* but BB was already a short and easy game in the first place (easier than any of the past games).  And it definitely needs some tweaks to have more longevity.   *"The PvP is now ruined and totally unfair,"* As if us red invaders and our PvP builds and practice were ever fair to us griefing what usually winds up as PvE hosts in the first place?  Didn't FROM already make it clear that they didn't want red invaders to have it easy at all in this game by way of the game mechanics themselves?  And didn't FROM make it clear that they didn't want invasions (host griefing, usually favoring the PvP build invader) to be the focus?  The biggest problem here in lou of the former, is that they gave us no better alternative, and what they are missing is a non-penalized PvP option such as unique bells, arenas, more useful covenants, as well as some sort of PvP option without the health nerf.   *"FROM is caturing to teh casuls."*  Maybe.  Or maybe they thought they made some bad decisions in the first place?  Maybe blood chunk farming is a boring and redundant time-sink and shitty design, and they realized that chunks could be as good a reward as anything else in a chalice dungeon?  Maybe they never intended for certain things to work out certain ways in the first place, and they are now fixing what they see as problems and mistakes.  It doesn't mean "the casuls won the day."   The point is, this game has its problems, but they existed long before any of these patches, and just because FROM makes a decision to change something in their game that they have a right to, it doesn't mean that the elite circle-jerk has lost and the casuls win.  IMO, the game's lognevity is already severely limited by many factors, and it will take more than a few minor changes to give it the oompf it needs to really stand up as a good and long-lasting multi-player FROM game.   If you want to PvP (and mostly fairly), there are plenty of options in this game, and there is no reason for you to not find it.  If you were looking for invasions though, ie., the easy griefing of hosts, it seems like FROM already made it clear through their game design that they didn't want that to be the focus of PvP in this game (or much decent PvP in general, for that matter).   To me, it seems like FROM made it clear that they didn't want this game to be as much about griefing players with red invaders as the previous titles, hence bell-maidens only spawn statically in a few locations, when you invade you get a health nerf, and if you invade other places that don't have bell-maidens, then you will most likely be fighting a 2 v. 1 battle along with your health nerf.     To me it just seemed like FROM's way of saying, "fuck you red invaders - have a real challenge."   This game is great and all, but it was easy and short in the first place - and now they added a mechanic so friends can co-op easier with their friends and multi-player in this game has been pretty clunky and shitty most of the time (though the previous patch helped a bit), more than anything else in FROM's series, even more obnoxious than SM at times.  If anything, these options are even more important for a game like BB that is already lacking in variety and replayability.  I don't understand why you are so cynical about all this, and why everything they have done is somehow catering to casuls.     How about a different side of your personal mind-set and opinion, that maybe FROM thought they made a mistake by making blood chunks a boring grind or redundant by burning through NG cycles to aquire?  Maybe they wanted people with friends to be able to play with their other friends?  Maybe they regretted some of their decisions and ideas?  Maybe they want to keep changing the game to make it better in their eyes?   Whoa.  Why so cynical?   I thought PvP happened regardless of preset passwords, and even though people have gone back and forth to figure the level ranges out, I thought it was sitll determined by some sort of +/- level range factor?   Edit:  or is this something about the covenant mechanics?   Best way is to probably post/offer your services here and on the hunter's bell, that way people can summon you with an agreed upon password :D   Hmmm, in the OP IW said he checked for chunks after killing the cleric beast in NG+, but nothing was available.     Someone else just said "blood chunks are available to buy after defeating One Reborn. Just tested this on NG+ "   Yeah.  I had a pwmf22gu open last night to which I had already killed the first boss.  I cleared the second boss, but I don't think I got anything other than a blood gem, BUT, I did clear the pthumerian elder on the 3rd layer and he dropped 2 chunks along with a blood gem.   There is a messenger bath vendor (just like the blood echo shop) right outside the hunter's cabin, through the side door in between the stairway entrance, and the entrance that loops around next to all the chalice gravestones.   You call me hypocritical?  Because this is pretty funny at this point:  For not reading my replies, you sure are angry about them.  Keep it up, cuz at this rate, along with the #1 businessman sticker or whatever trophy you received, at this rate you'll get the "Internet Asshole of the Day Award."  You just have to keep acting like a totally irrational, dishonest, disingenuous dick-head that refuses to listen to logic or reason or provide a cogent response.  Go on, I'll say it for you:  *la la la, I can't hear you, I'm not listening, la la la*   No, that's not necessarily what I meant or what I meant to imply, but as far as game design goes, you do bring up interesting points, and I am always happy to hear when developers or players come up with new and unconventional or non-traditional ideas when it comes to 'upgrades' or character's powers and progression (scaling, horizontal progression, etc.), but I digress. Inconvenience might have not been the best word on my behalf, as I am all for working and earning rewards in any game.  Adding chunks to the chalice dungeon is brilliant in that regard, as I'd rather upgrades/items/rewards/etc in any game come from a hard and challenging encounter, rather than having to say, repeat the same action over and over again (ie, killing werewolves for chunks, as it is very basic and redundant).  Sure, chalice boss dungeons and chalices in general can be a bit redundant and mindless as well, but it still remains more rewarding than the former imo, as there is more adventure there, especially making uncharted and new dungeons.   As for purchasing chunks, well they helped compensate for that by making chunks so expensive, also, I'm not sure at what point they even become available in the game cycle, but it is surely fairly mid to late game, and again, it's not like they are cheap.  So even if you had all but beaten a new game cycle with a new character, taking into account other gear and insight items/armor you'd want to buy, at most you could only buy 4-10 chunks in one play-through, which isn't much, but it would depend on how you acquired and spent your insight, whether you did the chalices immediately or after the main game, and some other factors in there.   Cool.  Thanks for the info, and thanks for making and updating this post :D   Edit:  On a related note - do we know what triggers the insight vendors to start selling chunks?   So...having to beat the game multiple times on new-game plus cycles to experiment and play with new and different upgraded weapons, (one of the few and limited things that really brings some much needed variety in this game, especially on competitive levels and so forth) was some sort of great design idea to you?  Not only is it fairly redundant, but I like to believe that FROM realized they made a mistake there by making chunks so few and far in between.  I'm glad they at least made blood chunks expensive to be on par with their rarity, and I'm fine with blood rocks being so rare, but honestly, farming is busy work, and it is a lazy approach to game design in any game imo, and I like to think that game developers can find more creative and enjoyable methods for players to experience their games, methods that don't involve time-sink busy work.   To further expand on it, once you learn Bloodborne (it isn't hard, as it is a very short game), it isn't hard to make new characters, or continue on older ones, to beat the game all over again and farm all the chunks on each playthrough.  You can even obtain all static chunks in less than an hour, but the point remains that I think it was an over-sight to begin with, or at the least, I think FROM didn't realize it would be seen and experienced as such a bother or restriction in the first place, and at the very least, I'd like to believe that FROM realized there was no real *need* for this hindrance.     The question is, what real value did it add to the game, other than an oddly imposed inconvenience?  Especially if you have multiple toons as many of us do - multiple toons who we ran through all the chalices with and optimized and so forth and already spent a lot of time farming chunks and gems with.  I bring this up for those of us who are and who were willing to put the time in to aquire the gear and upgrades, yet still thought the lack of chunks was a bad design choice, to offset the attempt to justify this argument as some sort of hardcore elite gamer vs. casul opinion.      Wow.  How do you go about internet cynicism, specifically, reddit-grade-ass-hole cynicism so eloquently, politely, and concisely?  I need to work on that...   Yeah, I saw a few other posts here mentioning getting chunks and gems at the same time, which I think is pretty cool, but to be more specific than my initial post, I am just hoping they kept the original and systematic approach of radial gems from pthumeru, waning from Isz, etc, as it helps stream-line the farming process, and adds some method to it.  I don't really care much for farming anything in any game really, but it's nice to know where to go if players are looking for something in particular.   I was wondering the same thing.  If gem drops are now completely random, then it seems that this will be an annoyance since you will have to randomly farm randomness for completely random drops, rather than at least narrowing it down by farming specific chalice type bosses...   Looks like the insight bath vendor messengers show up even if you don't have 10 insight :D  Finally, that was a fairly stupid mechanic/idea.   Just checked this!  Awesome.  Finally, there is more of a use for insight!  Now we just need a better use for blood echoes :D   People down-voted your posts because you are being a total asshole about all this.  I said OP made a dick-move, and explained why I came to that opinion, and right away, you attack me with all manner of inane and irrelevant shit you pulled out of your asshole;  from claiming that I am a newbro, to calling me a vaati fanboi, ad nauseum.  Apparently OP believes he made a mistake too in some way, shape, or form, as he deleted his post.  What's that tell you?   And then you have the ovaries to throw the word straw-man at me?  You never once addressed what I said (aside adding in a few assumptions), and you instead attack me?  Fuck off with your stuck-up horse-shit that no one cares about and your irrelevant bull-shit.  If you act like an aggressive, socially inept basement dweller, surprise surprise when people assume you are just that.     And not that your petty "newbro" bullshit matters, but yes, you are wrong.  I've been playing the souls series for many years now, and again with your asinine assumptions, what does that have to do with OP's original claim and my dissenting opinion?  Go find a post that OP hasn't deleted yet and jerk off to that you fucking jerk-off of an asshole.   Haha.  Well done.   Haha.  Just realized your comments were downvoted to hell.  That's what the community thinks of you, apparently.   Now who is being a dickhead?  And this is pretty funny, considering you're the one had the nerve to bring up the "community" to me.  Is this how you usually treat people in your community?  Because this immature, *I don't wanna hear it la-la-la I'm not listening* childish bull-shit is pretty goddamn immature and toxic.   Yes, isn't this community so nice - all the toxic assholes like you can get together and act the self-righteous and self-important, dicks for no reason at all, because, well, I guess you are just entitled to that.  So what are you, 14 years old?  La-la-la you're not listening?  Gonna go bitch and sulk with the other toxic assholes in this community?  And as soon as someone brings up something that you disagree with, you tell them they are fanboys and to fuck off, with no mature or cogent argument?  Yeah.  That's what i thought, and that's what I get for expecting more from socially inept troll's in their mother's basements...    Fair enough.    You might be right about half that.  The problem is, even if we put 99 in health, we can still get chumped the fuck out by 27% gems in Ludwig's and chikage in a few hits.  I don't think they thought all this out well enough to be honest :/   So, do you still have a link or name for whoever you were talking about saying that 150 was a good meta?  I mean, I still think it's a bit high, as you can be super versatile and have a lot of survivability, but like you said, PvP is fairly limited and all :/   Wow. You must be one of the community founders, since you are bold enough to speak for it, and bold enough to assume to know what the hell I really think about all this. Of course credit should be given where credit is due, but some vague accusation doesn't constitute proof, proof which I have yet to see, because as it goes with a lot of people, there is a lot of conjecture in between what is given in the game, so go figure that a lot of people wind up with similar conclusions. As for your comment about IN4 Das2, I have no clue what you're talking about. The game was a great RPG, it just wasnt a great souls game, but that didnt make it any less fun. Miyazaki still directed it with B team doing the rest, but hey, yeah, fuck it. It's not a souls game because you said so, and you made it clear that you speak for the community, being an all pretentious, presumptuous and self-important prick about it.    Edit:  To be clear of why I think what OP did is a dick-move (and I said dick-move, not that OP is in fact a total dick), is, he should have confronted Vaati about it first and foremost in private, rather than throwing open the soap-opera door.  Instead of screaming "I'm 99% sure Vaati ripped me off" right off the gate, he could have talked to him in private, or at least attempted to, and then made a decision from there.  As OP said, Vaati denied it, and if we take his word for it, than that means all of OP's accusations are for nothing.  Just think of this:  if your wife or girlfriend thought you were cheating on her, wouldn't you rather her confront you in private, and be emotionally mature human beings about it, or would you rather her kick in the door of yours and her's family reunion, screaming that she thinks you cheated on her?  Do you see where I am going with this?  OP acted the melodramatic house-wife who did the former, and the husband said, "no, I did not cheat on you," so now apparently the whole scene was made for what?  Attention?  Jealousy?  The demand for recognition?  I'll let you decide...   I do agree in giving credit where credit is due, but what I'm saying is, plenty of us posted and continue to post our lore theories and ideas (most of us without monetizing it) and I'm sure OP wound up at the same conclusions as a lot of us, with the rest being filled in by conjecture and what little room there is for originality and speculation.  I've been discussing the lore since release with others just like the OP, and there is a give and take and we definitely influence each other's ideas by said discussion, and plenty of us have wound up at similar conclusions or pointed out where we thought we were wrong or right, all without claiming pledgerism, but I get it. Vaati is an easy target, and OP got the attention and recognition he wanted, with little regard to any truth in the matter.  I still have yet to see any proof that OP was pladgerised, other than vagueries and the other givens that go hand in hand with discussion of a FROM game.    This has nothing to do with being a 'fanboi' as you so eloquently put it, rather that OP went about this like an asshole.  I would have said the same thing if he made claims against Terra, ENB, Davecontrol, silvermont, or anyone else.   Vaati is just one of many people who make decent videos about FROM's game lore.  Sure, he wasn't the first, but just because ENB did it 'first,' doesn't mean Vaati should be derided for it.  Shit happens all the time in any field, in any subject, on anything.  Vaati isn't even my favorite, but he does produce his videos to a higher quality than most, so I'll give him that.     Well said, especially because I have seen no other proof of actual plagiarism, other than the common references to in-game items and etc that are used by a lot of people.  Go figure that a linear game with a few pieces of cryptic lore start to sound the same and leave the same conclusions after awhile :/   I just read your update.  You think Vaati unconsciously or consciously borrowed from your works?  I'm sure after days and weeks of reading reddit posts about the same game, the same items, and a lot of the same conclusions, you would never do the same thing to anyone else either, huh?   I don't buy it.   Edit:  Last thing I have to post here (I should have just done one long, thorough post, sorry for that), is that I find it funny that you say, "please don't make any knee-jerk reactions," which is pretty damn hypocritical, since it is exactly what your bold claim with little no no evidence here is.  Way to be a dick about all this.   This was a dick-move.  I agree with a lot of other posters here that you went about this like a brat.  You should have contacted Vaati personally, first and foremost, rather than post this for attention and recognition.  If Vaati didn't contact you, you could have warned him you would do this, and then mentioned that you already tried to contact him for a reasonable amount of time in your original post.     This is a passive-aggressive, drama-inducing shit-fiesta.  What did you think was going to happen?  I think a lot of people are just sour on Vaati because he makes decent money doing what he does, and people say he is a band-wagoner, yet they couldn't do what he does, nor do they attempt to do so, but still they remain jealous, or they think that the original lore posters on FROM games in the souls series somehow hold a copyright on speculating and theory-crafting about the games/books/whatever that they love, as if they were the first ever to do so on a video game or movie or book or any other medium.  I get it that the souls series is unique, and thus, this seems more unique, but it's not new to the art world....     Yeah - but it can infect you without even being hit by him, and drain your health super-quick, and if you're busy dodging, you can't even use an antidote in time.   The one-shot grab is a given, as it can kill a lot of higher levels in one-shot if there health is already low and they are already poisoned :D   Yeah - or we could stop using 27% damage gems on weapons :D   Some of the weapons are easy to make OP with minimal investment.  A LHB without 27% damage gems is still a powerhouse, and you can get it there before you even beat the game.   Edit:  But again - it's not a matter of it being like dark souls or not.  It's the same fact of the matter that there is little to no sacrifice or focus in your build once you really start pumping levels.  This is the same argument it has always been...   Aside loose structure points, general FROM lore interpretation of citing items and in-game descriptions that everyone does, and the Lovecraft quotation, the only other thing I've seen anyone on here mention as proof for OP's drama-inspiring claim is the "mensis school being ripped into the nightmare" idea, which to me was a natural conclusion. My point is - neither of your phrasing was original or what I would say is plagiarized, as such imagery fits naturally into such a violent and weird game.    I bring this up, because I never read OP's thesis, but I have seen vaati's vidya, and before I read of any of this, the imagery I had in my head is one of the school ' ripped into the nightmare'. That is the natural picture I saw in my head and the exact word I thought of for it too - in some sort of poltergeist (when the house was sucked and ripped into another dimension) or crazy ritualistic fashion. If anything, a lot of the lore and speculation sounds similar, especially on the parts that are easier to agree on or figure out, and so far I see this as coincidental, especially because no one has given any actual example of plagiarism other than 'they sound similar at points.'  Go figure. A lot of us have been posting lore theories since day 1, and a lot of people and ideas posted before and after us sound similar or even the same.    My question would be, for all the people who post long-winded videos and essays, how much of 'your' work has been influenced by other's ideas?  I'm sure there are plenty of ideas that were borrowed without being cited, even if it was an 'original' thought.    Edit:  clarity n grammar   Poison becomes a bigger danger, specifically for the AIDS from the blood starved beast.  For dicks like him you can use blood cocktails to distract them, and things like oil urns and molotovs are helpful too.   As other posters have said, you can run past most enemies, which is a good idea provided you are stocked up on supplies.   Most of the bosses are actually quite easy in BB compared to DaS1 and 2 onebroing (agility sucks!), you just have to follow the mechanics and be patient.   Good luck.    I do appreciate that Bloodborne is one of the few Cthulu/Lovecraft mythos related games with an actual Lovecraftian mechanic (insight vs. insanity/frenzy) in it, I just wish they would have made it a bit deeper and more useful :/   There is actually fur growing out of them, it just hasn't poked through their layers of muscles and fat yet... ?   150 is really high though.  At that level, you don't really have to make much of a focused choice or sacrafice, as you pretty much have enough points to max (40-50) health, endurance, and two primary combat stats.... ie, arcane and dex, STR and Dex, Dex and BT etc.   Edit:  Aside my original toon who I just kept leveling due to having too many souls, my main toons/pvp'ers are all at level 98-110 though :)   I know I'm late to the party, and I agree with some of your points, but I think you overlooked the real reason and the most important reason that the chikage is even worth mentioning or using, is that it is based around a Bloodtinge build - one of all of four to five different build types available in the game.  Seriously, in terms of build and challenge options, this game is very lacking, and with how different the playstyle is on a Bloodtinge build is, it becomes important that we have chikage as a weapon and an option.   Aside the unique nature of the Chikage, the Bloodtinge build is the only build that can really utilize ranged weapons (namely Eve and repeating pistol) for consistant and decent damage, and no, I'm not counting the cannon with it's former 10 and now 12 bullet requirement, as you can get far more damage out of Eve with those same 10-12 bullets, and we won't even get into bone marrow ash.  Again - it opens up a different play-style, and to utilize it to its fullest (as with any build really), you have to do more than just spam R1, and it can involve a lot more micro-management, which can be fun.   The point is, as others have said, the Chikage with an appropriate BT build is a very different and fun playstyle compared to how similar the other builds can play, and this is important in a game with very few build options.  And for the record, my first toon was a STR build that was really fun to play, who settled with the versatility of the hunter's axe, as it was strong, and the movesets were great for crowd control and general damage.  I tried using the Kirkhammer, but between all the narrow hallways, wonky cameras on big bosses, and etc., I couldn't stand how the kirkhammer often took up most of my screen, and made it impossible to tell what was going on.  I wanted to like the wheel, but I just couldn't stand how slow it was and how short the reach is, even if it could be powered up and hit multiple times and etc.  My second build and one of my favorites was pure dex with the BoM/rifle spear/saw cleaver and finally BB as my primary weapon.  I love the burial blade moveset, but I hate that you have to pretty much beat the game, and then farm deep into chalices to really max it out with appropriate gems, compared to how early you can get Ludwig's Holy Blade, and how easy it is to get high damage on the axe or hammer or Ludwig's.  But my favorite build to date is a 25STR/50SKL quality type build who uses the OP Ludwig's for the hell of it sometimes when I want to roflstomp PvE/PvP, but primarily uses BB because it's pretty much my favorite weapon, and sometimes the BoM are fun too, because it is the only option we have for dual wielding blades in each hand.  (Worth noting, I didn't PvP much with my STR builds compared to how much I PvPd on my BT and dex builds, especially my dex builds.  Those are fun!)   It's not just the hype or over-ratedness of the weapon, it is just the simple fact that we only have four different builds available in this game (five, if you count quality).  Thanks for reading this :D   And people wonder why the term "slut" is a perjorative.  Dumb bitch asks him to fuck her, then fuck her in the ass, then give her a rusty trombone - then he complies, and she claims rape, after she already bragged about fucking all of her ex's friends and getting an STD... see where I am going with this?  It's also a matter of how it affects the woman's psyche, vs the lack of an effect on a man's psyche.  Very few women can be successful sluts, plus, being a stud takes some serious status or charm, but I digress.   The point is, the dude should probably raise his standards, even for a fuck-piece, and I hope this bitch gets what's coming to her...   These are all good points too.  I helped my brother get into DaS and DaS2 by co-oping a lot with him in his early to mid play-throughs, and before long, he was beating bosses and eventually the game itself, by himself, or with other summons.   Edit:  Keep in mind, you could always let your friend summon you, and you could use an un-upgraded weapon, and slowly chip away at the beast without killing the boss for him.   Eh, if he couldn't beat the asylum demon and never went back, I wonder about his longevity in this game as well, though I know for a lot of people, once they learn the mechanics and get over the initial difficulty hump, they get significantly better, and eventually these games become pretty easy.  However, if your friend in general lacks patience and intelligence, then I wouldn't count on that.   That being said, the cleric beast is pretty close to asylum demon in that he looks large and menacing, but he is a push-over - super-slow and stupid so as to be an appropriate first souls-type boss of the game.  He can focus on using oil urns and molotov cock-tails, or shooting the cleric beast in the head to trigger viscerals.  Other than that, your friend has to learn to dodge the heavily telegraphed swings and slams, and he has to learn to be patient, because that is the epitome of FROM's games.  You will be punished for being impatient and sloppy.   Yeah - if there was at least a bit more diversity in the layouts, the tilesets, the enemies, and even the bosses, I might have been more excited to grind them out on a few different characters, but they are pretty goddamn boring now after three toons, and soon a fourth on the way once I am done playing DaS2 (again).  I usually put a movie on my other monitor :D   With the limitations of builds, weapons and items in the game, the best you can do imo (aside low level runs or new toons) is limiting yourself in what weapon you use, or at least changing it up (I never used Ludwig's till my third or 4th build, and my gawd, that thing is a killer).  I do appreciate that playing the game through with different builds using different weapons does feel like a significantly different experience, but that seems to be about it.     You could try something more odd like the wheel or stakedriver since you have a lot of STR, and couple it with the cannon, or you could try the quality-type cleavers, but other than that, don't expect much of a change in NG+.     If anything, I'd suggest making an all around different build.  Go either dex or arcane or BT (which is actually quite fun for PvE).   WarSouls 40K Space Duneborne?  I love that game!  Would play it for sure!   Haha.  I remember reading that article over a year ago, and in the comments I left something to the effect of:   "I thought this was going to be a game review, not your goddamn personal existential crisis?  Go outside and play and get some sunshine dude."   ME's ending sucked big balls in major ways.  No idea what those assholes were thinking, as the ending went against everything that made the series great - the characters, the plot, the stories, the everything... so stupid    That patch is taking you hours to download?  Stay away from PvP please!  :P   That?  That was added, uh, to make the game truly terrifyinh?  *You'll go hollow...*  *shudders*   Sudoku*   Well, the community was split with SOFS' release, but I have seen plenty of signs and co-op action when I chose for SOFS.  I also went back to vanilla DaS2 to play with my brother, and I joined him in his play through on one of my old 800k SM builds.  We're now closer to 9million SM, and we've seen a lot of action in both invasions and co-op for the majority of our play through, so other than people not needing or wanting co-op, or maybe one of those odd SM brackets, I can't say I've had the same experience.  Even at such a higher SM now, I still see tons of summon signs in the usual places (Iron Keep, DLC bosses, King's gate, all the newb areas back at low SM, etc.).   It's probably your SM, your play time, or the community on the xbox. (I'm on PC).   Loved dual wielding maces and craftsman hammers, though the range sucks, and they are kinda suck for PvP, but they can wreck if you learn to utilize them for catching rolls and that forward step of the L2 powerstance.   That being said, I love dual wielding the black knight greatsword and majestic greatsword on my powerstance pyro build.   And honestly, pretty much every other weapon as well.  I love the heide knight swords, the sun swords, the shadow daggers, regular longswords, you name it!   I agree on soul memory.  Bad mechanic, to a point, but a lot of FROM fans like making multiple characters anyhow, and so that went on anyhow, or you could just back up and restore your toons.  The agape ring wasn't the best solution, but it would have been much better if they put it in the game off the bat.  I am going to be the first person ever to defend SM here for a moment, or at least say that I can see why they chose SM as a mechanic, as this game made it far easier to level higher than 100-150 metas, on top of having more stats and no useless stats, and what you got is a vast amount of options when it came to your builds.  It isn't as simple as comparing it to DaS1, as DaS2 added too many new stats and build options, which was pretty awesome.  To defend SM further I'd say, at least gave us lots of options with the different covenants and summon signs (loved the usefulness of the small sign), as well as the name engraved ring, which made most of the SM problems that interfere with co-op non-existent for me, at least.  Overall, SM has been and continues to be less of a problem to me than how shitty multi-player was in BB for the first month and a half of it being out.  Now it has been patched a bit, and I am already sated with the PvE, and bored with the lack of variety in PvP.     Sure, you don't necessarily need a bunch of similar yet different skin weapons, but you can't say it doesn't matter, as fashion-shouls has engrossed people in these games since day one, and has done a lot to increase the shelf-life of FROM titles more than most people will admit.  As for BB, well, you have like, one OP-primary weapon for each of the four (maybe 5) build types, and a few lesser weapons to compliment that, which frankly, is shit for options.  Sure the design is great, but at this point I'd love some more clutter.  Please, give me some more weapons to test and play with and PvP with.  I'll agree, the clutter can be annoying, but over the years, I've tried a lot of those options, and found enough nuances and changes to say that a lot of it is warranted, especially when they have unique looks, reaches, and movesets (this being most important).  As much as I love the design of the weapons and armor in BB, less isn't more here.  More would have been better, even if every weapon wasn't as cool as the burial blade.   I definately agree on the lag being a consistent turn-off in FROM games, but that hasn't stopped me, and others (who PvP far more ravenously and frequently than me) from enjoying these games well past their base PvE games, and well past their primes (and what would have been any equivelant game's prime).  The problem is, there really isn't much of an alternative for these games out on the market.  Sure, there have been a few indie clone-likes and soul-esque influences popping up here and there, but in terms of fluid yet weighty combat, coupled with real risk-and-reward game-play and loss (and we won't even get into FROM's unique story-telling), the market is mostly flat and stagnant when it comes to challenging the player's mind as well as their skills in the unique way that FROM does.     Black Knight weapons are fire weapons in this game, so it would be best used with flame weapon as opposed to sunlight blade.  You'd be able to get much more AR out of it that way, since the weapon buff spells increase AR by a flat amount, plus a percentage of the elemental damage.  I'd suggest something with lightning inherently in it, such as the heide weapons, or find what other weapons get awesome damage with lightning infusions.   You're all the result of a bunch of retarded monkeys who had butt-sex with a fish-frog.  There!  Are you happy?!   Really?  A lot of FROM fans have posted quite a bit about it, how they are already back to playing Dark Souls 2 (myself included), especially when it comes to PvP.  I'll definitely be back to playing BB soon, but after making a few different PvP builds and taking them through the game (chalices included), and using them a bit for multiplayer, I already feel sated, whereas, with DaS1 and 2, I couldn't put them down for months on end, and here, a lot of us fans are already bored or sated with BB after a month and a half.     I mean, the lack of weapons and armor that creates a lack of creativity and build variety, on top of shallow, pointless covenants really kills the replayability of the game imo.  I am just one of many to think and say that, and that's not even getting into the clunky-ass multiplayer system, the lame-ass limited invasion bell-maiden system, or the long loading screens.  I know the patches have helped a bit, but there is no way to make up for the fact that there are so few builds and challenge options, especially compared to DaS2.  Sure, a large group of people flock to the metas in these games anyhow, but I saw some crazy creative and fun builds and cosplays in DaS2, and continue to see more, whereas for BB, there are only a few weapons in the first palce (let alone versatile and powerful ones), and the primary OP metas are Ludwig's or BT builds, or the other three weapon options we have.  I mean, I can't even get annoyed at the meta in BB, because there are so few options.  That being said, the weapons and fashion that are there are great, but super limited.  The game in general made me think over the whole 'quality over quantity thing,' and at first, quality is very important, but for the longevity of not just the PvE but especially the PvP, quantity becomes pretty damn important, if not, just as important.      I'd say go for a onebro or other challenge run, though that might be a stark contrast/too hard/too frustrating coming from the unbearable heatness of bad-assery OP that is magic/hex in DaS2.   Honestly, I've played pretty much every base type of build in both PvE and PvP, and one of my favorite has been dual wielding.  Whether it's two maces, two swords, two rapiers, just in general, playing in powerstance is fun as fuck!   Eh, to be honest, after having played FROM's games for years, I found Bloodborne to be pretty damn easy, especially once I became accustomed to the quicker pace and mechanics.  I loved the original Dark Souls, but the reality is, the awesome level designs hid the fact that it is actually a pretty short game once you learn your way around, but so it goes with most games.  The same thing goes for Bloodborne, which was pretty dissapointing.  Dark Souls 2 was a bit more non-sensical yet straightforward in design, yet it still seems larger and more sprawling, though I don't know or care to know what the actual differences in size and length are, as I enjoyed each experience for what it was, and the best part is always discovering it for the first time.  It becomes pretty damn easy after that, once you know an area and a boss and their tricks.  As for BB, sure, there were a few tough spots, but I was able to kill most bosses in one or two goes, and even the cursed dungeons became trivial very quickly, all without the easy to OP Ludwig's.   Even the NG+ cycles and lower depth challenges are pretty easy once you get used to them.  Sure, you can get punished easily, and playing carelessly will get you killed in any Souls games, but I think once your familiar with FROM's tropes, secrets, hiding places, etcs., they become quite easier in general.  That being said, between variety, creativity, and nuances of a lot of the weapons and armor, I found a lot more replay value in dark souls and DaS2 than I have in BB, which has been a total bummer, but it is still a masterpiece of a game :)      I thought the closest break-point to 100 was like, 99 agility?  And the next one for more i-frames was 105?  Thanks in advance for your reply :)   I though the "el-em-en-o-pee" part of the alphabet was one complex letter :D   Dude... I was thinking this too, but you can imagine the depths of madness you would be peering into, attempting to discipher that thing?  It would be like reading the Necronomicon backwards on Friday the 13th after summoning forth Lord Cthulu!    LOL   Don't take Ambien too long before bed-time either, because then you wind up doing things, like dropping your phone in the toilet :D   So why'd you bother to respond at all then?  If you didnt read what i wrote, then you have no actual response for me, as the rest of what I wrote is more important than BB's clunky and limited matchmaking system. Sure, it works, but it working is no substitute or defense for it working well. That, and the fact that you can only invade/be invaded by default in all of three short portions of the game is still pretty lame. As for your reply in general,  it's a pretty dick-head way to go about things. To paraphrase - *'hey, I didn't read what you wrote cuz fuck you, but I am presuming to know what your thoughts, experiences, and opinions are, cuz I'm just that special of an asshole'*   Next time, don't bother, and don't tell me to chill.  And I ain't your fucking 'fam'. What are you, 14?   I agree, and at the same time, I don't think it would be altogether impossible for them either, they would probably just reach their sadism threshold much quicker than your ravenous FROM fan :D   Yep.  So many games make it nearly impossible for you to lose at all, and even if you do lose or die, BAM, one save/load screen later, you are right back where you were :D   And you were dead on about your above post - it's all about skill.  And that skill can be learned and honed, and it is all about that skill :D   But practice and patience and timing your skills with any of FROM's games will definitely improve your odds, and make you a better player intentionally or otherwise, and that process of learning and getting better (as deemed mandatory by the gameplay itself) is what has made FROM games so satisfying...  The point remains:  it is about skill.  The game itself will make you more skilled if you don't give up on it, whether you level up or not.   It's not just a lack of weapons, it's a lack of options and builds, and thus creativity and nuance.  The covenants are shit, the options are extremely limited for items and weapons and armor, and the multi-player bell system sucks in the first place (never mind the loading screens).  Don't get me wrong, I love the game, but there is a reason a lot of us have logged far more hours in the previous Souls games in PvE and especially PvP, yet we find ourselves already sated with Bloodborne.  It's a master-piece to be sure, but I didn't (couldn't really) put down any of the previous Souls games for months on end, and I found myself feeling done (for the moment) with Bloodborne in less than two months.  I know I'll be playing it more for sure, and definitely sooner rather than later, but the game is extremely lacking in so many options and diversity and challenges, period.   I really don't see them adding enough of a diversity in weapons and armor and gear (and thus creativity and nuance) to make the PvP feel any less samey.  Sure, it was fun at first, but I just don't think the items in game nor the mechanics and shallow covenants leave much room for multi-player (specifically PvP) longeviity  :(  (Hell, even I am already back to playing DaS2 :/)   To a degree, I agree, but at the same time, Bloodborne felt fairly easy to me, because once I became adjusted to the new mechanics, I was already accustomed and familiar with FROM's tropes, secrets, and methods.  Sure, there were a few surprises, but aside the defiled chalice and a few other select moments, in most ways, Bloodborne felt pretty damn easy to me, I was able to kill half to most of the bosses on my first or second try, and it was definitely easier than DaS and even a lot of DaS2 for me, and I didn't even use the easy to OP Ludwig's my first playthrough.     I'm not bitching or complaining, as I love both games, but I am just providing your point with a counter-balance, as BB is extremely lacking when it comes to multi-player and PvP anyhow: never mind the stupid bell-system and the crap loading screens and connectivity problems, there are bigger issues with the shallow covenant system, a lack of invasions, and worst of all the immensely limited builds, not just in weapon choices and fashion, but also creativity and nuance.  A lot of the things you take issue with on DaS2 are the reasons why it made PVP so fun, and have such longeivity, and it is those same reasons that a lot of us are already bored with BB and back to playing DaS2.  Sure, BB is a masterpiece, but it just doesn't have the options for builds and challenge runs and diversity and multiplayer that the previous titles have.    Give it time?  Bugs and health debuff and lack of invasion and bad multiplayer connectivity and shallow covenants and OP weaposn that can 2 shot an invader, etc aside, there is a very distinct lack of builds and options and thus creativity and nuance in this game, and it makes the PvP redundant and boring rather quickly.  I love this game to be sure, I've had some awesome PvP, and it has some of my favorite weapons and combat mechanics, and it is definitely the best game of 2015, but PvP sucks compared to previous souls games.  We've had time, and many players on this subreddit and elsewhere are already gone back to playing DaS2 :/   Which is wierd, since M-Man was still director on DaS2, and he let B-team give us so many PvP options and nuances and covenants and etc :/   I love this game, but with the lack of fashion and weapon options, and the resultant lack of nuances, creativity, and builds, I'd say nowhere near as much as the previous games.  Throw in the shitty multiplayer, the lack of PvP support, and the shallow covenants, and bam, I'm already back to plyaing DaS2, among a lot of other FROM fans.  Sure, I'll be back to play more bloodborne eventually, but in the meantime, I'm already bored with BB PvP :D   Worth noting, I sadly don't see any DLC being much of a remedy for this, unless they make some fairly major over-hauls to a lot of different things...   I agree for the most part, though I disagree with the lack of variety not being a major problem in Bloodborne.  It's not just a lack of variety in weapons and armor (fashion) in the game that is a problem, it's the lack of builds and nuances and creativity that results from that.  It is the reason I haven't been playing Bloodborne for the last few weeks (and the same goes for a lot of other people that have posted here and elsewhere).   The lack of variety is a problem, not just for the lack of builds that you can play with in PvE, but it is an even larger blow to the already shitty multiplayer and lack of PvP content.  Coupled with the shallow and near pointless covenant system, it sucks pretty bad.  I actually used a shit ton of variety of weapons on my first and subsequent playthrough in both DaS1 and DaS2, so to me, this lack of variety is a much bigger problem than you make it out to be, and it is the reason I am already sort of burnt out on Bloodborne, and back to playing Dark Souls 2.     I loved Dark Souls 2.  It wasn't the best SOULS game, but it was the best RPG of the Souls games, and it had an awesome amount of fashion and other options, it was still the best game of 2014, it was still fun piecing together all the lore (though not as original and enigmatic as DeS/DaS, but so goes any trope once it isn't new and shiny any more), and it was and still is the best multiplayer experience in all the souls games for both PvE and PvP.  Surprisingly - coming back to DaS2 after BB makes me appreciate DaS2 even more, and BB just a bit less, though I still consider BB a masterpiece in mystery, horror, and an all around awesome FROM game.  Sure, I think BB has an amazing atmosphere, great design, etc., but there is a reason I played Dark Souls 1 and 2 far more than BB, and there is a reason I am back to playing DaS2 :)   edit:  stuff and junk   Sweet!  Now make a few more toons with different builds and take them through that quagmire of fun! :D   Problem is, FROM was just too damn good at what they did between weight and commitment/conservation of movement.  I swear, Dark Souls was one of the first, if not the first game I played where I *truly* felt like the weapons really had a worthwhile difference, not just in damage and mechanics, but namely their feel.  A spear felt like a spear, a hammer like a hammer, a sword like a sword, etc - and they have only made it better as time has gone on.  Pretty much every other game I play, most weapons feeel and play nearly exactly the same, and without the rest of the combat/endurance system's depth, it all just looks and feels like I am swinging around a wet noodle :D   Yep, and the only thing that really compares with the risk/reward, weighty feel and gameplay, and the satisfaction, are games with similar mechanics - and most of those were inspired by FROM in the first place :D   The rest of the games feel like Hello Kitty Island's Adventure :(   It kinda sucks actually.  You get ridiculous amounts of souls from NG+ cycles and the deeper chalice dungeons, and you wind up with nothing to spend them on :(   Whoa. They just got goth served.    Yep. It's funny that that's the standard FROM set for themselves. You'd be lucky to break 10-20 hours in a lot of games out there, and then seldom or never play them again because they become redundant or weren't that good in the first place. Don't get me wrong. 10-20 hours for most any game is fine with me, so long as it's top notch in terms of mehanics, story, etc, (depends on the type of game and multiplayer), but still, I can't help but be a little disappointed that there isn't as much variety and replayability in both PvE and PvP for bloodborne :|   Believable, but again, more like acquaintances and people you really like who you don't seem to see that often.  Sure, at 18, you might have been busy, or you might have been freshly graduated and unemployed and not in university yet, but did you really have intimate relationships with all 60 of those people?  Did you know all of them well?  Would any and all of them helped you move, or help you move dead bodies?  I'm talking about quality and depth over quantity.  Again, I have tens and hundreds of acquaintances (not talking social media), some I know well, some not so well, but as far as "friends" go, again, I reserve that for only the people I have intimate relationships with, people I've known longer than even a few years.  That sort of thing.   It's ok, you can just say it - PC gaming is better, for a zillion different reasons.  Never mind how stupid GFWL is and was on DaS1, the point remains, it is a better experience across the board, in software, hardware, and options and mods  :D   Right, but he does have a point on DaS being realesed on PC opening up FROM's games to a much wider audience, that in turn brought in a lot more money and fans for FROM, which made sales for DaS2, the DLCs, Bloodborne, and now SOFS what they are.  In short, I'd say, "it made a lot of people happy," but that sounds stupid as fuck, as you can't measure happiness with dollars :P   LOL.  I was thinking the same thing.  Realistically, how do you have 20 friends?  I attribute a lot of weight to the word, so 20 sounds high, because it takes a lot of time and energy and emotions to maintain honest, healthy relationships.  Sure, I have many aquaintences, but friends, those people who would be there to help me move bodies, those people who I can spend my time with rather than wasting such a precious resource, well, those are quite fewer in numbers :D    I agree for sure, but I'll take quantity from FROM, as they seldom fail to deliver with the quality.  Bloodborne's awesome level design hid the fact that the game is super short, and it hid it very well.  There are tons of souls fans who are already sort of... dare I say, 'bored with the game', or at least taking breaks from it due to how limited it is in build variety, challenge run options, and multiplayer.  So long as they follow their previous forumlas for DLC (cut content for DaS1 that was completed, or the planned crowns trilogy for DaS2), it will be just fine.  Those DLC's fit, because they weren't just tacked on, they were already heaviliy rooted in the plots and premises.  Worth noting, lots of fans bitched about DaS2 for any number of reasons, some justified, some nit-picking, but they still had a lot of fun with the game and played it for hundreds and thousands of hours.    The point is, for lots of FROM fans, they couldn't put down the Souls series games for months and years at a time, and not even two months past release, the same fans are already feeling done with BB because it is lacking in the many different options, covenants, and content the previous games have.  In this case, more is better.  Bring it on!   But it wasn't a planned expansion per se, it was content from the original game they had to scrap because they ran out of time, hence it fits so well, and is so fucking awesome.  It wasn't additional, it was just completed, and more of the same :D   Haha.  Yep.  I too bought a $400 Bloodborne player.  Sony is fortunate that it has such an awesome exclusive, as the multi-platforms are accessible to anyone, and from what I've played and heard, the other exclusives for PS4 have been crap, but it seems AAA gaming has been crap and stagnant for awhile now, which is why gamers welcomed the challenges and mysterious games that FROM offered, as they were actually being creative, original, and trying new things, which both the industry and the player's need.  Here's hoping for at least another exclusive or two to really make the PS4 shine.   My only (mostly only) complaint about BB is that it sucks how short the game is, though the awesome level design hides this fact well, and it also sucks that there really isn't much build, weapon, or armor varieties.  I was also bummed out in how they changed invasions/multi-player mechanics.  I'm already playing SOFS and falling in love all over again with DaS2, and I know I'll be back to play more Bloodborne, but I think back to DaS/Das2 and I couldn't put them down for months on end...   Especially when the nearest bonfire is so far away :(   Kitten Souls?  :3   You hit the nail on the head on pretty much everything worth mentioning.  And not just that difficulty is cool again, the challenge was welcome after so many crap indie and AAA games over the years that make it hard for you to lose period, and at the least, you just save and reload with no real consequence.  The industry was rife for some change in a different direction, and I feel like DeS/DaS was able to capitalize on it without even realizing what they were doing.  I'm not even going to mention how brilliant (intentional and otherwise) their story-telling is when it comes to the video game medium, as it uses the format in a way most games don't even consider.... can't wait for more :D   Yes, some bugs and glitches are almost expected, just like you can find typos in most any written text in a hard-copy book or online, but the product not working in the first place is the biggest fucking no-no!   What other people explained stands, and while it might just seem like invasions are a trolling and obnoxious mechanic (and so it often is), the reality is, it really adds a few more layers of excitement, fear, and the unknown to the game, deepening the game-play experience and atmosphere.  It helps keep you on your toes, weigh your decisions more, etc. :/   Yep.  I'm already back to playing DaS2, both vanilla with my brother, and SoFS solo, and I gotta admit, what makes these games so fun is the massive amounts of builds and challenge runs available.  I will no doubt go back to playing Bloodborne from time to time for both PvE and PvP, but they are both very limited at the moment.  Bloodborne's awesome level design hides the fact that the game is actually quite short, and not really that large or sprawling, but what is there is 10/10 for sure.  What is truly lacking is diversity in builds and weapons, and thus options in both PvE and PvP, and it really hurts the fuckin game.  Aside some mind-blowing, game-changing DLC, I don't see there being any remedy for it, and I just don't see it having the same longevity as the Souls games.  Sadly, that's not even getting into the shallow, pointless covenants, the shitty connection and multiplayer issues, etc.   I'd rather FROM start on Bloodborne 2, DeS2, or anything else, rather than focusing on BB DLC, though a solid DLC release somewhere down the line would definitely be welcome :D     Yeah, there are no worthwhile exclusives out for the PS4 at the moment, and triple A and big budget gaming has pretty much been shit the last few years, aside a few formulaic series of games (like Battlefield and CoD, but even those are pretty redundant and unoriginal at this point.  The point is, thank gosh for FROM.   At the right time?  That's an understatement. Between die-hard souls fans buying PS4's specifically for Bloodborne, and there being no worthwhile exclusives for the console in the first place, it sure was the right time.  That, and not to mention, big-budget gaming has been pretty much total shit as of late...   You sure your at the right doors?  Did you go to the king's gate instead of shrine?  Etc?  	105
 It would make sense for them to be able to switch stance to hit their opponent's opening side. Rather, it seems like just train from one stance.      The constant squats and quadricep soreness from SL5x5 are taking a toll on my martial arts training, makes me slow and laggy.  Wanting to try something new. Anyone recommend? Hopefully something that includes arms as well.      And this sub doesn't like OC, what the hell?   no, lets not encourage flashTV circlejerking.   apophenia    Very nice.   I would have picked a better shot of the Arrow though. Preferably with a mask for a more updated look.   What does OC mean?   What does OC mean?   I love your banners, I think we should used one of them for the default sub banner.   What the hell is OC?   What makes a Gorilla, handsome, to humans?  EDIT: Oh, by girls, the article meant Japanese Girls.   YES, THANK YOU. Was that removed from the final cut?  I noticed that end of the trailer where Ted says "I think I want to sleep on a bed made of your voice" was placed at a different scene in the final cut of the movie as well.   "Hey did you see that blonde coach over there?"  "You mean the one with the nicest boob job money can buy?"   Very professional response.   The fucking automatic captions for this video are ridiculous: http://i.imgur.com/8JeBDEy.jpg   You're a Purple Belt in BJJ working towards Black and one of your co-workers asks you what belt you are to which you reply, "Purple." They reply, "Really? You've been training for 3-4 years and you're only a Purple? My 10 year old daughter has a Black Belt."   I saw a trailer of Ted 2 (that I cannot find on the internet) where Ted  and John are driving with Sam when a huge car accident happens behind them which ends up in (an explosion?) I believe. Sam then goes like "omg are they okay?" then Ted says, "Yeah they're fine, they're waving at us! They're giving us two thumbs up" or something along those lines.  Does anyone know what I'm talking about?    http://youtu.be/eJTuQrIhWyI  thank you. any english translation video?   Why are his arms so fucking long?   Why no legs? :(   Other than that everything was perfect. Minato looks fucking epic   THIS.   I mean, can't you just delete them?   ...You still can't save your game in the middle of a battle. You've never been able to. I don't understand this one.  This. What the fuck is OP talking about?   The scene in The Flash (2014) where Barry Allen goes back to the past to save his mother from being murdered but ultimately chooses not to.   Ever tried any of the Mooto doboks? I just ordered one, they feel so breathable.   DANG, your school sells the Adidas Dobok for only $85? That's a really great deal. It goes for $120 at my dojang, $30 more for school embroidered name.   He didn't "break" Shamrock's arm exactly. He just inflicted so much damage to his arm that Shamrock couldn't continue the fight after the rest period following round 3.  Most of this fight was stand-up because of Shamrock's Ego. He claimed he could beat Le, a Champion Kickboxer, at his own game.   damn that'd be epic yo   I was being sarcastic. I've been on /r/MMA for awhile. We all know how downvotes work here.   Holy fuck that looked so dangerous.   Have you tried eating?  I laughed so fucking hard. Oh my jesus.   He beat Cung Le   Thank you.   What the actual fuck.   I'm 18   5'7", I'm still growing but I'm worried that doing gymnastics/tumbling will close my growth plates. The doctor said I could potentially reach 5'8", possibly taller so I want to optimize my growth as much as possible. Is there any scientific evidence or study that supports gymnastics/tumbling does not link to stunted growth? On the surface, it might have some truth as it seems many gymnasts aren't very tall.  I really want to learn how to be more acrobatic and do flips, aerials, roundoff back handsprings, etc. but I'd go against it if it means not growing any taller.   Gotta take into consideration that Cung is also a Taekwondo Black Belt. His kicking game is above average.   Would you fuck your mom?   What the hell? What's the reason for using a "Smaller" Octagon?   Fuck your downvotes   Was this in Pasadena?   Was this in Pasadena?   THIS MAKES ME HOPE THAT IT'S TO BRING BACK THE HYPE FOR A NEW SERIES, YO.   THREE MONSTER REBORNS   Pot of Greed is unbanned?   Karin and Sasuke's daughter and not Sakura's? Also, did Sakura   Sasuke ever get married   why did Sakura choose to take care of Sarada after Sasuke and her biological mother seemingly abandoned her? I was hoping someone could briefly give me some answers.   looked just like from the anime. thank you for the great coloring.   I thought Orange jumpsuits and headbands were mandatory.   Of course in my Ninjutsu school it's pretty much try to wear pants...  Wat.    Wow I'm really out of the loop. Didn't know there was a Naruto Gaiden. Is it a manga or a spin-off anime series?   Very informative answer. Thank you very much. I wanted to buy a snazzy Uniform from my school so I can stop wearing the basic dobok you get at your first lesson. I've bought all my sparring gear from my Dojang but to get the Mooto Extera S5 Uniform (The same one my Master and his children wear along with the advanced students, minus the black trim of course) from them would cost $150 as opposed to buying it online for $99 on Amazon. If it was within a $20- maybe $30 price difference I would go to my Dojang to help support my school. But a $50 difference is out of my budget. I wouldn't imagine it would be an issue but hopefully my master doesn't take it personally.  And yeah! I didn't think wearing a white collar dobok to training as a black belt would be a problem. But definitely keep it formal with the black trim for events such as gradings and competitions, etc. thanks for reconfirming my opinion.  If I may ask, what kind of Dobok do you sport?    Would it be acceptable to continue wearing a White-Collar on occasion as a Black Belt?    Kakashi Gaiden...?   For all of you that're doubting that Boruto was using Chidori - you're not a true Naruto fan. That sound effect is exclusive to Chidori.   what's that vest from?   Eh, Kakashi could do that too around his age.   All those Victoria Secret Models are pretty tall though.   It was from Le's last UFC Fight. UFC Fight Night: Cung Le vs Michael Bisping.   I love you.    Fuck.   Good reply.   That makes sense, I've heard the same theory regarding white belts fading to black belts. In your dojang, are all colored belts limited to only the White V-neck? And is it considered informal for a Black Belt to wear a White V-Neck?  I don't want to spend a lot of money on quality white-collar uniforms if I can't wear them anymore as a Black Belt.   But did it send the opponent flying though?      That Hook Kick to set up a Spinning Back Fist was ingenious. The sweep was very smooth as well. I'm gonna miss watching Cung Le's fighting style. Guy loved his spin kicks.      Do you think it would be disrespectful for me to save a couple bucks by purchasing a quality Uniform on Amazon rather than through my dojang?  EDIT: A Quality "White-Collar" Uniform. Don't know why I'm getting downvoted.   Seems like it varies from dojang to dojang, but is the Black Collar traditionally only for Black Belts?   A fucked up areola to nipple ratio   It was just something I wanted him to keep in mind. Though good wrestling is a great way to close the distance to neutralize punches and kicks, I don't believe closing the distance/takedowns is/are taught in Judo. But thank you for the sarcasm.   Right after that he mentions  "She was already an exceptional competitor, which she still is today," said Morris.   Which kind of contradicts the previous statement.   Fuck you guys, the armlock starts [here](https://youtu.be/u-nEbXZPGs8?t=88). You're welcome.   Kicking on the motion, nice.   A lot of Judo schools don't teach defense against punches or no-gi, though. They primarily focus on Olympic-Style Judo that primarily focuses on armlocks for submissions.   Yeah I loved her [thick ass.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/f7/a1/9e/f7a19e5a4582ea4e5809bfb73467cd23.jpg)   I mean, if that happens then Arrow and Flash won't be connected anymore to an extent. And that's the beautiful thing, they *don't* have to be.   "It's just like the tornado! Only upside-down, and bigger... and *scarier*."  Oh, Barry.   What is "Thawells" ?   Eobard Thawne/Wells combination?   you're the real mvp   Sara wasn't stick thin.   Canary wasn't stick thin. She had titties too.  EDIT: Not Laurel, Sara.   Caitlyn looks so sexy here.   That red doesn't look any brighter than the one in the banner. Have you seen the bright red that Future Flash has in the finale episode?   "Best fights are the ones we avoid." - The Karate Kid  "Greatest victories are the battles not fought." - Jackie Chan Adventures   A fucking plane crash? Jesus Christ.  Makes me never want to get on a plane.   are there more tit pics from this set   Likely because Kishi never intended to make Naruto, Minato's Son in the first place. Plot no jutsu.   perfect aereolas and nipples   How did your dad react to that?   Robin's holotech won me over watching the pilot for the first time. Did he ever use it again in later episodes? I forget.   Don't act like the stereotype about the correlation between black people and crimes isn't remotely true, though. Let's be real, there's some shitheads in every ethnical group and culture but there's obviously a prominent amount of amongst Blacks than in others in comparison. Largely attributed to their history of growing up in poverty and in the ghetto and what not but that's still not a good excuse to be a shithead.  Sorry if I offended anyone unintentionally.   I have a hemorrhoid... on my ass, Stan.      ...considering kickboxing is already an aspect of MMA.      This guy really lost to fat ass Roy Nelson. What the hell.   isnt kickboxing alreadu a part of mma   implyying hw fighters are not in shape   Even styles that incorporate head punches (EX: ITF TKD) limit themselves in what kind of punches they do and how frequently they practice. Many of those fighters don't ever even learn proper punching mechanics. And by TMA's I mean styles such as variations of Karate and Taekwondo.  In many styles of Karate, the only punch that is practiced against a resisting opponent is the reverse punch which is the only punch that actually scores in Taekwondo.  Punching techniques are ridiculously limited when compared to styles such as Western Boxing, Muay Thai, or American Kickboxing.  Watching /u/LawrenceKenshin's videos of Karate   TKD practitioners enter Kickboxing-esque competition really shows how flawed and porous their punching technique is.   Obviously, this does not apply to every practitioner but it seems like the majority of them out there have very bad punching.   tl;dr: Is there a reason that many TMA's put much more emphasis on kicks than punches?   I keep hearing "[This style] is the most widely practiced martial art in  the world" with different styles substituting the brackets. So which is truly the most practiced style universally?   My favorite is "Martial Arts is a vehicle for developing your human potential." He quoted his old Taekwondo Master when he was promoted to 10th Planet Black Belt.   I wonder why he decided to keep it standing rather than follow up on the ground   pound. I guess that's just his way of saying he respects Shamrock's striking. I love how he smoothly turned his back and walked away from it after it swept him.   You've done Taekwondo? You seem knowledgable regarding it.   Who is that girl?   You make it sound as if "Olympic Wrestling" is it's own secret special style of wrestling or something. lol.   Great display of technique here by Le.       Okay, holy shit. So I was about 6 or 7 years old and I was just chilling in my parents' room by myself while everyone was out in the living room watching Spider-Man 2. My parents' room has a door that leads out to the backyard and while watching TV, a FUCKING RAT the size of my 4 year old cousin just scrams through the room and out into the hallway. I immediately follow after it and as it was passing I looked into the other rooms with doors open in the hallway to see if anyone else noticed it.   It ran out into living room and went straight behind the big TV (the Big TV was right next to the entrance to the living room so it didn't have to travel far). I was freaking surprised that NO ONE NOTICED IT THOUGH. My mom, my aunts, and my cousin were chilling on the couch and no one noticed it.  I had my dad take a quick look behind the TV and we couldn't find anything. 12 years later and I'm still very positive that I saw something... I swear, it wasn't an "overactive imagination" or "I was seeing things" I SAW something. Something black. I'm not sure if it was a rat but it was pretty big.  My dad thought I was crazy and they still remember that too but I knew I saw something. I really wish I spoke up about it when I saw it... maybe I could've gotten another witness.  I still wonder where it went from time to time.   Miley Cyrus.   I always think someone is in the house with me, possibly a murderer when it's dark and I'm home alone.   Wow idk why, but the beginning of your post made me assume you were a girl.  "Sounds like **he**..."  Was the biggest plot twist.   This. Took me awhile before I could actually navigate for long periods of time.   That's what I thought! Thank you. Apparently all my friends refer to "The U.S. Open" for Surfing.

What the fuck kind of classroom is this? No order. Just chaos.   I'm being overly sarcastic. Only dumbasses are this unreasonable.   You should never put your hands on a girl in a violent manner.   Do you think this is self-defense or could the guy have just avoided the fight by walking away?   Do you think he would've gotten away with "self-defense"?   I mean he flipped a fucking girl.   "Equality" where women can hit men but men can't hit women. It's wrong to be hitting each other in the first place.

 Cringed at the line where he says, "...a few more concussions." Ugh.   Good on him for knowing when to step away.    I'm actually really concerned for the dog.    Same thing happened in Golovkin-Geale. Of course, he also had that awkward four-minute round, tripped over a camera strap and was put down twice. Just not a good night right out of the gate for him.    Showed up to an interview a few minutes early, as one should. Ask to use the bathroom, as one does. This exact same thing happened to me. Scrubbed it with paper towels, but they shredded into little pieces on my black pants. Opted to wipe it off, but now had an apparent wet stain on my crotch. Ultimately just pretended it wasn't there because honestly, are they going to ask?  Didn't get the job anyway, probably because I peed my pants and tried to cover it up with soap and water.    During the very early days of hockey, you couldn't pass the puck forward. Only back passes were legal, and the original "puck" was actually a lacrosse ball cut in half.    Oh wow. I had no idea. Thank you.    Saw this image of a first edition copy of Robinson Crusoe and couldn't help but notice the obvious speech impediment in the title: http://i.imgur.com/LNO6q.jpg  All jokes aside, I'm genuinely curious as to why this is. Does anyone know?   Good Night Dark Knight   **Blood Meridian, by Cormac McCarthy**  I've been wanting to read it for a while now. I'm about 20% in and so far I really dig it. I know it's not your typical novel with the way it's written and all, but the way he describes landscapes is absolutely incredible. I've even re-read a few of them out of absolute awe.    When he first joined the league I hated that I loved him (Penguins fan here). I mean, that sliding goal footage couldn't have been played more times during that one five-year run.   But I'm a total Ovechkin fanboy and I'm not afraid to admit it. When the Pens got knocked out this year I found myself jumping on the Caps bandwagon, and not just because they were playing against the Rangers.   I really hope Ovie gets his 'ship after all is said and done. I'd hate to see him go out without one.    Agreed. But hey, whatever gets the job done. Growing up, the smartest kid in the class was often the quietest one. Now as an adult, the biggest talker at work is full of the most crap.   Hah translation: "this is what my agent said for me."   Interesting. That first kid looks like he's not even 18.    Vladimir Poopin.    Crosby on food: "It's important to eat."  Crosby on water: "We need it to hydrate."  Crosby on ice: "It can be slippery."  The ever-vocal Sidney Crosby. Remember when his talking to the media was analyzed as much as his game? Some people just aren't talkers.    I Am Legend is one of my all-time favorites. Enjoy it.   Side note: Also the first book I purchased on a Kindle.    True, and all valid points. I think it's easier to identify after a fight, more so than during one.    I'm actually pleasantly surprised people didn't downvote this post to oblivion simply out of spite. Well done, peeps.   1.5 years, 1 link karma. I don't do the Reddits good.    Boxing, to me, is an even exchange of connects while also consciously playing a defensive game as well. My perception of out-boxing is if the one guy is connecting more AND making the other guy miss, then he's outboxing him - because he's landing more punches AND staying on the defensive. A lot of times it's about controlling the flow of the fight and altering the other guy's entire game plan. May-Pac, for example, or Rigondeaux vs. anyone (Agbeko comes to mind, where he literally out-boxed to the point of only getting hit under 50 times).   This is not to be mistaken for brawling, where both guys throw all caution to the wind and just go balls to the walls (Hagler-Hearns).   Just my two cents.    Somewhat related: Apparently he had a really high-pitched voice, although based on the comments in the reddit post this was likely due to the recording equipment at the time.   http://archive.lib.msu.edu/VVL/vincent/presidents/mp3/teddy.mp3  https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/3cp5l9/despite_being_the_manliest_man_in_history_teddy/   You basically defined my entire life trying to get a word in at Christmas dinner.

I know I'm pretty camera shy, so I definitely give thumbs up for that.   Thanks for the posts and I look forward to more.    Why the hell would you even say that?

 What movie to watch: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, The Town, Gangs of New York, or A Clockwork Orange.   Thanks guys.   Solobek.   Birdman.   Django Unchained, I hated myself for waiting so long but wow. That movie was absolutely superb and made me one thousand times more excited for Tarantino's "The Hateful Eight".     That's ambitious.    Hm. Worded it wrong. Know the girl, don't know the guy that interfered.      Paul Blart: Mall Cop      Enfeebling curse and greater sprint.   As a final item yes, it is imperative to late game and will help you out tremendously in team fights with your ult.   My build goes:   Warrior Tabi Executioner Hide of the Urchin  Witchblade  Runeforged Hammer  Qin Sais   I think this is the perfect balance of defense, damage, and attack speed. It is important to have attack speed on Vamana because if you buy a creeping curse you can just simply obliterate your enemies. Then hide of the urchin corresponds with Vamana's passive so well, and Runeforged converts protection to damage which adds on to that. Hope this helped.    I am all about jump parties in smite where people jump up and down before minions spawn, it is just so fun and makes the game more fun. Nothing makes me more mad then when people are jumping and some asshole comes in gun's a blazing and initiates a fight, leading to betrayal and hatred. Please, respect the jump party...do not be THAT guy.        	15

Cheers man    What is the final consensus on the reds and blues time travelling. Did it actually happen or not?    Basically they import their footage. Then place a title or caption with their name on it. You'll see that in the corner of all their LPs. They they have to export the footage again so it will have the name at the top when they bring l the footage together for the main edit.

 She did, actually, which, thinking about it, makes it even more creepey.  She moved from Nevada to Ohio to live with her sister. She never talked about it again that I know of, we sort "lost touch" after she moved, AKA my father thought she was insane and didn't really want her around or talking to us, even though he saw what we all did and just passed it off as an aggressive stray dog.   She's actually still alive, but she's in her 90's now. I've thought about calling her before and asking about what happened more, but I don't want to cause her to have a heart attack or something o-o.    That's creepy o3o. I love the Navajo culture but I never got too deep into the spiritual side of things their lore and their beliefs etc.   I did, however, forget one bit.   Apparently, up until my grandmother moved. She called my mother several times in hysterics, saying that "Yenaldlooshi is outside" or she'd leave messages saying "I'm not safe here, I have to leave. I will talk to you soon"  I don't remember that, I had to ask my mom about it. My mom doesn't even like to talk about it.   I do remember that apparently, several of my grandmothers neighbors also saw the same, large black dog over the course of several weeks.    I don't have any kind of video chat or anything, nor do I have skype, but I do wanna share this story.   My grandmother on my mothers side has always been very Superstitious, for lack of better word, she's not religious, but she does believe in a lot of paranormal stuff.    Her mother was full blooded Navajo and her father was Irish. Either way, she'd never been anywhere East of Montana and she grew up in Nevada.   One year, when I was in Gradeschool, we went to visit her, most of the visit was pretty uneventful, typical boring old people stuff, except she always kept her curtains drawn shut and would always peek out the window and when someone asked what she was doing, she would simply reply " Yenaldlooshi is watching me"   This went on for nearly the entire visit until a few days before we were due to leave, My grandma and my (then) baby brother (he's 19 now lol) were in the front yard that evening, planting flowers when all of a sudden, my grandmother starts shouting "*Insert little brothers name here* get away from that creature! It's not safe!" of course, being in Nevada, we all assumed that my brother had found a scorpion or a rattle snake, so we all run outside, to see my Grandmother clutching my little brother and shaking in terror against the side of the house, standing out in the yard, was a large,black, great-dane sized dog, it was staring at my grandmother with an intensity I'd never seen before. It looked up at us, gave a little huff and bounded off, I don't remember if it moved unusually fast or not, but  do remember it had really deep yellow eyes.   When my mother asked my grandmother what had happened, she kept repeating " The Yenaldlooshi has found me". She moved a couple weeks after that.

 Amber Lamps!   So rude...   This is how you write a story. Just sit tight and read that first paragraph -- really read it. Like, out loud, and just think on that for a second. Absolutely airtight, methodical, but beautiful. That's a storyteller.      Is it just me or does everything relate to work lately?  You can't leave your job, you'll starve. You can't stay where you are, it's got you contorted in ways that aren't natural. It's a lose-lose.   Start [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1uqbu6/it_said_hello/). You're in for a treat.   Hey, I'm a major film producer and I'd like to turn this into a blockbuster motion picture.  Sorry, I'm not really. I just got tired of saying "I want to see that movie."   I like aliens. It's like nosleep up and forgot about them, but when I was a kid, those were some of the scariest stories.   That epic moment when everyone's standing around saying "someone should," and you realize that someone is you.   [$9.50 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/8883704894/ref=cm_sw_r_awd_2tl.ub07BYWMA)   A sort of table of contents at the beginning. Something to help you come back to ideas you had a while ago.   That's a good Dad, right there. With a sixth sense for someone trying to harm your kid.   My partner comes out of the gas station bathroom around the corner. Jesus, I hope he washed his hands. This is what he does to me, though, makes me act like a worried mother. He's just a kid after all.      I set that up a while ago, so maybe I did and forgot. Awfully perceptive to notice that.   [Not exactly it](http://www.reddit.com/r/DarkTales/comments/2ybfr0/senseless_violence/), but hey, I came through.   This story is my jam.   I was 13. Just a kid. Thats a tender age, you know? Impressionable. I didnt deserve to be around that kind of senseless violence.  My parents murdered my dog, Rex. Cold-blooded. It was because I spilled milk on my mothers nice tablecloth. I tried to wash it before they found out. I was a kid, so I didnt know better, but if you wash a white tablecloth with a new red shirt  I came home from school and Dad was still digging the hole. I thought the dog was sleeping in the shade of the tree, but he was covered in blood. It matted his yellow fur against his skin, making him look smaller and more pathetic than Id ever seen him.  *Outraged* when I turned a tablecloth pink, but my fathers shirt was splattered in red.  Not entirely sure what to do, I called the police.  Cops in small towns know the people in their neighborhoods. I went to school with the officers son, a fat, bratty slob who cried when he didnt get his way or when he lost in H.O.R.S.E.. The officer knew me, but worse, he knew my parents. He went bowling with my father every Saturday.  Damn thing bit me, said my father. ...Got this crazy look. Didnt even bark or growl, just chomped down on my leg.  Lies.  The police told him that he couldnt bury an animal in a residential backyard. That things didnt stay buried with how many scavengers there were around, and that hed need a permit to dig more than a few feet. And so Rexs body was taken away from me.  Something changed in me that day. I felt it in the way my heart beat when I lay in bed that night. The strong, strange new rhythm continued and it informed my dreaming mind. In the morning, I had a plan.  I went to school. I paid attention in class, dressed down in P.E.. I even raised my hand to read out loud, something no one did if they could help it.  That night at home, I offered to make dinner. Kraft Mac n Cheese from the box with hot dogs and ketchup in Dads because he liked it that way.  I didnt bark or growl, even. I just watched as they slid to the ground, yellow artificially-colored foam seeping from their mouths.  I got some plastic sheeting from the shed, and wrapped them up good so that they wouldnt start to stink, and then drug them down the hall to the big closet. Dad was heavy, and I had to take a break before I moved Mom.  When Dad had remodeled the house, hed accidentally switched the knobs for the closet and the bathroom. Wed ended up with a closet that locked from the inside and a bathroom door that stuck in the jam.  I tried the knob and made sure. It was locked.  Things were simple. I stopped going to school. When I needed food, I took money out of their sock drawers and bought it from the Fred Meyer at the end of the street. I did whatever I wanted. People sometimes called, and even stopped by. I got used to ignoring knocks on the front door. No one I couldnt handle until Bill Lewis.  Mr. Lewis was a drunk, but a likeable one. He owned the only bowling alley in town and used his position, such as it was, to get familiar with practically every man in town. People felt bad for him or genuinely liked him, so they gave him things. In this way he got money, cars, a house, even the bowling alley was given to him by the previous owner. Practically everything.  Apparently Dad had agreed to sell him a car; the VW Rabbit that Ol Pop had promised to give me when I was old enough.  I watched Bill Lewis roll away in *my* car, and straight into the lake.  A few minutes earlier, Id told him I was meeting friends there, and asked for a ride. Dad wasnt home to sign the papers, but he could have the car after that. We got to the top of the hill overlooking the boat ramp and I hit him in the head with a hammer. I got out, reached in and released the brake, and he rolled on in.  Shouldnt have been driving drunk anyway.  The neighbor, Mrs. Grayson came over to ask about the grass being overgrown. She died in her sleep that night and then I buried her in the yard. The cops were right. Bits of her showed up everywhere, but the lawn was tall enough to hide it.  I did eventually mow the yard, but after hitting bone after bone, scattered around, I realized that I couldnt be sure.  To *make* sure, the seven members of the Kersey family took a family vacation which was cut short when they pulled out on a particularly dangerous blind corner of the highway just outside of town. I hid in the woods and watched them burn.  The following day, I went to the Fred Meyer with the Kerseys money. Just like always. Just Tuesday.   Just like normal, except that right in the middle of the frozen food aisle is Bill.  Bill Fucking Lewis, forehead caved in, dripping lake water and brains all over the floor while hes trying to decide between a Hungry Man and a Stouffers. I wiped my eyes. *Must be seeing things.* He was still there.  He went with the Hungry Man, put it in his cart with a swollen paler-than-pale hand. He pushed the cart toward me, shuffling along. With dead eyes, he saw me and waved slightly. No big deal. Just shopping. Just Tuesday.  I shut my eyes and wished him away. I fought to exist in a world where Bill stayed dead.  He patted my shoulder with enough force to almost knock me off balance. He gurgled something. Mouth working like a dying fish, ruined lungs just sloshing water in his throat, dead, blank eyes inquiring whether Dad was going to show up to bowl with them this weekend.  I ran, then.  Through the parking lot, past a family of seven who loaded groceries into their RV. Charred, skeletal children hung and played on the plastic kids shopping cart.  Almost home, Mrs. Grayson waved and watered her lawn from her front porch.  Inside the house. Home. Safe.  There was a knock on the door, but not the one Im used to hearing. The *closet* door.  I heard noises. Shuffling, scrambling around in the dark. Hushed voices.  The door wasnt locked. Someone unlocked it from the inside.  The bodies sat facing each other. The floor of the closet was covered with shreds of plastic sheeting. They turned and smiled at me.  Shut the door, buddy.   Definitely nuked. I've heard rumors that he's doing alright, just not redditing anymore. Miss the little bugger.   This is the scenario I'm terrified of whenever I can't remember someone's name.   "Hey, throw it into the ceiling fan, Mark!"   Everyone knows AL is an amazing writer, but this one of his is especially poignant. About as good as a short story can get.   Congrats!   That was... Exactly the same as my message. Aw.  She did offer to create some cover art for me. I can't stand that site though, and shan't be using it again.   I love Peggy.  Parks and Recreation actually had several characters that I couldn't stand, done in a good way because it gave something for the likeable characters to stand out against.  I'll just throw in for discussion how writing and film/TV seem to differ. When you show it on screen, it seems like fewer people in the audience take it as "the director thinks this way." There's been a lot more discussion of actors just playing a part.  But when someone, especially someone less well known, writes a character like that, it seems to be taken seriously more often.  I don't think morality factors in. People rooted for Walter White, and raged against Skyler. You can be right and still come across as an asshole, it's all in the presentation.  People really hate Peggy?      Yes I think it's smaller. It's bigger than 100 like I said, though. At a given time there are 500-1000 people on the sub. Most of those aren't logged in, and therefore can't vote. Some of those are browsing their front page, click to a single story, then click out (probably a lot, I think), given the difference that being in the top three spots make for vote frequency compared to 4-10.  The ones you're left with, the ones who are there, reading nosleep stories... There are probably low hundreds.  Disclaimer: making wild generalizations based on old data with no formal training.   You can't forget the importance of other social media these days, too. Some people friend on reddit if they like your stuff, but a lot more writers post their stuff to blogs, Facebook, tumble, twitter... I don't know because I don't do it, but you get the idea.  You mentioned 50, but a writer with a thousand followers/friends/tweeteaters gets views. And *quickly*, which against the colossal noise of newnosleep is the make-or-breaker.  It didn't used to be like that. Almost no one did that a year ago. I remember because it popped up in the OOC whether it was even allowed. The first time I saw that, I down voted all their stories (they wee posting every day) to offset the "unfair advantage."  So now look at the writers for Spire in the Woods and Penpal. They pretty much came out of nowhere, but their stories are fucking amazing. They didn't come in with followers, but they're still competing for the half hour a day that a redditor is willing to read nosleep stories.  So, no. I don't think that they'd have a chance today because they wouldn't get to the front page, which, if you can't do, only exposes your writing to the hundred or so dedicated nosleepers who go to /r/nosleep and not the millions of subscribers who only see nosleep on their front page.   **March 7th - Figure Drawing** Can never have too much practice drawing the human figure.

I've got a few minutes of pedaling left, let me tell you about what I've built here.  The pedals turn the crank, which I've extended and added a small sprocket to. That sprocket is connected by a chain which goes to a large sprocket. That's connected to a drum which winds a cable carrying a large amount of weight.  On the bottom of the weight is a blade. When the cable is wrapped around a sufficient portion of the drum, a button will be depressed, allowing the drum to turn freely, dropping the weight.  The blade, traveling approximately 60 feet vertically and so weighted, will shear me right in two. My two halves will then fight each other to the death.  If neither side survives the split (as is, unfortunately moat probable), then my last moment will be spent lamenting why I built a contraption that required so much exercise to operate.  Wish me luck!

There are plenty of examples at /r/3FrameMovies if you want to work from a reference. If you want to try this theme on hard mode, try to convey the plot of the movie (as though you were explaining it to a friend who had not yet seen it) without using words. Think about which moments in the movie represent pivotal plot points.  Alternate Theme: Spoilers  Theme posted by meatyelbow  ---  [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/comments/2xnimk/march\_2nd\_three\_frame\_movies/) via /r/SketchDaily        There are two steps to any murder -- three if you're being technical.  First, there's the planning and preparation. If you're the murderer, this is your meat and potatoes. *This* is where you earn your money. Everything that goes into you not getting caught goes into this first step. If it was a chess game (and don't think that it isn't), this would be your opening, middle and end game.   Technically, the act of the kill is the following step. In the bigger picture, it's insignificant, though. A blip. A moment in time at which a threshold is passed. Everything else, the real work, should already be accomplished. This is just the cherry on top of it all. And anyone who's ever eaten a sundae knows that it's not the cherry that you remember. The cherry doesn't matter at all. It just has to be there, plopped on top of so many other carefully laid layers. It's really only the movies and books that make it seem important. They make it seem like something magnificent, they glorify it. They'd better, it's what the audience has come to expect.  Which leads us to part three: the detection. You've played your chess game and now the detectives get their chance to play theirs. I often picture it like a dam. If the dam holds against the probing pressures of the water behind it, then the murder goes unsolved. The important things for the detective are to find the weak points and to have possession of the proper tools required to apply leverage to them. You couldn't use a common screwdriver on a hex head bolt just as you can't crack a murder case without witnesses, evidence or confessions.  The beauty of these rules is that they're all very flexible. Even breakable. A murder may not have any preparation at all, a simple act of passion which ends a life. This may make it easier for the detective, and often does, but *not necessarily*. Remember, the planning and preparation aren't for the murder, but in order to prevent discovery, and so even after the murder is committed, it's still possible to cover up what's happened. Yet other murders are never attempted to be discovered. Either because of exact planning or because of a profound insignificance of the kill itself.  But perhaps the most interesting type of murder is the one in which no one's died at all -- not yet. The plans have been laid, weapons manufactured and at a moment's notice they're ready to be deployed. The "investigation" such as there would be one, is already agreed upon. Damage assessed, fines and treaties settled on. The only thing missing is the order to fire ze missiles.   "I'll take it off your hands," the devil said.  A feeling, a conscience, a soul.  "But how will I love?" I asked him then.  "You won't," he softly spoke.   "But nor will you hate. You'll feel nothing, just wait, I can make you a god among men.   "Think of the pain you'll get to miss. The heartbreaks, the failures, the shit, isn't this what you wanted anyway?"  "Where do I sign?" I asked him then, mind wondering of life without pain.  I hope to god I don't end up in Hell, because I signed with the devil's name.   **March 1st - How-to Guides**          Illustrate some instructions showing us how you do something.

This fella was born with the thirst, and not just like the other bloodsuckers in his clutch of eggs. He had a thirst for human blood.  The rest of Harry's family stayed in the dog kennel they were born in, but the determined little flea made a break for the house. Once outside he saw that the house was on the other side of a dusty hot yard and a pile of junk cars.  His first hop took him to the sand. Grains half the size of Harry dislodged and rolled around him. Dust cloyed his tracheae. In an instant his internal temperature nearly reached the boiling point.  It took a few moments to free himself from the rubble. Once he'd dug himself free and found a suitable launch point on top of a piece of gravel, he lashed out with his strong back legs.  He landed in the mercifully cool shade of a black Buick. Another quick hop took him to the top of the tire. The warm rubber was laced with pits and imperfections that were easy to sink his claws into. Compared to the sun and the sand, this was a paradise. He considered just staying there until he died in a few short days.  But the hunger called.  He soared through the air and onto a welcome mat beneath the front door. Fibers stuck out in every direction. This was it. One more hop and he would be inside the house.  The mat shifted beneath him. Harry couldn't breathe. Just before his vision faded to black, he saw that the cat he'd landed on was wearing a flea collar.                        Mom found my sketchbook again today.  When Dad finds it, he just hits me and yells. I almost prefer it; at least its over quickly. Its Moms method to sit me down and explain why what Im doing is wrong. I dont agree, and she wont change my mind, it just feels like it takes forever. Everyone has heard the story a million times since they were children. I dont know what she expects to happen.  The story goes like this:   The creators redesigned the world with two cities. Two being the perfect number of cities to have on a planet like ours. This one, the one we live in now, is named Alpha. The other, Gamma.  The city of Alpha was made perfect in every way; Utopia. The creators designed it specially for their favored creations -- us -- to inhabit. Before the creators wiped the world clean and started anew, there was war, disease, suffering, *imperfection*. Not anymore.  Little is known about Gamma, other than its location. The twin city is located exactly 180 degrees around the planet from Alpha; 7,547 miles in any direction. Still more evidence of the creators perfect design. Who would we wage war against? Where would a sickness evolve? How would it travel? The two cities are perfectly separated.  But that was in the beginning; ancient history. Over time, the creators city faded and wore down. We were shown how to use it, not to fix or build it. The creators left us alone too soon.   My grandparents grew up in this same house that my parents and I are living in now, but had lived their whole lives never having used electricity. The electronic panels on the walls, now an indispensable wealth of information and communication, had sat dark and dormant their whole lives. For decades, the waste system lay in disrepair. Human waste -- shit, piss, even our dead -- was dumped over the wall and, with great effort (due to the smell), ignored.   I said before that the two cities were perfectly separated. They were, that is, until Alvis Frost was born.   A genius inventor, even as a child, it was rumored that the boy was half creator himself. At 13, he re-designed the waste incinerator so that the ashes could be packed into the beautiful clear bricks used to repair the buildings in Alpha. A year later, he re-engineered the water purifier to run self-sufficiently on solar power. Pumps at the purifier pushed it through the dormant system of pipes and into every home in the city. At sixteen, hed constructed a generator that harnessed the heat emanating from the planets core. When power was supplied to the main hub, the city came alive again.  During that  that the generator was being built, Alvis constructed a flying machine. It would be his last invention.   A commission led by the mayor himself attempted to block his departure. Alvis was nearly arrested, even threatened to be killed, but in the end he struck a deal. He would return within one year, whether he found Gamma or not, and only after he had ensured that the citizens of Alpha would be able to maintain the technology that he had resurrected. Frost waited patiently. Slowly, the people caught on. In a few years time, Alpha was nearly restored to its former self.  Finally, the day came for him to leave, and so he did, shrinking into the West, until he was nothing more than a black dot, too small to be seen.  Nine days later, another dot appeared in the Eastern sky. He had returned. The citizens of Alpha welcomed him with open arms. My mother was there. She said that she thought that it was odd that he never smiled, even when everyone was so happy to have him back. She feared that Gamma was gone. Alvis retreated into his home, saying only that he needed to prepare, and no one saw him again for several weeks.   Then out of the blue, he called a meeting of all the citizens of Alpha. Assembled there together, he put up a picture on the screen. It was the generator that hed designed. He explained how it operated, and what it was meant to do. Next, he showed them the water purifier, and how to use the brick byproducts to repair the structures of the city. He showed them the computer panels, how they lit up when electricity was connected to them, and they could be used to access a wealth of information.  The people of the city were confused -- why was he telling them what they already knew? Hed made sure to teach them these things before hed left. Had he forgotten? Did he not realize that hed come back to Alpha?  Then the truth came out. My name is not Alvis Frost. This city is not Alpha. My name is Hudson Link, and Ive just come from the real Alpha, the one Ive shown you in these pictures.  Ive come to the conclusion that chance alone could not account for the similarities between the cities. It cant explain the way that I look identical to someone born and raised here. It cant explain the... *bond* that exists between us.  Ive been through Alvis Frosts records. It took some time to be sure, but I can now say with confidence that they are precisely identical. Events in this city coincide with those in Gamma down to the day, down to the minute, in fact, to the very second. As I raise my hand on this side of the planet, Alvis Frost raises his in Alpha. As youve gathered here, your twins, differing only by name, have gathered around Mr. Frost. When I set out West on my journey here to Gamma... Alvis too struck out to the West. *Everything* is synchronized. *Everyone* is connected in this way.  They thought that Alvis was crazy. That his nine day journey had caused him to snap, losing track of where he was and even his own name. Of course, never having left the walls of Alpha, no one had seen anything like it.  They had him committed. It was for his own good, they said. Locked in the room of the tower for observation, he fell violently ill. They further separated him from having contact with anyone else. The mayor made it exceedingly clear that no one was to go near him. A disease had been contracted outside the wall; it wasnt safe.  That winter, as the first dusting of snow fell, Hudson Link succumbed to his sickness and died. They say that they found his body leaned against the Western wall of his cell.  The snow in Alphas streets rose and fell as winter came and went. People thought that that was the end.  ... Until a speck appeared on the Eastern horizon. It grew as it crawled closer. Eventually they saw that it was a man.  Alvis Frost had returned. Sun-burnt, frost-bitten, starved and nearly a year older, but alive. Once Alvis -- the *real* Alvis -- had fallen ill, the mayor of Gamma (who indeed called themselves Alpha), had sent him back out of the city in order to keep the illness from spreading to anyone else. His flying machine had crashed over a range of mountains, forcing him to go the rest of the way on foot.  Its strange for me to think that as I pull this pen across the paper, somewhere else, someone who looks and thinks like me is writing the same words somewhere else. That everyone I know in Alpha is all that there is in the world, because their twins are just copies of them.  My mom tells me that because of this, its wrong to draw faces in my sketchbook. I dont understand it. Its like she thinks that by drawing them, Im creating them; causing new people to pop into existence.  And this cant be true, because I am not a creator. There *are* no more creators.  Are there?

It was too late. The pizza boy lady killer had found his next victim.   [Even the rain pauses.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2miv2e/krampus/)  It's not perfect, but I did a lot of new things with this story. It's different for nosleep.   My devious plan worked!   Are you looking for feedback?  If so, I think that it might come across as insensitive if not done with great care. I get that it's fiction and that it's an alternate reality, but people do actually suffer from those things.  The superpowers themselves sound cool, though.   That actually seems to fit better, though it's not what I was trying to write about. Happy coincidence.  Edit: The long way of saying my boss is fucking me and locking me away in his sex dungeon.   The living. The living care if you do that shit to dead bodies.   I like reddit links because they're easy. I'll admit that I am not super familiar with other sites, but you could risk getting into people looking to generate ad revenue. On /r/keepwriting we see this all the time. For someone who's posting their blog everywhere, it's not much of a stretch for them to make an alt.  Maybe something like link posts to reddit and in self posts, you could include blogs and other sites.   Everything's been done. It's a matter of how it's done that's important. In this case, I think, pretty well.   You're crazy! A psychopath!  Family get-togethers must have been fun.   Whoah! Fuck yeah. Someone probably flushed it as a baby.   Thanks. Definitely should spend more time in #WritingPrompts.   Thanks. You've definitely got a participator here. As soon as I saw it I thought of /r/nosleepreruns, which had the same kind of idea.   Oh what is this?  This is just... you're too much.  So my last two stories for nosleep bombed. I've been crabby about it, since writing isn't really the easiest thing for me. It takes a lot of focus and I write *slowly*.   So when Sleep (Off) and A Gift didn't do well, I just thought that no one read them. Worse than that though, maybe I was losing touch with the audience. I was discouraged.  It means a lot that I come here (just randomly, too) and there's my name like people really read my writing that I work so hard on. Enjoyed it, even.  So anyway. Thanks. Perfect timing. And thanks again.      I can't have children. My husband and I have just come to accept that. We didn't have money for a surrogate or an adoption, and by the time we'll crawl out from under our loads of debt we'll be too old. It would be irresponsible to try.  Last year on December 15, I got a letter in the mail. I almost threw it away along with the rest of the junk, but something about it... I think it might have actually been the paper. I'm no Patrick Bateman, but the creamy smoothness of the envelope was somehow just *right* in my hand the way that I'd never considered before. It was pleasing. The triple-folded sheet inside was the same way. I laid it out on the counter, smoothing it out by running my hand over its intoxicating surface and studied the words, the stork logo and even the signature on the bottom.  *"A gift,"* I read. "The gift of creating a new life," which they would deliver for thousands who once thought that conception was impossible.  I did the worst thing I could have done when confronted with that kind of gorgeous promise. I accepted. I called and set an appointment to be seen the next day, then I tucked the letter back into its envelope and stuffed it into the drawer next to our checkbook.  The next morning, my husband left for work and I thought about telling him as I kissed him goodbye. I didn't, though. Some part  of me -- the rational part  -- was sure that it was too good to be true. Just another ad for just-another clinic that wouldn't accept our just-another-insurance-plan. But the other part drew me on with reckless hope and curiosity.   As I got dressed I thought about medical advancements I'd seen in the news that might make this possible. While eating breakfast I wondered what being pregnant would feel like. As I backed out the driveway I wondered what I was going to name her.  By the time I reached the building, my heart was racing with excitement. I hadn't let myself actually feel anything about children since we found out that I couldn't have them. Maybe I really hadn't realized how much I felt that I needed to become a mother. All of that was bubbling to the surface as I pulled into the parking lot.  The building was beautiful, if out of place. It certainly didn't fit the image that I'd made in my mind. The large clinic crouched near the top of the hill and looked out over the ocean. Natural light streamed in through dozens of bay windows that faced the water. The sheer white walls seemed to glow from within.  The receptionist welcomed me and as she was checking me in, having me sign papers and fill out forms. I remarked on how beautiful the place was. It struck me that their usual customers must be paying fortunes to come here. She smiled and said that they're told that all the time, but that it was really more than just a doctor's office. The center focused on the "big picture" for both the mother and the child, and that fertilization was only the beginning. Most of the rooms, she said, were for recovery and bonding after the children were delivered.  "It's important to Dr. Bristol that the women we serve have a calming place during the transition of new life."  A nurse in white scrubs like I imagine Dolce and Gabbana might have made came and led me into the back rooms. She took my vitals in one of the rooms. The natural light and warm feeling of the sun continued even deeper inside the building, away from the windows.  "I'll let the doctor know you're ready," she said, her soft, warm hand resting on the door knob. "... And congratulations. This is such a great opportunity for you." She smiled and left.  I wasn't waiting for long before the doctor politely knocked and peeked in through the door. Once again, I was surprised, but this time I was underwhelmed. The doctor was short and frumpily dressed. Here was the I'm-in-a-hospital feeling that had been missing since I'd walked in.  He didn't say hello or even look at me until he'd thoroughly studied my file in the computer through coke bottle glasses. His red, glistening face glowed against the backdrop of the white room.  "Ah," he said finally. "This is fantastic. I have just fantastic news for you. You're going to be able to have children. As a matter of fact, you're just perfect. Just fantastic." He smiled and rubbed his hands. "So, a boy or a girl?"  "Well, I... My husband and I haven't really talked about this, but I'd like a girl, I think."  "Perfect, though we could do a boy too, if you'd prefer that."  "Prefer it? You get to choose?"  "Well, *I* don't, but we allow all our new mothers to choose. It's our whole philosophy here."  The nurse in white knocked and re-entered the room, carrying a tray which she set on the table.  "What is?"  "To eliminate stress from the whole process. Some women we serve have a great deal of stress over those things. Many can't decide, so we end up delivering them twins. So many twins, actually, it's quite fantastic.  "So. Are we ready?"  "Ready?"  "Oh yes, we need to act fast if we're going to be able to get you in."  "I'm sorry, I was under the impression that this was just a screening. The letter said..."  "No no no! Don't stress. This isn't going to cost anything, and the decision is not permanent. If you change your mind at any time, you're more than welcome to come back and we'll help you through it. Does that help? I had hoped that we would be able to serve you today. A girl, you said."  "So, what, it's just a... some kind of treatment that will make me fertile again?"  "Yes, exactly."  "And... it's not going to cost anything?"  "It's my own very personal interest. Each year during the holidays I offer my service free of charge. A gift."  "And say, tomorrow I talk to my husband and we decide again that we shouldn't have kids... I can just come back?"  "We'll take care of you. Whatever you need."  The whole thing was crazy, but what was there to lose? To gain?  "My husband, though, I mean, what do I say?"  "Say whatever you like... Or say nothing at all. This is your process, it works however you want it to. Exactly the way you want it."  "Sorry, I just... I'm surprised, that's all."  The nurse was offering me a tissue. Tears were streaming down my face, but I couldn't process what they meant. It was all overwhelming at that moment.  "Shall we, then?"  I nodded. The nurse prepared the needle, and Dr. Bristol swabbed the area on my behind with disinfectant. A pinch was all that I felt. I tried not to shake as I held in my sobs of joy.  "All done."  That night I made love to my husband like I hadn't since we were younyoung lovers.   I didn't say a word to him about the clinic or the doctor or the treatment. The right moment never came. The last time we'd even talked about children was years ago; did I really even know how he felt about it anymore? Then after the deed, I felt as if I'd lied to him, ambushed him.   It would be a surprise, but an innocent one, at least as far as he knew.  The next morning I was sore. My legs were wobbly and my stomach was churning and bloated. From the lack of sleep, my head was foggy. On my way to the shower, I threw up. I felt drunk. Feverish.  The day after, I felt even worse, and I was hungry *all. the. time.*  The third day is when I noticed that my stomach was sticking out, even more than it had on Thanksgiving. It wasn't just food, but wasn't it early to be getting a bump?  On the fourth day, I called the clinic again. I made it clear that I had to be seen immediately. Something was wrong.  "Don't stress," the receptionist told me. "Just stay calm and come out whenever you can."  ---  "It's too late," the doctor told me. "Up to the third day, it's possible to remove the fetuses, but at four, it's hardly doable."  "Fetuses? What are you talking about? They're... they're nothing! I *just* had sex. It isn't enough time to..."  "This is fantastic, really. You're going to make them all so happy."  "Them, who?"  "The new mothers, of course."  "What?"  "Well, they're all waiting."  "What are you talking about? They're *waiting?* Waiting for what?"  "For their children, of course. Your children."  "What? I didn't agree to this."  "On the contrary. I'm quite sure that you signed the release."  "But I -- You said that I could change my mind. I want to change my mind, I'm changing it! This isn't what I thought!"  "I'm sorry. It is too late. You should just be happy! Hundreds of women are going to get to know the joys of motherhood because of you."  *"Hundreds?"*  "Oh yes. You see, our method is to fertilize *all* of the eggs at once. One shot. Of course, there are *thousands* of those. After fertilization, we harvest the most desirable according to the wishes of the mother. Through a simple surgery, then, we transplant them from your uterus into the new mother's. You're a hero, really, you've given them a fantastic gift."  "I don't want to. I just... I can't have children. I can't."  "You can't?"  "I'm infertile. That's what they said -- infertile!"  "Hm, well if that's your choice."  "So you'll... stop this. This... *thing* inside?"  "It's too late, miss. I'm sorry. Those other mothers... promises have been made to them. It wouldn't be fair. It wouldn't be ethical. We need to see you in two days. Please make sure to schedule an appointment on your way out."  In the following weeks, I grew. I stopped leaving the house. My husband wasn't allowed into the bedroom anymore, he asked too many questions.  Oh yes, a few times I expected to wake up from a strange dream... A nightmare. I woke up every day, however, to find that nothing had changed.  I never went back to the clinic. I guess I was trying to... I don't know. Wait it out, maybe.  Then the sheets were soaked with blood. Pain rocketed all over my torso. Waves of it, and pressure.  My screams drew my husband, who kicked in the door. They were already coming out. Little sacs with placental tails. I don't know how he held it together.  He wouldn't let me die. And he kept my secret the whole time that I recovered on a half-awake request of mine.  What would I do without him?  Perhaps... Yes, I should give him a gift. He'd love that.  I'm sure I'll do it right this time.   Can't believe I read that whole thing. Barf. Ugh.   /r/darktales.

The Freak's days are numbered, I'd love it if she was sent down for attempted murder, destination Wentworth and let the sparks fly   Bee as The Freak, mind blown   Which direction will the new episodes take then, will they go straight paranormal as that always worked, will it all be aliens, how about some spooky episodes with horror thrown in, will it be from canon or will it be new ideas, there has to be some bridging from the last films / series but instead of getting bogged down I think it's best to kind of forget some past events and tell new stories, that way it's not getting drawn back too much and will let the new stories shine   Describe the characters in one word only...  Bruce = brooding / Gordon = liability / Bullock = grouchy / Alfred = fastidious / Nygma = riddles / Penguin = waddles / Ivy Pepper = prunes / Selena Kyle = climbs / Harvey Dent = flips / Fish Mooney = swims   It means fucked, screwed, done over   Nygma riddles, Penguin waddles, Bullock curses, Jim chases, Barbara exhales, Leslie dissects, Ivy prunes, Cat climbs, Alfred tuts, Bruce broods   And not forgetting throwing pencils at ceilings   Gillian loves knobs   It seems he has a murky past, a dead end job, no missus and now Gordan taking the limelight  I wonder where Bullock is going, will he stay canon or will they throw in a newbie to complete him  Gordon has all the luck, drive and women just falling at his feet, Bullock is most definitely bollocksed  	12

Enslaved for hundreds of years, [falsely reported as inferior by pseudo-scientific studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_racism#United_States:_slavery_justified), segregated after emancipation, subjected to [institutional racism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism#United_States) (especially in Ferguson, MO as cited by a [DOJ report](http://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/opa/press-releases/attachments/2015/03/04/ferguson_police_department_report.pdf)), constantly bashed by conservative media, etc. After all of the history and examples I have linked, do you still believe they are simply "not trying"?    I feel bad if he receives downright hateful comments. Those are just confirming his biases on atheism.   I do appreciate people questioning his beliefs, especially the ones he holds that are ignorant.     "I immediately regret this decision."  -Kevin   Thank you!!!!   I hope so!

The reason he was cool after OP causally explained the situation is because OP is full of shit and this story is made up.   OP is Vince Vaughn.   Sick fucking reference.    Thank you!!!   Thank you for this. I love this show.   Bringle Space Program. Lol    Shoutout to /u/jatwaa, he brought me out of my hiatus.     Drake isn't even in the same league as Cole and Kendrick.  -What I said    They have different musical purposes, you can't compare them.  What you reiterated.       Drake isn't even in the same league as Cole and Kendrick.  Drake makes bangers and gaga ballads (stuff women go crazy over)  Kendrick and Cole make songs about social issues.   Never mind, I found it:  https://i.imgur.com/FQsbMpo.jpg   I can't seem to find an image/texture anywhere.    Idk, maybe his inspiration from the story came from the show?   But a rolodex is not for *your* contact info. It's for others' contact info.   But there is no posession!!!!!   Drunk assholes don't deliver.   I got a creepy-crawly machine for Christmas when I was young.  But I couldn't eat my creations. I wanted cupcakes because I loved food.   We're only hearing OP's side of the story.  Anyway, I must be lost because /r/pettyrevenge doesn't seem like the place to question the revenge that took place. It's more of a "yeah fuck that person" bandwagon.    I try to empathize with people. I wonder what made that lady close her store so early? Maybe a bad day?    The first panic attack I ever had was when I lit up my first joint. My heart started racing and I felt like I was losing control.     I kept jumping up and down saying "you see, it's not a dream because you're not flying."  I continued to touch everything I could because I was convinced that I was dreaming. I went to bed that night and I wasn't the same for months. I was in constant dismay about reality. I would have panic attacks. 'Inception' struck a chord and I haven't watched the movie since.     Then I was with a close friend and I started projecting my issues to him. He said:   "You know, test_subject4255, even if we are living in a dream, isn't it the best dream ever?"  I haven't forgot that since.   I was convinced that I just had a laced joint so I had to prove to myself that it was a fluke. I've smoked twice since (over a 6 year period) and I have had some good experiences. Things that really turned my mind around. I don't plan on using it again because it's really not my taste but I'm glad I got over my fear. I haven't had a panic attack since.    Anyway, I know that you're probably trying to find a connection between your current state and my story and I just wanted to let you know that it is MORE THAN OKAY to reach out to supportive loved ones/friends about your issues. Who knows? One of them might make you feel a ton better.     Edit: I am not condoning the usage of marijuana. This is just simply my story about a bout of depression I experienced. If you are medically depressed, I am also not condoning skipping of meds/holistic cures/not getting treated. Some people are born with chemical imbalances that medication can help with.

Cook until halfway done    **Broth**     * 1 medium carrot  * 4ish green onions    * 1 stick of celery    * 1/2 stick of butter    * Bullion or broth of your choice   * 1 Chayote squash   * 1 chicken thigh, chopped ham, or bacon    * 1 jalapeno    * 1 gallon of water    * Sea salt to taste  Get pot hot and toss in butter, chopped carrot, jalapeno, green onion, and celery. Mix occasionally and let it come together, about five minutes Chop chicken and add it, cook halfway and add the water. Add bullion to taste.  Toss in chopped squash and bring water to a good simmer. Let simmer until flavors come together. Add meatballs and grease from pan.     Cook until meatballs are done.    Dish, top with parmesan cheese and cilantro (or arugula if you don't like cilantro)   **Enjoy!**    The squash is about 4.5-5 net carbs    Arugula is 2 carbs per cup   Carrot about 3 carbs    Celery is about 2 carbs    Green onions are 2 per onion    One pot of soup (21 - 24 carbs) made at least six bowls for me, so the carbs are spaced out pretty well (3.5-4 carbs per serving).

[Nice fallacy bro.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring)   The video was shopped in.   I there with you. I've had HBP since I was 18. I'm 25 now. Stress was an important factor but my HBP didn't go down until I changed my diet.   I'm not sure what will work for you but I started cutting carbs out and it made a huge difference. I know it sounds weird because fat (for a long time) has been thought to cause heart problems. I have (in my experience) found it to be the opposite. I'm on a high-fat low-carb diet and I've never felt better. Keep in mind, I count calories too. Too many and you'll gain more weight.   Everytime I mention the following subreddit I get downvoted, but you should check out /r/keto. Now ketosis is used mainly by super overweight people as a weight loss program (they'll lose like 20lbs a month). I'm a 5'9" 180lb male and I just use it as a diet program. I eat red meat, chicken, vegetables, etc. I try to eat a lot of fiber and healthy fats. It's helped my blood pressure and heart rate immensely. With the diet you lose out on potassium and magnesium and you'll have to take supplements. You also need to drink a lot of water.   Exercise is important also. I try to walk everywhere I go but I'm not super active (I really should be).    There needs to be a rule against fake shit.    That dude was so fucking awkward.   Probably because this post is tagged [Serious] and they were making jokes.   Wait, so alcohol kills stomach bacteria too?    Totally agree. I've appreciated every video I've seen on here.

I honestly believe that most of his supporters have no idea his name is "Rafael Edward Cruz".   You're acting like they're not going to get punished.    I doubt it. If the kid had a gun and was threatening the old man, that's what would be reported. Self defense. You're just hyperbolizing to fit your "gun-freedom" agenda.    #   I cannot make this up:  https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/30081a/what_is_a_song_that_you_will_forever_associate/      It's a damn fine guess.    I thought that might have been the case. Thanks for informing me!   I just wish they spent more of that money on infrastructure. Austin roads can't handle everyday traffic let alone the floods of people there for SXSW and ACL.    Thankfully, yes. I was a sophomore in high school at the time. I graduated, went to college, and now have a stable job and a semi-stable life. A ton better than what it used to be.   Gosh, it doesn't feel that long ago. It's been more than six years. Woah. Time flies.   Like most TIFUs this didn't actually happen today. This happened 8 years ago.   I grew up in the south Austin area and some new gang members from California had moved into the area. I wasn't involved in gang activity but I knew a lot of kids that were.   One day I was walking home from a friends house and a truck pulls up to me with a couple of guys asking where my neighbor was. I told them I didn't know and they said that if I found out, let him know they're looking for him.  The next day in school I find out that they had a pistol on them and so I inform my neighbor's sister that they intend to kill her brother. I ask her to leave my name out of the mix when she confronts the principle about the problem but... she fails to do so.  A couple of days go by and I jump into bed and feel a cold piece of metal at my feet. I go to look at it and it's the head of a bullet. Then I start seeing holes in my walls. I lived in a trailer home (I had the middle most room, the trailer was facing the street [like this](http://i.imgur.com/d8zsEne.png)) and that bullet and two others had ripped through about 4 walls of my home. One hit a top bar of my bunk bed and fell into the bottom bunk. One ripped through the bathtub, my dresser drawer and landed in my box fan, and the other hit the bottom skirting of my house, landing underneath it.   One bullet passed above me and my sister and the other below us. I never heard the shots (it must have been fired in the middle of the night a couple of nights before) and I never found out who did it. I called the cops, found the brass casings, but nothing ever came of it. We lived in the poor side of town so I didn't expect much.   tl;dr: snitched and almost got stitched.   Edit: Dangit! I meant to edit the title before I hit 'submit'. My neighbor ended up living. They backed off after his sister got the police and principle involved.    I hope it is and I hope it further tarnishes his name.  Or maybe I hope it doesn't and he gets chosen as their running man. He is sure to lose.   I think OP is just sick of the double-standards when it comes to the GOP.   That Obama was born on American soil and everyone had a bitch-fit about seeing his birth certificate. The double-standard that nobody is complaining when a white republican is technically 'less-American'   When I eat at McDonald's I'll usually get a couple of McDoubles. I ALWAYS ask for them to be in the same box but they rarely ever listen!!! I don't want to waste the paper but they'll individually box each one...   It's working now? Maybe region locked?

I put a flair on the post to warn people.    I mean, that's how elections work?    If you're talking about gerrymandering then I understand what you mean. Many districts don't really have a legit choice in who wins their representation because either side will always win.    I'd love to hear your side of the bill. I am completely against it.    We are about to have an [open-carry law](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/17/texas-senate-gun-open-carry/24892513/) on public college campuses too...    It's just the voters that elect them's fault. :(   I see GKMC as a biography of Kendrick's youth.    I see TPAB as deep mental anguish that comes with being a popular black man in a white world. It's heavy on social commentary.    How is Prince Rupert's drop a chemical reaction?   you're* because it is 'you' + 'are'   It's the choose your own adventure one with the vampire poodles. Whatever path you took, you died.    Over 9000 for sure.    How the fuck could I let myself get all worked up over eggs?    My SO and I live together with a 3rd roommate. We'll call my SO "Lilly" and our roommate "Cindy".    Lilly and I pretty much share almost nothing. When we shop together I buy stuff I need and she buys stuff she needs. Now with certain products, we'll rotate purchase. Eggs especially. I'll buy them one time and she'll get the next time, etc.    Recently she's been shadowing a teacher that has about 80 chickens and she will give Lilly a dozen almost every week. So now we don't have to buy eggs because we're getting a steady supply of delicious farm-fresh eggs... until right now.    Spring break was last week so we didn't get our weekly dozen. When I checked the carton yesterday we had 2 left, enough for a breakfast. So this evening I'm getting all excited because I figure I'll eat the two tomorrow morning and then when Lilly and I go to the store tomorrow evening, I'll buy a dozen. So as we're winding down in bed I ask Lilly "hey, will you make sure I get up at 7:30 tomorrow? I want to eat breakfast." Now mind you, I'm not a big breakfast guy. I'm trying to get in the habit of it because I'm always so unproductive in the mornings.     Lilly says "Sure, but there's only one egg left and I'm taking it for lunch tomorrow."      WHAT. "Lilly, why didn't you tell me we were down to our last egg?"    "Well you never eat breakfast, megabenson." (Fair point)  "But but... Dammit! Now I have go to the store now and buy more!"     So I get up, put my shit on, and head outside to my car. Except I'm blocked in by Cindy and my next door neighbors and Cindy is fast asleep.     I get so damn mad! OVER SOMETHING SO SMALL.     Mind you, I wasn't mad at my SO. I was mad because now I'm going to be hungry tomorrow morning and all I have are a few slices of ham and 0 eggs...     Man fuck this. So fucking stupid.

If I somehow found my product key, would it be as simple as transferring those files (via safe mode) to a usb, writing down the product key, and then fresh installing the OS on a new HDD?    magic jelly bean key finder  I might be able to run this program in safe-mode to find the key.   A friend of mine gave it to me. He installed it via flash drive on my tower (I don't have a cd drive). He copied the installation files onto another flash drive (so just in case something like this happened) and gave me them.   The product key might be within the folder I placed those files into but that folder is on the broken HDD.  Edit: I'm not sure if it was a genuine copy or not. It didn't seem ripped because there were no special hoops he had to jump through.   I think I might just have to buy another copy of it.    Yeah, the problem with that is I had a usb with those files on it. I moved them over to my system (I needed to use the usb to store a big project) and guess what? They are on the crashed drive. :/   I don't understand why Windows 7 and 8.1 are the same price. The only thing I can think of is that they are trying their best to phase-out Windows 7.   For how old Windows 7 is, I don't think $100 is a reasonable price so I'm looking to you all for help with this matter. Maybe you know of a not-so-common software shop that has copies or maybe you know about decent sales going on around the internet.   Your help is greatly appreciated.    CarTalk!!!

No doubt to rake in what marvel hasn't already entirely consumed.    www.bigskybackyards.com   I think the bigger issue with tinting is things like concealing weapons inside    Someone posted a link to a website that shows the inside. Look like Windows to me   Bigskybackyards.com   I'll ask on a local Facebook group. The place was so fucking crowded I just snapped a quick picture and moved on    TIL driverless cars don't have to adhere to window tint laws         I got myself some half-sheet pans that are normally used in restaurants. That shit made me super happy   Then on the other hand when they leave it up to the students to pick groups I'm stuck with the other people nobody else wants to be in groups with because I didn't have friends    Yeah, that    OP from Watamote would be great    I wish the dishwasher I had was that clever. Whenever he'd bring our big whisks back he'd just yell "buttscratcher!!"    Thank God. It was a nightmare dealing with Google+ for pictures    Goddamn I know your feelings on the swaddle blanket. I hear that all the time, but nobody knows how hard it is for little Ricky Bobby to fall asleep. If he's swaddled he was constantly trying to get out of it, but when his arms are free they're up in his face rubbing his eyes and pulling the pacifier out of his mouth and in general raising a ruckus. Once you spend like an hour arm wrestling with him until he falls asleep he'll sleep through the night but if something wakes him up in the middle of the night good luck and be prepared to not get anymore sleep until tomorrow    Now if only you could have a live video feed of that sweet justice    Exactly what I'd expect you to post    That would be badass.    You'd be right.    No buttons being held down. It was just sitting right side up and plugged in. I unplugged it and turned the volume back up, and then plugged it back in and watched the volume go down again    I thought I was going crazy because when I turned XBMC on it was as if someone was constantly holding the volume down button with another keyboard. Turns out, a plugged in PS4 controller does exactly that   This post needs more cross section pictures because I can't believe half of those are cake without them   Back when my siblings and I were younglings it seemed like baby proofing the house was much simpler: gates for stairs, keeping doors closed/locked, putting covers on the electrical sockets. Most households still only had one TV, and maybe one game system. Phone Jacks were easily hidden behind furniture or were high up on a wall to begin with. And we didn't even get our first family computer until I was about 5.  Fast forward to today, my living room has a TV,  an AV receiver, a computer for the TV, a wireless router, a modem, speakers and a subwoofer, an external hard drive that needs to be plugged in, and four game consoles. It's all in one area and I need two power strips to handle it all. Then upstairs, I have a computer desk with open sides and back so all the cables are exposed.  Basically I really need some protips to baby proof all these wires and cables before little Ricky Bobby starts crawling and wants to play with the wires   I'm not sure what you're talking about when you say South Dakota doesn't get enough love. Here in Montana, we tell people to go there and North Dakota all the time    Are we not going to talk about how the 5th version looks like Jennifer lawrence?    All the reddit meet ups I've been to here were good. A bunch of us did trivia night at a bar once. It's hard to get a bunch of people together with vastly different lives though    Well it only happened to me when in hangouts so I figured it was a dumb feature    I used to work with a guy who got high before work. I preferred it when he was high. If he wasn't he was a cranky bastard that frequently lost his temper and would fuck shit up. When he was high he was in a good mood and worked efficiently with enthusiasm    I built my own steam box before steam view as a thing, except it runs Windows and has all my other media center stuff so basically it's just my movie /tv/gaming machine for the living room and not really a steambox but best of both worlds.    Is your girlfriend Bill Burr?   I think it looks great. People are just mad that they didn't invent a screen that fits inside the phone but is actually bigger than the phone's footprint   Missed opportunity on having the light fade on   According to the US Copyright Office, the picture taken by the octopus cannot be copyrighted and is therefore public domain [source] ( http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-monkey-selfie-copyright-20140821-story.html)   Just in case you weren't aware of the monkey selfie case   Yes, some brands may be more reliable than others, some may have a brighter screen, and some may have better remotes (for those of you not using a universal one). But it feels like most of what will make you happy with your purchase are things you can't filter or sort by on Amazon or Newegg. If it's a smart TV, what does the interface look like? Is it snappy and quick? Or is it sluggish and burdensome? How customizable are the TV settings? How well does the CEC (anynet+, bravia sync etc) perform? Is that reasonably customizable or does it operate by the laws of entropy? How does the screen look if you're in a bright room? Are reflections a problem?   My point is, I'm looking for a TV and sure I can find all the "technical specs" but I can't find human interface or experience specifications which is making it extremely difficult to choose a TV I want   Small world!    I think you hurt the dough's feelings    I still don't have lollipop... Fucking Verizon    No kidding, the only thing I have time for is taking care of my son, which takes away my money, eating, which keeps me out of shape, and my job, which takes away creativity. When I have any time to not do any of those I just want to take a rest   I'm not sure how I feel about this. I like K Rock despite the relatively small library of music they play, but I liked that there weren't any radio DJs to get in the way of the music.   sounds defective to me then.    Yet another great cover!   When did this start happening? How long ha r you had the phone?    I have this same problem with different headphone connectors. The audio cable I've had in my car for years works fine, a d the one in my work Truck works fine, but a new one I bought from monoprice for my truck won't make a solid connection at all. And I've had some headphones do the same.    Did Simmons talk about being into music at all in the QA? His role seems like it would be extremely difficult for someone without any sort of background in music performance. If he didn't have any experience with music that makes his acting performance so much better. Having done Orchestra and jazz myself had I never seen any of Simmons' previous roles, he would have had me convinced he was a director/musician first and actor second. His gestures, mannerisms, and movements were spot on perfect, including the throwing the chair bit. That seems to be a common trait for band directors.    Same here in band except my director actually did throw a chair at the drummers    One might even go as far as saying half of a decade    I bought my M8 just last year. I can't afford to buy the M9 off contract so it's a big no for me   I fell from a kitchen counter onto the ground when I was a baby.. My turned out fine.... I think   This comment thread is enlightening    And the FDA tried to put a stop to it, but backed off thanks to public comments   The revisions also address the issue of the use of spent grains, which are by-products of alcoholic beverage brewing and distilling that are commonly used as animal food. Concerns were raised that the proposed rules would require brewers and distillers to comply with the full human food and animal food rules if they made their wet spent grains available for animal feed. Theupdated proposed rule would clarify that human food processors that create by-products used as animal food and are already complying with FDA human food safety requirements  such as producers of wet spent grains  would not need to comply with the full animal food rule if they are already complying with the human-food rule.

Being hit in the nose in any form sucks   This was my dad's advice to me except to not be the first one to strike.    Yeah sorry for all the typos and general stream of consciousness. I typed that from my phone after driving for an hour and a half at 730 this morning    I always make this recommendation because when I moved into Bozeman for school, a couple places I applied at told me they already had hired people that were starting in a couple weeks when they got in from out of state. That upset me a bit because I was there and ready to work immediately.   I've also put in applications to places and not get a response, even while trying to follow up on them and have them end up calling me over a month later for an interview.   It's tough to say what would be the best course of action if they're telling you to apply when you're actually up here. Like what /u/Croup-vandemar said, maybe don't mention you haven't yet permanently moved, but I wonder if it's worth it to book a flight to make an interview when you're not guaranteed a job. I feel like some places may be open to a phone interview, but like before, you run the risk of them passing and telling you to try later   Yeah but the problem is that the population is growing faster than  the rate of housing being built. And as I said, housing is only half of the problem. The other part is the quantity of available jobs and whether they can or are willing to pay a living wage, or continue to rely on cheap college labor    The college is causing a depreciation of both jobs and housing. Every year, they let more freshman attend, even though they don't have the facilities to house them and for the first month they'll stuff 4 students into what are supposed to be common rooms for the dorms. Then the next year those freshman go out and try to get am apartment off campus, filling up all the available apartments. Sure, there's always something for rent, but competition is nuts.   When my brother was moving up to Bozeman for school, my parents wanted to save some money by having him basically rent a room from my wife and I. I was for it because we would be able to rent a place with more space for less money, but we never found anything and he ended up going to the dorms. That brings me to my next point: you might have to be willing to rent sight unseen. We found something that would work great and was the right cost, so we set up the soonest available appointment to look at it. The place went on the market the very day we called. The first appointment to look at it was in a week. We show up to look at it and nobody is there. We wait about 10 minutes and nothing. We called the rental agency and they told us they ready found tenants for that property, without even notifying the people who scheduled appointments to look at it.   Now for jobs, demand for jobs is very high, again because there are so many students. You might get lucky because some positions might open up with students leaving for the summer, but don't expect to get paid a whole lot. Many companies are taking advantage of the cheap unskilled college labor. Why pay someone more because they know what they're doing? We can hire this other guy, and train him for less money because he's willing to work for cheap because he needs rent/beer money. Unless you are a professional, it's a little difficult to make a decent living out here.   Anyway, that's my ranting and raving about Bozeman. I love the place but I moved to Billings for work because I wasn't making any progress in paying off my student loans there   I don't think there are any gas pumps with tap and pay at the pump. You're safe if you pay inside with card anyway.   That being said, nfc isn't all that secure.    I'm in the worst damn state. I never see anything at all for sale ever   500-750 is the range for studio to 2 bedroom apartments around here with varying degrees of amenities    Have a job lined up before you get here. It could end up being some time before you're able to find a place to live   Social justice warriors    Jesus I'm not even very old and these comments make me feel old because I understand nothing      The email I saw was an internal GM Petroleum email sent to all the conoco stations in the Billings area, so at least one of the stations was a conoco in Bozeman, and since the readers were installed on the inside of the machine it would have to be any station that isn't open 24/7  Which store isn't what is important though, this can happen to any store or ATM    That's only because they messed with the inside. If it's one of the ones that fit on the outside and isn't instantly recognizable, chances are your card will still work at the pump    Yep, paying inside from now on   Saw a forwarded email directed to a bunch of conoco gas stations warning that there were skimmers found on pumps in Bozeman. Be on the lookout when paying at the pump, these devices are getting better at being concealed   And I'm willing to bet the only way to make it illegal is to piggyback it onto another unrelated bill   They're just sleeping    I fucked that up didn't I? Goddamn it. I always have that inner voice when I type the name that I used the wrong one    What is the difference between this and the original metal one?    Jesus, video proof?

Were you disappointed in the wreck like me?    I love these man, you instantly became my favorite YouTuber when I came across one of your kazoo'd videos.

I think one of my favorite songs ever is a jazz rendition of it but a kazoo'd version would be amazing    He does lots of drunk videos and they look like a heck of a time   I love watching his vlogs but i can't stand his video game commentary anymore    And not only that, it spurred a fad where it seemed like every publisher started pushing games with proprietary controllers that would never be used again so they could cash in on selling meh games for $100+ like that Tony hawk game with the skateboard controller. People just got burned out about buying games you couldn't just use a regular controller with.   Though now it seems they've moved onto things like Skylander where they can get kids to beg their parents to buy them these action figures that also double as characters in a game   If they really are working on a new rock band game, I really hope they're spending time on making the equipment look nice, works well, is sturdy, and can be collapsed into a smaller size. The guitars are fine but the drummers goddamn   I still love to have mine around. It's great for when you have company over and run out of things to do    Tell me about it. We got rid of our stuff years ago when we were living in a small place and didn't ha e room. Well now we have room and want to have it again and it's nearly impossible to find good equipment. Ended up spending a hundred bucks getting two guitars, and drums, all with the wireless receivers, and the guy also had DJ Hero with it. The guitars are in okay condition, but we can only use one because one of the wireless receivers is actually a rockband 2 receiver, and I don't even know about the drums yet because the usb connection to the circuit board on the receiver is shot so I have to replace that usb cable.    It's the same in that there's music you play in the game, but that's really about it   How would it affect people with THE CDL jobs?    You don't want currenc.

My problem with all the cases that don't cover the IR blaster is that their solution is to just put a hole there. The power button isn't exactly a big button and having to press a button through a hole with my small hands would be miserable. The only case I've seen that did what I liked is the supcase one. It has a clear button over the IR blaster. Why is that so hard for everyone else to do?    Part of him that's supposed to help him walk that wasn't doing its job anymore is helping him walk now whether it likes it or not    Found the thread   https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1e7zz1/i_need_a_new_simple_hotdog_recipe/   7th post down in a search for "hot dog recipes" I found the thread  https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1e7zz1/i_need_a_new_simple_hotdog_recipe/  I was bored    There is no proper way to put it in there because it's not supposed to go there    This is my fear for buying myself a nice knife for home cooking. My wife beats the shit out of the bad knives we do have and she'll get butthurt if I tell her she can't use my knife lol   Jus  the tip   We're your /u/cool_hand_luke senses tingling?    I feel ya there. The last restaurant I worked at I did a year and 3 months there. If you worked an average of 30+ hours per week between open enrollment periods you'd qualify for health benefits. Well I did get 30+ hours per week but the restaurant opened in January, and open enrollment ended mid December. Basically, no matter how many hours you worked, every person who got hired for opening the restaurant got screwed out of health benefits for another year. I had already been looking for a better paying job when I found that out but that only intensified my search.   Now instead of barely scraping by each month paying only the minimal amount on my semi-crippling debt of $18,000 thanks to school, I've paid off $7,000 since April    For a second I was wondering why cool hand like double posted but you got me damn you    The funny part is that this rule was added BECAUSE someone made a call-out thread for /u/cool_hand_luke.

He's actually super crazy but acts normal when he needs to which is why he's a great actor   It really is amazing how the human mind can adapt. I would have thought a viking would be too busy smashing the computer with his war axe than learning to type    See, I guess I've always experienced TV because aside from optimum adding HD channels and charter adding more HD channels, I've had the same TV experience for the last 15 years. Nothing has changed there for me except that I only use TV at my parents place when we visit. I just get Internet    Yeah, optimum was providing 16/2 and when charter took over they upped it to 30/2 and not even 2 year later doubled it again. I didn't have any complaints with optimum but I'm really happy with Charter right now. MSU has shitty Internet.    Our area isn't part of the swap. The original company here sold to Cablevision and then Cablevision sold it to charter and I have a feeling it was because they weren't happy with how things are going.    This may be a new contender for best time OP delivered ever   Hopefully the only reason you're getting downvotes is because the game isn't available anymore because it actually was a pretty solid game back when I had my droid x2   Charter definitely seems to be the least shitty of the major ones. Though they keep petitioning Montanan government to waive some certain taxes that are levied here claiming they are a burden and Montana keeps rejecting it. I have a bad feeling that if they don't get their way they will sell the market to comcast. I haven't had any complaints with them so far since they took over from optimum/Cablevision. They recently doubled everyone in the cities from 30/2 to 60/4. It's by no means Google fiber but hey, it's Montana, at least I'm not mailing my reddit comments via pony express.    Sheesh. Yeah if I had four months I wouldn't be as upset    What in the fucking fuck am I looking at? Jesus if I got a part in a band or Orchestra and they handed something that looked like that to me I'd walk out.    God damnit I love this subreddit    Try that but with every single ship and you have tumblr.com   Same thing happened to us and we gave up on it around the same time. Sometimes it just doesn't work. I think part of the problem with us is that short tongues run in my family so he could never really get a good latch. Our son does great with formula   I don't like to, but I use a case. The phone is so damn beautiful but it's just as slippery. I was using a supcase but now I use spigen slim armor    Aside from people I text that don't use hangouts, I probably wouldn't use that feature very often as I already have a Gmail tab open all the time on my PC    How does this compare to using motioninjoy for the ds3? I hated the finicky software. Half the time it seemed like my controller wouldn't connect and it felt like there was noticeable input lag. In addition to that, needing to translate the onscreen buttons to be relevant for a playstation controller since games always showed the xbox buttons.   I really like the dualshock 4 but I REALLY like being able to use the 360 wireless controller adapter and just turning the controller on and being able to use it immediately, wirelessly, and without any setup. Just the other day I discovered I could use the controller for XBMC, I hadn't even thought to try it   Risky click    Last place I rented we technically weren't allowed barbecues, but luckily everyone had one and the property management company and the owner never enforced it because up here grilling is an all year thing, even when buried in snow    I guess we'll have to watch for this.

We have to keep arms inside of it because they agitate his face when he's trying to fall asleep and that keeps him awake and makes him upset   Probably whatever subreddits the creator set it to watch    Not fooling me with dQw4   I dunno, I'd like to see it with some dubstep    [I'm almost expecting the Dharma logo to be on the back] ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/32/Dharma_Initiative_logo.svg/220px-Dharma_Initiative_logo.svg.png)   	146

 Soooo... you're saying the entire European continent doesn't count? What about Japan and South Korea?   Considering the iPhone 6+ has split screen, it's a matter of time until it hits the iPad.   It doesn't matter if you're technically correct. When people see a tablet they think tablet price. That's the fatal flaw that Microsoft has in the Surface Pro.   I think my point is that the "quality" of the product quickly plateaus as you increase in price. Is there that much of a difference between a $30 dollar bottle of wine and two buck chuck? Of course. But do you think there's a difference between a $500 and $100 bottle of wine?  Also, coffee is a low-price commodity that is bought and traded for pennies. It's a total marketing scheme that they can charge $5 for a cup when you can get it for less than a dollar (for approximately the same quality!) around the world. Can you say that a coffee bean that is meticulously prepared, roasted, and brewed is 200%+ better than what you get at Starbucks?  The worst though, is Illy. At almost $20 for half a pound of *pre-ground* beans, it is highway robbery.   I live in the Bay Area. This place is the home of overpriced coffee shops. $5 for a pour-over from some ostensibly superior coffee? Bitch please, it's just ground beans and hot water. Maybe I'd be more interested if you show me some papers that you're paying farmers 100-200% more rather than bragging about how much better the coffee is.   Why wouldn't they spend it on lobbying and lawyers? Their entire business model relies on changing how transportation is regulated. They would be stupid if they didn't do it.   Delta could make a move to disrupt the airline industry, but they don't.   Better than whom? There were plenty of Irish, German, Jewish, and Eastern European immigrants that did pretty well but the vast majority of them were poor as shit in the beginning of the 20th century. There were even wealthy black people amongst the other 99% who were poor. How they progressed through the century wasn't really any different than Asians.  My point is that as a whole Asians are given this stereotype that they are the "model minority" when it has really a lot to do with external factors and the fact that you can't easily identify all the white immigrants. At the end it comes down to economic and social class.   I think you're missing a pretty huge part of history. The reason why Asians (and other minorities in the USA) have it much better now is because of the increased social mobility they have and also because they're generally much more affluent when immigrating to the USA. If you look back ~100 years these people lived in the ghettos of society, kept to themselves, and didn't integrate much. You can still see this today if you go to poorer districts of Chinatowns, where ghettos and triads still thrive.  One of the biggest determinants of integration is class. Nobody (meaning white people) welcomes you with open arms if you are poor and struggle to get out of the trap, but all of a sudden they think you are a model citizen and are a success story if you start making some money.   You're perpetuating a misconception about Chinatowns in the USA. They were historically extremely crime ridden. These communities also kept to themselves for ~100 years. It's only today that they've gotten better when some of them got more affluent and also when more well-off Asians started moving in in the late 20th century. Do you not remember the days when Asians built the railroads?   There's a great proverb: "Trust but verify." You are indeed advocating for victims by corroborating stories and compiling evidence. The ones that lie are taking advantage of ones who actually suffered! That is how truth and justice works. We should encourage everyone to come forward and speak up, but we should also be vigilant against liars.   Grew up in Edmonton. It's a huge issue because you don't want to fucking die while walking through the outdoor parking structure to the hospital. Also snow/ice and people who are ill do not mix.      I don't see how it's possible to make a terrible* movie based on a well established franchise. I mean, they've made several Transformers movies already and are going to make more despite the fact that they are awful. You could make the literal opposite of ANH and that would sell like hotcakes.  *Terrible in the corporate sense -- meaning a flop commercially   Why would Nintendo care about DS sales if their games will run fine on Android or iOS? If they come up with an emulator that runs flawlessly, then essentially they've passed on all hardware costs to Apple and Samsung. They would make pure profit from having a massively increased audience and no manufacturing expenses.   What? I think it's pretty clear that most of the increase in GDP has to do with the massive government involvement in the recovery (eg. TARP 6 years ago) followed by many years of aggressive quantitative easing. That's pretty much as centralized as you can get in a country like the USA.  The reason why so many people are still strugging to be in the middle class or are in outright poverty is because the easy money that the Fed provides mainly affected the business side (and largely big businesses at that). Their hope was that these businesses would create jobs which would increase jobs and consequently wages. The latter didn't quite happen, because labor is not in a good negotiating position to demand higher wages.  All in all it's pretty much the textbook definition of a command capitalist economy, where the government and associated centralized institutions have a large say in directing where the economy goes. They got a lot of things right in the past few years in terms of improving the economy (compared to virtually every other country), but they could have spent a little more effort improving downstream metrics like wage growth.   I feel like shoot to kill is a purely American thing. Even in private lives, Americans have the constitutional right to be executioners in many scenarios.   And that is the problem with law enforcement. How is permission to execute when a fight starts any reasonable path to forming trust in communities? Especially if they are working in a community ravaged by poverty, crime, and police brutality. There has to be some nuance in firing a gun.   I think part of it is that American law enforcement and even private self defense hinges on the right to lethal force. Which is insane. Even in the UK when you had that terrorist knife attack the police didn't charge in with guns blazing, and fired 8 shots instead of 50 like you see here in America. Here when you feel like you are in danger or if the perp is gonna fight, you have full rights to be an executioner.   Not an MD, but is this official protocol? My impression would be that if "the man" at a hospital hears of this, they would go apeshit.   Not an MD, but many doctors that I know in their mid to late 40s have deteriorating eyesight. I'm sure many of them will have extreme difficulty in reading the fine print on a vial.  The question is that there should have been multiple redundancy layers against failure. If the pharmacist didn't catch it, why didn't the nurse who fetched it read the label?   Some drugs are just insanely expensive. Things like monoclonal antibodies are really difficult to make in large scale. Small molecules may be comparatively easier to synthesize but it's a long road to get to something that works and gets past initial screens or Phase I.  Those who say that marketing takes up a huge portion: well, yes it does. But even if you assume that a drug which costs $3B to develop took up $2B for marketing, you're still left with $1B for the actual research itself. That's the equivalent of ~1000 NIH R01 grants.  You could argue that funding 1000 academic labs could yield better results. Certainly big pharma R D moves slow -- that's why things are quickly moving towards academic spinoffs and acquisitions.    It also goes the other way around too. There are many people on the left who are prone to characterizing people on the right as gun loving religious nutjobs. Many people on both sides have a knee-jerk reaction to issues like gun possession, subsidies for the natural resource/farming sectors, and religious freedom.   What kind of lab work is it? Theranos is a promising startup that is going to have booths inside Walgreens -- they claim they can do all kinds of routine tests with a drop of blood and a fraction of the cost. Currently valued at several billion.   Usually vocals are on the center track, so a quick and dirty way is to phase out the left and right channels using something like Audacity.   Da fuck... I thought that was a real JT song...   Not a medical doctor but I work in academia and closely with academic medicine. Notes should be concise and give exactly the information you need. When I write notes I often think about the perspective of another person reading them. Unfortunately a lot of people don't put any thought or effort into it. Proper note taking takes a lot of practice.   Change is possible! California now has the jungle primary and I think several other states are following suit.   Not to mention that the smartphone market, while growing, has seen punishing margins for every Android vendor. Only Apple is making a decent amount of money.  The tablet market is slowing down worldwide due to similar reasons, so I'm not sure how Nokia thinks they can make money off of this. They have to go low margin/high volume but that means gunning after the low-end Chinese market of which there are many players already.   Now that .NET is going open source, is there any reason moving forward for developers to invest in Java? Personally I found C# to be a much more pleasant coding experience with the exception of poor platform support outside of Windows. Now that point is now moot it will be interesting to see where developers start to move towards.   I like wearing skinny jeans. My long-term girlfriend of 4+ years thought I was pretentious and gay when we first met. Turns out that one of those two things are wrong....   Religious exemption doesn't give you a pass to break the law. I mean, maybe if you're part of a Christian church, but these guys aren't. If the CoS owns the police in the area, then why aren't the feds or state troopers stepping in?   This is actually an excellent point. A child may be able to speak fluently but the topics and level of articulation is extremely poor. Even teenagers in their last year of high school can't read or write with any level of sophistication as compared to a scholar.  If an adult were able to spend as much time learning a new language as a child, they would easily do better simply because the drive and level of articulation is so much better.  Similarly, you could extend this to any other type of education. Plenty of people become masters of their "craft" when they are well into adulthood. Students in graduate school do their best work in their late 20s and onward.      And there are still those that complain that he doesn't donate enough by percentage (compared to "regular folk").  His total donations to date eclipse the endowments of most large nonprofits combined.   YES!!!!!   Fig newtons are delicious and I'm a CoD fan.      As far as I know they brought in the author to help fill in the gaps.   Here's the thing I think a lot of Republicans don't understand: the US government, through programs like food stamps, are directly subsidizing companies like Walmart. If they were really so gung ho about getting rid of social welfare programs then they should be all for massive increases of the minimum wage. But they won't, because they're not ideologically consistent and just assholes.   That's not really the point though. There are plenty of people who drink a six pack every day. Sure, their brain won't look exactly like the bottom panel but having even 50% of that condition is terrible.   Even if it were down to bare bones profits of under 10k, flippers like this can make a lot of money from volume. It costs practically none of their time because they're hiring someone else to do it. If you have a good office manager who can coordinate teams, then it's practically free money and gives good money to laborers.  Plus, you won't have a house smelling like cat shit sitting around in a neighborhood.   Not sure what the big deal with a visual code is. starbucks has something similar with great success.   If they aren't already genetically predisposed to it (via a hereditary mutation), you can give them a mutagen in their drinking water/feed for a few days.   holy shit... http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fomepizole  I have the Asian flush, so this could really help with it!   So what happens if a drunk person took Fomepizole? They would stay drunk for a long time because the alcohol isn't being metabolized?   Canada will never turn into the US with the racist scaremongering. Why? Because Canada's minority population is vastly more affluent and educated than compared to immigrants in other countries. Because Canada has a long history of multiculturalism. And also because Canada has a very vibrant community of moderate religious folk.   I'm a guy and I had really bad cystic acne. Like large lumps all over my face. I took Accutane and now it's mostly gone (I'm 30 now), but very few people have made fun of me over it.  If you have friends teasing you about acne then you need to get better friends. Especially if you are younger or in college. It's not worth your time to be around that kind of person.  Personally, I don't care if a girl has acne or not. What I will point out though, is if it's a severe clinical problem that should probably be treated with antibiotics or Accutane or birth control. But if you are breaking out here and there on your face? Who cares? I'd be more concerned with how the makeup is making it worse.   What if the makeup is causing the redness and inflammation?  There are lots of OTC products that can bring down redness and treat acne without covering it up.  Also, I don't see how you can properly apply acne medication during the day if you have makeup all over your face.   For all people who are saying that the future is disappointing, just look at all the biotechnology that has appeared in the last 30 years. It's basically the computer and space age of the 20th century.      Just read the Wikipedia article for the Enabling Act. How is that even possible in the 20th century? I'd imagine other countries like France, UK, and USA would have a really hard time pulling it off.  I mean, even today with civil liberties on the decline it's pretty much impossible to completely dissolve the separation between government branches and to ban parties.   What a pretentious asshat.   I feel that Mao's greatest mistake was not quitting while he was ahead or consulting people who were more qualified. Which is like the standard MO for most communist dictators.   I mean, they still could -- they just need to be wearing thick rubber gloves and a hazmat suit. At the very least, and because these are cultural traditions that should be considered after all, you can wear rubber gloves and wash them off with bleach afterward. I wonder if that was ever communicated to the family members?   http://ycharts.com/companies/IBM/net_income  IBM makes plenty of money.   Isn't this a really big win for Globalfoundries? It doesn't have the design IP but it gained a lot in the manufacturing IP, which will be useful for licensing out or even for incorporating it into ARM and x86 processors. That is, unless IBM is already licensing manufacturing technology found in Power/PowerPC to other foundries already.  It would appear that AMD could really gain from some of the IBM manufacturing IP to give their chips a little edge.   When I fall asleep (even naps) I start dreaming in seconds. I get uncontrollably tired during the day, but only if I'm unstimulated. Does that sound like narcolepsy?  In college and grad school I also fell asleep in almost every single class, and I would have desperate urges to lay down (in public!!) and fall asleep when I was out and about on campus.   How did you not kill him with that move? That's a lot of pressure on the spinal column.   The US basically subsidizes everyone else's military budget so that they could spend it on something else. After WWII, the US was pretty much the only country standing that could fight Russia so they poured money into their military when countries rebuilding in the West couldn't. That never stopped as we move into the 21st century and I think a lot of people forget that.  It also has the interesting side effect that the US now can project a lot of force around the world. However, I think that if other Western countries want the USA to wind down their military ambitions, they need to start ponying up their own defense budget.   For example, the US spending in NATO dwarfs all other European countries, and yet the main purpose of it was to buffer against Soviet attack. It was also deployed in Bosnia, which is in Europe. European countries should contribute proportionally to their own defense.   Aren't large lobsters supposed to be lower quality because they are older and the flesh is tougher?   You mean like all Trader Joe's stores? I don't understand how they have so much fuzzy fruit hanging around. It's cheap, though.   The NYT has a great piece on the ACA today, about how the bronze plan (and some silvers) is a nightmare for low income people.  The ACA has a lot of good legislation in it including things for preventative care and pre-existing conditions, but it is a shit sandwich when you are poor as fuck and are forced to buy a shitty plan that makes you pay a $6k deductible even if premiums are subsidized.   Not to mention that the NIH plays ball with universities that charge exorberant overhead. The NIH drives policy and they have real power. If they said "we are only paying 10% overhead starting in FY2016", then you sure as shit will see Universities actually start to pay for departments out of their gigantic endowments instead of relying on soft money for everything. You'll magically get a ton of money for extra grants too.   I do NGS all the time in the lab -- there's really not that much difference between kits when you're sequencing exomes at 100x to account for false discovery rates. You're going to pretty much hit everything. The problem with the SureSelect kits are that they cost a ton of money. Illumina has a nice "Rapid Capture Exome" SKU that lets you do a multiplexed exome capture if you BYO Illumina multiplexed library for $300/capture and just use the Nextera enzyme for another experiment.  Also when you're looking at diseases with a very strong phenotype, most likely it is exonic and that should be the first line diagnostic before you do WGS because you will otherwise get too many false hits.  If you want to take it a step further, doing trio exome/WG sequencing for an affected person can really help you narrow down a mutation, regardless of whether it is inherited (by following pedigrees) or spontaneous (novel mutaiton not found in either parent).   But that's like saying all white experiences are the same, which is completely untrue. Obviously this person's is very different and shouldn't be painted in the same brush as what people refer to as "white privilege".  Also, this person is the poster child of diversity: a biologically female socially male person attending what an insitution that has a reputation to be an inclusive community for *women of all types*. I don't think you can deny that this person is part female and part male, which is as "diverse" as you can get.  The problem here is that you have a portion of college kids who didn't bother to have a sophisticated thought about (a) what diversity means beyond just "white" and "not white", and (b) what it means to be accepting of diversity itself. Then you have the NY Times and now this article painting a picture that there is a huge transgender backlash at Wellesley and other women's colleges, which may be (and likely) quite misleading.   Is that after tax? I'm a postdoc and I make about that much.   I'm pretty much the opposite of Libertarian, but if I were an American citizen I would vote for Rand Paul just because he seems like the only politician who is serious about reform.  Then again, Obama promised to shut down Guantanamo.    First of all, you need to at least complete your residency and be board certified. No matter what. You will command a larger paycheck which will help your student loans. Stick it out for a few more years.  Secondly, if you hate clinical work then no matter what you do you will hate fields like Radiology and Pathology. You're still hanging out at a hospital or a facility talking shop to doctors all day. That goes for academic medicine and research.  My recommendation is to go into something bioinformatics or hospital administration. These are somewhat removed from the day-to-day clinical medicine that you hate, but at the same time requires skills that you learned in med school.  You can also work as an in-house consultant for pharmaceutical or biotech companies. They need all kinds of people to help with clinical trials as well as basic strategy development.   The WMDs were circa 1991. Basically, not only could the US military/intelligence not find any from Saddam Hussein's purported "active WMD program", but they couldn't find any (which they helped manufacture!!) from over a decade ago.   Keep in the mind that this is the agency that found vials of fucking smallpox in a storage closet.   Not just that, but literally it only took THE FIRST infected non-healthcare person for the hospital system to break down. And shortly afterward, a healthcare worker was infected.  It's another thing when you can say "hey, this only happens 0.0001% of the time and we've handled millions of these cases in the USA". It's another thing when the entire health care chain breaks on the first try.   If someone straight up offered me $140k? Maybe.  But this house was already selling for $2.1 million. The other 140K would be chump change. They should have kept the cat.   The even more annoying part is when you compare their reaction to the swine flu outbreak a few years back. Total night and day. Sure, one is way more easily transmittable, but the other will fucking kill you if you aren't careful.  All the CDC is saying right now is "hey don't worry, we've got this" rather than outlining the specific steps people need to take to stay safe. Things like washing your hands, wearing face masks, infection latency, symptoms to be worried about, etc.  They're just doing PR when they should be educating.   End of Cold War, Round 2?   Pretty sure it's going to revolve around the Scarlet Witch/Quicksilver reveal in the next Avengers -- maybe around the fact that they are impossible to "control" by SHIELD/US government. It turns out that these Miracles are appearing because of something due to the infinity gems and the gauntlet. Iron Man, being a micromanager, proposes a registration list for all "Miracles" that are found.   They would also save a ton of money in lawyer fees in the long run too. Spending a few tens of thousands to contribute to a cover design (that's highballing the cost) would be much higher than paying a lawyer to litigate.   The Judge? Really? It's getting not so great reviews on Rottentomatoes.   I work in biotech and have done lots of genetic modifications on bacteria. Labs next to me do it on yeast. In my old lab there was a big lab doing synthetic biology. People are engineering human cell lines for specific mutations to look at disease phenotypes.  What I'm getting at is that genetic engineering, while still in its infancy, has the power to do some pretty amazing stuff with not that much effort. But with that power comes a lot of responsibility. If people wanted to, they could probably make a plant that secreted an antibiotic during growth so that Salmonella contamination would be less likely. It would be trivial, but would have huge ecological effects.   Scientists should advocate for not just a simple "GMO" label, but for responsible labelling that is not that much different from the ingredients in our food today. Everyone in the "food chain" needs to know what genes are being inserted. It needs to be transparent.   It's a bit worse than that. They pump poo up your butt every day for at least a month.   Unpasteurized milk started to become a big problem when farming went "industrial scale". Unless everyone is willing to raise cattle in very humane conditions, it is impossible to deliver unpasteurized milk at sufficient scale to make the health benefits outweigh the sanitary risks.   Not to mention that a "typical" fecal transplant consists of them flushing another person's poo inside you every day for at least a month. It's a laboriously intensive procedure, which is why the pill is so promising.   Canadian here. There are huge swaths of Canada that are just literally nothing but plains. Then you get into Ontario and the scenery is not that much interesting either.   The only feasible "modules" would be swapping of the screen and maybe one peripheral. Otherwise this is another project that I can see Google retiring to their graveyard.   I don't necessarily agree with the statement that antibiotic research is stagnating. Maybe that's the case in big pharma, but there are many biotech startups in the Bay Area and in Cambridge MA that are heavily pursuing new classes of antibiotics and novel variants of classic ones too.  What you are seeing is part of a larger symptom of big pharma being too bloated to perform effective R D. For the past 10 years now we are moving to a model where smaller startups (spun off from a University) perform the initial proof of principle with any kind of drug. After this, one of two things happen: (1) the company/IP is then bought out by a larger company which has the expertise to perform all the clinical trials and bring it to market; or (2) the startup itself decides to bring the drug to market itself.   I went to one of the top Ivies for my PhD. I didn't think it was particularly competitive at all. We were encouraged to collaborate (from first year graduate problem sets to thesis projects) rather than shut ourselves in.   I also did my PhD from Harvard and had the exact opposite experience as you. What program were you in and what kind of undergraduate exposure did you get?  Not to say that the whole networking thing is wrong, but to say that there were truckloads of dumb undergraduates is untrue unless you were coming from one of the most elite colleges overseas. I went to a large undergraduate school in Canada and the distribution of abilities between schools is not even close.   I went to a school with about 40-50k undergraduates in Canada to one of the best schools in the US for graduate school. Honestly, the biggest difference was the lack of competitiveness amongst my graduate school cohort. We were all in it together, and we checked our pride and shame at the door.   Did you know that the top two Ivy League schools have free tuition for undergraduates? The percentage that are rich enough to "qualify" for full tuition is actually quite low.   I love house centipedes! I had one in my old apartment and never saw a pest.   I guess my point is that there are plenty of major hospitals and huge amount of primary care clinics that are private practice/for-profit centers. Many of these provide decent care, but they are also there to make a buck. Does that impede care? Certainly for a lot of procedures, but I believe that you should triage care whenever possible. The vast majority of acute and non-life threatening cases can be handled by a minute clinic or a "Walmart clinic" -- it will free up space at more capable hospitals and improve care for those who really need a lot of attention.  Just think about flu season. Many people roll into primary care or urgent care to see if they can get antibiotics because they're (a) scared or (b) worried that they might have a secondary infection. Walmart/CVS clinics would be able to do a quick triage and maybe even perform lab tests! This would remove a lot of burden on the health care system.   I think that's very idealistic thinking. If you are running your own or working for a private practice, you are absolutely thinking about making money. You'd otherwise go bankrupt. And think about the nightmares with billing with hospitals and healthcare providers. They are in it to save lives, but let's not kid ourselves here -- there are hospitals making a lot of money in profit and are very happy to make more on the backs of patients.   I think the problem is that primary care makes so little money anyway, why would they care about people coming in for the flu or with other acute non-life threatening conditions? They want the patients with serious or chronic diseases because (1) it's more interesting, and (2) they will make more money.  A lot of things in primary care can be really separated into two categories -- one is conditions where nurses are more than qualified to handle, and the second is one that absolutely requires a doctor.  A minute clinic is great because a lot of the first category can be taken care of in very little time, and you get huge cost savings from local competition. It doesn't take much skill for a nurse to take a swab or a blood draw and send it in for culturing either.  This has the other advantage of unclogging primary and urgent care clinics.   I think this should be one of the top responses. When NK falls, the citizens will see that they lived in these conditions (which really got worse in KJI's time after the Cold War) but nobody did anything to help. You've got fucked up shit happening in Africa and the world still engages somewhat. You've got a mixture of bombings and diplomacy in the Middle East. But North Korea? "Fuck it, it's someone else's problem." The average North Korean is going to see that nobody gave a shit about their lives or how much they were suffering.   As a CEO, he actually has a legal obligation to defend his company against disparaging attacks. Remember that OP was the one who accused Reddit of "reputation laundering" first and violated the terms of the non-disparagement clause. At that points all gloves are off and any CEO worth his or her salt would go to the nuclear option.   I think from a technical skills point of view: the top 1% of software engineers have an incredible algorithmic skills. Anyone with a degree can code out a program that someone else spec'd out for them. It takes another person to be able to come up with the process.  PageRank is a great example of this. Another is probably song matching with your smartphone.   By viable they mean can carry to term. Just because a sperm can penetrate an egg doesn't mean it won't spontaneously abort after a few cell divisions.   Man, I'm so glad to hear that obnoxious Americans have dropped off that list.   Not to mention that human anatomy is something you can take in sophomore year of college. Many schools even let you do cadaver dissections in advanced undergraduate classes, if not in medical school. Now imagine if you were only doing that for a few months -- you'd figure out where everything is pretty fast.   Broken ankles sound like a suicide attempt.   Holy fuck, I'm surprised nobody's addressed this possibility.   Way too late on this, but I've seen many farms here in the US have a llama for the same purpose.   The problem is that this approach isn't intellectually consistent with religion. If you interpret it as being "this is where we want our religion to go", then you lose the concept of a single "fundamental truth" that is codified in all religions. Certainly religions, like many cultures, are manifested as "living" and "evolving" over time, but no person who represents or believes it would explicitly try to push his or her religion in one direction or another.  Just like the whole stoning people thing in the Bible: people conveniently don't talk about it because "times have changed". Do you really think that the Pope 1000 years ago really got up and said "Nope, we're not doing that anymore even though it's in the Bible?" I believe that religions change implicitly as a reflection of the surrounding culture. That is why when you go across the world, religions such as Islam and Christianity actually vary quite a bit.   Check out the live thread for more details: https://www.reddit.com/live/tnc30xhiiqom/      It started happening way before Obamacare. Companies were already fucking with people's hours just so they don't have to provide benefits.   At that rate, they should have just called it Windows Infinity^^plusone.  	107
 Using a complex adaptive AI, researchers have turned Mario into an autonomous agent that's aware of both himself and his environment. And he learns.      Elon Musk wants to build an internet for people on Mars.

Australian actor Hemsworth sheds his "Thor" costume to become Nicholas Hathaway, a "black hat" bad-guy hacker released from prison to help American authorities dismantle a criminal network.      A new study has found nearly half of those who drink alcohol in the United States have used one or more alcohol-interactive prescription medications that researchers say can lead to dangerous health complications and in some cases, be deadly.         The global heat streak of the 21st century can be explained with statistics that defy astronomical odds.               More than 11 years after Beagle 2 was lost in the early hours of Christmas day 2003, scientists said they have now found the stricken spacecraft intact but only partially deployed just 5km (3 miles) from the centre of its intended landing site on Isidis Planitia, an impact crater close to the Martian equator.   The Beagle had landed safely after all, but it didnt have the energy to bark. The UK Space Agency has confirmed that the only British space probe sent to Mars safely landed on the Red Planet but failed to fully deploy its solar panels for a successful radio transmission.         Solar power has come a long way from powering calculators to small electronics and now our homes, businesses and possibly the country. Currently roof top solar panels are dominating the solar industry and have become its flag carrier.      Musk plans to build a Hyperloop test track, approximately five miles long, and he plans to do it soon.      The CEO of SpaceX and Tesla wants to speed up the development of 800-mph tube transport. He's willing to pay for testing -- most likely in Texas -- to make it happen.         A team of researchers from MIT has now taken a novel approach to gaining such high-resolution images: Instead of making their microscopes more powerful, they have discovered a method that enlarges tissue samples by embedding them in a polymer that swells when water is added. This allows specimens to be physically magnified, and then imaged at a much higher resolution.         Urban myth that had US TV show Mythbusters weighing a truck full of pigeons on a scale and getting them to fly. Now it seems there's some truth to the idea that a truck driver carrying a cargo of birds can lighten the load by making the birds fly.      Using digital technologies does not directly cause stress, but social media can increase awareness of problems facing friends and family, and this stress is "contagious,".      Research in the nematode C. elegans in the Lithgow lab at the Buck Institute shows that iron accumulation itself may also be a significant contributor to the aging process, causing dysfunction and malfolding of proteins already implicated in the aging process.      Microplasma-gold nanoparticles on a new, highly sensitive, test strip that enables early detection of heart attacks.         In a study published today in the journal Nature, the researchers show how the nearby presence of polar (water-attracted, or hydrophilic) substances can change the way the nonpolar hydrophobic groups want to stick to each other.      Previous techniques to align the nanotubes resulted in less-than-desirable packing density, or how close the nanotubes are to one another when they are assembled in a film. However, the University of Wisconsin-Madison materials engineers pioneered a new technique, called floating evaporative self-assembly, or FESA, which they described earlier in 2014 in the ACS journal Langmuir. In that technique, researchers exploited a self-assembly phenomenon triggered by rapidly evaporating a carbon nanotube solution.                     Physical inactivity is a cause of twice as many deaths as obesity, according to a major new study.  However, we can reduce our risk of early death simply by taking a 20 minute brisk walk each day, researchers from Cambridge University said.               The discovery of a material that maintains a rechargable sulphur cathode helps to overcome a primary hurdle to building a lithium-sulphur (Li-S) battery.   Such a battery can theoretically power an electric car three times further than current lithium-ion batteries for the same weight - at much lower cost, researchers said.                Coastal developments in northeast Asia are threatening the survival of Australian migratory shorebirds, a study has found, with some species experiencing population declines of up to 75 percent over the last two decades.      Nanodiamonds have been added to the surface of a new "hyperbolic metamaterial" to enhance the production of single photons, a step toward creating devices aimed at developing quantum computers and communications technologies.      Rafflesiana pitcher plant's leaves form cup-shaped insect traps that look like a pitcher. When the rim of the plant becomes wet, it gets extremely slippery and ants walking on the surface fall victim to the voracious vegetation.         The computer is better than a friend or roommate at predicting personality traits given just 70 Facebook likes; a parent or sibling with 150; and a spouse after 300.      The first verbal conversations likely occurred between 2.5 and 1.8 million years ago and were about tool-making, a new study suggests.      The 3-dimesional photoboltaic or pv cell technology provides a new technique to increase the conversion of solar energy into electricity. This breakthrough is patterned using the light management principles in fiber optic devices, in which the 3D design is employed to trap sunlight in micro-photovoltaic structures where photons travel around until theyre turned into electrons.         Facebook users in the U.S. will soon receive Amber Alerts to help find missing children who may be located near them.      A team of chemistry and materials science experts from University of California, Santa Barbara and The Dow Chemical Company has created a novel way to overcome one of the major hurdles preventing the widespread use of controlled radical polymerization.

I'd have the police check around next door. Those sounds could easily be a burglary or squatter. Or wax Henry come to hang out with live Henry.   Dude. Follow the rules of GTFO.   Hey OP update soon okay? Hospitals don't usually end well for the folks on here. Can you give us any more info/details on the woman? It seems like this might have happened elsewhere, if there's someone going around taking out the doppelgangers.   We don't NEED proof here. That's not how it works.    Was it your last summer there because of the "murders?" Did you ever want to go back? If your dad has any stories you should post them!   Police. Call the police. Tell them you left your door open during a walk and now there's strange noises and your dog is acting like there's someone else in the house. It's better to have them think you're nuts, and know they didn't find anything, than it is to risk something happening to you and your animals.   Reason #374 why I don't go near the woods. EVER. Hope you're doing okay, OP. Where were you bleeding from? Do you have any bites or anything?   With weapons and a guarantee of hand holding, I would join a large group expedition to check things out.   Also strange: living a (mostly) normal life and then realizing at 23 that sometimes you know stuff before it happens and that you have all your life but never anything serious. Til now.   I've always wanted to try DMT but having never done more than smoke a little weed and REALLY enjoy dilaudid, I've been chicken shit. This basically solidified for me that I'll never try it. Be careful if you go back though.   I vote ingratiating yourself to them and learning the trade. If you can't beat'em, join'em!   That's actually how it feels in my head most of the time. Eat well, stay hydrated, advil helps the throb and lorazepam slows things down a bit. Trust me. I'm a part-time nanny and on contract with the petroleum board. You can handle this.   I wasn't so much saying you were BEING rude, as I was saying that being rude here is a very efficient way of screwing yourself out of an answer. I'm in Canada so maybe the rules are a bit different. I had an uncle who left the RCMP to become a PI. I hang out with car guys so I have had a plentiful helping of what cops are "really like" despite my healthy respect for the profession. Is there really no one on the force you could talk to? I mean even in passing just be like "hey remember that asshole kid who did that thing with the dogs? He just bought a leash and some machetes." I mean if all else fails you could go the vigilante route.   That's not how nosleep works bro.   I don't think I would have accepted Dean's explanation of his odd behavior when you went over there. Keep an eye on things and be suspicious of everything for a while. Remember how scared he made you?   Seconded.   Nosleep is a great place to ask for help but if you're going to be rude to the people here you're more likely to get downvoted to hell than actually helped.  Otherwise, unless you're off the force for being mentally unfit or otherwise a danger to the public, maybe it's time to ditch WalMart and start a private detective business? So you can keep an eye on things and earn a bit of credibility with the police again so when things do catch your eye, you actually have somewhere to go with it.   Honey... you didn't go to the zoo. Can you go on a walk and find a policeman? Tell him about going to the zoo. He'll help make sure you have lots to eat.   God should probably reconsider saying stuff like that... it freaks people out.   Update us ASAP OP. How is Willow?  Get her out of the house either with the police or her mum, get some friends round to help you gather up your stuff, get the cash, and get the hell away from there.    No it was perfect. Just what I needed. But I'd love to know more.   Take some time and get your thoughts together and then it's lawsuit time.   I did actually start crying at the part where you said if you've ever lost a dog, they're there. Some odd stuff has gone on tonight with my old dog's ashes and my new dog suddenly staring at the urn and wanting to lick it. You should maybe stop helping people get there early but thank you, because tonight what I really needed was to know that she's having fun and she gets to be a puppy again.   Are you... are you repeating the day? Or dead...?   Could you elaborate a bit on what you said about seeing what Darryl has become since coming back?   Talk to a counselor at school about the rain and how you've been feeling because of it.   As a nanny... this is terrifying.    Yeah dude they start filming this summer and FOX has signed them both on for a 6 episode run! With all the original writers and stuff too.   Someone please link this guy to glitch in the matrix.   Just a heads up this is probably going to get taken down as an "intro."   Just touch the garlic. You don't have to eat it. Stay safe!   Any tiny puncture marks anywhere on her OP? Needle sized up to about the size of a canine tooth? Keep her hydrated. Maybe also let us know your reaction to garlic in your next update.   Stay away from my animals or you won't have to worry about what you might become, unless you have particular worries about being worm food.   I know it's hard to imagine but... maybe you can feel her because of the connection children have to ghosts. And maybe that's why your husband moved her away, because she's interacting with you and it scares him. If what happened to you was painful that could be why thinking about it and trying to figure out what happened hurts you.    So true. We produce a never-ending supply of disposable workers who when they leave there come home and lead productive lives with their wives and.... fuck that who am I kidding. They come home addicted to drugs, living on welfare because being there teaches them ZERO marketable skills, and generally torturing an already struggling area. And you, my friend, are the first person I've spoken to who knows that's what's happening as well as I do.   I think probably burning her body and then mixing the ashes with some salt and spreading them around a place she liked. Maybe a good scrub down of the house as well, replace some flooring, new paint, breathe some new life into your place. It can do wonders for clarity and peace of mind. I'd also probably get a new bed, if money allowed for it.    Amazing. Edit: Amazing rescue and beautifully captured imagery. I have very few memories that are that clear. Props OP. Glad you're safe.   You and Tom find the cadaver he was snacking on. There must be some security cameras down there. Contact campus police or whoever and ask them to look at the footage as something strange was going on when you walked in. I think people donate their bodies to the lab right? But there's a lot of legal stuff. The authorities are likely to take it seriously if you think tampering of any sort is happening. If campus police won't listen I suggest going to the Dean and involving regular police. Until then, keep the deadbolt in place and pee somewhere else.   I'm so sorry. Have you tried Ebay or something to find another? /3   It comes from eating human flesh in general. It's a prion processing disorder. You can also have similar symptoms from eating only one meat for an extended period. Things build up in your system over time. Colloquial knowledge tends to mix up Kuru and CreutzfeldtJakob disease. That could be where the misunderstanding came from.   Totally what made me think of it. PS. X-files is back for 6 episodes!  	48
 /r/nocontext       Let her have cake.      /r/KarmaStore   I'll give permission for .01 BTC.  Or one upvote.   You can still see the $9999999999.99 price.         Come on, this is at least a .5 for Apple.    Remember 2 years ago, when you used to hide behind the couch to poop in your diaper? Same thing.  /r/nocontext      Classified   I picked up on exactly zero of these while reading it as a kid. So there's that.   Then it would be a crime to release it. No comparison.   /r/nocontext          https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/387vfo/0_bottles_of_beer/    If I offer you a deal and you don't accept it, why am I the piece of shit?  Let's start over: in your view, is there anything a company can do legally that wouldn't be right?    But if I offer you a deal and you think it's a fair deal, why am I the piece of shit?  But they *don't* think it's a fair deal. That's why many are refusing.   From http://taylorswift.tumblr.com/post/122071902085/to-apple-love-taylor  Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing.  and  We dont ask you for free iPhones. Please dont ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.  Where did anyone say they're being forced into this?   And *didn't make a deal* with others, whose music will not be on Apple Music.    There's no problem with the trial thing.  Yes, I acknowledged the legality.  To be clear, is it your claim that you should never complain about something a company does as long as it's legal?    Your claim seems to be that anyone in business can do whatever they want. Sure, nobody's claiming that Apple acted illegally here (well, [maybe not](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2933342/technology-law-regulation/apple-and-music-labels-illegally-conspired-antitrust-probe-seeks-answers-itbwcw.html), but that's not this discussion). The claim is that Apple isn't acting properly, and artists are upset.  If an artist doesn't like their contract, they should go solo.  That's what Taylor did, and that's what a lot of artists who agree with her will do.         /r/nocontext       No, someone who might pay for a song now won't for the next 3 months.  And again, if Apple thinks that won't happen, let *them* take the risk, not push it onto the artists.    The risk is that no record company will sign in with Apple.  No, the risk being discussed here is that people sign up for the trial, but don't continue afterwards, and artists lose sales they would have had otherwise. If Apple pays during the trial, then Apple's taking that risk, while now Apple's insisting that artists take that risk on themselves.   In the pouc, of course.   If Apple believes that, let them cover the loss for the first 3 months. Apple wants all the potential without any of the risk.

Any miner is free to mine RBF, so unless you connect to all miners, you can't guarantee detection anyway.   https://www.mail-archive.com/bitcoin-development@lists.sourceforge.net/msg08439.html  Having said that... honestly, zeroconf is pretty broken already. Only with pretty heroic measures like connecting to a significant fraction of the Bitcoin network at once, as well as connecting to getblocktemplate supporting miners to figure out what transactions are being mined, are services having any hope of avoiding getting ripped off. For the average user their wallets do a terrible job of showing whether or not an unconfirmed transaction will go through. For example, Schildbach's Bitcoin wallet for Android has no code at all to detect double-spends until they get mined, and I've been able to trick it into showing completely invalid transactions. In fact, currently Bitcoin XT will relay invalid transactions that are doublepsends, and Schildbach's wallet displays them as valid, unconfirmed, payments. **It's really no surprise to me that nearly no-one in the Bitcoin ecosystem accepts unconfirmed transactions without some kind of protection that doesn't rely on first-seen-safe mempool behavior.**   Yes, and links to a model of how that works, in which this snitch location sending-back is fine.   I did.  There's nothing about that model that would mean this couldn't work, and you aren't explaining why you think it would.    in the model proposed in HPMOR, there are no multiple "loops." There is only a single self consistent reality.   If that was the case, how could any timeline ever be consistent? Sending stuff back creates things that weren't there the first time around.  There aren't multiple loops in reality, but whatever creates reality must compute more than one loop.  It makes no difference if the variables he is solving for are the password to a safe or x,y,z,t coordinates. it's the same thing.  There isn't proof of impossibility inside HPMOR, and there's strong reasons to believe your model is incorrect, which you haven't addressed.               What about Native Americans?   He did grant some refunds back in the day, as I understand. They were called "staking payments".   Can you imagine Josh sticking around for over a year still making payments though?       You can sue for anything but a law can only change through an act of legislator. It stays on the books even if it has no effect.  I guess I misunderstood how that works.  So laws that have been invalidated stay on the books?  Edit: just looked this up, yeah, that's right. Wouldn't it still be relevant, just like it would be relevant if you found that a bunch of states still outlawed all abortions, though?    based on what?  Because you aren't brute forcing. On the "first" loop, he sends back a location+time. On the "second" loop, he goes to that location at that time. Let's say he fails, because somehow his actions caused it to move; the next loop he's even closer, and eventually is right by it.  According to you, no time travel loops should ever be consistent, because you'll always create small perturbations. My point is that those are smoothed out.    Police are taught Garner. It is the standard.  Thanks, that's what I wanted to know.  It could stay on the books, but it wouldn't have any effect.  Could someone then sue to strike the law from the books?  And is this story analogous to finding that a state had an abortion ban on the books?   he is trying to determine the correct values for a set of variables (x,y,z position and time) with the intention to send back the correct solution only if it's found. It is exactly the same.  Again, he does not need to test every value until getting the right ones; the "loop" probably ends within two rounds if not less.  This is very different from Harry's brute force factoring algorithm.   it happens to dumbledore in addition to harry, where attempts to use time turners to get more information result in them just writing notes to themselves not to bother.  Dumbledore wants the note and looks for it; he definitely didn't precommit to not write such a note.  Harry's a bit more complicated, but he did in fact write the note, it was in his handwriting. He definitely wasn't in a state of mind where he would never write such a note. There's even been theories that he played a prank on himself with that note (these are a bit complicated, though).  I see no reason why this couldn't be the same.  Specifically, because the info he was passing back isn't supposed to be difficult to get. There are far fewer loops required for it to become consistent, which makes any "complexity reducer" less likely to kick in.    You aren't understanding correctly. Garner v. Tennessee is law of the land and no law can be contrary to it.  That's what I thought. What am I missing? In particular, what are police taught in such a state?  Also, assuming these statutes were around when the Garner case was decided, why didn't that ruling automatically strike down those laws?    You are brute forcing a solution with multiple iterations, which is what got us "DO NOT MESS WITH TIME."  It's not brute force, just resolving perturbations. This happens elsewhere in HPMOR as well, and is well-established as possible.    It's mostly intellectual wanking  Welcome to /r/Futurology    It's technically possible for him not to catch it, but not in a way that maintains a consistent timeline.  If he tries to catch it at that time and it moves, for example, then he will need to send back a different message than the one he received, which makes that timeline inconsistent.   you used terminology that is causal.  It's sort of casual in the sense that it represents a deterministic universe model (neglecting QM). Some explanations will need to refer to the entire state of the universe, perhaps.  if it's not causal (which eliezer actually explicitly states in the link you posted), can you reformulate your assertion without causal language?  The (maybe)-possible worlds where Harry doesn't catch it are inconsistent, because in those worlds Harry sends back the info, but if he gets the info in the past, he does catch it. So there is no consistent world where he doesn't catch it, therefore he catches it.  I've also not seen an answer to the idea that he just sends back a message that cedric caught the snitch, or no message. these could be self-consistent realities.  He precommitted to send back a message with the location and time of the catching regardless of what happened, so those are not possible-worlds.   Yes, but some of these state laws are direct contradictions of the Garner ruling, if I'm understanding correctly.      That doesn't help me understand. What are police actually taught?   The trolley dilemma has a rational solution. The trolley dilemma is removed as soon as sentiment is removed from it.  You have yet to support this. I'd like to hear your resolution of the is-ought problem.  My claim is that selfishness isn't rational is from the perspective that selfishness may achieve your short term goals, but from a long term perspective it is a losing strategy.  In that case, you agree selfishness (as I use it) is rational, you just misunderstand what is meant by selfishness. Of course you also optimise long-term.  That said, even short-term selfishness can be rational; if someone only cares about the short-term, who are you to doubt their preferences?  We have not established a set of goals here... lets say the goal is to minimize your personal odds of harm.  That's definitely a selfish goals, let's take it for now.   While having self-driving cars protect their owner seems like the choice that achieves that, the opposite is true. Assume the programming comes from the manufacturer and every car gets the same programming (because for something like this that will simply be true). Now, the odds of this situation coming up in your lifetime are incredibly small, but the odds of you being the driver in this situation are even smaller, but orders of magnitude. Therefore when taken on a lifetime basis the choice that causes the least loss of life is also the choice that is least likely to kill you personally.  However, as long as cars are user modifiable, each person still has an incentive to change their own car. It's a large PD.   There's also a larger problem with your philosophy; if you were in the car making the decision real-time (this may not be practical, but it's a thought experiment), would you choose suicide to save other people? If the answer is no, then why should you accept a car that makes that same choice for you?  Your answer is probably going to be that you benefit from everyone else doing so as well. But it's not rational to cooperate in every PD, and this scenario lacks the qualities that enable cooperation.    it implies causality between different universes.  No, it doesn't.  It's rather simple to lay out a consistent model here; that you can't see one is just evidence that you haven't thought enough about it.  See http://lesswrong.com/lw/fok/causal_universes/, and his comment [there](http://lesswrong.com/lw/fok/causal_universes/7wum) for some more links.  We'll see if you have any problems with the logical system defined there.   It's not evidence of *police* discrimination, or of discrimination now.    Is there a site on the internet where people actually discuss opposing points of view in an intelligent way?  There are many, you just need to look. It depends on what you want to discuss. Even many subs can have those kinds of discussions, mainly the smaller ones.  There's been a site started recently with that explicit goal you might want to check out: http://www.omnilibrium.com/   Which drafter had a time machine?   Are police taught based on this case, or based on their local statute, which explicitly says otherwise?  For that matter, shouldn't local statutes that are contradicted by the Supreme Court be automatically struck down?    how so? he found the solution because he had the information.  Regardless of who wins, Harry will know when and where it was caught.  So are you suggesting it's possible he could send back the message "Cedric finds the snitch"?  No, the person who caught it isn't part of the message. In that case, he'd send back just the location and time, just like if he had caught it. However, that makes the cases where he doesn't catch it inconsistent, so it doesn't happen.  I don't need to be, because time turners are impossible, and the rules are not defined, even within the world.  The rules aren't rigorously defined, but there are enough bounds mentioned to extend the idea to certain other scenarios such as this one.  it's 100% conjecture about something that does not and cannot possibly exist.  You'll need to defend this idea; while I'd agree that in our world it's likely that time travel is impossible, the further claim that it cannot exist in any world seems hard to defend. I doubt you could even prove it's impossible given the laws of physics we know; as far as I know there is no consensus among physicists that wormholes cannot exist.  Do you deny that there are mathematically consistent models of time-travel, some of which make HPMOR consistent?  Once you're dismissing models because they aren't real, why read any fiction? Definitely fantasy, which isn't possible, but even other books are not true, and in the sense you seem to use the term, not possible.   That's really not that hard to mask. For one, what happens when you set up OB through Tor? It fails somehow, or blocks Tor IPs?   Are you trying to get fee free sales or many sales?  eBay charges a high fee, but they also provide a lot of exposure. What makes you think OB will do the same?  Plus, craigslist does have international sites.    I'm pretty sure the human brain isn't very good at understanding these "mechanics", if they can be called that at all.  You aren't inside my head, and that's quite presumptuous. If you claimed to understand yourself and thought my ideas contradicted the True Understanding, then you might have a point, but to claim it's not understandable at all because you don't understand is wrong.  HPMOR doesn't actually define the rules of time turners very explicitly, since they are impossible.  It's not defined explicitly; I've speculated at length in this sub on what those mechanics are given the things we do know. If you're interestested I can dig up the links.  As to why I think this specific case is implausible even within the loosely defined terms of the world, it is basically the same as the math search problem; actually, it's worse. The math problem had discrete solutions and a clear algorithm to solve it. If you treat the snitch as a set of variables (position, time, velocity), and let go of the intuition that this "seems normal" from a human perspective, you can see the "snitch finding algorithm" should run into the same problem as the math puzzle. It is attempting to brute force a search via temporal iterations.  There's a big difference; the math algorithm is designed as a brute force algorithm. The snitch isn't.  The equivalent in math would be "check if the numbers are the correct factors, if yes, send them back, if not, find the actual factors by asking whoever multiplied them or using a calculator, then send those numbers back". That only requires one "loop", and in my model it works.  In this case as well, he's not brute-forcing the search space, he's finding out the solution at the end of the loop through non-time-related methods, then sending that back, perfectly consistent with other time travel examples in HPMOR.  if you need to think about it intuitively, consider that the case where harry DOESN'T get the snitch first is more probable, so he doesn't bother sending back a message at all.  Harry resolves to send back the position of the Snitch regardless of who gets it. That makes your example inconsistent.  The time turner should optimize for path of least resistance  It's more complicated than that, and HPMOR doesn't actually say what we're optimising for, so there's some ambiguity there.      As promised:  1. We're talking about modifying your own car, not others. You have a point that it's similar to a PD, although it's not a perfect analogy, because there will be people who are never on the other side, who only drive. It's a lot more complicated than PD, more like many repeated half-PDs with different people. 2. I addressed this in the other reply. 3. Your claim is that selfishness is not rational, and your justification seems to be that it hurts other people. You then try to say it hurts yourself also, but then it wouldn't be true selfishness. Could you define rational in whatever sense you're using it that makes selfishness irrational? 4. Goals are not "objective", that's meaningless. Please explain what you mean.    that idiot will be busted in 24 hrs or less.  How so? Has OB had some technical breakthrough that allows for forced deanonymization on a decentralized platform? If not, how can you prevent people from selling whatever they want?     If the company was called TS1 at the time instead of Pixar, yes.   That actually doesn't address my point at all. You can sell on craigslist and accept bitcoin with no fees, so openbazaar isn't helping you as far as I can see if you were going to sell on ebay.   I've thought about time travel a lot, including specifically in HPMOR.  Why wouldn't this work given the HPMOR mechanics?   Funding a company that makes a single product can reasonably be called funding that product.   I'll try to address your other points later, but as for 2, how do you get around the is-ought problem and assert specific ethical injunctions?   1. It seems pretty clear that using a car that was exactly like the standard autonomous car but optimises for the owners' health in such situations is better for that owner. How is that irrational? 2. Do you feel either side of the trolley dilemma is irrational, and if so, why? 3. Your last point seems to imply that selfishness is what causes the problem; however, selfishness is a preference, and can't be irrational by itself unless you're using a nonstandard definition. 4. What part of the arguments here do you consider unobjective?   Have you been reading the prequels?   For one; when WMDs are sold anonymously online, will we be better off?   If AI don't specifically like us, they won't need these technologies to destroy us.  That doesn't make the other points invalid though.   There were six listed in the government's sentencing submission. That's just the ones they could prove likely came from SR (one was discovered dead with their browser open to SR, and a tracking number within belonging to a drug package nearby).   The claims in there of safety are speculation, not data based. Read it yourself please.   The government introduced evidence of six deaths.   When you have VCs funding these noncompanies, it can get confusing.   That's not a fair analogy; the benefit from internet communication is orders of magnitudes greater than the potential loss from terrorist use. It's nonobvious to say the least that the same is true of decentralized marketplaces. We all know that illicit sales will be a significant portion of what takes place, far more than the portion of internet communication that is illicit.   So   Is anything written there untrue?  i do think that any AI worthy of being a threat won't need Openbazaar to be dangerous, but the other points seem valid if true.   Leonard! Stephen Hawking said something that I didn't understand!   If you read the actual articles, they say it affects anyone without solar panels, such as the poor and people in apartments. They also mention that those are disproportionately minorities, but it's not the main point.    The argument seems to be that the money given for solar panels is more than what the utility makes from the energy, and so they must raise prices for those without panels, who end up paying more than they should.   He knows where it was found and when it was found, and sends both facts back. Pretty simple.   Only ten to try, brb   Point out to your friends that even though individual votes may not matter, posting on social media may convince many people not to vote, which will matter more.  So they should stfu online.    I also don't think the question is valid.  From your next part it sounds like you think the answer is simple. But that doesn't imply the question is invalid.  Always minimize loss of life.  If you have to choose one life over another choose the one with least property damage. If both are equal in all respects (probably will never happen) choose the driver.  That implies killing the least number of people if possible, which is one possible answer. However, note that the driver might not like this, and might not want such a car.  There are ethical problems with designing features that only hurt the owner.  It's definitely not as simple as you make it out to be, there's also the many people who don't think we should kill one person in the trolley problem and so on.   It assumes a level of knowledge that isn't practically possible. If I was designing a system I would design it to minimize harm as well as it could, with no life having priority over any other  How is that possible? If it comes to such a situation as described, what does it actually do?  Or are you claiming that design decisions will never need to take into account these kinds of situations? Isn't it better to decide them now rather than depend on some system that you feel shouldn't be answering these questions anyway?  That is, unless you think a autonomous car will somehow never have enough data to decide that it's in a situation with tradeoffs, anyone designing a car needs to decide which tradeoff to take.  It's also been posted at least three times already this week.   I didn't see this link before.   We know from canon that Felix Felicis is banned, surely time-turners are as well (and presumably there are detection techniques).   Even had he not found the snitch, he'd know where it was. Doesn't seem to be a problem.   but like parchment versus rock, the game was a foregone conclusion: the parchment would have a rock shaped hole through it.  I have a love-hate relationship with these cultural vignettes.

Yes, the world is less competent than you thought when you were 5.  The elites are still pretty damn competent.   No fees for sending to friends from a bank account.   This just eliminates a handful of clicks. In theory a userscript or extension could have done this for someone who wanted.  Instead of having to buy bitcoin then send it, you can do it in one step. Plus a feature they already had for merchants is now available for others. (And it's not like other companies didn't already offer autoselling.) Big deal.   Anything for me?   You're the Illuminati, got it   Plot twist: he's not your father.   What incentive do the elites have to act while the robots are obsoleting the non-elites?   [Yes?](http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/new.gif)    It means the aggregator will not be liable for the actions of those whose content they display. Full stop.  That is wrong.  http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/indemnify  To compensate for loss or damage; to provide security for financial reimbursement to an individual in case of a specified loss incurred by the person.   That's not what indemnify means, or at least not the only meaning.    Indemnity is already true from a legal standpoint for search engine/aggregators (Google News for example)  Source? Where was someone found liable to Google to pay legal expenses?  This guy seems to be under the mistaken impression that Apple is granting themselves further protections under the law than what already exists.  It's pretty clear that the terms aren't legally enforceable because he didn't agree to them; Apple pretty much implies that they are taking them as agreed to.  I mean, how do you read  When your RSS content is included in News, here are the terms that will apply:  , knowing that they are including your content by default, and not interpret that as Apple claiming something they shouldn't be? Terms are generally understood as creating new legal obligations.   The question is whether to prioritize your own life over others.    Do you think we will have a worldwide nuclear war in the next 20 years?  Unwilling to say. There are strong reasons to think either way, and I don't feel qualified to speculate.  This does bring up the discussion of international political economy response to a country developing stuff other countries dont like  which meets your second question. Typically this is met with sanctions then war.  That only works if the other countries are more powerful. If one country develops robots first, I doubt the world is competent enough to ban them worldwide.   That's a false dictotomy; you can have too little control to stop but enough to choose between options.    To make the jump from where we are to the robot replacement ignores hundreds of thousands of steps that provide feedback and allow for course correction or organized activism to affect the outcome that, if the system of political economy is working, (whether or not it is working to my or your satisfaction currently is not relevant) should stop it from happening.  How can you stop that? Would you support a ban on robots?  Give details, please.  To take your third point specifically, when enough people are affected they will do something about it. Conflict is as much a part of economics as money or anything else. It is a way people respond to the distribution of scarce resources.  That has historically failed far too many times for me to feel safe.  The problem with the current state of income inequality is that, save the very poorest people, most people have a standard of living that was unimaginable even 30 years ago.   Define "most people". If you mean 50% of humans on this planet, that is *not* obvious, and needs to be argued for.  People (I am talking about in the US here) are not changing things because for the vast majority of them, life aint really that bad.  Agreed, although I think the majority is less than vast.  Switch over to your example  and lets just say we are half way to your extreme example where people are being replace at a relatively high rate and unable to find gainful employment  the picture changes at that point and the people organize to get their interests and needs heard and met.  And how do these 50% of humans, say, who can't do anything better than robots, "organize to get their needs met"? Who has an incentive to meet their needs?  I like [this quote](http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/)  Once a robot can do everything an IQ 80 human can do, only better and cheaper, there will be no reason to employ IQ 80 humans. Once a robot can do everything an IQ 120 human can do, only better and cheaper, there will be no reason to employ IQ 120 humans. Once a robot can do everything an IQ 180 human can do, only better and cheaper, there will be no reason to employ humans at all, in the vanishingly unlikely scenario that there are any left by that point.  How exactly will people mobilize to prevent that?    The company that is building and programing robots in the near term I would imagine. Or are you talking robots buildin robots?  Well, yes. If a robot can do anything you can, there's no reason the company still hires you as opposed to a robot.  Theoretically, the leisure class will have arrived (if the human race was rational) and people would be involved in the production and programming  But we've stipulated that robots are better than humans; why have a human produce and program when a robot can do it more efficiently?  or just share in the resources our new robot overlords provided and chillax.  HAHAHAHAHAHAHA. Excuse me, have you seen what happens to actual modern day societies when there are extra resources? They don't end up trickling down too much. If we can't solve poverty for people nowdays, what makes you think we'll succeed when humans are superfluous?   In reality  because most people dont like to share - most likely wars and unrest on an unimaginable scale until a new normal is established due to the economic disparity between the haves and have-nots.  It looks you like you do get it; so why your argument above that this is natural (and implicitly safe)?   The fact that the people lobbying are in the zinc industry doesn't mean the only argument for keeping the penny is that it saves jobs.  Even if there were strong arguments unrelated to saving jobs, you'd still expect the ones to care about it most would be the ones who make money from it.   When I can buy a robot that can do literally everything you can do but for less, who is going to hire you?  Previous "industrial progress" didn't completely replace humans because they couldn't do some things humans could.  General AI would be able to.         There seems to be some sort of entitlement that users in here can dictate exactly what services provide them.  The other extreme is not allowing any user complaints. Your logic would say that no one can ever complain about anything a company did, with the possible exception of actually illegal actions.   I think some people need a refresher, that if an organization is providing a service, and you do not follow the rules, there is a good chance they will not serve you.  Which rules? Their terms do not mention any restrictions on email.  If you would prefer to work by your own rules, you are free to create your own platform.  Would you say the same to someone complaining about Paypal's policies? Obviously nobody is forcing me to use circle, but why is complaining illegitimate?  Would you say the same to someone complaining about Coinbase closing accounts that donated to Gwern?  I would imagine there is a reason behind this, perhaps overlapping from the promotions when they were handing out free Bitcoin for accounts.  I've been ID verified and got no bonus, so that doesn't apply.  If you don't want to, I don't really see a reasonable explanation why Circles policies should adjust for your individual case...  If they want to disallow some emails, they should at least tell me on signup, or make the policy change public.   Some of us have seen way too many poorly done studies to trust like that.  When over half of studies fail to replicate, that's not an unreasonable attitude to have towards a single study. When there are multiple studies, meta-studies, etc, then we can put a bit more trust.   It's never *easy* to shift someone's beliefs, especially parents.   He explicitly says he's fine with that part; it's indemnifying Apple he's got a problem with.   There's also phone verification sometimes, coming up with names, captcha, etc, it realistically won't only take two minutes.  Besides, it's the principle of the matter. Don't want to let banning privacy emails become acceptable.   It also says it's had problems replicating. So there's that.   Isn't that equally explained by parents knowing their kids better than someone just looking at grades?   Can't tell you where to sign up; I *can* recommend frequenting /r/hacking and /r/howtohack, and Hacker News.  That link is where the bitstamp hack funds were sent to.   Why submit them, when you could [vanish with the funds](https://blockchain.info/address/1L2JsXHPMYuAa9ugvHGLwkdstCPUDemNCf)?   Circle verifies ID, there's no reason they should have a problem with the email.   Thanks.  So cards without cashout to cash I can ignore?     And that takes how long? And to do this for each site you want to sign up for?  There are legitimate reasons I use opayq, and switching to gmail would take so much longer.   So, 24 times as long as opayq.  Plus you need to check it, whereas opayq forwards all emails to your main.   I don't plan to travel at all, I'm only interested in churning for cash.  Does that mean I can completely disregard all miles/hotels/airlines cards, or are those sometimes useful even for non-travelers?   blur is easier.  How long does it take to open a gmail account? Compared to 5 seconds for a new opayq email.  	149
 I'd start right [here](http://youtu.be/Dbih0Loe5HY)   Why would Blair shave his head?   Fair enough.   But can you hide it?   Nah, I'm good sir.   Me.      Awesome picture. It's kind of crazy to see how the bottoms of the 9's are cut off in "1919" to look like "ISIS".      $45 for the bundle, $49 for shipping (to Canada).

So my sister told me to do the opposite when my son was born, and I've been ever so slightly retracting it a little bit at tub time (from 3 months when she told me this to 26 months now).

I had a dream I was walking through a cutover in the forest whilst [Black Milk by Massive Attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=li-adM-qOwI) was pouring down from the clouds. I found it both terrifying and awesome that it was happening. However, as Black Milk would probably freak some people out, I think I would go with [La Femme D'Argent by Air] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VH5bL_XbO64).   I still have to wait 2-4 more weeks. I've already picked up a another copy from HMV in the meantime.   If indie merch didn't fuck me on the last pre-order, I'd definitely sign up. I'll grab it at HMV.   I couldn't get past the opening credits, got a "this is going to be terrible" vibe.   In Canada it is.   Hannibal TV series is absolutely fantastic in my opinion.

Team was having a hard time, abandoned post. Go hard after their flag, get it out of base, ours gets taken, I die, spawn, kill their carrier, return flag, team mates cap ours. 1-1, 4 minutes left, red team flogging us hard, I play defence with carbine on flag. Kill lots of them, they back off for a little bit, I jump on the mongoose and fly into their base, die immediately, repeat that 3 more times, 4th time in base, had enough back up to get the flag just outside of the door. Red plays major defence, everyone on our team continuously dies to touch the flag, catch a break and get it past the half way point. Clock is at 30 seconds left of overtime. Entire red team killing our carriers, not even 10 seconds left we get it in our base during a repetitive massacre. Every single one of us marched into the gun fire to pull that flag closer. 2-1 win for us.  First time I laid my controller down and exclaimed happiness aloud since halo 3. It almost seemed like everyone was playing to win for once. Something I rarely ever experience in halo 4. So much fucking fun.   Alastair Crowley connection?   It won't. That's a fantastic bottle. The Puscifer music videos are a ruse, everything else seems to have a lot of effort.   I came here to allude to this as well. It's just social commentary, one big joke. Art isn't art, it's a product.

 My dad had a car accident at 16 in which he was thrown through the windscreen into a pool of burning petrol. He had no eyelids for a few months and his face ended up looking quite a lot like this guy's, minus the nose thing.   He was in hospital for 18 months, and had time to come to terms with the fact that nobody was ever going to give him anything based on his looks.   It turned out to be the making of him in a funny sort of way, he worked his arse off, married a fine gal and became a very successful guy. I've got a ton of respect for the way he carries himself and after the initial 'whoa' most people just forget it's there. He's never even bothered going back to get more plastic surgery to make it look nicer.   Tough stage of life for it to happen but life goes on.

Kung fu, swing dancing and motorcycling are three hobbies I've found to be very social. I'm sure there's a ton of others depending on what you're into.    You have red and blue lights flashing in your helmet? I'd shit myself! Also, set your gear shifts earlier on corner entries, you're unsettling the bike.    Great post, thanks!    Nice job. I'd stick a fat flat handlebar on it.    I'd vote for him. If harden wins, the whistle da real MVP.    Chemistry and stacking the team to the rafters.    I've got a mate with a tiny knob, he's got a great philosophy on it. I wrote a song about him, you might like the sentiment: https://m.soundcloud.com/wrongtown-brothers/one-little-person   Did you deliberately pause that on a shot of Tiago Splitter? Because that thing sure looks like a splitter to me.    I'm starting to think that of all his vaunted abilities, team stacking may be the most important.    Nobody's asking no questions when it's business time.   Haha thanks! First answer that got into my thick skull.    You're right - but they're still awesome flicks.    Right there with ya. He looks like a fuckin' arsehole.    You got a gift there!    But then I violently attacked a woman.    Anything could've happened to that bunny. Split toning. I call split toning.    HOW DID YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT?    Am I going crazy? The shot you posted is nothing like any of the misty forest shots in the guy's website. No idea how you plan to get that feeling with such a wildly different shot.    Well, I think it was kind of a reference to the one-handed backwards reverse MJ did in 1988, except he threw in an alley-oop pass and went backwards between the legs. This is the one:  https://thebestten.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/michael-jordan.jpg   Except he's much shorter, and dunks off one foot where 'Nique was a 2-foot power guy. In fact he looked absolutely nothing like Dominique Wilkins 2.0, except for the fact they're both awesome.   Sorry mate, I was ready to get on board until the Wiggins trade, and since J.R. Smith came across I've got nothing but contempt. It's just another grasping pop-up superteam.    Australia, whoever is beating the Cavaliers, probably Westbrook.    I've had a hubsan x4 and a syma x5. The syma cost 40 bucks and has been amazingly durable. I destroyed the hubsan in 24 hours. The ones without cameras are lighter and easier to fly.    My god she almost doesn't look real.   They'd need to give Vince an extra scorecard to hold up that says "I coulda done better."    I say we bash 'em.   The East is gonna smash the west with dazzling fundamental peach basket.   That's a crash, not a close call. And it sure doesn't look like smart riding. Glad you got off with an easy wake-up call and I hope you pull your head in until your ambitions and your talent line up a bit closer, to paraphrase Casey Stoner.   In the face of the MVP, no less.   ba doooo doooo doooo   That cake looks more like your dad than your dad does.    So you're saying they have an offense but he's refusing to run it?    Chicago needs some kind of offensive system. I've only seen one full game recently - at the warriors - but the bulls hardly seemed to move the ball at all. One pass, maybe one screen, then iso Rose or Pau with zero off ball movement. Pau is great in the post but Rose was chucking up contested off balance jumpers all night - and it didn't look like he had a ton of other options.    Instructions unclear....      I would have gone with 'aladocious' instead of 'alidocious.'   Well look at it. The right surface of the left rock is lit and vice versa. The light source is in the middle. If you wrap a 180 panorama around, the left side of the frame is looking 90 degrees to your left, and the sun is still back at 0 degrees,  so the angles makes sense.    I recommend having a go in a variety of awkward places you can look back and laugh about later. That's what being a kid's all about!    What if it's a 180-degree panorama stitch? Then it would make sense that the rocks on the right and left would be lit the way they are.   That 360 two-hand windmill thing would have been a stunner if he made it.   Some buddies of mine often go to Gasolina in south wharf to watch motogp/sbk. The guys there love their bikes, too.    Cheers!    I'm in town to do a few bike tests, and I thought I'd pick up a lid while I'm here. Cycle Gear? What's the best place to shop?   Let it be so.    This is where you offer to wear a homemade cock'n'balls hat and video yourself walking around a shopping mall if you're wrong.    You've nailed it... I'm an Aussie in America this week and it feels incredibly insincere and weird to have people constantly attending to me. I don't like it, I'd much prefer to be on equal footing with them. Mind you it's gone the other way in some of the fancy coffee shops in Melbourne, where the wait staff make it clear they feel like they're way cooler than you.   Ah for fuck's sake, really? 20% is the standard? Fucking hell.    Yeah man, the theatrics on the launch were unbelievable.   Clearly you need more stars.    Maybe, but a shit planner!    C'mon dude, it's all just meat and bones. You'll get over it.   Sold!   I stuffed up my travel itinerary and bought a ticket to the game, but I'm flying out 2 hours before tip-off. Gutted. Also, I can't resell on ticketmaster because you need a damn American credit card. So... Anyone here want it? 3rd row behind the Pelicans bench. :(   Wall formed, league fucked.   Well.... it's kinda nice.    I hear they have a coke machine now.   It might end up cheaper to rent a car after all - how bizarre!    Indeed - that's a wonderful tourer, one of the comfiest and most practical things I've ridden. Dunno if I'd really call it an ADV bike though, it's much more of a road bike.    Let me know if you hear any more about it. I might ring the Pistons box office when i get there.    Daaaamn 40 bucks each way ain't a cheap night out. :(   I guess I could rent a car if I had to, but is there an easy way to get out there without one?   Aussie here, excited to get tickets to my first NBA game, and maybe a second. I'm staying in the city centre and need to get out to the Palace for the Pelicans and maybe the Nets in the next few days. Google Maps is telling me it's a 3 hour, 4-connection bus ride out there... Whaaaaat? Is there an easy way to get to the game? What would a cab cost? Thanks for your help!   Yeah, for sure, it's a bizarre idea. But these are transcontinental tourers and that size makes things smooth and comfy on the road.   Yep and yep. I think it doubles as a torque extender for the other tools too.    Cheers for the kind words. This is no intermediate level bike, it's a monster. I'm gonna try to get hold of some of those 800cc Triumph triples, maybe a BMW F800 GS or a crossrunner. Til I've tried a few I can't really make a call. But they're all huge compared to a proper dirt bike - the KLR and DR650 are decent dirt focused compromises for road/trail touring.    I don't disagree with you - nobody wants to see my ugly mug. Unfortunately I don't always have time to go and make appropriate vision to cover every second of the voiceover, and a talking head makes for an easy edit. I've done plenty of others the way you've suggested but this time the bike was back before I had written the story. Sorry!    Cheers mate!   They sure are, man. Great once you get going but you better be real careful where you put a foot down. Gave me an appreciation for what our short-arse riding sisters have to deal with.       Nick the Dick. And he's flopping it onto a hot dog bun on a serving tray if memory serves. Great movie!    No amount of patents can convince me that hydrogen will take over as the next big thing. It's a pain in the arse to deal with, and a hugely inefficient use of energy.    It looks like they actually took it off his Facebook page. Luck it down folks!    LeBron could be awesome. He just doesn't wanna.    I've been riding more than 12 years. Take me off a bike and I'm still that kid.    You can say poo, you're on the Internet.    The 1980s Celtics plus Len Bias.    Dunk of the year? It's great, but he does something like this every other game!    If it makes you feel better, he's been phoning it in all season anyway.    White Australian here. Appropriation is one thing you could call it - another is that she acts like a complete fool. But hey, pop music wouldn't be doing its job if old people like me didn't think it was garbage.    You should have sex with him. If he likes it, he's a total pervert.    Did... Did I just hear you bitching about bitching about bitching? HOW DEEP CAN WE GO?    LOVE FIST! LOVE FIST!    I would love to see a video of this.    Let's just hope he doesn't take the *other* Paul George leap.    And now we can get back to not wanting to watch it.    Don't bother with the camera, they're absolute shite until you get very expensive and add a stabilising gimbal. They also weigh the quad down and chew battery. The same Sena without the camera is even better.    Except your skill at conjugation.    Personally, I lost my shit when I saw it melt away. I even called the missus over to gawk.   A buddy of mine used to work picking up corpses for the coroner. She said these kinds of deaths were way more common than you'd think.    Way i read it, he was giving his team a serve for how badly they got torched in the first half.    *predominant   It's rubbish.   They laid the groundwork, but the NBA rose and fell internationally with Jordan.    Jordan more or less *created* the golden age of basketball.    AKA 'the vaginalympics.'   Bands live and die on their lead singer - I've been in quite a few. And the most interesting people artistically are often complete twats. LSD, in the Van Halen sense, is very real.    That floater is Rose's skyhook. Unguardable, instant release, over 7 footers no worries.   Shows how much I know, I don't even think I'd star that one in Lightroom...   But he's sprinting that fast on snow and ice...  	115
 I dont want idra near OGN. MonteCristo and Doa are amazing as they are.   its a cultural thing from starcraft broodwar where fan girls would skip school to attend matches. They would hide their face in order to not be recognized. Add in cultural shyness and you get hidden faces   i kept yelling at him to use it! it was pissing me off   my dad wouldn't let me watch lion king because he thought hakuna matata was a curse word   i believe round of 16 is in studio   i hope it makes it to the front page just to show how much this community enables and celebrates this sort of behavior   Ap Euro History, AP US Govt, and AP Us History were all easy. AP Calc was a breeze. Ap English Lit/Lang where annoying I also took Organic Chem, Analytical Chem, and BioChem so that might be why I thought AP CHem/AP Bio were easier than AP Physics   and AP Physics.... never take AP Physics.   Source: I took AP Chem, AP Bio, and AP Physics.   i'm just happy to be getting a consistent stream from the ESL instead of all the stuttering delays you see on their LCS coverage   are they giving you a chance to get back into the bracket too?   it is..husky was saying it an mlg ago and when day9 asked him why he said tyler told him noonie is correct pronunciation.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MibQYMyRBpc   I love MonteCristo cosplaying Phreak.    catz streamed the first 3, where they tied again. may want to keep an eye on that stream   we are waiting for a group to finish..there is a 3 way tie between strelok, lucifron, and yugioh. They are playing out tie breakers.   because they have been the regulars on the new SOTG   Any one else experiencing this issue?   He went to Korea for the wcs announcement    A lot of the Chinese players have been doing this   Any time sundance talks i feel like he is lying/doing the corporate shill   the bracket also says a lot of people won their series 1-0   yes america is 1 qualifier..top 8 make the field   think you were a little too early with that    Siw wins both games versus XLord with overwhelming numbers of blink stalkers. Mental King showing solid mmm play vs targa      down again   Combine this with protoss also having control of very early game with the new available pressures/all ins available   casting from replays to accommodate Koreans even more.   I honestly don't understand why blizzard chose ESL...especially after being able to watch them botch the entire EU LCS for LOL.    I would like to point you towards reddit.com/r/allthingsterran :)   1. i transfer 4-6 ish, once my first command center is slightly below saturation i point both cc's towards second (or maybe even my third)  2. As I low down my 4th cc i tend to stop making scvs. I'm looking for an army of 60-75 ish supply most the time.  3. terran drops? usually a about 3 well placed turrets on corner of you bases will stop most but you can obviously play super safe with more. for zergling counter attacks i make a wall at natural and at 3rd ramps with bunkers by each(usually with 3 marines inside)  4. Thats a really broad question. go over to the allthingsterran subreddit and check out the [build guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/AllThingsTerran/comments/1c9gbb/gosubuilds_update_1_month_after_hots/)   Did the party ever get paid for the brightblade mission or did the screw it up too bad?      violet is back in korea now(notably playing in GSTL )   i was trying to frame it in a way a LOL fan would understand    Code S is the SC2 equivalent of LCS...or more accurately its like OGNLol. ALL the best Koreans tend to play there(and Koreans tend to be the best players). Code A is the "minor leagues"..these players have an opportunity to get into code S next season.  All the new WCS action will be available on twitch.tv in free 720p but VODS might be behind a pay wall(similar to OGNLol).   The fear was more noticed to me in the tavern mostly. You can say that to this point most merchants have been bartering with the party but since visiting dalomar this particular merchant seemed very gruff/upset(especially for someone who raised his price by 100 gold). I may be reading into it though.    The first thing I noticed about dalomar when he questiones the group was that he said lower LEVELS(plural). The group only went down one level so that clues me in to them missing something. Also, dalomar seemed relatively uninterested in the book and more interested in the contents on the keep. This leads me to believe the book was a red herring used to get the party to find something else.  I've noticed that sense the party visited dalomar that towns people have been swindling them and giving them distance. Ryan thought this was respect but I view it as fear...obviously the people are afraid of the group since they started talking with dalomar.  I think everything dalomar gave them was exactly form that script(wizards don't haphazardly do anything...just ask gandolf). The arrows and rope were supposed to be used to create a path for the party not touching the floor to not spring and traps, the oil for the acid coins, the torches BC he knew they would be descending levels into darkness, etc   Two questions...I noticed Dalomar said lower levels(plural)..yet the party only explore one lower level. Was this on purpose if you can comment on it.. 2. Was the book they retreived actually the book Dalomar was looking for..furthermore...did dalomar even want the book. it seemed from his line of questioning he was more interested in the spirit   I'm logged into NA and I have been stuck searching for a match indefinitely. Is anyone else experiencing this? I would contact riot support but the webpage seems to be down....   no but zerg players do. ZING!    i had actually checked to not continue my subscription and still got charged the $30...   i should note i dont represent nasa opinions blah blah blah..but making enough noise with congress does make changes(see SOPA)   yup   sequestration cuts  Source:I work at NASA   The correct answer is Naw-Fuck   i live in norfolk, va . well hampton actually but close enough   disappointing that wont be able to have a true midnight release party :(      basically you quit right as the hard part ended...the rest is all balance poses and your heart rate comes down and you can relax   I 3 you. FYI B1 spoils result of B2.   that EG Curse is strong.   merely fat that hadn't disappeared yet...i was 170 ish when that pic was taken and it takes me getting down to 155lb to appear lean   a little wider than shoulder width. Grip is the main problem but my back rounds like a mofo on my way down. doing some accesory work to try and strengthen it so i can keep my chest up. here is my [form check video](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/181kp3/form_check_squat_deadlift_bench/) from a couple weeks ago.    my goal is to not be weak ass. More specifically to meet the standards for the 3 main lifts. 1.5xbodyweight squat etc. i'm stalling at 115 lb press, 145 lb squat and 185 lb deadlift. done 1 reset on all and back to those numbers and still stalled.   actually i've been struggling with getting results from the heavy lifting thing. lol   these are my results from day 0 to day 90: http://imgur.com/a/6lGX5 The wasn't super strict on my diet the last two months and i skipped a lot of kenpoX days bc i was "didn't have time"  that being said i lost 25 lbs and was significantly more fit afterwards.  My one word of warning is that if you are the sort of person who has a hard time motivating yourself, you WILL struggle to do the entire program   it just looks wrong..both teams are making bans they just only appear on one side   yeah there is a glitch in custom games right now. it was happening on MLG prizefights last night too   they're either new balance running shoes or nike basketball shoes. don't remember which i was wearing last night T.T   sorry for being an idiot..fixed   * [bench](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bIk0aeZinA) 5 reps at 95lbs * [squat](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xji2zF0fNeQ) 5 reps at 115lbs * [deadlift](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evbHJl5pvNI) 5 reps at 135lbs  I did lighter lifts so I could really focus on my form. Any tips would be helpful.   i with i had people that would tell me my form sucked or if i was doing okay...I'm always unsure.   i hit level 30 with 0 normal wins...i always played intermediate bots until then   Lol fans love the DoA/Monte Cristo synergy. in LoL casts they are the opposite where Doa plays tasteless to Cristo's Artosis.   I'm still following my resolutions: No weight change :( but my lifts have changed:  Deadlift: 125lbs  --- 200 lbs Squats: 85lbs -- 125lbs Bench: 100lbs -- 120lbs OHP: 55lbs --- 70 lbs  I'm doing beachbodies BodyBeast routine whilst adding in the SS lifts on appropriate days(i do bench before chest day etc)   I read this as "6 Western/Independent korean players" rather than as "6 western players and Independent Korean players"   if you want to kill it more do the DB Deadlifts after your high weight deadlifts. For example I did my SS style deadlift progression(45lb*5reps, 60lbs*4 reps, 95lbs * 3 reps, 135 lbs * 2 reps, 205lbs * 5 reps) followed by BB deadlift progression(25 lbs *15 reps, 40 lbs * 12 reps, 50 lbs * 8 reps, 40lbs * 8 reps) and continuing on with the rest of the BB back exercises.   yes. although it seems to have gone away of late for me if i stick to the lower resolutions   the walmart i go has 1lb ground turkey similar to this:  [ground turkey](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Fresh-85-Lean-Ground-Turkey/14089618)   I say skinnyfat as most people on this subreddit understand that means an ectomorph somatotype generally characterized by a pear body shape  with most my fat on my stomach. I'm very aware that classifies as overweight (hence why i'm working out ) :D  I will try morning time weighing and see if that changes things.   Every day before doing the BB routine, I do a SS style lift. Max Chest press, max squats, max deadlift, max OHP, max shrugs. I then do the BB routine as accessory work   mostly eyeballing while using loseit.com to track. for example. i'll cook a lb of ground turkey in a pan and then use half the pan and say thats 8oz    i went down to 188 and then recently popped back up to 190. I'm always weighing myself at 7:15pm before i eat dinner   I've definitely raised numbers on all my lifts(ex started at 125 for deadlift, cranked out 160 last night). friday is my cardio/core day(specifically HIIT)   I'm a 5'11" , 190lb skinny-fat male. For the past month, I've been practicing my fork put downs(1800 cals, 50% p, 30% c, 20% f). as well as working out 5 days a week.    M-max chest 3x5, chest accesory work, tricep work   T-Max squat 3x5, more squats...even more squats. calf raises   W-max deadlift 1x5, dumbbell deadlifts, rows, bicep curls   R-Max OHP 3x5, shoulder press, lateral raise, upright rows, Max shrugs   F-HIIT/core  Two questions: 1. Why is my weight not changing? Do i need to cut calories more? is my 30% carbs too much? Do i need more cals so my body doesn't hold in fat(that feels brosciency) 2. All my workouts last a little over an hour. sometimes i'm soaked with sweat(see leg day) and other times I feel a pump but don't sweat...does that mean i need to work out harder/longer on those days   I think it would be nice if everything submitted got auto-tagged spoiler until a moderator changed it bc a lot times spoilers are getting to the front page before being tagged.   Doesn't SK gaming have a major presence in Poland?   definitely check r/p90x out. I did it last year and lost 20 lbs and toned up a bit. ANd don't listen to the naysayers  you can definitely gain strength doing it if you push hard and keep trying to up your weights   MRN first appeared at MLG Anaheim 2012. many of us have been follwing since then. Especially since the owner is a member of the Fighting Game Community and the manager(DJWheat) is well respected by most gaming communities    the teams name is TowerDiveTv...hence TDT  	79
 Interesting to read these comments. As mentioned in the blog, I'm a psychologist who seems to have accidentally developed a specialty with this type of problem - through no planning of my own. Any suggestions/experiences you have might be helpful. I'd like to be able to quote you tho (without revealing identifying info or your handle) in my talk if possible.  In Welcome, Sato's problem seems to have been a combo of a triggering panic attack, low self-confidence, and uncertainty about direction. Once rolling, the problem was sustained with internet use (hard to imagine large numbers staying indoors for 4 years with novels) and - interestingly suggested in episode 23 - the luxury of a parent-supplied economic safety net.  Any thoughts about these, and suggestions for other causes or maintaining factors (rest assured I have many more - didn't learn about this from WTTN)?         BTW, here's a link to a course called What Is Depression. Normally there's a fee, but the link gets in for free. https://www.udemy.com/what-is-depression/?couponCode=whatistrial   Whether or not you have a clinical depression, it does sound like you are having a lot of symptoms of low mood. Seeking out a counsellor who can help with your thoughts about school and where you'd like your life to go would be a good idea. The depressed frame of mind pulls a person to focus endlessly on what they DON'T like, whereas to move forward often you need to forcefully redirect your mind to what you WOULD like instead. A therapist can help with this.      Arguably not being cranky is a bit difficult this week, given the news in Nigeria. Nevertheless, it's often a good goal.         And yet, through hateful and hurtful means, Phelps provided a model for the logical extension of believing in Leviticus. In so doing, I think he inadvertently caused more people to rethink their homophobia than anyone in history.  Not a popular idea, but ultimately it can help to have your enemies behave like idiots. http://www.psychologysalon.com/2014/03/fred-phelps-inadvertent-ally.html   	10

The WW flour will create a softer cookie with a softer mouth feel than a regular flour cookie. Try halving the recipe and giving it a try. A small bag of Whole Wheat flour is not that expensive and if you don't like the cookies you can look up muffin or quick bread recipes to try.

I personally like it a little darker.                                 Have you seen this video, it has a lot very interesting information on the Tiny House Movement and on American Urban Policy itself. A must watch for anybody interested in the Tiny House Movement. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-zESacteu4      Another view https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udQvxmq7AhQ   Don't forget "Murder by Death" watch "I gotta go to the can again and I don't want to miss nothing!" at 2:50 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szG35uyiiuk   That's the kitchen, and that's the kitchen table where they eat as evidenced by the chairs alongside. The table is steel because they also use it as a base to climb the ladder to get upstairs.         http://architizer.com/projects/18-m-width-house/      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5060110      I want to see the pic when one of these stunts go horribly wrong. Then the family can sue because he was able to get up there somehow.   Just keep the table clean for when you use the ladder to up and down.      (1) How the hell did I miss that the other day and (2) WhyTF didn't karmadecay catch that!   I didn't crop or change the pic in anyway. I just checked karmadecay with the pic as I found it. I checked other pics and they came up already posted. Odd. Maybe because of the nsfw tag? It's been well over 3 months so I might have posted it anyway because it's a cool pic. I can only go by what it says, right?   i found it on redass, thought it looked cool. Your probably right.   I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059739 and I have to say they really compliment each other.      Man did he quickly disappear when those child abuse rumors popped up.      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059586 and again got some nice nsfw pics on karmadecay   Was on Lexington Av NYC waiting to turn on 59th Street, in front of Bloomingdale's, when a man wearing all white, White Hat, white suit, white shoes wearing a full length White Sable Fur Coat carrying a large Bloomingdale's bag erupts from the store's entrance and runs full speed headlong into oncoming traffic, dodging moving cars and quickly disappears into the 59 street subway station. Out pops two security guards a minute later but the guy is gone. I've wondered since then what the story was behind that mad dash.   I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059451 and some nsfw pics popped up on karmadecay for this this pic.      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059310 and here's the link to more incredible pictures http://www.boredpanda.com/dam-curry-rice-damukare-japan/      I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059310 and here's the link to more incredible pictures http://www.boredpanda.com/dam-curry-rice-damukare-japan/         It's a conspiracy ; ) Here's a direct link (I hope) http://www.jspacenews.com/jspace-quotables-10-quotes-legendary-jewish-comedians/      I checkedhttp://karmadecay.com/results/u5059215 and here's the story http://www.greenatom.net/news/indias-prime-minister-blames-rising-pollution-on-changing-lifestyles/               I checked http://karmadecay.com/results/u5059090 and here you go http://www.cracked.com/article_21654_6-treasures-ancient-world-destroyed-by-idiots.html here's a before and after shot.

    "It is not my intention to doubt that the doctrine of the Illuminati and the principles of Jacobinism had not spread in the United States. On the contrary, no one is more satisfied of this fact than I am. The idea that I meant to convey, was, that I did not believe that the Lodges of Free Masons in _this_ Country had, as Societies, endeavoured to propagate the diabolical tenets of the first, or pernicious principles of the latter (if they are susceptible of separation). That Individuals of them may have done it, or that the founder, or instrument employed to found, the Democratic Societies in the United States, may have had these objects; and actually had a separation of the People from their Government in view, is too evident to be questioned." ~ George Washington "If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency, first by inflation, then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their Fathers conquered...I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies... The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people, to whom it properly belongs." ~ Thomas Jefferson        	4
 Never been to one before but seriously considering it for the premium experience especially for a movie of this caliber. Is paying extra for gold class worth it over your average walk in cinema?   HOLY DAMN MY EYES!   Sounds your like your psu is dying and gta 5 is pushing it to the limit.          im gonna pre order it just to piss you off.    It will be on Origin.  Not steam.    And of course people still bitch about batmans voice. their never gonna get it right enough to please enough people. I thought it was bad ass. I hope they go through with it.       mine will. i7, 8gb ram, gtx 970. I'm ready for this game.       who cares! buy!   Star Wars and Batman V Superman. I'm in total geek mode right now! hype!   what about the people who got tickets to the imax event? kinda sucks for them .   works for me.    new link! http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/JoshWildingNewsAndReviews/news/?a=118811   Gone. These are dropping like flies lol.    and yours is gone too lol.   And its gone. Sorry peeps.          he doesn't get any say in whether or not they crossover. if marvel and kevin feige want it to happen it will happen with or without him.    amd cpus naturally run hot. 77C is nothing to worry about imo. when it gets 80c or above then worry.    crikey thats 2am my time. oh well. sleep is for the weak!      **** I hate reviewers like these. They try to be different for the sake of being different but don't express their own actual opinion.    the new force awakens trailer and star wars battle front trailer will premiere at star wars celebration.    Too late hes Doctor Strange and hes going to be awesome.    why? as long as Tom Cruise is physically able to play the role of Ethan Hunt keep making the moies.       Yea not right now but down the line mainly due to the fact that Miles doesn't exist until peter parker dies. so theres that.    So Is 3d bluray still a thing, and do people use it? if so whats it like? Also whats the current adoption rate of 4k tvs? have you guys moved to 4k yet or are you sticking with 1080p tvs?   Disagree. I still enjoy arrow but Flash has been vastly superior to arrow this season.       Could be a bad overclock. Did you overclock at all recently?            Seems to be missing some movies.       War machine.       Reminds of  me of what happened with Patty Jenkins and Thor 2.       Hey ive got the same laptop. Asus laptops are great.             Loud music at 6am.          Initially chose the wrong career path, ended up with 20k extra student loan debt that I didn't need. Now on the right path but I still regret that decision. wasted 2 years of my life. sucks man. I often wonder tho had I not made that first mistake would I have gotten to where I am now? maybe, maybe not who knows.       Loki in The Avengers. Hes got the joker elements but hes less serious I guess? not sure if thats the right way to describe him.    you sure its the thermal paste and that your cooler is mounted properly?   AMC indie spotlight.    Never. The animated movies are still really successful in their own right.            you probably have a virus or bit coin miner that found its way on to your machine.       Don't get me wrong the MCU has had some cool villains not great but cool. Loki was fun and entertaining to watch kinda reminds me of the joker a bit. Bucky was awesome too. But Fisk is just on anothr level entirely. Every time he was on screen I was legitmately scared for our heroes whic has never happened in the main MCU films because we know our hero will survive because hes got another movie out the following year. Now I really want Fisk to shows up in the new spider-man movie that would be amazing.    Spider-Man as a meta for the audiences would be kinda cool.    A little more context please.    yep episode 4 is out now lmao.       because reviewers need to write their reviews in advance.    I haven't seen anything yet to indicate they have and with all the age of ultron press the cast need to do not sure how they will find time.    Civil War begins filming next month not Doctor Strange.    The Russo Brothers    Be pretty funny if it ended up being Doctor Strange.             You know I think I saw that in a tv show.    I'm telling you man good manners get you far lol.    HP and the order of the phoenix.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgXoH6NrnOc                  I couldn't believe he was that stupid when I read that part but it turns out he is. I'm just baffled.    I know. His last comment especially just infuriated me. He admits to being a PC gamer but then calls us bastards? wtf.          Ill miss the 20th century fox logo :(   Really? Id called that innovation but that's just me.   you cant brnig the guy back if he dosn't want to. These movies are exhausting to make.    I hope its true. The piledriver architecture that AMD has been using since 2012-13 is old and out of date and AMD fans have been wanting a high end APU for some time now. Hopefully they don't screw it up like the bulldozer chips.    The july date was given to spider-man since hes now part of the MCU.       Didn't catch on? explain why it made over 2 billion dollars then? I think people liked it for what it was not because it was trying to be a poor mans star wars.    he did say in the OP there is certain things he cant talk about so Thanos is probably one of them.    Almost forgot how was Andy Serkis in the movie?    Ooh now I'm really curious.    Game of thrones and Daredevil in the same weekend. Hype.    In what way was it disappointing? did it not directly tease the next movie?   were you guys asked to lie or deny certain things about the movie?   Interesting. So I shouldn't believe everything I read on twitter then? since I saw someone say hes not in it.    Can you confirm if Loki or Heimdall appear in the movie?   Had to google this cause I never heard that Joss was actually pissed about it but it seems like he actually is from what I read which sucks because I think Idris was just excited and accidentally let it out I don't think he purposefully did it just for attention like some articles make out he did. If he is cut from AOU because of this I'm glad Joss isn't doing Infinity War he seems like a bit of a dick imo but im sure there's more to this than we publicly know.    you sure? it looks like the suit he was wearing at the end of winter soldier that he got from the museum.    Why did Dom just get up and awkwardly leave, and also where was he going and why didn't Letty go with him? I thought they were married?   I like how cap is wearing the old suit.    Bullshit it felt like a rushed movie it was almost 3 hours long lol.    Loki according to this guy. So did Idris lie about having a scene with Tom? or was it cut?  https://twitter.com/reed_tucker/status/586353360737021952   Someones getting angry sex tonight.    giving presentations or anything that involves public speaking. fuck that shit. let some other schmuck do it.       Punch myself in the face         So Its ok to talk about GTA 5 but not COD? since when did you make the rules?      Punny.    tbh I wouldn't mind if that was the case. Disney has so much on their plate right now its insane. I want this movie to get as much development time as possible before going into production.   maybe rockstar shouldn't of taken so long in the first place. The reason alot of people will pirate gta 5 is cause they dont trust rockstar to make a decent port after what happened with gta4. its hard to care about rockstar in this situation.       Link? cant seem to find it.    I remember reading that Scott Derrickson was supposed to direct with CBS films financing the project. Anyone know what happened?    I agree with AD,Elementary,TG. Haven't tried Mad Men yet. Modern Family is not my thing but The Newsroom and Doctor Who are amazing.    Agree with this one. I tried watching the piot. I couldn't even finish it, it was that bad.     I was like this at first. Took me a few tries to get into it but once I did it was awesome.             wait the video description says 13 episodes? I thought it was 10?   I'm actually curious to know more lol.          the camera makes it more cinematic.          How do you think theyll do it? Could it be as small as Hawkeyes cameo in Thor?      Original Post http://www.gpforums.co.nz/threads/498518-Are-all-mac-users-numpties?p=10533958#post10533958  Ill dig up a story I still cant get over even years on  At my old repair shop job, we had a 27" iMac come in that the user said the DVD Drive stopped working, and it was out of warranty\user didint buy applecare so apple would not touch it  Some poking about later we ended up pulling a shitload of toast and crumbs out of the slotloader, we even tipped it up and shook it and such a large amount of crumbs came out after the chunks of toast we physically fished out left us stupefied, we instantly assumed the user had kids and the kids did kid things with the mac, and as a result the drive was toast (heh)  we told the user and he went all red and said "well, I uhh.. thought it was hungry"  "huh?"  "Yeah! Well recently its always been a bit slow when you turn it on in the mornings, like its tired or something, and I figured that I feel like crap until Ive had breakfast in the morning, and I have my breakfast at the computer desk so I thought it just needed a bit more energy, so I fed it toast!"   uwotm8   Mac users eh lol.          At the start of this episode John was trying to train Finch to use a gun of sorts, preparing him for when John is gone. Anyone else think they might of been foreshadowing his death?   bullshit. if you do it properly you should only have to do it once in a life time.    At least you have a job.    That's already out.    Dr strange is next year.    Damn it you stole my answer! lol.       Seen the movie a couple of times now and I'm eager for the bluray release. Any ideas when?      End of this week. The press screenings are on the 9th.         Anyone know if arrow will get a wondercon trailer?      Yes! Even though I play it on PC. Hearthstone is one of those games that should go multiplatform. I mean it kind of has already with the iphone and android. But Im surprised those happened before the console versions. Hopefully Blizzard gets around to it.    Thats a bad way to do it in my opinion. your basically starving yourself the rest of the day. id call that an unbalanced diet.       wait campaign? da faq?      make sure its signed in contract as well that way you can sue them if you ever have a bad day lol      Barry attacking Eddie is at 1:07 in the wondercon trailer. At least I think its Eddie it looks like him.       In the wondercon trailer we see Barry punching the shit out of Eddie. My theory is that Eobard Thawne decides to leave Dr wells body after realizing that Barry is close to finding out the truth he takes over Eddies body essentially killing him (like he did with the real Dr Wells) that's why we see Eddie killing those cops in the wonder con trailer.       Revenge of the sith, Quantum of Solace.    I lost the game!         6300 is a decent cpu 4300 should be avoided at all costs .   But the human eye cant tell the difference between a 7790 and a gtx 970.    This one.    Justin Lin is directing star trek 3.    Link doesn't seem to be working just getting a blank page.       is the money in your own account? if so then legally you can access when ever you want.    keep it! not sure how you just find a mobo with an i7 on it lol but kudos to you haha.    its trademe what do you expect.    But if he doesn't get a break till December that means season 4 wont be ready at all by the fall this year?   I've been thinking with Amell now cast in TMNT2 It'll be interesting to see how they will find time to film arrow. I mean unless Season 4 features very little of Oliver I cant see when they would film it if they still want season 4 to premiere in the fall this year. TMNT2 will be filming for at least 5 or 6 months that's not including the possibility of reshoots ether and Casey Jones is an important character in the TMNT story so its not like they can film less to accommodate Amell filming arrow other wise the story would suffer. I'm wondering if the addition of this new spin off show that features some characters from arrow is a way for the CW to fill the gap so at least the CW will have an alternative to Arrow if Arrow does need to take a break this year. Thoughts?    Unfortunately it will. I'm not sure by how much though.    Too slow mate.    Like how many times did Toretto and Shaw ram their cars into each other for no reason? lol.    why does the carpet look like magets?    No its not.    Ryse son of rome is a fun pretty game if you like lots of quick time events and a cheesy michael bay esque story line .   is it batman arkham knight? what else is coming out?    So what was the deal with that? was that a subtle hint from the film makers that lucas black will have a larger roler in furious 8? Why didn't Sean go back to LA with Dom? maybe they just felt it wasn't right for this movie?    Monday to Friday its 10pm then awake at 4:15am. Weekends or holidays its when ever I feel like it .      Have you read the comics at all? if you haven't read the comics then X-men 3 is actually a pretty decent flick.    My recent obsession is Interstellar. Seen it about 5 times now. And when ever I'm doing something on my computer I always have Hans Zimmer's score in the background. Its just so damn good.    Excellent choice!         grammar natzi irl eh.             http://i.imgur.com/CzgukMH.gif  	200

 Recently I had someone request I make a Twitch stream on doing game development in C++.  I stuck with C++ and SFML, and went through and showed how to make several types of 2D games (pong clone, space invaders clone, a top-down RPG, and more).  While it's some rushed code (so as not to drag out each episode too much), it might be a decent resource to those who are interested.  You can find the entire season on my Youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFi3QmBRyyMnw0PHVM7smZh9Iw8a8WA7  I'm working on some new content for my Youtube account (game dev and programming related), as well as planning out a second season for my Twitch stuff (and focusing on increasing the quality of what I put online).  The big thing that I'm going to make better for the next season is having things a bit more prepared beforehand, as well as making sure the last episodes aren't me just sitting around rambling as much.  Any feedback on this is welcome of course.  I hope people find this useful!  You can find my Twitch stream at http://www.twitch.tv/gemisis/   Okay, so this is based on the original idea I had when I made this (sorry, been running around all day so only just got to typing this haha):  -So the start of the video would be them dancing around in circles. -Once the drums start, the start swinging in and out before fusing to Garnet. -Lyrics go with Garnet dancing around -Some kind of faster paced animation while singing goes -Once "Go ahead and hit me if you're able" is sung, they split again and dance around, maybe introduce Jasper into the video and have the three of them fighting. -Right before the first "We will always be twice the Gem that you are" they fuse back together, dancing around with Jasper at that point. -Once the solo part starts, they split apart again, dancing around. -Lyrics start again and they fuse together.  This is what I have for right now.  Feedback and such would be awesome :)  I've tried to add some personality to the current animation (it won't be the same every time), and was originally planning to have the animations change based on the beat, but still have an amount of random to look cool haha   Let's do it then! haha   If someone makes this, I will totally put it on there :D   I can understand where you're coming from.  Believe me, I'd love to have bigger prizes, it just takes time to establish oneself for something like that, and I'm just happy I can offer anything as a prize :)  And honestly, I kinda got excited for the socks.  I've never seen something like this before which made em unique imo lol Sadly these are prizes so I won't have any haha   So, this isn't being run by a company, it's by a single person, so really I'm talking with 1 or 2 people I know at these companies to get us these prizes.  They (Google and Microsoft) are putting their trust in me not to run off with everything (which I greatly appreciate), so I can understand why they wouldn't want to just hand out a $300 phone as a prize to something like this.  And of course I don't plan to run off with them to start with. :)  Hopefully in the future I'll be able to do this again with better prizes though if this one goes well :)   Easiest way to do it: Buy domain separate, and host on Google Drive.  As long as you don't mind losing server-side control, you can setup some pretty fancy sites with it.   There's a few different places you can use.  Recently I've been sticking with Google Domains (domains.google.com).  They're a bit more expensive than normal, but they have high quality management tools imo.  Another good one that is cheaper is namecheap.com, though they can be a bit confusing to use if just starting out.   I bought the domain, threw some 3D spheres together with WebGL, made em move, and add the song from somewhere I found haha  Edit: Would love to have 3D models in place of the spheres, but sadly I can't model to save my life  Kinda surprised it wasn't bought already     	10
 As I recall it, they were driven out.   People have become untrustworthy so I don't blame you. I am very guarded as well. I also think this is the reason why people have resorted to having and overly affectionate towards pets. Like women with cats for example. Still, money isn't s bad thing as long as it is used efficiently as a tool/means to achieve something of importance or value.   I haven't seen this comment so I'll just go ahead and ask:  Isn't this exactly the blueprint used by most religion today?   Your 'relative' believed he was getting you into something that would make you as rich as he was going to be. So I wouldn't blame him, he was self deluded at that point.   IBM sent emails on Saturdays. #IJS   How is this any different from politics. Specifically, how is this any different from actual work. Isn't the average job just a better paid MLM? I mean, compared to the CEOs and those within his proximity, I'd say the average worker is not really making anything   I will never understand why we have concluded that money is the 'only' possible way to motivate human beings to work or do their best.   Very true. It's actually idolizing money, which goes against the 1st commandment. We are to place only The Highest above all else so that this shapes everything we pursue in life. It's actually for your own benefit so that you are not lost. And not because you have some 'jealous' God.   That was one loaded comment. But I bet you Walmart will have a prenuptial agreement.   'Two things you need to live without worry.' That right there is the problem. You can simply decide to live without worry. Work hard and be confident in the law of reciprocity.  Also, money and power do not absolve you of worry. It often brings tenfold worry. Being at peace is more a psychic/inner state.   So I was thinking, cause you know, people do that from time to time, that you should make a conversation starter checklist too. Simply hand said list to the other party and have them check which ones they'd be happy to discuss. Win-win, no?   Here is some data on nutrition from the USDA: http://ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/go-to-the-atlas.aspx  Folks should also consider not patronizing establishments that fuel mass consumption of anything (think mcdonalds, burger king, pizza hut etc). All these 'chains' have high demand and therefore high supply and little to no accountability.  When we act without thinking especially with habits and consumption, we all tend to follow trends and fads. This is bad in ever way. Especially with food. We subconsciously become comfortable with a very very limited variety when it comes to food. We often do not experiment and learn to develop a taste for a wider variety. This is why everyone eats pizza, burgers, beef and just a handful of other foods (oh and chicken). There are millions of different types of food and millions more when you think of the number of different combinations. But we have become far to indolent and complacent in the way we live. So we can't always blame these corporations for the way they act because we basically created an environment for them to flourish.       Let's take a moment to note that beyond name calling and the sparring application of labels, you have offered absolutely nothing to the discussion here. Animals 'fight' each other for territory, mates, food. All of these things are necessary for existence. Please tell me what your blood thirst for war is about? I think you are the one living in a very sad bubble. Deluding yourself that the madness in Syria etc are 'natural'. What a sad sad human being.   It is interesting. I'm 2 years younger than you are but you look much older. Most of these things that we do socially these days are literally poisoning our bodies but we consider them 'manly' and fun. I'm glad you started to take care of yourself and I hope continue to do so. Its much more fun being in a healthy body I think.    I don't understand how this is going to help Greece. Can someone please ELI5:  1. How does taking on more debt to make payments on debts you already have, but clearly are unable to afford, work? Isn't this in fact just delaying the inevitable and making the devastation of the inevitable worse that it would be at the current time? 2. Aren't their new creditors the same creditors loaning them more money? Why don't they just get a interest free payment deferral?       Like everything, I feel that we focus too much on creating these one size box to fit an idea. Why is it either communism, capitalism, socialism, etc? These concepts were created centuries ago. We have smartphones for crying out loud, I say we rid ourselves of these outdated ideas of a time we can't forget soon enough! Why do we not create a mix by taking the observed positives from our own experiences and create something that works for us? And it does not and actually can not be the same blend for every single nation as we are all different. What is 'perfect' for the American should absolutely not be perfect for the German. Why can we not create a society without abject poverty and suffering? Well, because such a society will naturally preclude the possibility of excesses and lavish luxury. That is the answer. They are both two sides of the same coin. Want to end societal or world poverty, end societal or world excess!   But prosperity is not synonymous with wealth. Ask the Danish.  Prosperity is not having excess and not suffering from want. It is also not lazily lounging about in comfort and neither is it about overwrought nerves resulting from excessive toil. It is a balanced middle middle class.  Edit: grammar.   Here is an excerpt from a book which addresses these and many many other questions:  http://grailmessage.com/en/volume-two/earthly-possessions  Wealth and earthly possessions are gifts which should be enjoyed by being put to good use. It becomes a problem and a hindrance for many when they allow their wealth or fortune to enslave them. That is, they instead subjugate their entire life to the pursuit of and acquisition of said wealth.    Why? Are we not 'higher' animals? My point wasn't to kill and enslave each other. Animals do not do that.  If you look and read about the structure of animal society, you will hardly find killing and enslavement. You have predator prey relationships and this is a simple balancing act. There is no 'slavery' in nature, that is man's creation.  There is also no war in nature, there is however warfare, which is completely different.  I never said let them die in the gutter, my argument was in favor of what you are saying. In a sense, I said we should try and emulate a structure similar to the animals in that they do not have to 'buy' anything they need for basic survival. Building material, food, water, clothing, should be made available free to every member of society.   Human's live off logic? What type of logic comes up with the society we live in today? With all the suffering, starvation, deprivation, war and death. You 'claim' that we live off logic, but the evidence shows quite the opposite. You call them 'wild' animals but really these animals live in a perfect harmony with their environment and each other. Even in the structure of predator and prey, you still have a perfectly logical and balanced system.  You are right, we shouldn't compare humans to other animals, we have proven enough that we act lower than animals in the way we live and interact with one another.   How is a loan considered assistance?   We, my friends, are screwed!   Actually, yes.   Very good point. But if we take animals as an example, they do not have to work a job but they must put in some effort to find food and also to avoid becoming food. But they have free housing, and materials for every day life. How can we create a human equivalent?   Sure. There is precedent both from Exxon and other energy companies. Apply this to people. If tried and convicted of a crime, people are placed on parole. At that point, it suffices to just be implicated in, or be in the wrong place at the wrong time. There is no burden of proof required since he/she has shown exactly what they are capable of. Why are you acting all brand new as though Exxon and these other energy companies are any better than ex convicts?   Could this be a clue to understanding/solving warp travel? A controlled burst. Instantaneous infinitely large but short lived acceleration that warps you from point A to point B. So it appears you're almost in both places at once because of the duration of travel.   That doesn't mean they 'didn't' either.   At the end of the day, if you can be honest with yourself, this is really just looking at the opposite sex naked. In any other context this will be considered being perverted. Why does slapping the label of sport, art, or some other high sounding designation, make it any different than what it really is?   I'm not sure, I think the evidence had been conclusive for a while now. Like the article says, folks like Exxon have successfully funded the efforts to muddy the waters aka make it appear inconclusive.   Ya think?   This guy. Since when did politicians let logical reasoning get in the way of their ideology?   This sounds too logical and common-sensy. You must be communist!   This point is so sad. This country could be a much better place. We could really have stuck it you the Europeans. In a good way of course....   And not one cheetos gif. Come on Reddit..   You're putting way too much thought into this.  	37

 It wasn't a sweep...   I mean, excluding the fact that the Magic went 2-0 against the Lakers in the regular season, and were a (horrible, horrible) missed layup away from being 2-2 with the Lakers through 4 games.   66 win Cavs team with lebron putting up historically great playoff numbers = weak?   We're in the exact same asset-collecting stage as you, we don't want to give those up, and we're very high on Elfrid as our starting PG.   That's a little bit nuts. Bill Russell was unequivocally the greatest defender in NBA history, has 5 times as many MVP's as Hakeem, and was the undisputed best player on TEN championship teams (I would argue Havliceck was the best player during their '68 and '69 title runs).   Sure.    For Moses - he has a couple factors working for him. He had incredible longevity in his career, he was an all-time great scoring center, and beyond that he was one of the greatest rebounders ever, and beyond that he was THE greatest offensive rebounding center ever; he led the NBA in offensive rebounding 8 times and had a 7 year stretch where he averaged over 6 offensive rebounds a game. I won't get into the statistics of it, but that level of offensive rebounding created an extraodinary offensive advantage for his teams purely by increasing their # of possessions. Very few players in NBA history have ever offered this kind of advantage.   Secondly, he was the undisputed best player in the NBA from 1978-1983, unseating a late-prime Kareem, besting future teammate Dr. J, and preceding and delaying the Magic/Bird Rivalry as the best players in the NBA. It should be noted that during this time he won 3 MVP's, whereas Kobe only ever won 1 - and it's fair to point out that Kobe's era of MVP competition was much weaker than Malone's. This is probably one of Kobe's biggest knocks as well.    Finally, Malone was the indisputable leader of the one team that managed to win a championship RIGHT in the middle of the Lakers/Celtics dynasty era of the 80's. He did so by SWEEPING the showtime lakers with Dr. J already in hard decline (he averaged 18/7/3 on 45% in the playoffs that year). I think MM has a very strong argument over Kobe.    Second, Jerry West - West had the misfortune of playing for the Lakers in his prime against the greatest team dynasty ever assembled. Simply being on a team that MADE it to the finals 10 times in 13 years is an incredible accomplishment. Knowing he didn't ever win an MVP either makes this position a little dubious, but then knowing he was the MVP runner up 5 times makes it a little less dubious, considering his prime coincided with the Wilt/Russell/Oscar primes. West is also the NBA logo - which I deserves a couple points in my book for the sheer iconography :). Some actual numberical arguments for west: he leads kobe in career PPG, RPG, APG, and FG%. Obviously those comparisons don't hold a lot of water when adjusting for the pace of 60's games; but I'll offer two statistical counter-arguments. First, Wests game was severely hurt by the nonexistence of the three point line because West was an *incredible* shooter; in fact just looking at his FG% in the context of his era (FG% was pathetically low in the 60's) alongside arguments that we've all heard in critique of Kobe - I would say there's an argument to be made that West was a better shooter than Kobe was given the evolution of the game in their comparative careers. Second, west consistently averaged many more assists than Kobe in an era where assists were significantly harder to get credit for, which offsets to a good degree the increased # of possessions per game in the 60's.  I'll say finally that I think Kobe's career has been greatly greatly enhanced by factors outside of how good he was as a player. He was always going to be good enough to be the best player on a championship team, sure. But pairing up with prime Shaq and then having Pau-Odom-Bynum as your supporting cast when the East sent relatively weak teams both years, all while having the greatest coach in NBA history coaching your team, were strokes of absolutely incredible luck for him. He did lead his team to two championships, and he is a historically good shooter, and for that I think he definitely deserves a spot in the "God Tier" of NBA players along with about 15 other guys, but I think when you look at how truly good of a player he is I don't see him stacking up favorably purely from the circumstances of his career. When people talk about his drive and will to succeed and be the best, I think it's a great narrative and absolutely true - but ruthless competitiveness is a means and not an end. When we measure players we measure how good they were, not how they got there, so I'm not convinced that's a valid argument to move him up the pantheon.    I think the "potential" factor is pretty warranted though. He not have any attitude/mentality issues like cousins, or potentially limiting weaknesses he isn't already rapidly addressing like Kyrie *despite* being on a bad team.   And [here's a ranking of all player's seasons in NBA history who were under 21 when the season ended](http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1 match=single type=totals per_minute_base=36 per_poss_base=100 lg_id=NBA is_playoffs=N year_min= year_max= franch_id= season_start=1 season_end=-1 age_min=0 age_max=20 height_min=0 height_max=99 shoot_hand= birth_country_is=Y birth_country= is_active= is_hof= is_as= as_comp=gt as_val= pos_is_g=Y pos_is_gf=Y pos_is_f=Y pos_is_fg=Y pos_is_fc=Y pos_is_c=Y pos_is_cf=Y qual= c1stat=mp c1comp=gt c1val=2000 c2stat=per c2comp=gt c2val=18 c3stat= c3comp=gt c3val= c4stat= c4comp=gt c4val= c5stat= c5comp=gt c6mult=1.0 c6stat= order_by=per), sorted by PER. There's good reason to be very very excited for davis.   I'm almost with you here. I wouldn't put him behind KG though.  1. MJ   2. Kareem   3. Magic   4. Bird   5. Lebron   6. Wilt 7. Russell 8. Shaq 9. Duncan 10. Oscar 11. Moses Malone 12. Jerry West 13. Hakeem 14. Kobe 15. Karl Malone 16. Julius Irving  Edit: I'll happily defend any one of those players over Kobe.   Furthermore, the Magic pick must convey by 2019 and is set for 2 years after their pick is conveyed to Philly - meaning that the Lakers would have to finish in the top-5 in the next three consecutive lotteries for the Magic pick to become two consecutive 2nd rounders.  It absolutely will convey.   10 points for 35 minutes of playtime is hardly 'robust'.   Nope   Nope   Nope   Nope   Nope   Nope   looking as well   It never ends in a tie.   ... and then the game started   As someone who went to FSU during the Tebow era, I can safely say:    No one cares, fuck the Gators.   Ha. Florida State beat you guys 31-10 and more than doubled your total yardage. You guys got pretty well dominated, and like it or not, it's going to leave a lasting impression in the eyes of the voters.    Heh, according to [this](http://www.runnersworld.com/weight-loss/how-many-calories-are-you-really-burning?page=single); I'm wrong about the calories issue.  But regardless, you *really* should cover less total distance and start actually running.   1) calories burned  is roughly equal to distance covered; there is a difference between running and walking but it's negligible. at 5 miles a day you're probably burning closer to 600 or 700 calories.  2) The only real and significant way to improve your ability to run is to run. I can promise you right now that if you ran an aggregate of 10-15 minutes, 4 times a week, you will not come even close to tiring yourself out. You are worlds away from overtraining my friend. Injuries *can* happen, but that's always going to be a risk, so don't fret it.  3) If your goal is to eventually run a 5k, you should stop covering so much distance every day, and start running. Developing your cardio and slow-twitch fiber muscles are your two most important objectives, and neither are going to helped much by walking.  4) If you have a side goal of losing weight, you should do it in the kitchen.    Request: Jameis Winston TD throw against Bethune Cookman.   Yep, there are a good handfull of financial/technical papers that keep a pretty low circulation but cost like $100-250 an issue. They'll probably never die.   I saw that, and it's super helpful! I always like to get several opinions though.   I'm about to start work in tax for a national non-big4 firm, I'm a bit nervous and obviously want to do well. Should I spend the next week brushing up on my excel skills? What do I need to keep in mind on the job? Things you wish you knew going in? Tell me everything you wish you could tell yourself when you first started.   I'm about to start a full-time job, and I need about 4 or 5 new dress shirts. I checked the sidebar for both button-ups and business casual. They are both full of good info, but neither suggest any brands or brand comparisons for button-up shirts.   What are your major go-to brands for getting dress shirts? Preferably those who have online stores!   And Patrick Ewing   But to be more fair, he also averaged 48 minutes a game and 40fga per game that season, in an era where teams took on average 30-50% more fga per game than they do today.   It's weird to think that if brandon jennings was 2 months younger or had scored one more point he would be on this list.    but even then, he's above and beyond those two guys.  Stockton was all-nba first team twice, Nash was the league MVP twice.   I think there's an argument for both of them, but to suggest it's not even that close is ridiculous.   Where did your double-doubles stat come from? [This](http://www.examiner.com/article/players-with-the-most-double-doubles-nba-history) says otherwise.   Roy Hibbert has never-  * Had a full NBA month where he averaged over 10 rebounds a game * Scored 13ppg over the course of a season * shot 50% over the course of a season * Been much better at scoring than league average from really any area of the floor, per his [hoopdata](http://www.hoopdata.com/player.aspx?name=Roy%20Hibbert)   And he's 26, only a year younger than Dwight Howard. I realize that last year he was playing injured for the first half of the season, but until he has at least a full season under his belt of seriously improved play, I think the aforementioned points cast some strong doubts about his potential to be the best big man in the league.   How about this then: Roy Hibbert has never played a full regular season month of NBA basketball in which he averaged 10 rebounds a game.   Tyson's Corner, you sweet mischievous devil.   I'm glad you put a ton of effort into this post, it's refreshing to see an opinion backed by supporting arguments but... I still completely disagree, If we're comparing pre-back injury Dwight to Marc Gasol, then Dwight is still easily the better center.        You acknowledged that Dwight was significantly better at rebounding, but you seem to disregard to some degree just how much that matters for how good they are as overall players. Look, for instance, at [this graph](http://skepticalsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Top1000_11343_image001.png) showing how Dwight compares to some of the all time rebounding greats. Being such a tremendous vacuum for defensive rebounding is an *incredible* advantage that Dwight offers that Marc doesn't even meet league-par for (Marc Gasol was 84th last year in defensive rebounding rate, with Zach Randolph 20th).  Even outside of rebounding, I think your on/off the court defensive rating is specious because you're comparing two completely different teams with completely different rotations. Nobody since prime Ben Wallace (who was on par or ahead of Magic-Dwight) has even come close to being the shot-altering, game-plan changing, one-man wrecking crew Dwight was from 2009 to 2012.  On offense- I think you're spot on about Marc's versatility being an advantage, but I think your "floor spacing is everything" argument doesn't hold water. The Rockets are in theory (as the Magic were in practice) aren't going to be held back in any regard by having only one true big on the floor, their emphasis on three point shooting comports with that limitation perfectly.   Finally, unless I missed it, you completely omitted the impact Howard had as the head-and-shoulders-above-the-league best pick-and-roll center in the NBA offensively. Howard's athleticism on getting to the basket was the single biggest reason (among many others) the magic had the 2nd best offensive efficiency in the league in 2010.   Because that's 5 extra years of schooling and anywhere from 200k-450k of student loans.   Really, he's just mad we're not catering to 1946.   TBD about MKG; he isn't 20 yet, so it's not fair to entirely judge, but he hasn't shown anything between last season and summer league that he was supposed to have coming into the league.    AbeeEEeeEEeeeEEEeeed   Nah, Walton's prime was comparable to maybe any center in league history, including shaq's; it was just so absurdly short and he didn't use it to win a ring - and so it's been forgotten with time.     In re. point 3: Let's not forget that taxing the entire value of the transaction as opposed to the recognizable income on the transaction is almost an offensively stupid idea to anyone who understands how our tax code works (i.e. not r/politics) and would never make it into actual law; though even if it did it would get quickly struck down.    .5%   To be fair, Jameer didn't help them get to the finals. He was injured. Dwight did work with a backcourt of Courtney Lee (as a rookie), a much lesser developed JJ Redick, and Rafer Alston.    Right now I have it at:   1. Thunder   2. Rockets   3. Clippers   4. Spurs   5. Warriors   6. Nuggets   7. Grizzlies   8. T-Wolves/Pelicans (total crapshoot depending on injuries and fit)   Anyone 6'6 or higher is going to give him trouble, but there are plenty of SG's in the league of comparable height that he can (and usually does) defend just fine.   What the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu   SVG said that Dwight was the mot coachable player he's ever coached, and if he had the chance he would do it again in a heartbeat.    Yep. Nash winning in '05 was one of the greatest travesties in NBA MVP history. *Anyone* who would argue he deserved it over the four great bigs (Shaq, Duncan, Nowitzki, Garnett) of 05 is insane.      A  C  F   A team in a garbage position is not the same thing as a garbage team.   To be fair- that was largely a product of his low usage rate. He was drafted into a team with four good scoring options in place already, and was asked to play a limited role.    false.   Jrue Holiday, Anthony Davis, Eric Gordon, and Ryan Anderson give them four *solid* scoring options. With Vasquez' passing ability off the bench, they're a good role player signing or two away from being a ~45 win fringe WC playoff team.   If they don't trade any of the aforementioned 5 for the next two years they're all on contract, all of their players are in their young-to-mid 20's and will likely keep developing from here. I could see them getting up around 50 wins in 2014/2015 with the nucleus they have now.   Yeah! Tobias Harris averaged17/8.5/1.5blk at 20 years old, and Vucevic went 13/12 in his 2nd year in the league. Throw in Moe Harkless who is a very solid perimeter defender in the making, Nicholson with a polished offensive game, and Oladipo in the mix; we have a pretty sweet core going forward.   Block party in New Orleans.  Love it.   Anthony Davis was pretty solid offensively this past year.   I like Nicholson :(  But yeah, I totally agree.   Also- we're a bit crowded as well. Nicholson had a very nice rookie year at PF; and Tobias Harris will also probably spend most of the time there with Moe Harkless looking like a staple of our future core. We really don't have the minutes to spare unless we want to take them from Nicholson, which IMO would be a terrible idea considering how offensively refined he is already.    Yes.    Oh... fans?    No.       Also:   Kemba Walker   Ty Lawson   Tyreke Evans (if that's really his position)   Jrue Holiday   Eric Bledsoe   Damian Lillard   Brandon Jennings   Ricky Rubio   Steve Nash   Goran Dragic   Jarett Jack   and Greivis Vasquez  Chalmers is really nowhere close to the top-10.    Meh, they also signed Carlos Boozer who, despite underperforming, still made them much better.    They also signed Thibs as their coach in place of Vinny Del Negro- which meant going from having the worst coach in the league to one of the three best.   They also signed Kyle Korver, and got Taj Gibson- both were integral role players to the team's success in 2011.  So it's not nearly as simple as you're making it out to be.    Okay   That doesn't make any sense.   OLIDAPOOOOOOOO   This is great! I have a solid understanding of reformed theology, heidegger, and Calvin; but not so much modern theology or Schleiermacher, but I will definitely look into those subjects as I plan my attack for this treatise.   I mentioned in another post that I'll probably be going through the [study edition](http://www.amazon.com/Church-Dogmatics-Vol-1-1-Sections/dp/0567202909/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1371540976 sr=8-2 keywords=karl+barth+church+dogmatics) because I don't think I have the theological (or multi-lingual) background to get a good understanding of this treatise when read straight-on.    This insight is wonderful and incredible cool. Thank you for writing it.   I haven't read any Barth before. How valuable would you say having read something by him before is, as opposed to diving straight in? And what other work would you recommend?   Because the [Study Editions](http://www.amazon.com/Church-Dogmatics-Vol-1-1-Sections/dp/0567202909/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8 qid=1371540976 sr=8-2 keywords=karl+barth+church+dogmatics) offer a much more palatable way of reading through Barth's work. From what I've heard this treatise is dense enough that I'd like to take the path of least resistance to minimize any discouragement.    I'm heavily contemplating doing a multi-year read through this work, and am equally excited and daunted by the idea of its length and expense (the study books I'm ordering are about 10,000 pages in length and $1,000 total).  Has anyone here ever worked through all or a part of this work, and would they have any insight or recommendations about it?   Brofist*  My AE walnut captoe oxfords are maybe the coolest things I've ever owned.   Website is down for me :/   I am not a smart man...    I just manually created the location, and then moved everything over, and now it works fine. Thank you so much!   Thank you so much! I've made an edit- I think now I'm having trouble getting cmd to recognize my path? I added a path in 'environment variables' on my control panel C:\jdk1.7.0_21\bin; but when I go to cmd and enter cd C:\jdk1.7.0_21 it says "the system cannot find the path specified. I'm not sure what that means.  And, I really appreciate the encouragement.   This is my first time learning any programming language ever, so this is a very very beginner question. I'm using a textbook that has told me to do a couple of things I already can't figure in getting started. I'm using windows 8.  After installing JDK and adding the path, my book says to install the Library Source and Documentation by: opening a shell window, change to the jdk directory   make a subdirectory *src*:   mkdir src   cd src   I don't know how to change a directory on cmd, or how to make a subdirectory. I have no clue what I am doing and it's already incredibly frustrating.  **Edit**: After having searched around for an hour, I can change the directory using cd C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_21, but then I'm getting access denied when I try and set up a subdirectory.   I've put in a path in environment variables as C:\jdk1.7.0\bin, but that path is not being recognized by cmd? Somebody please help?   Fellow JD here, just graduated. So far from what I can tell, it's been more difficult to find a job simply because law schools largely don't have any connections or contacts with CPA firms.    Eh. Dwight was quite clearly the best center in the league for at least a four year stretch, and he spent most of this season recuperating from back surgery. Tim Duncan is a power forward. Roy Hibbert is dominating a team right now that doesn't even use real centers; remember he averaged 11.8/8.3 on 45% shooting this year. Marc can do everything well as a center, which makes him amazingly valuable, but the handful of things Dwight does (or rather, did preceding this season,) he does miles better than Marc Gasol.  Let's not get too carried away with short term memory.   There was an interview posted here a while back where Nabokov said that he was not in any way influenced by Joyce and only read one novel, Ulysses, by him until much later in life. But you're spot on about Poe.   Is that really who you're using for music? You included MGMT while forgetting...  Elvis   Chuck Berry   Aretha Franklin   Bob Dylan   Jimi Hendrix   The Beach Boys   Marvin Gaye   Bruce Springsteen   Johnny Cash Simon   Garfunkel   *The best center in the NBA, when healthy   He actually did an amazing job of containing Dwight when the Hawks beat the Magic two years ago in the first round. He's very good at defensive rotations and in several other ways that don't reflect on the stat sheet.    I don't mean to sound rude, but implicit possession is like literally the first thing you learn in an informal logic class. They really, truly, are not different at all.   No. Stating something is "ridiculous" is, by nature, a matter of opinion. So the "I think" is implicit when you say "it is ridiculous" because we now know that's what you're thinking. They are the same statement.   Those two things are literally exactly the same.    I've always loved the intensity of Job 38:  Where were you when I laid the earths foundation?       Tell me, if you understand.   Who marked off its dimensions? Surely you know!       Who stretched a measuring line across it?   On what were its footings set,       or who laid its cornerstone   while the morning stars sang together       and all the angels shouted for joy?"  Do any verses draw a deep, solemn inspiration the same way for you?   If not for him taking his Rhodes scholarship he probably would have been somewhere 3rd-4th round pick; I think things could have worked for him in either direction but he kinda made his bed by taking that year in Oxford.   Either way, he's an outstanding individual and I'm only happy for him   I've always had a question: should an upvote/downvote/nonvote distinction be made on a completely value-neutral basis? Or should the actual quality of the substance of the post have some influence in a normative redditor-downvote/upvote decision?   e.g. If someone puts a lot of thought into an opinion, we should not be downvoting them regardless of what that opinion is; but if their justifications are so weak and exegetically wrong, and their deductive reasoning so horrifically bad, that it arguably *doesn't* even add to the conversation, could that merit a downvote in spite of the effort put into the post?   That's nothing like saying the Bulls are just as good without derrick rose; look at their respective records when the pg's are playing and when they're out.   I've been consistently saying that Rondo is not near the elite point guard everyone in /r/nba thinks he is. The guy definitely has a way of sometimes completely taking over a game... but if he's never going to use it in the regular season, and can only get there 15% of the time in the playoffs, then how much can you really ascribe that characteristic to him as a player?   Sorry forgot to mention that this list wasn't exhaustive- it only includes the ~30 highest career points leaders in NBA history.   Lebron and Kobe both completed their 8th 2000 point season recently. Durant is the only other player to do so this season, however Melo and Harden might join them before the season ends.    First of all, I realize that 2000 is an arbitrary number, and this stat isn't too indicative of anything we didn't already know. But it's still interesting to look back and see it as a rough metric for consistency in a player's career: how many times a player averaged 25 points a game for 80 games a season (or a rough equivalent).   That is to say- it could be a rough look at a combination of how long a player was able to score at a high level without injury.    Of course things like the lockout, game pace, the 3pt line and the evolution of defenses hurt various players through various periods, so I don't think this is dispositive of anything, just an interesting stat to look at.   Here's an all-time list:  Karl Malone- 12   MJ- 11 (was 29 when he got his 8th)   Kareem Abdul jabbar- 9    Kobe- 8   Lebron- 8   Dominique Wilkins- 8   Alex English- 8   Wilt- 7 (including a 4000 point season)   Oscar Robertson- 7     Dirk- 5   Allen Iverson- 5 (and a 1989)   Jerry West- 5   Larry Bird- 4   Shaq- 4   Elvin Hayes- 4   David Robinson- 4   Hakeem- 4 (and a 1995 season)   Moses Malone- 4   Vince Carter- 3   Kevin Durant 3   Patrick Ewing- 2   John Havlicek- 2   Tim Duncan- 1   Reggie Miller- 1   KG never had one   Ray Allen never had one    Edit: I should probably point out that this isn't an exhaustive list of everyone whose ever had one. But everyone who is currently ahead of LBJ in all-time points is included on this list.    Honestly, if in 3 months Lebron has a 4th MVP (very likely), another ring (reasonably likely), and another finals MVP (almost guaranteed assuming they win); I'd take his lifetime body of work over Kobe's.   Those are big ifs though.    1. People knock on it all the time. It would be, by far, the lowest fg% of any player in most all-time top-10 lists, with the exception of Bill Russell whose offense makes up 0% of his basketball legacy.   2. Dwyane Wade, Michael Jordan (emphasis here), Magic Johnson, Jerry West, Oscar Robertson, Julius Erving, Steve Nash, Walt Frazier; and even in the present day Chris Paul, Tony Parker, and Stephen Curry all have much better FG% and TS% than Kobe   3. Taking into consideration the number of terrible shots he's taken should rightfully work against his legacy, it shouldn't be a factor we control for when defining it.

Would you be able to recommend any better analogies? It's a lot easier to communicate conceptually with them.   I saw in /r/Christianity a little while back an infographic explaining the trinity. It had a list of good and bad analogies and why they were good and bad. I've spent a while searching through this sub for it but I can't seem to find it anywhere; would anyone happen to know what I'm talking about or have the picture saved somewhere?   Dammit, I loved that record.    Welcome to /r/nba; where the subscribers are mostly white and the jokes are even whiter   Any Magic fan who is okay with us letting go of Vucevic is an idiot. I've also not encountered one among the dozen Magic bros I chat with.   No, sorry, I'm a CPA; so generally in an unrelated field.    With Thompson, Kyrie, and Waiters- you're one more good draft pick away from having tons of potential; and then one Lebron james signing away from being a real contender.   Okay :(   No dude, you gotta just understand that PLaSMaN knows your God is imaginary /s      You could say the idea of downvoting us is *irresistible*.  	107

The Greek anarchosyndicalist group Rocinante say that it is time to push for much greater gains than any government would be interesting in seeking. In particular they are calling for workers to act outside of the politically controlled official unions.   The French anarchist magazine [Alternative Libertaire](http://www.alternativelibertaire) reports on their appeal.  @@@@@  Along with the Greek anarcho-syndicalists, Alternative Libertaire calls for "turning the defeat of capital into a real victory of the working class." We must socialize the banks, confiscate the businesses that have resorted to blackmail of salaries and conducted disguised lockouts, and place them under the control of workers'. Breaking with capitalism is the only way out of the crisis.  In the referendum held by the government Tsipras 5 July 2015, the Greek people overwhelmingly said 'no' to the agreement plan submitted by the Troika (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund) at the Eurogroup meeting of 25 June 2015.  The "yes" was supported by almost all the European leaders as well as by the bourgeois media.  In Greece, the referendum marked a deep class divide. For a week, the country had lived to the rhythm of pro-yes and pro-no demonstrations. The yes was ardently defended by the propertied classes, by the gilded youth, the Greek Medef (Note 2) allied to the trade union bureaucracy of GSEE, by PASOK (social democrats), and the right hammered incessantly via private television, it was claimed by the banks and companies, some of which have even resorted to blackmail in paying salaries ...  The 'no' was held by the working class and defended by the political and trade union forces that defend their interests, including the anarcho-syndicalists. Sovereignists and the neo-Nazis of Golden Dawn also called for a no vote, but the street mobilization was mainly done by the "social" and it marginalized the nationalist no.  **A yes vote would have been catastrophic**  A yes vote to the new austerity program would have been catastrophic for the Greek proletariat and would once again have delivered them into the hands of the European capitalists. By refusing this agreement plan, they probably wanted to show that they were able to raise their heads and refuse to let a handful of technocrats, bankers and ship owners decide their fate.  But we must not delude ourselves about the consequences of this referendum which was primarily intended to reunite at the polls the heterogeneous social bloc which brought SYRIZA to power.  After having very much agreed to endless negotiations without having achieved almost nothing, and after constantly lowering the already timid ambitions of the Thessaloniki agenda, Alexis Tsipras, threatened with being abandoned by some of his electorate and by the base of Syriza, had no choice but to take his government to a popular sovereignty bath.  **The change will not come from a more or less radical leftist government**  If we can rejoice in the snub inflicted on defenders of austerity in Europe, we must keep in mind that this referendum is absolutely not an end in itself and that not will prevent the European capitalists from continuing their offensive so that neither the Russian or Chinese capitalists want to snatch their share of the cake!  The Tsipras government will very well scramble to reach a less disastrous agreement, without any lasting improvement of the living conditions of the Greek proletariat will not be achieved as long as the capitalist system, based on the law of profit, remains in place.  The change will not come from a more or less radical leftist government;  it will come from the ability of working people to unite and organize themselves autonomously to bring down the capitalist power and return the wealth into the hands of those who produce it.  **Greek anarcho-syndicalists call for a split in the GSEE(Note 1), to rebuild a struggle unionism**  The Anarcho-syndicalist Initiative [Rocinante](http://rocinante.gr) argues that we must immediately socialize the banks and confiscate the companies , who, last week, resorted to salary blackmail salary and conducted a disguised lockout, and place them under the control of working men and women.  It isn't necessary to wait for these measures from the Syriza government, but from a regenerated labor movement. Rocinante therefore calls on all unions and union members remaining loyal to the working class to leave the GSEE confederation bureaucratic and rotten to the bone, to build a new unionism, reorganized on a new basis, democratic and class.  For Rocinante, the return of the Syriza government to the negotiating table with the Eurogroup just to get a less painful compromise must be prevented, by the ratio of forces on the workplace and in the unions.  Thus, the referendum should not give rise to illusions about the possibility of social transformation from above.  With our comrades in Rocinante, we call to " turn a defeat for capital  into a real victory of the working class" and we will continue to show our solidarity, beyond borders, with those who struggle for a future free from capitalism and all forms of exploitation.

The Greek anarchosyndicalist group Rocinante say that it is time to push for much greater gains than any government would be interesting in seeking. In particular they are calling for workers to act outside of the politically controlled official unions.   The French anarchist magazine [Alternative Libertaire](http://www.alternativelibertaire) reports on their appeal.  @@@@@  Along with the Greek anarcho-syndicalists, Alternative Libertaire calls for "turning the defeat of capital into a real victory of the working class." We must socialize the banks, confiscate the businesses that have resorted to blackmail of salaries and conducted disguised lockouts, and place them under the control of workers'. Breaking with capitalism is the only way out of the crisis.  In the referendum held by the government Tsipras 5 July 2015, the Greek people overwhelmingly said 'no' to the agreement plan submitted by the Troika (the European Commission, the European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund) at the Eurogroup meeting of 25 June 2015.  The "yes" was supported by almost all the European leaders as well as by the bourgeois media.  In Greece, the referendum marked a deep class divide. For a week, the country had lived to the rhythm of pro-yes and pro-no demonstrations. The yes was ardently defended by the propertied classes, by the gilded youth, the Greek Medef (Note 2) allied to the trade union bureaucracy of GSEE, by PASOK (social democrats), and the right hammered incessantly via private television, it was claimed by the banks and companies, some of which have even resorted to blackmail in paying salaries ...  The 'no' was held by the working class and defended by the political and trade union forces that defend their interests, including the anarcho-syndicalists. Sovereignists and the neo-Nazis of Golden Dawn also called for a no vote, but the street mobilization was mainly done by the "social" and it marginalized the nationalist no.  **A yes vote would have been catastrophic**  A yes vote to the new austerity program would have been catastrophic for the Greek proletariat and would once again have delivered them into the hands of the European capitalists. By refusing this agreement plan, they probably wanted to show that they were able to raise their heads and refuse to let a handful of technocrats, bankers and ship owners decide their fate.  But we must not delude ourselves about the consequences of this referendum which was primarily intended to reunite at the polls the heterogeneous social bloc which brought SYRIZA to power.  After having very much agreed to endless negotiations without having achieved almost nothing, and after constantly lowering the already timid ambitions of the Thessaloniki agenda, Alexis Tsipras, threatened with being abandoned by some of his electorate and by the base of Syriza, had no choice but to take his government to a popular sovereignty bath.  **The change will not come from a more or less radical leftist government**  If we can rejoice in the snub inflicted on defenders of austerity in Europe, we must keep in mind that this referendum is absolutely not an end in itself and that not will prevent the European capitalists from continuing their offensive so that neither the Russian or Chinese capitalists want to snatch their share of the cake!  The Tsipras government will very well scramble to reach a less disastrous agreement, without any lasting improvement of the living conditions of the Greek proletariat will not be achieved as long as the capitalist system, based on the law of profit, remains in place.  The change will not come from a more or less radical leftist government;  it will come from the ability of working people to unite and organize themselves autonomously to bring down the capitalist power and return the wealth into the hands of those who produce it.  **Greek anarcho-syndicalists call for a split in the GSEE(Note 1), to rebuild a struggle unionism**  The Anarcho-syndicalist Initiative [Rocinante](http://rocinante.gr) argues that we must immediately socialize the banks and confiscate the companies , who, last week, resorted to salary blackmail salary and conducted a disguised lockout, and place them under the control of working men and women.  It isn't necessary to wait for these measures from the Syriza government, but from a regenerated labor movement. Rocinante therefore calls on all unions and union members remaining loyal to the working class to leave the GSEE confederation bureaucratic and rotten to the bone, to build a new unionism, reorganized on a new basis, democratic and class.  For Rocinante, the return of the Syriza government to the negotiating table with the Eurogroup just to get a less painful compromise must be prevented, by the ratio of forces on the workplace and in the unions.  Thus, the referendum should not give rise to illusions about the possibility of social transformation from above.  With our comrades in Rocinante, we call to " turn a defeat for capital  into a real victory of the working class" and we will continue to show our solidarity, beyond borders, with those who struggle for a future free from capitalism and all forms of exploitation.  Alternative Libertaire, July 5, 2015  Note 1: The GSEE is largest private sector union federation in Greece. Its directing body is elected on political party lines and it generally falls under the control of the social democratic PASOK party. It is heavily bureaucratized and more than slightly corrupt.  Note 2: MEDEF: Mouvement des enterprises de France. The largest employers association in France.                     Remember I told you that you'd beat me to the draw given time. Good article.                                                                                                                                 The [La Via Campesina](http://viacampesina.org) organization which links farmers, peasants and farm workers in some 67 countries has a few North American affiliates such as the NFU(Canada), Union Paysanne (Qubec), National Family Farm Coalition (USA) and the Rural Coalition (USA). Unfortunately the 'big players' in both the union (UFW, UFCW) and farmer organizations haven't seen fit to affiliate.         [Varoufakis: Our "NO" is a majestic, big "YES" to a democratic, rational Europe](http://yanisvaroufakis.eu/2015/07/06/our-no-is-a-majestic-big-yes-to-a-democratic-rational-europe/#more-8425)   I'd say that that would be impossible.                     Point well taken.   Yes, atheists in Bangladesh are examples of courage.            I don't think so, but I am not fully confident that I know enough to give a firm answer.         I don't think the author of the article meant it in that way. No doubt it is solely the government at fault. I certainly see the same use of language in matters unconnected with internal Canadian politics. Think "Italy does...", "The USA does...", "Germany does...", etc.. In terms of Canada phrases like "BC does...", Nova Scotia does..." are also quite common.      It was a figure of speech.                  I imagine that whatever mechanism they put in place there will be ways around them.            At first it reminded me of modernist 'Gaudiesque' buildings in Barcelona such as La Sagrada Familia. Buildings inspired by Gaudi, however, employ more flowing lines and fewer corners. There was enough 'flow' in the picture to trigger my memory, but they are not fully modernist in a strict sense.         I read somewhere that the 'home team'  playing match against the police were actually some commie group rather than anarchists. I saw tons and tons of red flags but only one possible black flag.  Another couple of things from the video. At times it looks like people getting photos outnumbered the players actually in action. The second thing that amused me is the large number of people who seem to be just 'walking through' what the reporter repeatedly described as "utter chaos". All seemingly without a care about what was happening at all.               I imagine that a large proportion of people who show up here are 'militant vegetarians'. Not all, however, not all.    That's a good question. If push comes to shove I imagine the 'not withstanding clause' could be invoked. The most likely thing is that previous federal provincial agreements have designation this as one of the areas where Qubec has legislative powers that other provinces don't.      Yes, that's the gist of what is unsavoury about this legislation.          Mais oui. Le grand voleur chasse le petit voleur. The big thief chases the little thief out.     	199

It changed her and that's why you dont see any alien creatures in BL2 because the destroyer created them before it died. There are so many questions surrounding that character and no one seems to care about her! . I wanna know if she was the siren Lilth was searching for when she came to pandora, they share VERY similar tattoos so it's entirely possible.   Yeah dude! Hence why i wanna know more about her! :D as for the hole in her, who's to know? Perhaps it was merely a robot. Her siren tattoos look more like circuitry/wires and she displays no siren ability when you fight her. Who's to say it was her at all and not just a robot? OOOOO CONSPIRACYYYYYYY! xD   Agreed. Not to mention deathtrap is disgustingly OP in the early levels   gunzerker only really gets fun at level 30 onward if you ask me   It's because gamespy was shut down or something i think so if they didnt do it BL1 would have no multiplayer what so ever. It's nice that they did that, but it's something that should have happened a long time ago. Much like an FoV slider for the PC port :/ but hey cant really complain too much   yeah i know :/ she was a scrapped concept for lilth. But damn i'd like to know more about her :(   Her siren power was regeneration? that'd be interesting.   oh really? my bad i'll delete it then   agreed BL1 had the best loot system. Even just opening chests was exciting there was a much greater chance of cool shit. In the other BL games it's always greens/whites in chests :/   Like what's her siren ability if she even was one? Like why did Atlas leave her on pandora? How did she rise to power? How did she even become involved in Atlas/the crimson lance? What if her siren ability is to heal herself and that the destroyer never really killed her?   I would love the return of Atlas! and commandant steele :'( Gearbox please.   I know but it leaves so many unanswered questions.   S S went out of business due to bandit guns being more successful. Also i agree with you BL2 weapons certainly have that feel to them but BL1 guns were simply more fun :/   apparently BL2 was found to only have 5 million different guns where as BL1 has almost 18 million   I don't see why they restricted themselves so much after BL1 with these weapons types restricted so heavily by their manufacturer. Lets face it every torgue assault rifle is the same. Every Hyperion sniper rifle is the same and so on.   We want innovation. We want to see Torgue sniper rifles and Jakobs rocket launchers and just generally more variety within all weapon types no?   Was anyone else hoping for some closure surrounding Commandant Helga Steele in TPS? I mean there's so much mystery surrounding that character and yet no one seems to want to know more about her. She hasn't been mentioned once since BL1. No echos. Nothing.   Yeah it's widely considered the best DLC out of all the BL franchise.    Ive been too both. Im really struggling to work out what im missing :/    yeah ive done them all and ive been there :/   hey guys im having trouble finding all the named locations onboard the Helios station. I was wondering if you know of any hidden places :) I've got the other two location achievements.   Literally ANYTHING Atlas/Commandant Steele related OH GOD PLEEEEEEEEASE! .  EDIT: Or how every claptrap unit got destroyed by jack but i have a feeling that'll be a DLC already  	22
 Very, very doubtful but instead of slicing it, take it to a local university for analysis before damaging it.    I agree, but very little has that same structure, color and texture. I have worked extensively with schorl and can absolutely tell by looking.    That was my first thought--like wow, this is not only clever but this person clearly did some research.    Without a doubt      Layers and layers and layers...   Looks a bit like half of a rare bagelosaurus.   Yes, had some Dremel burns before.. Very helpful and even more incentive to invest in a new toy. Looks like he got a heck of a deal though. Can't find anything quality in that $300 frame   Dumb question but how safe are they? Seems it would be easy to let your hand slip on a wet rock and...well...you know.   Even more inspiration for this investment--thanks so much for posting. Great jaspers too--      It is not a tentical, or even a tentacle as those types of soft tissues do not fossilize.   I would let it sit in a weak oxalic acid bath for about four or five days then sit down with a dental pick to expose the crystals. Acid sounds dangerous but it works great and really lets these shine.          Since they all chimed in with the right answer, let me propose a wrong one. It's petrified Chex mix.   Yes please! I love handiwork like this, thanks for considering!   That is the most awesome answer I could have ever expected. What a great craft--can you post something that you've made and the resultant slag?   If you don't mind my asking, what does one with a bog ore collection? Or is it just a special collection item?   NC rockhounder here--yes, that's common stuff; pretty up close. I believe it's olivine, but where you found it epidote is not uncommon either. I can almost guess where you found it, by the way, because I've only ever seen it great quantities in this one location. About an hour from Greensboro.   Found or bought?          Thanks, but the red crystals don't have the characteristic shape under magnification. They're just clusters.    Here are two more photos using my LED maginfier - http://imgur.com/a/8Mksu   This is quite heavy for its appearance--not sure what any of it is, most curious if that's ruby since it's been found near where I was (other corundum as well)--not sure what the black is or the white either. How would I carefully expose the red/ruby/garnet, whatever it is? So appreciative of this resource--learn a lot, but confused myself on this one.      The story has been updated with biographical sketch of this guy. From starting college at 12, running a very conservative senate campaign, run ins with pornographic legal problems and now exascale computing, less convinced than ever before. Update is now listed on same page.   I don't know but all I can think when I see this rock is that it looks delicious.      What was strange to me that when she asked why keep it all centrally located when risk would be centralized too (since he's planning to use it for currency trading) he said BECAUSE of Linpack. That was his only reason. She was just silent a minute like "ummm" ....then it got stranger. I don't know if she just had him on for the sake of amusement (all of the Wire podcasts are with reputable people this is an anomaly) or what but I am mystified by almost everything he said. He doesn't sound like someone who understands a single thing about HPC.   Crinoid stem in good shape, looks to me.   By the end of this she's quite skeptical too...interesting stuff. But no proof, which is what she's digging for. NDA with Intel, no deeds to be found on that land in Oregon, but the guy's company for currency trading might (MIGHT) make some sense. However, delivering it through cloud--not big sense.      Meanwhile, this is will (sadly) be one of the most popular articles about supercomputing. *sigh      Very Game of Thrones. And of course, very awesome.          YOUR government, I meant. Was so struck by the utter shamelessness of this "contest" that I forgot how to spell.          Heh. Fair enough.

 Thanks, you too.    I keep getting comments like this, but I really don't know how to answer. I mean...can you imagine my own confusion?   Yes, we had played it, plus the left-overs and coffee were still out. That's how I know it wasn't a dream, and that I hadn't just woken up in bed and found her.   I just got back from a three week long trip with my brother where we stayed with my aunt and uncle. I've been surrounded by nothing but friends and family, which definitely helps.     Thanks yaar.    I know I was conscious. The mugs and plates were still out from the coffee and left-overs we had.   	5
 To work my ass off to go back to school and not have to pay student loans....   I remember switching from private to public schools...private schools everyone had brand-new art supplies. Crayons, makers, pencils, pens... This one kid in particular came from a very under privileged family.. I noticed his crayons one day, seeing that they were old and had been used a while ago. I took the money out of my piggy-bank and bought him a new pack. At the age of 7. To this day I will never forget the smile on his face when he found/opened up that new box of crayons that randomly appeared in his desk.      Something Corporate   God Bless the World, this is why I drive a Ford. Such amazing people. Love from Ohio my dear Redditor!   I'm from the Midwest, where pop is a soda and ranch is out on everything.    Gotta love Frank Zappa   Most of us women at the age of 12. If I can recall one girl named Meredith- she had called me a cow and said I was possessed by the devil. So I threw a chalk board eraser at her head. We went to catholic schools. She got a sucker for the pain, I got scolded, detention and 4 wonderful weeks of counseling by our parish sisters.    I think I have enjoy the concept of the show. The retired PI and the psychic/medium. Goodness, hopes down. But it's all good!    What gets me about her sketches is that when there are creatures or other entities the way she describes them and the sketches totally freak me out. The one that I will never forget, this image has stuck with me for moths was of the creature that she claimed to be an evil spirit in someone's hallway. It was a black mass with a round shaped mouth. It looked like it would suck the life out of you. I've seen something similar before and it just really struck me as real.    Does anyone on here watch Dead Files? If so how do you feel about Amy Alan? Being somewhat sensitive myself I feel as if she is the realest.    I wanna kick this ladies ass. For real. Being a girl and playing street hockey as a kid not ONE adult complained. They were so happy we were playing streey hockey and not doing drugs like the other. Bitter bitch. She needs to grow the fuck up. If it is that big of a deal talk go the parents not 12,year old kids. Fucking moron.    I can see the eye. It blends right in like it belongs in the darkness. When I noticed it I felt a huge weight in my chest.    I cannot say I am a professional psychic/medium but I do know I have abilities and many "professionals" have shared that same information with me.   Try saging the house. All corners, door ways, every room including the attic. This can be done at any time, if you are more comfortable with the daylight do it then.

He's not as big as some of the other men I have dated prior to him but that doesn't bother me at all. He's so wonderful and good with everything else it truly isn't something I think about.    Just keep swimming !!   Face looks like he's got a dildo shoved up his ass hole   Human eyes.   Idk maybe like 5-6 large ones and a couple handfuls of small ones.

 Moderately. I'm not working at the moment and I'm spending all my time writing, which is what I love. That could change at any moment.   Pretty sound advice.   Tell me your secrets to ultimate happiness!   A black market, hey...? Hmm...   Man, I'm just not a big music person. I tend to not buy music and just listen to the odd soung on Youtube.

Unsure on the rules. Does that count as self-promotion? Is such a thing allowed?  I mean, obviously the point is to start a conversation, but...   Oh this thread hurt me bad.  Talking about Harry Potter events - and not talking about the books.  Oh, calling it *The Sorcers Stone*. That just makes me feel icky.    My heart stopped a little bit then.  Write in one of my books. The idea strikes me as sacrilege.    Didn't what a playstation but knew how to run a simulator on a PC.  When I had my first PC it was still on dial-up. We used to have a farm game that played the song "B-I-N-G-O". If you know/remember that song.   I was so happy when I got a playstation.   Yes. It was *'The Way of Shadows'* by Brent Weeks. It was two-for-one so I got the sequel as well.  Now my favourite genre to read and to write is fantasy. It's had quite a big effect on me.   You, m'lady, are a saint of the highest order :)   [You, sir, are a saint :)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-HBW-hPttDh5imuTNrDepA)   Well the opinion bleeds over into the film. So I guess by putting it in this sub it is preemptive.   If this film bombs (or she does do what she does in the books) and everyone hates it, I want people to come back to this thread.   Yeah, the entire scheme is flawed as fuck. Very much to the point of it being nonsensical.   I like this idea that they're trying to paint the government as being all-powerful and totally evil. When...no...not really. The only bad thing is the Hunger Games - which is apparently the only governmental thing the actual government do.    That was a call for an example, actually.     I'm mad about the scene in the book.   The thing is, that is the *worst* trilogy I've ever read. And I've read Twilight. The Hunger Games is a good book. Catching Fire and Mockingjay are both totally, absolutely abysmal. So some of that hatred bleeds over into the films.   I'm not mad at the films. Catching Fire was a good film. I'm against splitting the third book in two because *it's absolutely fucking awful, and* nothing *happens*. So the third film wasn't the best. But I'm waiting to see what they do with the third one. They've maintained a fair level with the films so I think it's only fair of me to expect the finale to be not totally awful.   The only thing you will regret is not having bought it sooner.    I've never come across anything that would show me otherwise.    Never played that one. Though I hear good things.    I'm pretty happy with as it is, thanks. I trust that your changes will finalise it now :)    Titanfall had giant robots. COD might be doing better than it, but that's purely because the game already has a solid fanbase. Possibly (assuming here) made of pre-teens who don't really know a lot else about gaming so they stick to it.   Team Fortress 2. That's a solid example of an FPS done right. I also quite liked Evolve. I know that isn't *quite* the same. But running around and hunting a giant monster is far better than running around and hoping you can start shooting someone before they start shooting you.   What conclusions have I arrived at? What misconceptions?     [Thoughts?](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-HBW-hPttDh5imuTNrDepA)   AW is a touch better but is still at it's core: run around firing your gun. And...AW shifted the format a bit and they added verticality. But they were too late to the verticality game because Titanfall was all over that. So at it's core it's still COD just with a pinch of Titanfall, and a smidgen of the power-ups from Halo 3. Which...isn't enough.   If it helps you can find size templates online :/   If meat (red and white) forms a dietary staple, then...yeah. Need it to be kinda healthy. And sure you can replace it with pills, but those won't carry you through the same way.  It's not a matter of cooking. Well I should include pasta. I'll let you have that. I'm just not fond of veggies.   I'm pretty sure that ethics is by its very definition without facts. Ethics and morals mean something entirely different for two different people. I mean, anything can aim to make a claim factual, that doesn't make it a genuine fact. I would on principle disagree with anyone or anything who tried to convince me I had to bend my beliefs to suit what they have decided.   Are you implying we should be spoon fed our morals and ethical beliefs? Sure, some of what we take is given to us by our societies and we take that, we don't have a choice with that. Everything else we're pretty much left to decide for ourselves.   What do you think? [Clickity](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-HBW-hPttDh5imuTNrDepA)   *Now?* Try four versions ago.   I mean, isn't meat pretty healthy. Not in vast quantities, and not processed. But aren't they dietary staples? Also, meat is the only thing that even tastes half decent.  Quantum physics(well, any science) /= ethics. My own opinions and ethics and morals I'm quite happy to decide by myself. And, just as a result of life, those things will change for me, that's just what happens. People I meet might change them, opinions are meant to be flexible. But at least I'm not being spoon fed everything I ought to decide by myself.     That uploaded beautifully :).  Would it be possible to make adjustments? If you don't want to I'm perfectly happy with it as it is, 'cause it's great, just a few things don't look entirely right.  [Banner](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-HBW-hPttDh5imuTNrDepA)  Feel free to tell me to piss off :)   Torturing something and eating something are totally different things. One is unnecessary, the other sustains life. That's all the food chain is. We don't torture the animals when we kill them - is that what you're getting at?   I think contemplating issues in our own intellectual vacuum is probably healthier than being spoon-fed morals.  :)   Might might not make right. But thousands of years of evolution to shove us at the top of the food chain kinda mebbi does.   Do I need an entire ethics committee to tell me what is wrong and right now?   Sorry, I think you're going to read that and it comes off a bit harsh, that's not how it was intended.   The thing about splitting movies into two started with *The Deathly Hallows*. Which by all rights was a super long book and could have done with being split into two.  Mockingjay is a terrible book and nothing happens and doesn't need splitting into two. I disagree with it.    I'm glad I saved you the pain.  Well actually. Catching Fire is a horrendous book but a fairly good movie. The films are actually better than the books, so hopefully the final final one won't be that bad.   Well, when the third one comes out. It will have spoilt the whole movie for me then.   I don't have any controversial, but I do have *The Host, by Stephanie Meyer*. That would certainly get questioned.   Hey, thanks for this I really like it :). Unfortunately YT is saying the file is too big, I've tried fixing it but it hasn't worked. I'm unsure what the problem is.    Spiderman 2. Or the original Spiderman game on PS1. Both of these games were boss. They can't be beaten.    Why would someone call a swat team on a person, just because they got their arse kicked over a video game!   DA:I, yeah, was a colossal disappointment.  Don't worry, Withcer 3 is nothing like it.  The feel of Skyrim and TW3 are nothing alike. TW3 is much heavier, much more demanding. Both storywise and gameplay wise. But the worlds are equivalently epic and comparable.   Just yeah...Get The Witcher 3. If you like high fantasy, especially TES, you'll love this. Also, you should play TW2, not to play TW3, just because it too is an awesome game.   Didn't check out the blog, but...Are you writing fanfiction?   I know. But that's my point. You can't say you love animals, but then only mean the cute ones.   That's heavy man. Real shit. I'm sorry you got stuck in such a bad situation. But the advice everyone has given you is the best. Leave her. I know it's hard, but it's that simple.   We are humans. We fucking earned our place to be able to eat meat. Don't feel guilty for it, it's extremely normal.   The hypocritical thing to do would be to say you love all creatures, and then include the bi-line^aslongasthey'recute. Which is what most everyone does. "I love all creatures. (except Angler Fish, fuck those things)."  Nothing wrong with eating meat. And in fact nothing wrong with being a vegetarian. Just be comfortable with your choices.   I was raised a catholic, attended wholly catholic schools, and was confirmed into the religion as a teenager.  I don't believe in God.   I don't think that God is important as a figure that *exists*. But just as something to put your faith in. To give the feeling of something bigger than yourself, that exists outside of you. It's a comfort. And, even as an atheist, I think churches, mostly, are great things - when done right. Their the only real figure that promotes peace, love and charity on any scale, I think, societally, that's important.  I'm an existentialist, I prefer to think I'm guiding my own life.   **MAD END OF HUNGER GAMES SPOILERS**  [Spoilers](#s "Not so much in the film (though I expect the upcoming film will replicate it) but in the book. They take over the capital *and she chooses to place the capital kids into a last hunger games.* Why? Fucking spite. Despite her sheer PTSD, her loathing of the capital borne *purely from* the hunger games. *nope, fuck it, into the Hunger Games you go you little innocent shits.* And, let's face it, that entire book is fucking terrible anyway.")   Ah I've come across Codecademy before. I could never stick to anything, so well done for doing it. I know coding isn't easy, so that's certainly something to pat yourself on the back for doing. By which I mean go out and celebrate!   Ah I've come across Codecademy before. I could never stick to anything, so well done for doing it. I know coding isn't easy, so that's certainly something to pat yourself on the back for doing. By which I mean go out and celebrate!   I'm not inherently against pre-orders, so this seems like a good idea. It's a bit of a gimmick though, convincing more people to pre-order because *you might the be one pre-order who pushes the group to the next bonus*. It's heavy sales tactics and manipulation which I'm against.   NIGHTCRAWLER NIGHTCRAWLER  Because they set up the romance with beast, rather than Azazel so...   It would be for me haha. I rarely exercise. And not if it can be otherwise avoided.   That is true. A day can't go wrong when it's headed by a decent sandwich :)   I think I'd have died about four days ago if I was considering even doing that.   I came across something which is a great way of measuring classics. Which is to compare it to the things that were out when it was published. The Catcher in the Rye was the first of it's kind, and whilst I don't think it's aged well, it certainly is/was deserving of it's classic status.  But you've actually hit on the reasons why the book is a good one.    he spends the entire book whining about how his life and choices are all some one else's problem.  Because he doesn't want to face responsibility. He doesn't want be an adult, as he says; a phony.  He isn't, as a character, meant to have a redeeming feature. That is his character. And yeah, nowadays, it's not very interesting, but *that is his character.* He's stuck in a loop. Stuck between being a teen, and being an adult, that's why he wants to be *The Catcher in the Rye*.   John Green explains it better. If you want to get anything out of the book, [watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R66eQLLOins)   You just know it's just bound to be a good day then.    Glad to hear it's a nice day. Have fun on your killer bike ride :)   I'm waiting for a phone call about whether or not I get to write the screenplay for a short film. *fingers crossed*.   That sounds like a pretty decent day! I can't see Ted 2 till the 7th :(   My day is pretty good. Best of all I'm waiting for a phone call from a guy who hopefully wants to hire me as a scriptwriter on his short story project. I want that job!   Try Smite.   try /r/suggestmeabook   Hey everyone, how's everyone's day going? Great, I hope =D   Yeah, it's not an easy read at parts. Probably not something I'd come back to either. But it's worth reading, just the once, I reckon.   I have a lot of favourite quotes. But the one I have tattooed on me, which is absolutely one of my favourites is *"So it goes."* by Kurt Vonnegut, from Slaghterhouse-5.  I just think that it's a fantastic principle to believe in.   Purists who've read every single comic book will never be happy with the film.   People who dislike superhero films, and just pass them off as CGI-laden utter shit, will downvote them.  People who want to be hipster and dislike anything mainstream - yes, this actually happens - will downvote it.  It takes a certain kind of anything to be liked totally by the masses. Not even Harry Potter had the luxury of ensnaring *everybody*.    I've never had any issues with it. Does the job for me. My university lecturers said to get Final Draft as well, which, when a free version does the exact same job, to the exact same level, is ridiculous, and probably a touch elitist. These are the same people who also said to use FCPX over FCP7.  Yes, I use FCP as well, not Avid. I'll let you have that one. Avid really is the industry standard.   As a film, I think the idea is great. The execution of the first movie though was horrendous. We have a whole *city* full of *thousands/millions of people* who can do *literally anything*.   But no, fuck that, here's the inside of a very boring house for two hours whilst the interesting things - *which clearly are not going to happen inside the house* - are occurring outside.    Happy I could help :)   Celtx does the job. Does it the exact same. Minus that needless fair chunk of change.   Get Celtx, it's free. It does the formatting for you. There will be tutorials online about where to put the formatting. How to introduce scenes and transitions.  Also, check out some professional, hollywood screenplays. Some are quite easy to find as PDF's via a google search. Always best to have a look at one, and gain an understanding that way before you sink your teeth in.   It ain't worth shit until we can play in it. And, lets face it, we can't. Those are pretty pictures. But they aren't game worlds.   I watched the movie yesterday. Hadn't seen it in a number of years. Damn, it is a really good movie!   Some of them are good, and some of them are just hella bland. I was watching a new one the other day and I was giggling madly.  Favourite character...eh....Why not Ralph? *"My cat's breath smells like cat food".  Yours?   What episode of the simpsons? Old episodes of the Simpsons *especially* the original Treehouse of Horror episodes are, hands down, the shit.   You can get a sample of the first few chapters on Amazon. I recommend reading through them. I did, I loved it, was amazing.   This is old, but also very good :)   New to the sub so not sure if this is within the rules, or what normally happens, but...can I request an entirely new cover art? I don't have anything to build it on, so it would have to be from scratch. You would of course be credited.  The channel is called: British Book Guy  Im British and it's a booktube channel. :)  Really it only needs to be simple, just the name in front of something british like the Union Jack or St. Georges Cross, with a cup of tea or something. Like I said, full creative control.  The recommended size is: 2560 x 1440  Apologies if this is unorthodox. And thanks either way :)   I would save it. Sustain myself through unemployment a bit longer.   A PS4 might be worth the investnment in the long run. There's already great games out there like Bloodborne, and more are due to come it's way. If you want to invest in a PS4 now isn't a bad time.  Destiny isn't a bad game, the online is fairly tight. If you want to play with your friends, do so.   Gotta sell copies. Gotta reach a wider market. Appeal to a larger demographic.   Will try this thanks. I just wasn't too eager to start yanking the strings I just put in. Do not trust my handiwork in the least, going to have to wait a week to be able to play without expecting to get a string twanging in my eye. But will definitely try to do this =]   Ron Jeremy?   Coming around the same time as the legalisation of gay marriage in the *entire* USA, I think this is a time for the LGBT community to celebrate, not complain. Really, not a week to complain.   Hey man, thanks, that's a great answer. Pretty happy to know the best way is to play it, that's what I really wanted to hear :)   I humbly await to see the thread :)   Are we going to do this the other way? God knows there weren't a few thousand questions I would have loved to anonymously asked a grown-up when I was a teenager.    So do I. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't half expecting them to snap off the first time I played them. Not sure how much I ought to trust my handiwork. :)   I expect it is. And I also expect that I would really enjoy astronomy, and looking through a telescope, and learning about all the different things from Earth's viewpoint. But I also like my documentaries.   There is UE and Unity. But those won't be easy or simple to learn. If you want to pick one, I recommend Unity. It programs physics for you.   If you want to get serious about gaming, those are the way to go. If you only want to make the one scene, then go with something easier, as previously mentioned.   RPG maker.  Roblox.   Something equally inane like that.   The thing about astronomy is that I don't really see it is as anything much more than looking at tiny white dots, and remembering constellations. The only thing worth seeing with the naked eye is Andromeda. (Did you know you can see an entirely different galaxy with the naked eye? How goddamn awesome is that!?). I think there might be more to astronomy than that, but not for me. I like finding out new things, and finding out what quasars are, and what causes some stars to go supernova and some not to, and to see nebulae, and to compare our star to bigger stars, and our galaxy to other galaxies.     Whoo! It was a Ukulele which it was pretty new. It took me about an hour to *learn* how to do it. Countless videos and instructions. And then about another hour just to actually get it down. But now Yeah! it's done. Feeling pretty happy and proud with myself. Can't wait to start playing it tomorrow to hear the difference the new, and vastly better strings, will make :)  In other news, I'm now being plagued by a particularly large moth. Dammit.   I've spent an ungodly amount of time watching and re-watching space documentaries. I know a lot about space.   Whether or not the top starts to fall isn't important, because GET THIS:  *The top wasn't Cobbs totem*  This isn't my own theory, this is one from the internet...  The totem was his wedding ring. Now we know the Top was Mal's totem to begin with. But at the beginning of the film exposition-Arthur explained that anybody else knowing anything about a person's totem negates it. *But Mal is dead* you say? Well, she isn't. Not to Cobb. Who constantly sees her to the point she is the antagonist of the movie. The top being Cobbs totem totally negates it's existence.  But, for the shrewder ones among you, they will have noticed Cobbs ring. In the dream, he is wearing it. Outside of the dream, he isn't. In the ending scene, he isn't. The top doesn't decide it at all.  In fact Nolan has said that the top wobbling at the end isn't anything to do with the dream or not. It's to do with how little Cobb now gives a crap about the dream, the dream-world and his past life.   Hey, so, first time I've ever changed strings (yay). I don't even wanna mention how long *that* took. But anyway...So from what I've heard the strings will keep on popping out of tune, and that's fine. At what kind of time will that *stop* happening? So if it continues for longer than it ought to I can probably but it down to the strings being buggared (my own fault).  Also, so the strings need to stretch. Should I give them a while to get used to being stretched, even a little bit? Should I wait until tomorrow to play on them? Or are they good to go - just be prepared to keep on tuning them?  Any other advice or tidbits I missed out which are important? Thanks guys.   Because they were both living one life. I think it's just part of the narrative that maintains that they are the same person. They live each others lives, and do each others jobs. It just reinforces that they are the same person.   Honestly I haven't read them in years. But I do remember thoroughly enjoying them.   The second incarnation of Spider-Man since *that* Venom, and in Marvel's hands? They won't hesitate.   They were going to use Giamatti yeah. He might not have been the best, but that suit was excellent.  I don't know about Venom. I'm sure Marvel won't waste any time putting him in there somewhere.    Yes, I did. I thought it was a pretty decent film. He's a good actor, and he did well in Jurassic World too.   I think they're aiming for October, but it might be a bit later than that. I'm honestly not 100% sure. We have been greenlit on steam, so keep an eye out for it :)   They've done a really good job with the game. I have to say. I can't speak for the story, but the game is impressive as hell.    You should watch the whole video. It's all on YT or failing that on their own website. Just anything by Neil Gaiman is amazing. Also watching his 2012 commencement speech. It you're not *bleeding* inspiration by the end of it there is no hope for you.   I'm working on two. The first one is pretty much done. It's coming out in a few months (excited squeals). Look it up: *Anomaly 1729*  The second is a bit less developed, and is so much work   How's your game coming along?   My instructor was twenty minutes late for the lesson I was meant to have before my test. That lesson was the first time we had done an 'emergency stop', which turned up in the test. It was a fucking shambles.   Passed first time though :)   Fight Club...what?   	112
 Listening to Kasey Keller announce games and commentate is like listening to Jennifer Aniston's boss at the restaurant *Chotchkie's* from *Office Space.*   Oh my God. Where did she go to finishing school? The Emile Heskey School of Finishing???   So you're saying that there was a *short*age of dwarves?   https://imgur.com/kL3Lo1R   Albert ENTstein   You can't spell embarassed without "ass."   Seriously. Cavani could have been killed.    [Welp. Looks like it's just me and you, OP.](https://imgur.com/w96lHKO)    What's everyone freaking out for? Am I the only guy that likes delicious Fapjacks?   Y'know, I knew it was Jacques but went to IMDB to make sure and they had it spelled as "Jock" so I don't know what to believe anymore.    So you wanted to buy some weed but accidentally went for a hit, man? Sounds like you got just what you wanted.      At that time in my life I personally just cared that I had all the exotic MJ I could smoke like a kid in a candy store  I always heard rumors that you had to take The Silk Road to get on The Pineapple Express.    Crushing the head is better because I HATE SNAKES, JOCK! I HATE 'EM!   So which lucky doctor is ready to disarm the rocket in dis arm?   Easy there, Jamie.    jajajajaja      op is the bravest teenager on reddit                        I wonder if there are any Jurassic period frozen dinosaur genomes in that thing.       *Don't you*  BUH BUH - BUH BUH BAHHHH  ~~Forget about me~~ *Scientology*  - Dangerous Minds                  Gary Neville orgasm part two is on the menu.    https://i.imgur.com/IvGio7K.gif   We might be on top but this has been a shitty performance, we've lost two key players for the next match if we have one, and I'm predicting an ugly end to this game with at least one more player being sent off.          I find it funny that they put President Cleveland's weight in the corners of this bill.       "Unlike your wife's legs, this case is closed."  *bangs gavel*   So did the guy playing Call of Duty taunt your son by saying that he fucked his mom? Cuz he totally did.             "Hey! I know you are there! The only reason you can't answer is because I know you can't speak with that guys dick in your mouth!"  Sounds like a gag order to me.    OP wins the medal of bravery for today.    That one is going to Jon Snow.    If professional Lego building were a sport then I think that Messi would be the best at it.

 Pffft Shawshank of course.   Inherent Vice.   *CoughZodiacCough*   Into the Wild, by far.   Chinatown, Akira, The Wrestler.   Can you do more of these?   definitely is, OP fucked up the title      That was a trip.   Same here. He's great, better than Jeremy Jahns IMO      Simplify everything. Don't overcomplicate things.

That humans are in fact a mix of good, bad and fucked up.      Prisoners (2013)   Beautiful but haunting film. I highly recommend.   I've been messaging you about it...   Love this film.   Sorry. My bad.   It says $128 on the box...   Well that was fucking awesome.   Yeah let's just ruin some more contemporary classics.   Please don't hurt me.   **FUCK**   * American Beauty  * Spirited Away   * Dark Knight Trilogy  * One Flew over the Cuckoos nest  * The Big Lebowski  * Zodiac  * The Social Network  * Star War Original Trilogy  * Indiana Jones Trilogy  * Lord of the Rings trilogy  * Back to the Future 1   2  * Terminator 1   2  * Die Hard   * Pulp Fiction  * E.T  * Schindler's List  * Saving Private Ryan  * There Will Be Blood  * Boogie Nights  * Psycho  * The Birds  I could go on...   I doubt they would use CGI for those scenes.  And, there is ONE scene that simply CANNOT be put onto a film...readers of the book, you know what I'm talking about. *That scene*.   The miniseries was exceptional? Umm.....         uhhh...Star Wars, Jurassic World, Spectre.      Cinematography. Someone wanna help me out?   Cheesy ass action movies. Commando, Time Cop, you name it.   Blurays.   That's me.   Includes T.V shows as well.   Exactly, studio execs need to stay the fuck out of the actual development process. I hope this still gets made, I was hoping maybe Darren Aronofsky or Nicolas Winding Refn may pick it up. Who knows. Who would you like to see pick this up?   I agree completely. This and the blade runner sequel are my two most anticipated films for the next 5 years. Since 'It' is/was supposed to start shooting mid-June, they'll either have to find someone to pick it up or shelve it for good.         This movie was going to complete my life. Cary Fukunaga writing and directing? Perfection. Two films instead of one? Perfection. A darker and more violent tone than the miniseries? Perfection. Staying for true to the book? Perfection. Will Poulter as Pennywise? Perfection. Well guess what? New Line just have to go and fuck everything up! According to sources, they were going to cut the budget, only allow for one film AND where going to aim it at teenagers or a younger audience. In other words, they were going to give it the shitty, generic, jump scare-filled horror remake treatment that horror movies are getting these days.   This just sucks. I hope New Line can pull their heads in and give Cary the space that he needs.   "Nobody knows who Will Poulter is! Instead let's hire some 25 year old beefcake nobody!"   Have you read the book? If you have, you'd probably be on board for this remake as the Tim Curry Mini series was no where near to the tone of the book and actually really sucked and it didn't do the book any justice. This is the remake the story deserves, and now it's probably not happening.   Some new flair system the mods have implemented. I pretty sure it's only on this sub. Complain to them.   It's going to get really annoying...   The director just dropped out and production has stalled...    An unnecessary remake. I hope it's good though.    Yes but is he interesting in the source material? You need a director who understands the story and characters. I'm not saying he doesn't but we don't actually know. Plus we need more mature director.   Good choice.   Such fucking bullshit. Studio excecs only care about the money.       That totally sucks. Those words hit me hard.            Fuck yes. This looks incredible.      Like Tyler Durden. I don't want to but I'm just interested in how someone would go about doing something like that, giving up all your material possessions, values and consumerist life?   Lets see if we can get bigger than /r/Fighclub, I'm talking making a title page banner, weekly discussions about shit etc COME ON         Skip to 4:08, you'll get what I'm talking about then.      Skip to 4:08, you'll know what I'm talking about then.       I was surprised. I immediately thought of the idiot he played in 'We're The Millers' and that had an effect on my overall opinion. But the more I've thought about it the more I've come to think that he is a pretty good choice. The director apparently could not say no after being 'blown away' by his audition. I don't know about you but hearing that from the director just boosts my opinion.    The man who is directing it, have you seen any of his other work? True Detective? Sin Nombre? Both of those instilled confidence in me that this man know exactly what he's doing behind a camera.   Also, what do you think of the casting choice for Pennywise?    I fucking shat myself.   I drew a fat Batman   http://r.weavesilk.com/?v=4 id=qsw102mywp8   Yeah it is a pretty plain poster.      W.....Why?      Stoked for the remake?   Mr Snowden, what is your favorite film? Also, are you aware that they are currently filming a movie about you starring Joseph Gordon Levitt?   Indeed!   They all look like decaying buttholes.    Nightcrawler is a fucking brilliant Neo-Noir thriller.   Wow, thanks for this!   The symbolism of Tyler making those rules are so that they would be broken, just like the law. He knew they would break the first rule, preparing them for breaking the law...   YES I know I broke the first two rules, Tyler made those rules just so that they would be broken.   But yeah what is it like on there? Why is it on private?            Being put in a plain metal box the size of a small bathroom and have all the walls close in by 1cm every year. Of course you get fed through a small shaft in one of the walls....bread and water.   That last part made me cringe.    I somehow doubt It'll be PG-13.   My life is now complete.   Correct.    You're dead right with the whole 'analyze' thing. Thank you very much for all of this, greatly appreciated.   This just makes me even more skeptical for Ant Man.  Good job with this btw.   I love Deakins. Thanks for this, had no idea it existed!    Any Disney/Pixar film.   Big Hero 6, oh man. :')        Harrison Ford said it was one of the best he had ever read.   :(   I've heard elsewhere that the script for the sequel is fucking amazing. I hope this is good.   Someone give this guy gold.       Who should play the Beatles?    I hope they don't do the same thing. I have faith in Miller for him to try something new and different.    Mad Fuck Max: Fury Road.  My GOD what an awesome, awesome film!!! Argh I could go on and on about how damn fun this movie is!      Some Oscars will be won.   Australia has a much better rating system. Here it is what's called MA 15+.      Download tor, and start searching.   Fuck that was intense. I need to see this now.   Edit: Directed by Sam Mendes and shot by Roger Deakins? Ok, I need to watch this RIGHT NOW   htowntoker713, If Zack Snyder DOES in fact deliver a VERY good film, I am going to give you gold. I have put a shortcut of your account onto my desktop and it will remain their until march 26 or whenever it comes out. You wait and see. If BvS is good film, the gold is yours :)      D:      That Goonies one brought a big stupid grin to my face. So many memories, thank you so much for these.      You dont need to as the new one is not linked to the other 3. I still recommend you do though, they're all great action flicks.   Prisoners, anything David Fincher especially Zodiac, Nightcrawler, The Chaser, Inherent Vice (If you're looking for a lighter tone, although it has its dark moments), anything Scorsese (but I'm sure you've seen plenty of his) as far as underrated Scorsese films go I recommend Mean Streets and Casino. Also Mystic River is a fantastic crime drama.   Have you read the book? Off the top of my head he'll also (maybe) do the [book spoiler](#s "motion capture for a gigantic demonic alien spider"), play the creature from the black lagoon, a fucking werewolf, a leper, and a fuck tonne of other terrifying shit.  He also may have to eat dead children's corpses as well as kill them. Yay!   Yes ahaha same here.       He'll look much older in the clown suit and makeup. And trust me, when he is, his age will be the last thing people will be paying attention to.   That was fucking intense.   Where can I get a copy of it?   FUCK THIS MAKES ME MAD!!!!   Damn. Maybe his upcoming Civil War epic, The Free State of Jones, can get him back to where he deserves to be.       [Literally Kevin Feige right now](https://i.imgur.com/BGOEqBn.gif)   Fuck I'm a retard.   Who?   Holy shit. r/moviescirclejerk have gone all out in circle jerking MM:FR, I repeat, ALL OUT.   I was just thinking, if the director of BIRDMAN thinks Will Poulter is good enough to star in 'The Revenant' alongside big names such as Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hardy, and the director of TRUE DETECTIVE thinks he's good enough to play Pennywise then that must mean that this kid has some serious talent, and we haven't seen any of those films yet.  What are your thoughts?          This is kinda cool. Even if Attack of the clones is shit. Try and do a Blade Runner meets Drive video, it'll work a lot better.   Bang! Mystic River it is!   Nope. Good guess.   Can you guess [this](http://imgur.com/4RQNtH0) one? Good luck  	137
 Deviled eggs are super easy. Quite delicious. And very cheap. Eggs, mayo, mustard. Might have that all already  and not even need to spend.        Si!   Whoops. Didn't even see it. Sorry to repost, vikes fans.   This article is extremely well written. It comes off as poignant and eloquent. But it still leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

 It's almost like we got better in the offseason. Maybe not in terms of individual parts but in terms of cohesion and balance.

Re-fried beans can be fried or baked.    the raw beans can be cooked when dry or soaked overnight, then stewed, drained of most of the remaining liquid, and converted into a paste with a masher (such as a potato masher), or pressed through a fine mesh sieve (to remove the skins). Some of the drained liquid, or chicken or vegetable stock, is added if the consistency is too dry. The paste *is then* ***baked*** or **fried** with lard or vegetable oil and seasoned to taste with salt and spices.         Any chance for spotify? I want people to know I'm listening to this.

Obviously there was a lot more that went into that but cutting the Internet and cable was the first step which allowed me to start taking more and bigger ones. It's possible and you might find one day that not only do you not miss it but you relish the freedom of un-connectivity.    Cut the internet too. I did it about 18 months ago, said goodbye and it has been the best change I've made in a really long time. You people are lying to yourselves if you think you *need* it.   For me personally it was a health and lifestyle decision but not supporting those monopolies with my business has been a nice side effect.   As opposed to the creative masterpiece of a name that is 'Cowboys'. It just makes it too busy, is in a weird spot, and just doesn't fit. Sorry, Chandler.   I like the white ones but the blue ones need to lose that Dallas Cowboy star.   Obama didn't de-escalate anything in Iraq. He left on the timeline Bush negotiated after trying to renegotiate to keep US troops there longer.  Bush signed the SOFA Accord but the war *was still going on* and Obama was the one who presided over the actual complete withdrawal of US combat troops from Iraq. It's one thing to sign such an agreement at the end of your final term and another to actually follow through on it. The SOFA Accord was signed 5.5 years after the invasion of Iraq. Lets not pretend that Bush ended anything. He introduced the framework for his successor, but his successor still had to end the hostilities. Would McCain have backtracked on SOFA had he been elected? If you believe yes (which his words leading up to the election would indicate), then how could you not agree that Obama was the one who actually ended the war? We invaded without UN approval, what makes you think a flimsy withdrawal agreement couldn't have been superseded?  He increased the troop numbers in Afghanistan for years with no benefit, or clear mission, before finally pulling back troops.  The idea was the same coin as the successful 'troop surge' in Iraq during Bush's presidency. Just like in Iraq, it worked until the surge subsided. The problem with both conflicts was that there was *never* a clear desired outcome, we wandered in without a goal and with outdated strategy and the people of Iraq and Afghanistan paid the price.  He completely botched Libya  How so? The goal was to support dissidents of Qaddafi in a bid to oust him from power, which was accomplished with intelligence sharing and the targeted strikes of Libyan military assets. Unless you mean botched as in he botched it by getting involved in the first place; an assertion which time will paint a more detailed picture of and you could very well be right on.  and funneled weapons to Syrian rebels, many of whom were Islamist terrorists.  I'm not going to argue with you on that one. I really don't know where I stand on the whole Syrian Civil War or our involvement.  He tried to get involved in Syria very early on and only backed down when there was a large public backlash. You don't remember the whole redline comment?  See, the fact that he backed down when there was a large public backlash is an important point to me.  Obama doesn't get credit just because he didn't get involved in every little skirmish.  When your country has been at the forefront of foreign military intervention since the 1950s, I think you should get a little credit when your foreign policy shifts slightly from that precedent.  Bush had international support when he started his wars, too, as well as congressional ***and UN approval***.  Not in Iraq. International support was paltry at best and UN approval was non-existent.  If anything, he's doubled down on all of the previous administration's follies.  I just can't agree with that when one of those admins started two separate trillion plus dollar ground wars and the other didn't.   I'm just saying Obama is not anything like the peacenik you're trying to paint him as.  I'm not painting him like a peacenik, I just disagree that he is a war-hawk.  His foreign policy isn't perfect. Far from it, it's lukewarm at best. I don't agree with a great deal of his foreign policy but I do think it's a step in the right direction away from his predecessor (because tepid isn't great but it's better than scalding water for washing your hands).  You should take off your blinders and see what he's really been up to.  You should save the personal attacks for personal arguments.    100% false. Bush ended the Iraq war, Obama wanted to stay.  If Bush ended the Iraq war, how could his successor want to say?  The Iraq War didn't end until December of 2011, Obama was elected in 2008 and took office in January 2009.  Nice rebuttal, you're off to a good start.   Um...Do what? Limited by what standards? No occupation?  Uh, yeah. Limited as in limited. Limited as in minimizing war resource allocations.  We always try and claim international support. We did the same thing in Iraq.  Well we *did* initially have a lot of international support in Afghanistan and Iraq to a lesser extent but then we stayed there for a decade, and rightfully lost it.  You seem to think unless we are invading and occupying everything is ok.  I absolutely do not think that, and for you to jump to *that* conclusion based off my comment tells me more about you than you not knowing which president ended the War in Iraq (and confidently not knowing it to boot).  The only thing he hasn't done is a full scale invasion....everything else is 100% Bush policy.  Right...the only thing he hasn't done is get the US stuck in 2 separate trillion+ dollar wars which significantly hurt our international standing and isolated us from our allies.  But I mean really, Obama's foreign policy diverges enormously from GWB's, for better or for worse.      Firkin and Fenix seems to have a divese NFL crowd, and it plays all the games.    Care to elaborate? De-escalated/ended war in Iraq from US presence standpoint; de-escalating Afghanistan from US presence standpoint; limited involvement in Libya (air strikes + intelligence); limited/no involvement in Egypt; limited/no involvement in Iraq/Palistine; refusal to join the fight in Syria for 4 years; no action in Ukraine; delayed action against ISIS until now (according to the West chatterbox). And you look at the conflicts we've been involved in (that weren't inhereted) and they share the common bond of international support.   If anything he's been trying very hard not to repeat what he saw as the previous administration's biggest folley.    This is neat and all but you're not even gonna post any picture?    Apparently you're wrong dude because he didn't get a red.    If the NFL was smart, he'd be the player face of the NFL.    Maybe y'all are both just fat.

I contend that the entire Liberal point of view is based not on logical, factual debate versus Conservative's logical, factual points but on the fact that Liberals must necessarily lie to disguise their faulty arguments. In other words, Liberals can't win debates based on facts so they have to resort to lies.  The five points you offer above prove this. You rely not on any real or actual Conservative view points but instead rely on the false narrative that Liberals claim Conservatives hold. AKA you rely on lies and not on actual Conservative views.   In reality, Conservatives have factual, logical, philosophicaly based reasons why they hold the views they have.   As a Tea Party Conservative, I am not a racist. I get my news from many sources and not from any Fox News echo chamber. I oppose socialism, Leftism, Progressivism philosophically because they are the antithesis of Jeffersonian Democracy. I have no business overlords and I am an atheist.  I oppose Obama, Bernie Sanders, Hillary, Liz Warren and every other Leftist based on their views and policies. I have scientific reasons why I doubt that anthropogenic climate change is a serious issue or that the proposed solutions would offer any difference.  I don't believe that you are consciously lying. I believe that you and other Liberals are being fed lies by the media, academia, entertainment, and fellow Liberals who then form opinions based on false information.  I believe Liberals lie so that any debate on the facts never takes place. Conservatives are demonized as haters so that their views never have to even be considered.         Can you tell me why Conservatives oppose the issues above? I am curious if you actually believe that Conservatives have rational, logical, well thought out and sincere reasons why they hold the positions they have on political issues.  Oh and all of the issues above ARE political issues to Conservatives.  Well?   Liberals incorrectly claim that Conservatives:  1. Oppose Obamacare because they are racist  2. Oppose climate change because they are anti science  3. Oppose any female candidate because they are anti women  4. Oppose gay marriage because of homophobia  5. Oppose immigration reform due to being xenophobic   Seriously, can you tell me one issue where Liberals accurately  portray Conservatives views?        It also killed MTV.

Many uneducated people misunderstand the Southern Strategy or do so intentionally for political gain.    How do his comments on the Southern strategy prove the false claim that the GOP is racist?    The Democrats were overt racists and supported slavery, segregation, Jim Crow, created the Klan, and opposed civil rights for blacks.  The GOP was the party of Lincoln and supported the end of slavery, integration, and civil rights .  These are indisputable facts.  Democrats renounced overt racism during the civil rights movement and should be commended for that.  There exists no proof whatsoever that the GOP changed course and embraced racism, fielded racist candidates, or supported racist policies.

 Really? Cos I've seen videos where she talks about games she likes. Also basically all of her criticisms on youtube start with "it's possible to both simultaneously enjoy and criticize", which is true, not many games are 100% perfect.   I think people are very sensitive about what she says instead of accepting that like many critics out there she only mentions something if it's a problem. That doesn't = she hates all games. I prefer her positive criticism, of what I've seen, though, but I like positive criticism from most people, negativity is less appealing to me personally.   Sounds like you've got quite the list already, good luck! Don't feel bad if a game doesn't click, if you've got something else to try there's nothing wrong with changing things up. Have fun!   Am i the only one who likes engaging with all forms of polite criticism including hers? She makes some good points sometimes so I think its unfair to generalise about her work.

Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51OztTj9r5M  **Any of these telltale games** (contains dialogue options, almost like an interactive movie or TV show - not super long and the last two aren't all out yet, gameplay is mostly quicktime events and dialogue): The Walking Dead S1 2 (will make you cry) - Fan Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIq1bpzxCZw  The Wolf Among Us (neo noir) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a_St9DTuO0  Tales from The Borderlands (comic roguish adventure - apparently you don't have to know the previous games, according to friends I have who have played it - I haven't played it yet but heard good things) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_0Od_savz7A  Game of Thrones (If you like the show) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZeJfIvy3Ck  **LA Noire** (LA confidential style cop drama): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jeYym1U226M  **Fallout 3/New Vegas** (First Person RPG Shooter, Dialogue Options, Create a Character): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7a1GVlC9SM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-x-1fm2cq8  **Skyrim** (first person fantasy RPG, dialogue options, create a character) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PjqsYzBrP-M   I love that log bridge in Skyrim, it feels so epic fighting over a waterfall.   Falling off a cliff on my horse in Red Dead Redemption :/ and I'm fairly sure that's actually quite hard to do!   I do gaming criticism/comment (also develop my own little games) - but I focus on keeping a positive perspective. It's an attempt to counter the tone of videos that focus on anger/outrage.   I've tried not to post the channel too much on reddit because of self promotional rules, so if anyone wants to share them if they like them, feel free :)  Only two videos so far, but got lots planned :) Enjoy!   Peace  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUCZVL49fTP8lKX-taX_cpA/feed   Find games that you enjoy and you want to play, don't let other people tell you what games are the "right" games to play. If you need recommendations, what kinds of games/stories are you interested in? I'm sure people here could recommend some, for PS2 right?   https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUCZVL49fTP8lKX-taX_cpA/videos  Well nobody asked :) Done two so far, the latest is probably the slickest.     The beauty of the internet is you can probably find communities and content creators that suit your tastes.   I personally have misgivings about the very pessimistic and snarky tone the dialogue about this art form has cultivated. I dislike outrage culture very strongly - I feel like that energy could be better spent on actual world problems. Although cordial and polite critique on a variety of issues is absolutely fine. I agree with you about Danny O'Dwyer, but I like him because he's calm, clear and concise. He doesn't beat the outrage drum, and I appreciate that.   Conversely to you, I actually like many elements of every outlet you mentioned. However, broadly speaking any sort of outrage turns me off, this is supposed to be an artform for discussion, not anger, bitterness or incivility - at least that's how I feel about it.     He was basically naked lol :P nah ur right i meant Big Boss in Mgs3 and Peacewalker   A suicide squad game would be awesome, I just hope they make sure Harley Quinn is more of a goofball psychopath, rather than the sexy booby schtick the Arkham games have given her. What can I say, I love classic Harley ;)   Unfortunately, a lot of popular games videos and stories revolve around outrage and they get voted to the top. I strongly believe this can be counteracted through passionate, but positive, games videos and articles.   E.g. Superbunnyhops MGS2 video - insightful, but also positive.   I've started making videos on the basis of not being negative or angry, for that very reason. Hopefully one day they will be popular enough for people to post on /r/games   Haha, yeah fair call. Snake has a "naked" getup ever since MGS3 I believe, so maybe, here's hoping she's got some different getups like proper camo etc.   I am so interested to see how the themes of this game play out. GZ was a brutal condemnation of Gitmo, always loved how Kojima fits smart with the surreal/off-beat.  I also love how you don't always have to play as snake, which is cool.   I only really watch Criminal Intent would have defs played a telltale game with Goren and Eames   See their portraits in the menu, also i think quiets costume can be changed in the menu too.   With the 12x XP Boost the game is great now, I managed to level up to 50 with my Jedi Knight in a few days when it had took me 3 years on and off to just get my Sith Warrior to Lvl 40.  I've been playing on and off F2P, what is a 12x xp boost and how do I get one? I also just play for story.   It's the same actor, but I don't think the characters will be the same at all. At least I hope not.   My biggest issue with Arkham Games is the redesign of Harley Quinn, It's not a game breaker for me, but I always loved Harlequin designed Harley. I don't feel she needs to be "attractive" in terms of sexuality. She's more of a goofball maniac after all.   Yeah! Something eerie, but appealing about Animal Crossing's "perfect life" atmosphere. haha.    	22
 Nope. My vacations ate going on, so I am not procrastinating anything :)      /uj The AutoMod replies are getting really annoying now.   **HITLER IS AN APPROVED PROPHET!**   You should!   My favourite is running and cricket :)   Yup, or was pretty sad. The first 10 minutes of Up were sadder, though.   Which sport do you like the most? :)   I love Toy Story 3. It was an amazing movie.   Toy Story trilogy :)   You favourite movie?   Not a lot of rules, it has as many as a normal sport. What's the most popular sport in your country?   Playing Cricket is really fun, and it's the most popular game here in India. And, you should really watch HTTYD. It's one if my favourite movies    #BuyANexus   I woke up a few hours ago, and now I would play cricket (heard about the game?) with my friends. Yesterday I saw How To Train Your Dragon 1   2, and both were really good movies.   Hi! How's your day going?   I don't really watch a lot of TV, so I don't have a favorite show :)   Besides code, I really don't know :P    Currently I just finished my 10 th grade, so I didn't really do anything yet to pursue the goals. I would love to be a coder!   I would like to see myself in a good university in five years... I hope I would be in a good university doing Computer Science.   I would love some random questions :)   Mmmm....   Probably just fooling around, troubling people :P   Toy Story (1,2   3). I just love them.   I would go for truth!   implying a Nexus 6 can be destroyed.   /u/Flexxkii has wonderfully done it. This is the best implementation of Naut 3 I've ever seen.   I almost cried during the first 10 minutes of Up.   As you have counted Toy Story, I would also like to count in Up. The first 10 minutes were too damn emotional.    **MODERATORS MODERATORS MODERATORS MODERATORS MODERATORS**   what's up?    [This](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/)   **DUARTE DUARTE DUARTE DUARTE DUARTE**   **MODERATORS MODERATORS MODERATORS MODERATORS MODERATORS**   So should we start screaming "MODERATORS MODERATORS MODERATORS MODERATORS MODERATORS"?

What spam does this sub have?   implying a Nexus 6 can be destroyed.   Seriously. AP has shown themselves to be the only Android news blog that takes itself seriously. They consistently produce new, useful, substantiated content. I don't see many other android journalists (or even other journalists in other fields) do as fantastic  of a job as you guys do.   The APK teardowns, fantastic sources of information. Don't see others doing this. You don't just post "Oh boy i think this is happening rumor rumor rumor." You go through the code line by line to see what it could mean. That's dedication. Every week, the "x apps of the week." Awesome! What a great way to find apps. Original reviews, insightful and honest opinions, I love it!   All other general news. Always original content. Rarely do I see recycled "this rumor happened" and "this is coming out" like I do from literally every other blog.   Getting to know Android x.x.x. Perfect. Probably my favorite recurring thing on any blog ever. Basically, what I'm trying to say, is thank you so much for putting out actual content. Thank you for not trying to get pageviews from "hot" titles and "latest rumors!" Thank you for trying to get pageviews from writing solid articles and putting thought into almost every post.   Seriously, I love you guys. I hope you can tell from all the upvotes and how many of your stories hit the front page! But even still, I wanted to let you know how absolutely grateful I am (and we all are)! Stick around, and keep up the fantastic work! We don't take it for granted, even if it might seem like it sometimes!   **tl,dr; I LOVE YOU ANDROID POLICE! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING! 3**   I seriously love these new shorts!   Not running M Preview.   Damn, you're old.   not Google+   You have disgraced Lord DuARTe.   You have been indefinitely blessed.   He's totally awesome :D   Dhruv?

It's 11.00 PM here, so I'm not sleepy...      Yup, all keynotes start at night for us :(   That's even worse!   Hey, I have a Red Bull can lying around in my fridge, that might help!   I love the timer. It's amazing!   M0DS   I hope I can stay up!   India/GMT+5.30. I don't want to miss the Material Now event today :(   I think I'll have to pull off a nighter today to participate in the thread.   Waiting patiently for the ACJ thread!   #BuyANexus   I love Asterix!   CC and /r/androidcirclejerk.   Books, reddit and animated movies.   I don't play games. I don't listen to music.   Cyanoshit    You have disgraced Lord DuARTe.   40C/104F here.   I will try to come!   What? Why do you want me to crush women? :O   Because it is designed by Lord DuARTe.   This movie looks too damn promising.   First time I have used it, I am going to watch the movie today after 6 years, so I was excited :P   what's up?    [This](http://m.imdb.com/title/tt1049413/)    'Cause I'm 16.   I like to drink water.   Only a few people hate it. It's actually very good, and that's the reason why it's the highest grossing animated movie.      I am getting super-excited for this one!   Also, how was the movie? Does it live up to the high expectations?   And using reddit is fun *is not fun.*   Buzz Lightyear?   It would be the monsoon season here, with rains, and that would make it gloomy :(   Summer's almost over here :(   I might rephrase the question. Why is he the biggest shill?   Why is /u/ladfrombrad literally Stalin?   My top comment is this:     I had put an AMA request for him on ACJ, I think he saw that...   Yup, pretty proud if it...   MKBHD.   Running, it always helps relieve stress.   Even I love animated movies and I am re-watching most of the animated movies I love!   I loved Tangled as well. The CGI is beautiful.   Monster's Inc. is very nice film. I just rewatched it yesterday.   The animation was perfect.    Up was a very touching movie... I loved it.   Yup. Wall-E is amazing.   Probably the most underrated Disney movie?   Yup, Tangled and Frozen were excellent as well, and Big Hero 6 is my all-time favourite.   16, M, No, No.   Also, when did I tell you I like Disney? I genuinely don't remember :)  	113
 You can't just see a doctor? What country do you live in?    "Oh it's that clown guy. He's a bit of a prick"   Can I suck your cock?   Playing video games makes you an artist now? Jesus christ   The full details are that he made it up   What?      Sea horses wouldn't be able to pull a ship of that size    The Internet can substitute for either gender   Or OP could try living on the edge a little and just pick one   Le fuck off   But I people weren't willing to do it, it would pay more. Why should I have to fork out extra money to pay someone when a high school drop out is willing to do it for minimum wage   They're specimens not 'piss jars'!   None of this applies to me except the video games. Am I safe or do they need to go to?   How do you make Bond feel insecure?   Trial by dank memes   We could have an entire AskReddit thread dedicated to Tommy Wiseau theories   Isn't there a theory that this is completely made up?   B-boom goes the uh... The d-dynamite   But the amiibos push the price up, right? So what's the difference?   All humans in FF7 have Cetra roots. The theory is they occupy the same universe. Potentially, 7s humans descended from 10s Cetra   This seems common in fiction. Did it actually occur much in real combat?   that sounds ok  No it fucking doesn't    Couldn't you simply not tell anyone and immediately go to claim it?   Two virgins talking about what constitutes good sex...   Cloud being a clone of Sephiroth is a bigger plot twist than the Aerith thing   A secret character would be data mines within a week of release   I think they must mean the people from Spira were the Cetra. FFVII humans lost a lot of their technology and innate magical ability once Jenova wiped out the Cetra      No, it's because the equipment we use to measure it interacts with the particles and effects it's behaviour   I always assumed it was prosthetics, but in the last episode of season 5 Arya keeps removing faces from a corpse as if they were just thin masks on their face. Is it magic or something?   But 'you can control three characters and mash x' is? Let's be real here, 99% of all Final Fantasy battles are just mashing X   The problem was the game was too easy. The battle system was fine at its core   Just change turn based to time based   Yikes   That's any genre though.   -carry around a bunch of boxes  This is fucking retarded   Maybe shirts should come with expiry dates   Found my car keys    A what?

They won't care   Do you ever think about how much dick your mum sucked in her lifetime?   Is it just broken atm or is it simply not an implemented feature and the data is a placeholder?   Is this data retroactive, or will it start fresh with source 2? Can't check as I'm holidaying   Picture a man, alone, browsing Reddit...   Best to 14th best then Cars 2      Simulators are notorious for being time sinks and addicting. No idea where you heard they were consider boring   But that has nothing to do with the argument. Of course there can be successful projects without crowd sourcing... The point is it brings things to market that otherwise wouldn't exist. It adds options for creative or ambitious people to raise the necessary funds to create things people will enjoy   Isn't that just standard German inflection?   His delivery sucks then    Isn't a plasma screen just glass?   How does that answer his question? I'm not saying it doesn't, I just don't understand it to be honest   If so, how does the whip achieve the actual grabbing?   Good luck mate   Crowd sourcing gives the ability for them to fail in the first place. Without it, games like Yooka Laylee and (I believe) FTL would never be given the chance to fail in the first place. The average person cannot raise the kinds of funds without some form of external investment.  Traditionally, this is capital markets or bank loans. Now we can add crowd sourcing to the list.   It doesn't encourage laziness anymore than convincing some wealthy investors to give you money and squandering that. Either way you are ruining your own reputation and wasting resources provided externally. The encouragement to not be lazy is wealth.    When you form a company, you are often not the one investing either... This is why many company founders are often CEOs and not actual owners.  Crowd sourcing brings products to market that may not otherwise exist. They also do not require any given individual to bear a significant portion of the risk of the product/company as opposed to traditional investing.   Also, your notion of getting what you want by working hard isn't true of capital markets that already exist. Having a profitable idea gets you what you want, not working hard. Very few products available for purchase are self funded   It's just a form of investment.  Capital markets have allowed technology and the quality of life to explode.   Crowd funding isn't much different. Except the potential return/reward is a new product on the market instead of dividends.  Games like Yooka Laylee would not likely exceed of it depended on investors from acapital market, since they're riskier than CoD 18.  It's a fine system that is currently a little too open to abuse. But certainly not 'lazy'   What the fuck? You can't count people?   Sooo... Read more carefully before shitposting   -pick up kids  -meeting with leader of reptile overlords -do laundry   How the fuck do they keep losing them?   How long do they typically have lunch for? What if no one is hungry?   Or maybe the kind of guy who is more excited to watch a movie then be with his date was not particularly exciting to go on a date with    And the movie was still decent regardless of what Kubrick wanted   Unfortunately? The sequel was fine    Why? He literally told us nothing about the girl    Jesus Christ, it's a few fucking dollars as some stupid features. You're absolutely spastic    How?   Fucking rubbish    It's meant to be inconspicuous...   More specifically?   "I'd like to put his... ass on"   Is the exact opposite of Kevin Spacey   I agree with you. The cringe for my is the disrespect for its value. You don't just carve up thousands of dollars for a joke    girls kissing and then getting down on eachother real candid lesbians - Pornhub.com    I understand there may not currently be an answer yet, but just incase: does anyone know if Blofeld is not part of thee Craig films at all, or will he simply not be in this film (perhaps the sequel?)     The controls were smooth has hell. He design decision to prevent motion and shooting is to add to the tebsion   First prequel?   There are three?   Because this joke has been posted so many times now it would look stale and outdated before this movie releases   It'll be better than the movie too   Iron Man and Batman have taken down foes faster and stronger than Luke, with more powerful 'magic' abilities       True   Or his ex will suck the massive cock of some rich investor while OP browses Reddit   Or it could keep track of the ones it picked   You walked right into that g   What an old post      No, use he because he was born with a dick and these degenerates need to fuck off and die.   Better than being dead   'High quality'   They only started that in X    Making a post on the Internet is taking something serious?   Ignoring the obvious stuff like outdated music.  For me - being able to take Cloud out of the party. It always felt odd to have him stuck in the group   You can in FFX by pressing triangle.   Is it a Mario platformer?   The issue here is yearly releases leading to saturation. Who gives a shit if it's a successor or not?   Right... And op is arguing that it shouldn't be that way. He knows this is the case. That's the point of his post.   You have to justify the law as it is, not summarise it...      Actually, Qs role is to judge their worth and he DOES get into trouble for meddling with species.

I haven't seen any Craig Bond movies, I thought he was meant to be young Bond?   Yes   Haha wp!   Literally WHO   Good job!   Nice on matey   Brilliant!   Haunts you? Would you say this story Hurts you?  Ps. I didn't read past your opening line   It still looks easy without those tbh   I'm sorry I missed this one   VIIIs draw system is rubbish    Seven is getting a remake, maybe he could wait for that   That makes no sense and would just leave you with three copies of FF3. you can probably get a refund on two of them    Not being professional isn't always a bad thing. It was a story about chocolate, get the stick out of your ass   Why?   You said PS4 is really just the PC. He responded to that   [Salad Fingers breathes creepily]   Balk?   Because if they put Halo on PC then the XBone dies   I think this is most likely just to get people who didn't play it the first time round. A little extra cash.   Kh3 is nearly completed? I thought it barely started development   Which has already existed since the 90s, and was recently rereleased on Steam with achievements and cloud saving...

The answer would be all of the above and more, depending on the ruler in question   Just as unfunny as the real SNL   Dear God...   Studios wouldn't hire him? That's cold. Cold like ice. Which is what his character Mr. Freeze uses in the movie Batman and Robin.   Jimmy fallon's fake laugh... Jesus Christ   Or hired taller actors.   I definitely remember watching it one night when I was 6   Actually picturing this is fucking weird   Degenerate   Most of those examples aren't brigading and are no different from any sub designed at making fun of people (cringe, rage, fashion disaster subs, ugly people, etc).  The two that involves active FPH harassing cross sub are not enough to warrant an entire sub deletion or garner admin attention. I still don't think it's a convincing excuse for deleting the sub.   On an unrelated note, that chick from progress pics has an absolutely disgusting body.      The reason they were banned is debatable. I was an avid FPH browser and I never once saw any meaningful attempt to harass people organised on the sub.    You're thinking of Marth (who Roy is a clone of). Roy has always been mid to low tier.  Considering how weak Marth is now either the gap will be bridged between the two, or Roy may adopt some of Marth's new disadvantages and be even weaker yet. It's unlikely this character will shine competitively unless they completely rework him   Yes I do lol! I want to lick his sticky globs of semen off his nob   I think her body is fine, but the dress makes her look...

 Wait, so one bar?

WHY AREN'T WE DOING ANYTHING?! SAVE DA BABY!!!!!!   He was. I was just ^going ^^along ^^^for ^^^^the ^^^^^ride.   But its got electrolytes.    I've lived here for about a year and still want to branch out. I'm partnered, just looking for more adventure. I liked the hiking group post for Venture County (so I guess it doesn't *have* to be LGBTA related), I'm just more curious than anything what sort of community is here.  Oh, and LGBTA is lesbian, gay, bi, trans*, and ally (straight).   What made marriage so difficult back then was yet again that instigator of so many other sorts of heartbreak: the oversize brain.   so in california, the californian fan palm sheds its fans along side its trunk, like a scarf on a neck. this insulates the tree at night, where temperatures in the desert can drop below freezing. this creates refuge for a plethora of animals that can eat the fruits, carry the seeds, help pollinate the plant, and give nutrients to the soil.  some other cool facts about them, they are exactly the correct height to protect them from columbian mammoths, their top predator, once upon a time. the native americans would seek the trees out, as they grew where the water was. they would burn the dead fans on the trunk to scare all the little animals away (think snakes, mice, spiders, bats, birds, etc.).   [Newscasters use a midwestern accent, it's the most stereotypical American voice](http://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/americanvarieties/midwest/).

[Damn.](http://comedycentral.mtvnimages.com/images/shows/Futurama/Videos/season_7/futurama_715_eat_and_digest_640x360.jpg?)    The main difference between animal emotions and human emotions is that animals don't have mixed emotions the way normal people do. Animals aren't ambivalent; they don't have love-hate relationships with each other or with people. That's one of the reasons humans love animals so much; animals are loyal. If an animal loves you he loves you no matter what. He doesn't care what you look like or how much money you make.  This is another connection between autism and animals: autistic people have mostly simple emotions, too. That's why normal people describe us as innocent. An autistic person's feelings are direct and open, just like animal feelings. We don't hide our feelings, and we aren't ambivalent. I can't even imagine what it would be like to have feelings of love and hate for the same person. Some people will probably think this is an insulting thing to say about autistic people, but one thing I appreciate about being autistic is that I don't have to deal with all the emotional craziness my students do. I had one fantastic student who flunked out of school because she broke up with her boyfriend. There's so much psychodrama in normal people's lives. Animals never have psychodrama.  Children don't, either. Emotionally, children are more like animals and autistic people, because children's frontal lobes are still growing and don't mature until sometime in early adulthood. I mentioned earlier that the frontal lobes are one big association cortex, tying everything together, including emotions like love and hate that would probably be better off staying separate. That's another reason why a dog can be like a person's child: children's emotions are straightforward and loyal like a dog's. A seven-year-old boy or girl will race through the house to greet Dad when he comes from work the same way a dog will. I think animals, children, and autistic people have simpler emotions because their brains have less ability to make connections, so their emotions stay more separate and compartmentalized.  Of course, no one knows why an autistic grown-up has trouble making connections, since our frontal lobes are normal-sized. All we know right now is that researchers find "decreased connectivity among cortical regions and between the cortex and subcortex." The way I visualize it is that a normal brain is like a big corporate office building with telephones, faxes, e-mail, messengers, people walking around and talking -- a big corporation has zillions of ways for messages to get from one place to another. The autistic brain is like the same big corporate office building where the only way for anyone to talk to anyone else is by fax. There's no telephone, no e-mail, no messengers, and no people walking around talking to each other. Just faxes. So a lot less stuff is getting through as a consequence, and everything starts to break down. Some messages get through okay; other messages get distorted when the fax misprints or the paper jams; other messages don't get through at all.  The point is that even though autistic people have a normal-sized neocortex including normal-sized frontal lobes, our brains function as if our frontal lobes were either much smaller or not fully developed. Our brains function more like a child's brain or an animal's brain, but for different reasons. When the different parts of the brain are relatively separate from each other and don't communicate well, you end up with simple, clear emotions due to compartmentalization. A child can be furious at his mom or dad one second, then completely forget about it the next, because being mad and being happy are separate states. A child hops from one to the other depending on the situation.  You see the exact same thing with animals. Strong emotions in animals are usually like a sudden thunderstorm, They blow in and then blow back out. Two dogs who live together in the same house can be snarling one second, then go back to being best friends the next. Normal people need a lot more time to get over an angry emotion, and even when a normal adult does get over a bad emotion he's made a lasting connection between the angry emotion and the person or situation that made him angry. When a normal person gets furiously angry with a person he loves, his brain hooks up anger and love and remembers it. Thanks to his highly developed frontal lobes, which connect everything up with everything else, his brain learns to have mixed emotions about that person or situation.

That was a beautifully seamless gif.   And they can just stop breathing if they get over excited. It's really an ordeal :(  Some of my most frequent clients though. So that's an upside.   I mean... I let dogs lay down if they want... but with the grooming loop and all, we don't really flip dogs on their back. At least at my salon. Some bigger dogs we might have them on their sides. Some dogs we might hold like in the picture. I'm just not allowed (or strongly discouraged) from flipping a dog on it's back. When I worked as a vet tech assistant we did that, just not in any grooming salon. Might have to try it though, or run it by my boss.   http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/2qz9xn/lpt_walking_your_dog_for_an_hour_to_two_hours_a/  IDK why you're getting down voted, i said this same thing a day or two ago.

My boyfriend and I have been arguing for the last five minutes, settle a score;  Is that a rock? Or a pan?   WHAT?! That's insane!  What else do you know about it?   My friend knows since I'm a groomer, I'm sort of obsessed, and sent me a link to a Facebook page. From the looks of it, people pull out their camera every time they see a cute dog, like a photo safari for puppies in the wilds of suburbia. Though I could be completely off.  I'm confused beyond belief, and now want to do this all the time. Any one have any info? The subreddit for it appears to be private.   I'm so glad I'm gay.      See, I love clients like you. They know the breed. They know the vet well. They are involved in the dogs life. I'm sure you also let your dog swim tons and get that great exercise otterhounds need.  Also, not gonna lie, I did see your pup. It's been a dream of mine to work on an otterhound. Aren't there like less than 2,000 in the world?   I got a chance to bathe a dandie dinmont terrier (coworker's dog... he carded the dog and shaped the head himself, he just needed help since he was swamped that day). I felt like I was in the presence of a demigod. My school actually owns two Papau New Guinea Singing dogs, brothers i think. I love rare breeds. Facebook has a great group for rare and exotic breeds I follow that showcases breeders from around the world.   I mean it is, I work in a grooming salon, people that don't exercise their dogs and have dogs with long nails, well, these dogs have a tendency to act up and feel uncomfortable with someone man handling their feet. I've seen it. My arms get scratched up from it.  Having a vet or a groomer grind your dogs nails is great. Especially since it's behind a wall/door/curtain and you don't know what's going on.  If you can't spend an hour with your dog a day, I can't fathom why you'd have a dog. Champion dogs cost $2,000-$3,000,000 (See chinese bred Tibetan Mastiffs).   The benefits of long walks are numerous. Better behavior indoors, ample bonding, cardiovascular health for you and your dog, a great way to meet neighbors and other dogs in the neighborhood; I could go on.   * or ground manually  I guess I say that because it's a nail grinder. Such as, "Hey Debra, yea we did the blueberry facial scrub and oatmeal shampoo, with medicated conditioner, expressed the anal glands, grinded the nails, and gave him a teddy bear head with a half inch on the body." It's a bad habit.  So thanks.   Disgusting.      For dew claws, bring them to the groomer. Sometimes they won't even charge you, it's so easy.  If you must do it at home, get a nail clipper [example](http://www.amazon.com/Safari-Professional-Large-Nail-Trimmer/dp/B0002ARQV4), and look at the dew claw closely. If you can see the quick, cut above it. If the nail curves, cut after the apex of the curve, the top of the curve, at a right angle (like 2:00 on a clock). If you cut the quik, don't panic. Use some Quik Stop to cauterize the cut, numb the slight pain, and stop the bleeding by holding on the area with the septic powder for 15-30 seconds. Though the professionals are always best!   Yea, the reason I posted this tip originally was that a lot of dogs don't like their feet/paws/nails being man handled. It can be traumatic. I wouldn't say a barbershop and a grooming salon like the one i work in are analogous, because my clients don't speak the same language i do. Most don't know whats going on. Long walks and a little training (touching the paws often, using your cell phone on vibrate on the paws and body) can go a long way.   I sort of love everything you wrote. Groomers unite and such.   I agree! It's just not a luxury most people have when we get really breed specific. Ex: Ratting, agility, herding, sledding, swimming. Though they all can be done!  OC, California has a herding pen in... Santa Ana I believe with sheep. San Juan Capistrano has dog sleds for huskies. Tons of agility clubs all around the area. And the beach. For dogs like my lab that love to swim and surf.  But only some activities will wear down the nails. Walking/Running/Jogging will.   Oh no! I don't do cats.... My coworkers do. They have an even worse time!  Scratching posts. Corrugated cardboard or whatever it's called. Cat trees. Spend time playing with your cat so they unretract (sp?) their claws (I like the fishing pole with a toy mouse at the end).   It can be for some dogs. If a groomer or vet in the past hit the quik (blood supply) it can resurface past emotions and freak them out. Also, their paws are central in feeling the world around them (Ever hear a dog can 'predict' an earthquake?). Myths aside, they are sensitive areas. I said this in the other post, about 5 in 15 dogs i see in a salon loss their shit. Long walks and a little training prevent that.   In a perfect world I completely agree!  Though when you groom dogs, and 5 out of the 15 dogs you groom in a day lose their shit when you trim their nails, I tell my clients to walk their dogs more! Bonding time, cardiovascular health (for both of you), better behaviors in the home; there's tons of benefits to wearing down your little pooch.  Some other tips, play with your dogs feet. Let them know you can touch them. Also, put your cell phone on vibrate and hold it to their paws and body. The buzzing will get them used to clippers and nail dremels. I've seen it work wonders.   It's not, but ok.   http://38.media.tumblr.com/c0285a36e0dc57ba5159a85b4733d529/tumblr_ndjxfkqQ241rlo1q2o1_1280.gif   So jelly, mine is like 2.95.   [Here's some other benefits to walking your dog! Provided by petMD](http://www.petmd.com/dog/slideshows/general_health/top-ten-health-benefits-walking-your-pet-provides)   As a dog groomer, I get happy when I see a dog walk in to the salon with healthy nails from long walks. It's 15 minutes I don't have to spend doing something most dogs aren't comfortable with. Nothing is worse than nails that are so long, they actually curl in to the pads!

Then I'd look at rescuing a puppy from a city shelter, specifically one that kills dogs.

But most likely just simple oxidization of some safe to consume meat.    Oxidation. (From the USDA Site) Oxygen from the air reacts with meat pigments to form a bright red color which is usually seen on the surface of meat purchased in the supermarket. The pigment responsible for the red color in meat is oxymyoglobin, a substance found in all warm-blooded animals. Fresh cut meat is purplish in color. The interior of the meat may be grayish brown due to lack of oxygen; however, if all the meat in the package has turned gray or brown, it may be beginning to spoil.            Do what now?

His terrible faking almost ruined the movie for me. Still recommend watching it, though.   Yeah, that's not how America works. Comcast will have many places where they are the only provider worth a damn, and if they are not the only provider they may own most of the transmission lines and can charge the other companies so much to use the transmission lines that they have to charge more than Comcast....so people feel forced to use Comcast. It's a mess.   Where I live I have two choices. Out of the tens of companies providing internet access, I have two choices. That's it. Well, three, I could pay for a high-end satellite based internet, but yeah, two choices.   Aha! So there is a difference...it's not a one or done kind of thing. Yes, I will head over to r/sextoys and see if I can get a wider response. Thanks!   She's not overly sensitive...and I don't think that she ever said that it hurts, just that she goes sort of numb....I wondered about the differing quality of vibrators as well...     My wife and I, in our fulfilling quest for sexual gratification, have begun to experiment with a little bdsm/bondage play. I like to take my wife a little out of her comfort zone, and she likes to experience new things.  In previous conversations she has told me that she does not enjoy masturbation/stimulation with vibration. We have not experimented much with vibration because of that.  In our bondage play, I would like to introduce vibration, but it should be pleasurable, not punishment.  So here's my question(s). Is masturbation or stimulation with vibration a learned skill? Or is it more something that works for some of you and not for others? Care to share some stories about your like/dislike of vibration play?  Saying all that, I of course will talk with my wife before anything happens, but I am curious what the community here might advise for me, and for her. (She's on reddit, and subbed here, so I won't be surprised to see her pop a comment in.)  Thanks!   If the phrase "unregulated data" doesn't scare you now, I have a feeling that it will in the future.   My wife and I had gov't assistance at one point in our lives. I was between jobs, and moving out of the city I lived in. There was one point as I moved up in my career that I just made enough money to disqualify the children from medical assistance. I called to ask, really just being surly, why it was that the 50$ too much that I made would take away hundreds of dollars in benefits, and after much talk of tables and earnings, she did tell me that I could have another child, and at the income level I was at, that would qualify my family for all sorts of benefits.  It wasn't exactly the advice I was looking for; and it painted a very interesting picture of the welfare system at large.           What flavor of cord cutter watches Fox News? Are we cutting our grandmother's cords now?   That looks unpleasant. Guess he won't be shoplifting from Bed, Bath, and Beyond anymore.   Be careful with public exhibition in your own home. There have been a few cases of people getting arrested, or harassed by police, if the wrong person sees and contacts the police. IMO for the inexperienced, cam is the way to start.      Assuming you have no problem getting the other half of that pin out without messing up the hole, get new bridge pins. They're cheap and relatively easy to find. I just upgraded my six acoustic to brass pins, and my twelve acoustic to chrome pins, total cost was about $15-20 including shipping.    Socks first. Always.      Good on you, Dad. Well written and well said. More of us should learn to express ourselves well so that our voices are heard clearly. I hope you see a difference next year.         I use the adhesive vinyl...on the top left if I remember correctly. You need sticky on one side cutter vinyl...most of the sign vinyl on that page will work. I use black because I can see the white backing paper through my cuts just a little bit easier than any other colors, but color doesn't matter.      Hmm...lots to work with here.  "Captain Phillips" would need some rum based islandish cocktail  "Polar Express" could give you a nice frozen drink, maybe with mint?   "Cast Away" Yes. Coconuts. Pina Coladas maybe?  "The Green Mile" Anything green. Creme de menthe, apple liquers, midori melon liquer.  "Forest Gump" How about a Gumptini? Chocolate martini with a chocolate garnish?  "A League of Their Own" Baseball = Beer. Serve with peanuts.  "Joe versus the Volcano" Mai Tais!   And for the truly tasteless, because this is Reddit, the "Philadelphia"...a small shot of some red liquer.    But it sure would be fun to watch! The way you guys played this year, I'd give you that one...outstanding job.        The team has also won four Rice Bowls, which is played between the collegiate champion and the champion of Japan's professional league.  I want this here. That would be incredible.    Just another reason to like this guy. I look forward to whatever he does next.   I had read another article that talked about Hughes idea for the sequels. Basically checking in every 10 years or so, through the actors natural (and Hughes') lives.                      Right on. Currently on the last night of a long weekend without my SO and two kiddies...just off work, listening to some 80's rock, chillin' with the puppies, beerin' up, and surprise: on Reddit. Pretty much what I did with most of my free time the last couplethree days.         /u/calibur_ 's post is funny, but also completely true. You need relationship counseling, and sooner rather than later.   I checked out your overview, and I see that you're subbed in /r/Christianity...have you though of seeking help through that sub...though I imagine that you will get much the same message there...with a fair amount of "Let go and Let God" which will probably be of little help at this point.  Do you have a trusted family member or counselor/pastor/preacher at church? I would suggest that route for you and your family.  Whatever you decide, please do it soon. Your daughter's behavior is most likely normal teenage troubles, but the emotional distance in your relationship and the way that you apparently feel about it worries me.  Reach out to someone if you need help; someone IRL, not just here on Reddit.                I recently had an issue with my 10yo son...he had been sneaking downstairs at night to play videogames. I got curious what exactly he was doing after catching him a couple times, and saw that he was going online to play flashgames. So we sat and had the "internet talk" (who knew that was going to be a thing?) and told him about how going on line was a public event, not a private event. We talked a little about the dangers of predation, but mostly about how bad programs could get downloaded onto the computer that could harm us. I had no intention of doing so, but apparently I terrified him of using the PC! Trying to manage balancing between being safe, and being connected is our new challenge at home.   Outstanding article. Thanks for sharing. I have been saying these same things for quite awhile. It's nice to see someone smarter than me saying the same thing.

I like the editing/translating of articles in the target language aspect of Duolingo, but other than that I struggle to stay interested in the site. Many of the sentences just don't make sense, and it adds another level of disconnect...I have found in real conversations with people in my target language I can make some educated guesses about the content based on what a normal person might say, and the way a normal person would construct sentences, and that becomes part of my learning when I find my assumptions are correct, I can file away another word or phrase I don't know, as opposed to trying to guess why someone would say something so ridiculous as your sentence examples show.  What do you think about Memrise? It's user generated, so the good is with the bad there, but I use that site far more than Duolingo recently.   Practice.  Sorry, there is no hack. Work with songs you like, and know well, that are easier than your current skill level, and practice them.   The one piece of actual advice I have is to let mistakes happen, and don't stop. Play each time like someone is listening. It will help you to learn to cover your mistakes, and view the song as one piece, not a collection of a thousand things that all have to be done correctly.  Get off reddit and get back to practicing.   Found it. [Here's a Scientific American article overview of the information](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/2010/06/17/music-and-speech-share-a-code-for-c-2010-06-17/), and [here's a link to the actual paper from the study.](http://ase.tufts.edu/psychology/music-cognition/pdfs/Curtis%26Bharucha2010Emotion.pdf) (long PDF file.)   Ha. I've been looking for it for a minute now. I will post it if/when I find it. It was a while ago, and I want to say that it might have been TED related, but damn if I can find it.    I had recently read about an experiment that a music researcher did at some college. I don't have the link bookmarked anywhere, so excuse me if I paraphrase, but the researcher invited professional voice actors to come in and record simple phrases.  One was a happy phrase, and one was a sad phrase.  The researcher discovered that the voice actors, no matter what nationality, background, or accent, invariably dropped the last one or two syllables of the sad phrase a minor third, while the happy phrase stayed in the major.  The article talks about this a bit at the very end, but perhaps the children rhyming phrases mimic our natural tendency to drop our voice a minor third when delivering sad information, and music has simply developed alongside language to mirror that minor third drop to emulate the negative side of emotional communication.            Plant a [Rain Garden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rain_garden) and put a nice little fence around it.   TIL not to drink milk at /u/koranuso's house.      MIDI is Musical Instrument Digital Interface. What it does in its simplest form, is it records data from your musical instrument (Drum, keys, guitar, anything MIDI enabled) and stores it digitally.   The information that it stores is the notation, pitch, duration, force (or velocity) along with a bunch of other parameters like clocktime, cues, panning, and other information.  What makes MIDI so useful, is that the way this information is stored allows you to make adjustments to any or all of this information.  Example: You can record a few notes of your guitar through MIDI. The digital signature of how hard you hit the notes (velocity, or force), how long the note was recorded (duration), and where on the fretboard that note exists (pitch) can be saved as digital data, and then a sound can be applied to that information on a DAW (that allows you to manipulate MIDI information). You can then record farting noises through a microphone, upload it to a MIDI processor, use that to replace the sound of your guitar, and now your guitar is a tuned fart-box. You can also use a MIDI processor that will emulate whatever sounds (farts or not) that you have loaded in real-time, turning any MIDI instrument into a multi-instrument, multi-sound emulator.  You can also manipulate the data in many other ways, fixing sour notes, changing the velocity or duration of the note, applying any number of sounds to the digital information, etc, etc.   [Here's the Wikipedia overview of MIDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI)      Eisenhower - war hero, or Teddy Rooselvelt - general badass.            Yeah, no problems there, just keep practicing.   I roll my index finger forward just a bit when fingering (teehee) barre chords, so that I'm not just pressing down with the meat of my index, but the thinner side of the finger. That's just my preference.   Keep practicing. Hand strength is key.  Do you have the same problems with other barre forms? Like the G at fret3?   While you practice, you can use the cheater forms too...  There's XX3211. It's a weak F, doesn't sound as good or as full as the barre, but it can get you through a song until your hand is strong.  There's also X3321X. I cheat that one when my hand gets tired...lol. Sounds a bit fuller than the other guy up there, but still missing that full sound of a barre.  Keep practicing. Work on hand strength. (Seeing a pattern?)  Good luck.   First: Relax. Focus on the simple things. Find what you're good at and focus on those things.  Second: Discuss this with your wife (most important) and your/her family (assuming they're a loving and supporting bunch) and they will tell you essentially the same thing. Relax. Love her. Be there. Do what you can.  Third: There are other ways to help. If you don't feel comfortable in direct baby care, focus on support care. If the wife's feeding the baby, you're washing and sanitizing bottles/blankets/etc. If the wife's putting the baby to sleep, you're reading the story or singing the song. If your wife's the one changing the nappies, then you're the one cleaning baby's room. Sure she's frustrated, but there are a million other things that you can be doing...even if the only thing you can do is reduce your wife's workload around the house so that she can focus on the baby care issues that you are not comfortable with.  My experience: I participated in baby care, but I never felt comfortable with it. I found ways to be proactive and involved, but honestly, it just sort of felt like work. Now that the kids are older, I get to help with homework, and social problems, and arts and crafts, and so many other things that I *am* good at. They're only babies for a little while, don't get hung up on the little things.   Short answer: Love her. Love your wife. Love your family. And don't forget the most important thing that new parents forget...you need a little time to yourself, and so does she. Make that happen, too.  Good luck, dad. Don't be nervous. Dads have been doing their dad thing for a long long time. Find where you excel, and rock it.  Now go talk to your wife.                        Exactly. This is how people are starting to watch TV. I don't think that we need to go backwards into a surfable streaming content destination. If we wanted that, why not just pay for cable?                                        Check out [this post](http://www.reddit.com/tb/ec75w) from u/Warly and get an idea of how chord progressions work over keys to understand the "1-4-5" (or more appropriately the "I-IV-V". Print it out, and hang it on your wall, it will become more important the more you practice and understand it.   A lot of my fears were self-esteem fears in the past. Not being good enough to find real love. Not finding happiness in my life.  I've found most of those things, and now I am a father, and all my fears are for my children now. Every. Single. One.  It's the most rewarding and most terrifying thing ever.   Dude. Really. Do you need Reddit to tell you to run like the wind? You already put your dick in crazy, and you can't unfuck that, but I don't think you need anything to do with this girl, fuckbuddy, friend, or gf.  Just my opinion. (Experience: I've fucked more crazy than the American Health Care system.)   Because the US is hell bent on *convincing* Americans how loyal we are to our returning injured troops. They have no interest in *actually* doing anything, especially if they know they can get the same knee jerk flag waving reaction they want if they just tell us that they love the troops.  If they cared about the troops at all, the VA system would not be the struggling, under-budget, paperbased mess that it is.  If they cared about the troops at all, they would have wanted to find out why the suicide rate increased so rapidly after DS Gates instituted the Stop-Loss Programs, and more importantly, why they didn't decrease after draw down.  If they cared about the troops at all, they wouldn't have cut SNAP benefits, as many of our troops, active and retired, rely on food benefits to feed their families.  Or maybe if they cared about the troops at all, they wouldn't have sent our sons and daughters to fight in wars that did nothing but protect the profits of a select group of corporations.  Our politicians wrap themselves in the American Flag, the put their hands over their hearts, and they say all the right words in all the right places, and for some reason we are willing to believe every second of it, even though there are piles of evidence to the contrary.   Tough question on a Sunday afternoon....  Short answer, yeah, Piracy is stealing.  I think a lot of here find ourselves in the weird grayspace of being both a content creator and a content consumer. The creator in me wants to believe that I can make it rich doing what I love, but I know that the best I can hope for is to make a living, and even that is a long shot. The consumer in me, however, recognizes the disconnect in money paid for music and money given to the artist. I don't pirate (okay maybe casually) but I also don't pay for music either. Most of what I listen to and enjoy is more local and small and they usually are happy just to get the listens, so they put music up for free. Like, /u/tomj1990 , I find myself going to the shows, putting up the dollars at the merch table, and knowing that I'm helping them get down the road to the next show.  You mentioned ethics and responsibility, and I agree, there's a disconnect there in modern users, but the "old way" where the men in suits get far more of the dough than the man on stage isn't something I want to go back to.  The point that I took a really long time to get to, is that maybe teaching ethics and responsibility isn't the entire answer: maybe it's teaching content consumers to seek out ways to pay the original artists, and helping content creators think up new ways to source revenue for their work, without involving the giant corporate structure that drives the price of content so high. (Many of the twentysomethings that I talk to don't recognize that they're stealing from the artist, but actively accept that they are stealing from "those corporate bastards".)      That was the happiest I've been all year. Annnnnddd...what the fuck Ron Jeremy's Belly Button?         No prob. I love my state, as messed up as it can be.  There's good surf in Miami as well, I'm just not as familiar with the spots. Yes, sharks are a concern, but a minor one. New Smyrna is the sharkbite capital, and most of them come from surfers at the inlet hopping off boards and landing on top of cruising sharks...usually small, though we did have a great white about 40 miles off shore this last weekend!  Water temp today here in NSB is 64F. Cold, but doable. Only warmer as you go south.  Couple other things about FL....don't drink and drive, don't get caught with weed. Public drinking is usually a no, but check where you're at, it's okay some places.  If you're into live music at all, check out some local bars in the St. Pete/Tampa/Ybor City area. Great music all over the place.  So many other things that are cool about FL, glad to hear you're skipping the whole Disney experience. Lots of local roadside types of attractions all over the state.  Most of us are cool, but you will be dealing with several different types of people. People in Orlando are different from Miami folks, and the people that you would meet in Crystal River or up near the Itchnetucknee are backwoods redneck for sure. But as long as you don't talk politics or religion, talk to the locals. Orlando/Miami/St Pete/Tampa/Ybor City all have areas that are just not safe for non-locals. Don't go to sketchy places. And things can get sketchy quick. One city block is art and restauants, and the next is crack houses and hookers.   Feel free to ask anything specific, now or during your trip. Like I said, I love FL, and would be glad to help.  	187
 If you hate gays so much why not join ISIS?  Where'd he say he hates gays? I don't 'hate' many convicted felons on death row, and in some cases, you can even understand what drove them to commit their crimes. That doesn't change that the law prescribes for them to be executed. Where exactly does 'hate' function in this or are you incapable of talking about something without your emotions boiling over?  EDIT: I just remembered we actually spoke before. You can't tell consenting adults what they can do behind closed doors. Also based on that mentality I'm sure Islam fits you like a glove.   Are you okay with incestuous relationships? polygamous ones? necrophiliac ones? You can get consent in all of those cases (pre-mortem in the last case - assuming consent is even needed for engaging with something non-living). Where do you draw the lines with your vastly superior moral compass?   In Islam, it's acting on the impulse that's prohibited. Repressing a prohibited urge is considered a good deed. For instance, if a klepto walks into a store and walks out without stealing anything, that's a good deed in Islam.    I'm not entirely sure the point you're making here. Are you suggesting killing someone for acting on their desire is acceptable?   The Shari' punishment for *Muslims* being caught having certain acts is capital punishment. These punishments are at the discretion of the ruler, and have historically rarely been applied. They're also rules that apply to Muslims - non-Muslims have their own laws under the Islamic governance framework (when Muslims occupied Zoroastrian territories, they didn't prohibit tithing Zoroastrian communities from engaging in incest in spite of their abhorrence of it).  As far as this particular issue, if somebody goes to a Shari court and confesses that they had male homosexual sex, and they are found as being mentally sane and honest, capital punishment is applied. This is the same as when people confess to adulterous relations while married (capital punishment is applied). Likewise, if they are caught by four reliable witnesses (so basically they were having sex in public), the punishment is the same.  If someone chooses to act on their desire, isn't it between that person and God?  No. Some things are between you and God since the law doesn't prescribe punishments for them (i.e. breaking your fast, not praying, etc.). Other acts on desires (extra-marital affairs, theft, murder, bestiality, necrophilia,  etc.) which do have punishments 'on the books' for them - would under an Islamic state have those punishments carried out.   Sadly, as with every other situation, the outcome is a forgone conclusion. It will be interesting to see how japanese average people react when all is said and done.   Not necessarily. Many countries pay off hostage takers, especially for valuable hostages, through back-door channels.   I was wondering what the view of abortion was in Islam; whether its interpreted differently by scholars or is covered under the Q'ranic view that one should not kill others who have not provided reason to kill them.  You might be surprised to find that several of the early church fathers didn't share the modern Christian take on abortion being outright "murder" in all cases. Like with Islam, there were discussions on when ensoulment occurs (before which a fetus is not a human anymore than sperm are humans).  After the ensoulment period, Islam doesn't *generally* allow for abortion.   Imagine suffering for a year and losing your closest friends and family members. Along comes a group that takes revenge on your behalf and empowers you to defend your community. That's the perspective of a plenty of people in some of these towns. In one town, daish brought out Syrian soldiers and the community beat the soldiers to death. Daish didn't even have to do anything.  Do you remember what US troops did to Fallujah after American corpses were desecrated several years ago? They sent out letters telling families to leave (while making it exceptionally difficult to leave) and then effectively bombed parts of the city into nothing, with more than just your conventional weapons.  When you live in a bubble and haven't experienced what these people have experienced - it's hard to contextualize their actions objectively. For the record - I'm not justifying this sort of thing by Daish or by the US occupation, just pointing out 'how'/'why' people do these things.   Plenty - but on the flip, conversion rates spike after incidents like this. Most people are just angry - but plenty are more confused than they are angry. Many of these people want to understand the greater picture, and the context, and in turn - several end up becoming Muslim. It's a recurring theme in the West. And this sub plays a quantifiable role (if we take professions of faith on here seriously) in that direction.   Also. Couldnt they just get a sharper knife? Use a guillotine?  The knife is sharp. They are dead with the first blow, the second one / third ones are to guarantee it (in case you didn't watch the clip)   inna lillahi wa inna illayhi rajioon   The Qur'an was talking about epistemological ideas that were not explicitly developed until the Enlightenment over a thousand years before it.  Stuff like this, and many other reasons.   I'm only 21 so I don't think of death as always near  I've seen people die younger than 21.   So, the age of earth is 1/3 of the age of the universe.  You can't necessarily draw that conclusion. We don't know where overlaps take place or if each yawm is of the same length of time.   It's at the least compatible with modern theory afaik. The Qur'an explicitly states that the Earth and "the heavens" were once a part of a single unit:  Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?   As for the Earth itself, its arrival at the present state took place in sittati ayyamin (6 periods) similar to the Bible I believe.   Indra Varuna is a shit head, but its not like he's wrong here.

There are certain classes of people free speech does not allow criticism of, nor does Charlie Hebdo.

Hey guys - look over there, they're worse than us, stop trying to imrpove us, look over there - see!!!   Zionist pig is a term that can only be applied to jews, which is an ethnicity.  You can be a Zionist without being Jewish...in fact, plenty of white Christians in the US who aren't part of the tribe in any way self-identify as Zionist....   Does everyone in this sub hate jews?  Because pointing out a fact as OP does is anti-semitism /s  OP is certainly a racist sack for sure, but it's pretty desperate on your part to lump a criticism of media's dubbing this group as some sort of champions of free speech as "hating Jews"...   No. It's not racist. As a matter of fact they are very anti-racist.  You must be retarded or American. Have you ever opened a copy? It's a racist rag...it kinda always has been...   It doesn't matter that Islam isn't a race. You can have a racist agenda and attack an abstraction (like religion) that particular races tend to affiliate with. This really shouldn't be a difficult concept to grasp...   This will probably sound like a good point to people in America - but anybody in France can tell you that the CH staff are bigots...CH was quite literally a racist rag...its when somebody was openly bigotted of Jews - (and not in a general way by lumping criticism of Judaism with other religions - with CH has done in the past, or criticism of Israel minimized by criticism of Palestinians - which CH has also done) - that CH had an issue.  It's like the Chef guy from South Park years ago. Had no trouble attacking anyone. But the moment South Park attacked Scientology - he was offended and quit.  And that's absolutely fine under the guise of free speech, you can attack many groups and hold a special position for a certain group. You have that right under this general abstract concept. It's the fact that their rag, because of the circumstances, is being championed for being champions of free speech, when really they're a fringe publication that makes use of free speech to attack (generally) disaffected minority populations.   I don't like to link to DailyStormer but responding to someone by attacking them versus the content of their message is pathetic, deflective and childish as fuck.   I can imagine the number of random texts I'd get from dudes. That red volkswagon beattle can be deceptive.   Pfftt... a civilized and understanding way of approaching the issue? Fuck that - MURICA   It will be the best troll of 2015 - and it's still just January.   http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-aQlYTMDODws/UzhjKXKj-9I/AAAAAAAAGdg/2nspf30VitQ/s1600/4+Assad+Lawrence+Hadi+Shalhoub.jpg     When it comes to issues related to Islam, Muslims or Arab terrorists, sources like Breitbart/daily mail and other trash rags often make it to the top spot in /r/worldnews. It's rather depressing really - especially since I've seen the speech and the mayor quite literally *did not* say "fuck off" - these guys can't print shit without exaggeration or respinning.   Yep - the internet empowers global calamities to instantly become local. Anecdotal issues become the objective recurrent reality in many people's minds.   Only steers and queers come from Texas - more power to you as an out-of-the-closet Moslem. There needs to be more.   Clearly English comprehension isn't stressed on in Texas though.   Half of our country relies on Fox News to be informed citizens that take part in elections.   We have sky news, which isn't a million miles away. But we also have the daily mail, which is pretty much fox news in paper form.  I guess the difference is that Daily Mail is generally considered a tabloid rag - a huge chunk of people in the US literally use Fox News and other such outlets as their primary source of information.   Either that or the dog is just legitimately stupid.   I don't think that's what he was attempting a "they got what was coming" esque justification - but I can see why JPost and some others would want to reframe the discussion in that way. Every time somebody attempts to explain context to a situation, rather than just telling us to be angry and mentioning how horrific it was, we get in a tizzy.   What bias are they depicting? From the announcement email, they're simply asking staffers to dig at the root causes of these issues (if you read the announcement in full and not the re-contextualized excerpts highlighted in the article) - if anything, that's exactly what you want out of a news outlet providing you with a basis to make informed judgements vs 'OMG the Durka Durkas are killing us for cartoons - Muh Freedoms!'   I have no gold to give sir - have a shekl   Our mosques are segerated. My halal butcher is in Bellerose, Queens and serves me last even if I arrive first. The closest mosque to me refers to me as "abeed." If I go to Friday prayer at the mosque near me, people don't pray next to me and they switch into their language when talking around me.   And you're 100% sure this is because of your skin color? It couldn't possibly have anything whatsoever to do with the values you espouse? Which you vocalized at least on Reddit - and I'm sure you've vocalized at these different places? Not to dismiss your experience - I just want to know if it isn't conflation and re-contextualization..  I've been to mainstream mosques in 4 states and 3 countries, and never once experienced anything like what you're talking about. Maybe NYC is just a cess pool...    Many black Muslims first found Islam through the NOI so Farrakhan deserves a bit of thanks for just getting islam out there.  Plenty of people in the US found Islam 'because of' 9/11. Good things can often come from bad things, you don't go around praising/thanking the orchestrator of something that isn't good.    NOI is not black supremacist actually. They view all Afro-Asiatic people as the same.  So it's an Afro-Asiatic supremacist organization disguised as a religion.   17 isn't pedophilia.  In UK, underage laws are at 16...   I don't know about /r/worldnews, but that is quite literally the exact response I've gotten from someone. When somebody on the fringe does something 'bad', he's a true representative of the religion. When somebody does something 'good', he represents only himself and is one of the rare handful of 'good' people that believe in Islam:  Be better at bullshitting. Look, I am the most consistently anti-Islamic poster in this sub by a longshot, and yet even I am happy to acknowledge Muslims whose conduct warrants praise. The "fringe elements" are, in fact, representative of Islam generally. But, even as toxic as the religion generally may be, its sheer size means that there have always been and will always been individuals who self-identify as Muslims who are still excellent people. The man in question is one such example. So I am happy to praise him, but with the understanding that he is a credit to himself, not some typical representative of his religion. But by all means, keep straw manning the position of those of us who are critical of Islam.   Charlie Hebdo weren't killing in the name of freedom of speech.. They weren't violent..   But they *were* an extremist fringe. Nobody said they were violent, but their vitriol wasn't representative of French thought as a generality or as a majority. The same applies to the men who killed them. The comment by the AJ staff member isn't about violence, but the values espoused by the two groups.   Oh no -- something that shatters the view of Muslims as a monolith characterized by the fringe elements of the group.   You didn't get it because you were the butt of the joke.    I was laughing hard throughout but find it hard to imagine people got the references through out it.  He was having a go at another comedian ;)   I'm actually not a bigot. But I've learned how to reap the benefits of the bigotted karma train on reddit. Say something objectively true in a coherent manner followed by a disgusting bigoted comment in the guise of rational analysis - and notice how the obvious bigotry won't even be registered by most people. It won't be registered because most of the people reading and upvoting the absurdity I posted are imbeciles of r/worldnews and view groups they classify as the 'other' as monolithic entities.   has claimed them too,  No - 2 individuals (Cohen and somebody else) have claimed that those groups have claimed them, in contradicting narratives. The story grows more implausible.   It's okay - it happened years ago and it's not the same thing as killing a bunch of bigoted cartoonists so it won't get the world riled up. /s   Not only that. It might also never have happened. There is literally no follow-up to be found on the internet that supports that this story is true.  In your exhaustive 0 minutes of research you were unable to find any corroboration and therefore the story should be just dismissed. Alrighty. I was alive when that happened - I remember hearing about it when it happened and it was covered extensively - nice minimization and dismissal of other people's suffering though.  How about actually looking into stuff before making bullshit speculations?   Most of this sub is that sub-set of Sunnis that use Reddit. Make of it what you will.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iH-ko7PRMEk   So...chemo?   http://www.sportsmallgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/legday.jpg   Rule 30.   Maybe they'll start blowing each other up for a change.  For a change? In Syria, rebel groups fight each other more than they fight the Syrian government that they originally set out to depose. And even as a general rule, the victims of these terrorist groups are by large majority, other Muslims.   My question is why is it even offensive to make fun of your religion.  Go around Comptom in klan gear yelling "Niggers are monkies", and then when you're getting your ass beat, explain that it meant nothing to you and you were just having a laugh.  Islam is something that a lot of people identify with, it's something they associate with their families, their ancestors, their friends, and themselves. You can't expect to make fun of something - that is the most important something for many people - and expect a handful of them to be a little less willing to play by the rules of their country. Especially in a place like France where most of these Muslims are a marginalized minority growing up in the ghetto.  On top of that I don't imagine all powerful God needs you to defend his honor.  God doesn't need anything from you in Islam. You don't pray because praying keeps God alive, you pray for yourself.  I don't think these criminals were thinking "well in God's moment of weakness, I'll go defend him". You're coming from a very transactional, need/desire fulfillment based culture I imagine so you're conflating it with mindset of people like this, but that sort of recontextualization won't help you understand what happened imo.   They knew they were being provocative and have faced threats in the past, I'm quite frankly a bit surprised that everyone is so surprised about it. And I don't understand how they didn't have stronger security precautions in place.  Right? If you're going to make a living on the overtly bigoted notions of a small percentage of the national population - you've got to have at some point considered that your exercise of free speech might not be well received everywhere. Imagine somebody walking through a ghetto in the states in full klan gear yelling 'niggers are stupid'. Free speech and all, but you know what you're doing isn't gonna get you kisses and hugs.  That doesn't make what those guys did right, but everyone that exercises speech that is inflammatory makes a calculated risk. And the same people crying foul about this horrendous incident were nowhere to be seen when George Galloway was getting assaulted by a Jewish guy, or when European revisionist historians were being interred as state policy in many places.   Well the ritual was annual for the Maya - I'm sure you can find sources on that. And I don't think they sacrificed entire villages at a time, but no, I can't back up the '1' figure that I posed with a 'like' and '?' to suggest I'm not making an overt claim since I don't honestly know.   Why else would he just run into them like that?  If he was one of the hostages.   Yea - that whole "the hostages died before we came in" isn't seeming super believable.

Dunno if it's a sin, but questioning aspects [of the holocaust narrative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_against_Holocaust_denial) is certainly illegal in plenty of countries. Including in France.   Forget hate speech against Jews, how many of these same "Western liberals" raised an outcry over the consistent imprisonment of revisionist **historians**. Not bigoted cartoonists - historians. How many of these same "Western liberals" came to the defense of MP George Galloway when he was physically assaulted for his freedom of expression?  How many of these same "Western liberals" are defending the hate preacher Abu Hamza al Misri that just got sentenced on trumped up charges today - charges we know are trumped up given that our government has a policy of torturing terror suspects in custody (now undeniable) and UK was unable to even bring the same case to court with the same evidence for the last 10+ years - because they knew they didn't have a case. Raid after raid, arrest after arrest, they found they couldn't build the case. As soon as the chap gets extradited to the good ol' US of A - suddenly there's a bullet-proof case against him justifying perpetual imprisonment in effectively solitary confinement.   They sacrificed - what - like 1 kid a year? How many kids die on average each day for the freedom and democracy abstraction?   the fuck is silktricky.com   You think people move to "the West" for the freedom?  This. My ancestors moved because they were bound by chains and told they had to pick cotton and live in American style perpetual slavery - because we were the unlucky descendents of Cain that happened to get caught.   The whole idealogy of Hinduism is based on non-violence.  The central Hindu texts like the Gita are warrior epics dealing directly with the justification of war...  The post-Gandhi popularizations are no more Hindu than the myriads of religious tradition throughout the sub-continent...

It's not about it being popular, it's about ensuring that your opponents make their political dialogue anti-Islamic. That rhetoric will guarantee your Muslim base even if they disagree with you politically or on topics like this.  As far as people having open support for this in some cultures, its not hard to imagine - people kill each other over politics, momma jokes, and other 'petty shit' all the time.   Out of the woodwork? This is a prominent individual in India, and he's cleverly manipulating the discourse to benefit from polling - nobody's crawling out of any woodwork, it's a well calculated political move.   Those Muslims are just doing exactly what they are supposed to do. Kill White men and fuck White women (notice the girlfriend of one of the attackers is White). How else do you think they will destroy Europe? Growing up in what is now a Muslim area, we were attacked all the time by Muslims and Blacks in order to isolate us and get White women (who they treat like whores). When Muslims go to a club where there are lots of pretty White women, they will start fights in order to make the White men leave so they can prey on the White women. It is Sexual Jihad. It works very well and many societies have been conquered and destroyed using this as well as other techniques. Countries which were Buddhist, Christian, Pagan or Hindu before are now majority Muslim because of these techniques.  It worked in my home. Eventually, we had to leave my neighborhood.

There were Jews in the gestapo...your criticism of their use of the term isn't very well-reasoned.   He didn't say "just"....   Absolutely, police are always re-educating those silly serfs trying to go 10 over the limit and parking a few minutes over their metered time.

So the bukket is a grower not a shower - very impressed never-the-less   I would share with a neighbor--Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Athiest, or alien--without a second thought about it, simply because watching someone else suffer would cause me suffering. We are all HUMAN.  What if he wasn't suffering (as the individual in the OP)? What if he appeared to live more lavishly than you even and seemed like a complete asshole. Does simple innate humanism drive you to go share your meal with him then? Or does being 'HUMAN' generate envy, possibly dislike, in that particular case?  Empathy doesn't drive you to do acts of kindness, it only allows to you notice when somebody is in a state that you wouldn't like to be in and you are naturally moved to move them from that state. And even that only if you *happen to* to observe an individual distressed with your own eyes (or hear about it). What OP is suggesting is an unprovoked kindness, one that isn't driven by simple empathy...   I wonder if he thinks it's equally absurd to believe that the universe and everything in it was created for us alone by a being who we cannot hear, see, touch, taste, or smell  Is it as absurd as the idea of multiverses that by definition exist such that we cannot hear, see, touch, taste or smell them?     Livin the American dream   Ahhhhh... thank you kind sir - have an upvote - I've been googling for about 20 minutes and racking my brain - leave no joke unturned as they say.   Hey there  I don't know what exactly you're looking for, but here's a Google search of a pretty useful English Academic Islamic website on the topic of Moses  https://www.google.com/search?q=moses btnG=Search domains=www.islamic-awareness.org sitesearch=www.islamic-awareness.org  As far as the Biblical and Islamic accounts, they aren't exactly identical - and the Islamic account is nowhere near as detailed with specifics. The Qur'an has a very limited focus on stories and the idea is that the past stories included in the Qur'an were mentioned because of direct benefit to be drawn from them. So coming from a Christian background, when you read an exclusively Islamic account of - say Moses - it'll feel like a Sparknotes version. Islamic texts neither confirm, nor deny, many aspects of these older stories - or the talmudic/church interpretations of them.  If you look up tafseer (interpretation) of Qur'an, you'll note that scholars will often use what Muslims call 'Israeliyyat' (stories of the Tribe of Israel) that Muslims inherited from Christians and Jews to supplement the information explicitly found in Muslim sources (Qur'an and hadith). And the Muslim treatment of these stories is:  (a) if a detail is confirmed in the Qur'an/Ahadith, then the preceding detail is accepted as true. (b) if the detail is contradicted by Qur'an/Ahadith, then the Islamic narrative trumps preceding narrative. (c) if the detail has no testimony whatsoever in Qur'an/Ahadith, then the Muslim stance is neither to accept nor reject it's veracity.  This might be especially useful to you however since Israeliyyat aren't necessarily just what you find in tanakh or even mishnah, or presently existing non-canonical texts. In this sense, the Muslim scholars retained some pieces of information that aren't presently available anywhere else. So if you have access to a library with a volume of an English translation of tarikh at-Tabari (History [of the World] by al-Tabari), then you'll have an even greater volume of information on Moses stories that were known as late as about 800 AD (but the veracity of which can't be established without further research of course).  All that said - the story of Moses is actually pretty big in the Qur'an - I think Moses is actually mentioned by name more times than Muhammad himself in fact. Different details about Moses are found in different parts of the Qur'an since it isn't a book in the traditional sense, but a good place to start is [Surah 28](http://quran.com/28). If you want to get more in depth, an abridged translation of Tafsir ibn Kathir (an interpretation by Ibn Kathir) can be found [here](http://www.qtafsir.com/index.php?option=com_content task=category id=99 Itemid=84).  Hope you find what you're looking for - best of luck!   I was just explaining the theological reasoning behind why the word 'revert' is used by Muslims. It's a presumption based on Islamic theology - all created souls are created cognizant of their creator (even before you acquire self-awareness as a child a few years later).  By comparison - you have Christians who baptize children before any reasonable consent is physically possible. To these groups, the child is 'Christian' before he can say 'Christ'. The only differences are that Islam forgoes baptism and considers all children as being born Muslim, and the concept of original sin never actually comes into play in Islam since children are inherently sinless in the religion.   Allahu Akbar = God is Great. Takbir is what you say to ellict that (the word to describe the saying).  I imagine you want to throw together a micro-brew and market it through controversy. As far as calling your drink "Takbeer" - you won't get far imo.   Explicit tahreem of cannibalism is not in the Qur'an either. Hell, you won't even find a saheeh hadith prohibiting cannibalism. The Qur'an only has give or take 500 legal verses, with repetition - and the law is a lot more expansive than that. Just 2 cents.   In Islam, its considered reversion because in Islam the natural state of a human being is that of a sinless Muslim. So for Muslims, Churchill, like all people, was born a Muslim but was taught something outside of his nature by his family, etc.   ...and I really don't understand how the place stays in business.

Not agreeing w/ random dude on the internet, but random anonymous dudes on the internet will be more honest than any dude in real life. No expectations or fear of consequence for what you say anonymously and all.   Why's the dinner on your sister's arm though?   I've consulted someone who has spent all their college years specializing in the Arabic language and it seems that, according to them, the word for interest would be "faedah" vs "Reba" or "Banhith" (usury).   Faedah simply means benefit in Arabic. Riba literally means 'increase' in Arabic. It's not a direct translation to usury so even the post-Henry definition of usury that negates smaller interest isn't applicable to the literal definition of the word.  The definition of a religious term also isn't simply by linguistics (which is sufficient here imo) but by how the term was defined in tradition. I can put together a small book with the number of traditions on rib'a. In context of all of those, every money earned on money lending is riba - no distinction is clearly made between small and large amounts. To be specific, there are traditions which explicitly discourage even accepting paltry gifts - even 'a rope of straw' - from people when they repay your principle due.  In particular, if you look at the history of the cancellation of riba, the Prophet instructed his followers to pay back their principle and not pay a dime of the riba (that was owed to the money lenders). If the intention was that small amounts of riba were okay, than he wouldn't have allowed his followers to forego paying *anything* over the principle to the creditors of ta'if and elsewhere.  Citing commerce as a normal means of making money, including charging "reasonable" interest rates on loans, etc.  That's not the obvious reading of the ayah and I've never heard of any mufassir of repute suggesting what you're implying here. The people who used to take usury said "this is just business" (like non-usurious business). It's not suggesting that business/commerce is loans - the usury takers compared it to investments/risks associated with trade.   General consensus among Shia scholars is that tattoos are allowed. Many believe that to be a weak hadith.  There is ijma amongst Usooli Ithna Ashari's on tatoos?? Do you have any actual proof?   People are not hermaphrodites, they are intersex. I hate this bigoted sub sometimes.  Out of curiosity - how is that bigoted? Is hermaphrodite not an accepted term anymore?   The ruling for hermaphrodites was classically that they don't marry either gender (and we've had surgery available to hermaphrodites since ancient times). You'd want to reach out to a scholar, but I'd imagine that given the rule for hermaphrodites doesn't change in spite of surgery - the ruling of a transgendered person also would be similar.    Correction they do remove something. But you are still rude for trying to validate "what a real woman is". There are plenty of people who are legally a woman but we're not born with a uterus or ovaries. Or what about women who have to have them removed due to various medical reasons? Are they not "real women" anymore.  The point would've been that there are 'real women' - in that there people who are naturally born with female genitals and aren't hermaphrodites. One day - they might have an accident and some parts of their body may have to be removed - this doesn't change that they were naturally born women. Because they are 'real women', the rules and suggestions associated with women still apply to them (in general) and only rules specifically related to their (now missing) parts become void.   For instance, would you be just as offended if I said that a child born without legs isn't a real biped? Humans - in general - are. But by definition, he isn't. Even if he later has surgery and receives working mechanical legs. He doesn't become a 'real biped' or naturally born a 'biped'. The reason this is important from the Islamic perspective is that - as with gender - some rules and suggestions apply to people based on their physical attributes. Somebody born without legs isn't required to do things like wash their feet during wudhu for their prayers. Let's suppose they have new mechanical limbs - the rule for them doesn't change all of a sudden.  So it is a technical issue and I highly doubt the intent was to offend.  That's neither here nor there - rules in Islam are secondary to the main point of Islam: tawheed (accepting the Oneness of God). Everything else, like following rules even if they are seemingly inconvenient for you, is just a physical manifestation of accepting what God is and what our roles are.  Either way I may some day have female private parts and identify as a woman. *edit still not sure if I will have Srs. It's a big decision regardless of morality.  I don't know you - and I have no idea what you're going through so I am not really in a place to say what you should and should not do. As you know though, going through with what you're considering is an irreversible change. And as someone who cares - regardless of your religious persuasion or decision regarding this issue, I would encourage reading *everything* you possibly can on the issue from all sides - moreso what medical professionals say on the topic through study than what some politically motivated organizations might say.  One of the foremost medical institutions in our country (Johns Hopkins) stopped using surgery as a treatment for GID. And in spite of the direction that political correctness is taking us, [full length studies](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0016885) suggest that this treatment isn't working. To TL;DR some of the most problematic study findings:  (a) An incidence of suicide 20x that of the naturally organed population - suggesting that our solution of surgery is not working to treat GID.  (b) A finding that the majority of people who underwent surgery (of a sample) still had psycho-social adjusments that had not improved (from pre-surgery) - again, suggests that our solution is not working.  (c) Another study on non-trans people who felt they were naturally incorrectly assigned a gender - that 80% spontaneously lost this sense of improper identity over the course of time.  But regardless of what decision you make, just make sure its well-thought out and researched. Wishing you the best.   What you're missing is that most cases in the gay population are among blacks. So they end up stigmatizing all gay men because they wouldn't dare single out blacks in the same manner.   Source?    There are also gay blacks so how does that get counted?  Well inmates can't really donate blood anyways.   I don't know a wife per say, but I know plenty of people openly in non-monogomous relationships where I live.   Quran arabic corpus also translates Ribaa as usury, and usury is charging 'excessive' interest.   That's the post-King Henry-ish defintion of usury for English-people. You won't have a one-to-one translation of all Arabic words to their similar English ones. Ribaa means 'interest' - full stop - not just 'excessive interest' and the proof is in the traditions dealing with it.  Imagine if we started saying that the prohibition on pre-marital sex, and alcohol is just on doing it too much? What's left of the religious prohibitions at that point?   That's what I was thinking.

That said - it was something OP would've done before Islam.   That's a literal instruction about literal things - even if the expression "one of its wings" isn't literal. If a fly falls in your drink, you're suppose to dunk it. Have you ever thought about why flies are able to do just fine even though they land in feces and what-not all the time? They have anti-bacterial agents that counteract the 'poisons' their bodies pick up. You dunk the fly in the drink a few times and now in addition to the poisons it added by landing in your drink, it gave you the antibacterial agents from within and without it.

The tradition you're comparing to this about Hell's effects on weathers (or fevers) has nothing in common with it. The tradition you opened this thread with is talking about something that isn't known to exist in our universe (Hell) having an effect on something in our universe. That isn't testable. That's the same as saying the angel Izrael takes life vs saying cancer/car accident takes your life. Not testable, not empirical - and neither tradition contradicts our empirical knowledge because its not a statement about an interaction between two things that exist **here**.  If you had a tradition of the Prophet saying that a certain crater on Mars is the reason we have extreme heat and wind, you can test that. It's a statement about something **in this universe** having an effect on something else **in this universe**. It would necessarily be empirically observable and if it wasn't, we'd have an issue.   You have an institution which keeps telling us "there are bad apples, but our cops in general are good." Yet it explicitly chooses *not to purge itself*. It has a culture of discrimination that is demonstrably not anecdotal. And you have unions that protect and legitimize bad behavior by protecting the supposedly "rare" "handful" of "bad cops". Its intimate relationship with the judicial branch specifically allows wanton abuse.  http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/414/right-to-remain-silent?act=2#play http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mcu27/occupy_wall_streeet_in_nyc_is_being_raided_by_the/ http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/ky2bl/heres_an_interesting_fact_there_were_600_people/ http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/rd76t/why_has_the_news_focused_on_trayvon_martin_while/  I'm sorry - the good cop / bad cop narrative just isn't going to fly if as an organization, the NYPD (like many other departments) does literally nothing to single out and remove the bad apples from the orchard.

When you say fulan died, we say Izrael took his soul (i.e. why he died). That doesn't diminish from the empirical reason why he died (cancer, car accident, etc.) - I don't see why this hadith is problematic w/ respect to the empirical causes of extreme heat/cold.  How is it explained?  The same way ahadith about fever being from Hell are explained. [Extreme heat and extreme cold in the world are a taste of the punishment you (could) get in the afterlife.](http://audio-islam.com/2012/07/07/the-heat-of-the-summer-is-a-reminder-of-the-hellfire-shaikh-abdur-razzaq-ibn-abdul-muhsin-al-abbaad-mp3-areng/)  	140
 Don't apartments usually offer a parking space that's included in the rent?   and learn Japanese as well!   Yeah I was wondering the same thing here, guess the magic of Hollywood is at work again!   umm here in Australia you pump your own fuel into a car.   I would actually love if Louis CK was in the actual movie as an android. No one would suspect him.    [Chris Harris driving the Hammer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MzqNn8kJqQ)    With Inception the entire opening drools with bond-esque moments. From Leo wearing a tux and holding a silenced pistol to the entire set piece itself.    Ah yes Denise Richards playing the most convincing nuclear physicist.    It's better that FOX focus on the Prometheus sequel and then once it is done they should take a look at a potential Alien 5. At least that way whatever we learn about the xenos in Prometheus 2 is carried over without any real continuity errors.    I love this, very Blade Runner-esque.   [Deux Ex Universe is NOT an MMO](http://au.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/deus-ex-universe-is-not-an-mmo)   I think this will really be the full vision of a DX game they hoped to achieve with DX:HR but because of budget and time constraints they couldn't do it. However the sheer fact that DX:HR is still an awesome game with quite a bit of content cut shows off how amazing a fully realised vision would be from Eidos Montreal.       Hard to say, you are condensing a 10 hour game experience into a 2 hour movie (maybe 2.5hrs max). I'm a huge fan of the series however I think it would be pretty difficult to work into a film purely because of how the story is written around the game. Not to mention the odd characters that pop up in the film which would confuse the fuck out of focus testers and the studio. I think the best way to do it is to write the film around the story and not the game if you get what I mean.    Superb work mate! This looks extremely professional and could fool a lot of people haha. Do you work in animation/vfx etc?      Curious as to why everyone hates him?   Not surprised at all. I think EA knows that making it exclusive to PC   Xbox really hurt their sales expectations for the game. I don't think they bet on the PS4 beating Xbox One in sales.    This is going to sound so fucking stupid but after watching Speed Racer, I would love to see a film based on the video game series, Wipeout.   I'm Australian as well but they have pretty much relaxed what food you can bring in since the consumer watchdog had a go at them for banning outsidefood and overcharging for their own food.   I actually really enjoyed the 2010 film with Liam Neeson etc. Was surprised that they haven't made another one, did it bomb in the box office? The chemistry between the main characters was great, seems like a missed opportunity to not make another one in my opinion.    Yeah I heard the same as well, at least we know it will look and sound good. e.g Only God Forgives.    Ah yes, this guy uploads the most beautiful night drives. Grab some headphones, put whatever music you want and just turn the lights off and watch, simply amazing.    Not exactly sure if it's electro/synth, feel free to correct me. Also here is the original, [Non Remixed Version ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKjtqJ-VO38), both are beautiful tunes in my opinion.       Ah yes I am glad I wasn't the only one who got a cyberpunk vibe from the music. The film looks really interesting as well, although I heard it did pretty bad in festivals it will be cool to see what the film is about at least. If anything it will look good and have a killer soundtrack!  EDIT: The [Symmetry Remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2Rk-pLgtYE) is also awesome.    Thanks for the link, such a beautiful track!   Pretty much my experience in Dragon Age: Inquisition. It almost feels too easy.    My absolute favourite is the GITS Stand Alone Complex [Helicopter scene](http://youtu.be/xyDki4KhGhw?t=14s). So fucking good, the music and visuals are perfect.    The [GTA IV Reveal Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M80K51DosFo) also made good use of it.   Well he's actually in pre production on [Hacksaw Ridge](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2119532/?ref_=nm_flmg_dr_1) which he is directing, starring Andrew Garfield.   Yep, from Australia, although all the posters etc in the cinemas said Fast and Furious 6. The same thing happened with Fast 5, was called Fast and Furious 5 on the posters etc and then Fast 5 in the opening credits.    Here's a wiki page on the [Blue Brain Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Brain_Project) which according to the wiki is "an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering the mammalian brain down to the molecular level. The aim of the project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the cole Polytechnique Fdrale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland, is to study the brain's architectural and functional principles."   Fast and Furious 6 was called Furious 6, i'm pretty sure. When I load up my Blu Ray it says Furious 6 in the opening credits.    It's CG, as for the brief scenes of it looking damaged when it lands they probably used kit cars made to look identical to the real thing since destroying 1 of 7 cars only in the world just for a film would be a terrible and stupid thing to do.    So in JP lore was InGen publicly blamed for the events of San Diego in The Lost World? I ask this because in this video it states that Masrani bought InGen and are still using their name. Wouldn't the public be totally suss on that or do they not know that InGen actually created the dinosaurs?   Does anyone here feel that superhero films in the future will feel genre fatigue and start to see less superhero films being released on a yearly schedule? I feel that there are three big video game based films that could have the opportunity to be the equivalent of the the first breakthrough superhero film (e.g Spiderman, X-Men).   1. Assassins Creed (2016) So this is being filmed right now with Ubisoft having very close creative control on the story of the film. This is a pretty huge franchise which has the potential to earn big bucks at the box office, although the franchise has had a bad rep with gamers due to the last release, Assassins Creed Unity which was released in an unfinished state with an unsatisfying story. This one could go hit or miss in my opinion.  2) Warcraft (2016) This is a big one. Duncan Jones directing the Blizzard made franchise. Warcraft is already a huge name because of the online only game, World of Warcraft. It's a billion dollar franchise played by tens of millions of players around the world. The early footage shown to those lucky people at Blizzcon have had people excited, Blizzard have worked very closely with the story for this game so this one could be a massive hit and break the video game stigma.  3) The Last of Us (20XX) This game was personally my game of last generation. It told a beautifully crafted story between a young girl named Ellie and a much older survivor named Joel, set 20 years in the future after a terrible fungal outbreak which causes people to turn into running fungi mutated versions of themselves, making themselves crazy. This is the best game to show off a mature story and extremely well written characters which are both complex and interesting. My personal take is if this is adapted correctly, it could be a serious contender for it to be an award winner.  Edit: spelling   Nice I had heard some of Chrome Sparks stuff before and really dug it :) Liking Phantogram as well, cheers for the suggestions!    Yep I have Zaba on spotifiy, love it! I'll check out Odesza as well :)      Still my favourite [rave video from 97](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOMT3bRJXOo), everyone in the video is just off their tits.    Can cheaper drones get this kind of altitude?   Nice lighting and colour, where was this taken?   I would actually like to see him do that "impossible job" that was mentioned during the film.    So basically guys what features do you think GT7 should have to blow everyone away with the PS4 tech behind it? We have already seen amazing weather and visuals in Driveclub however that runs at 30FPS which is counter to what Polyphony run GT5/6 at. I imagine the cars will probably have a much deeper level of detail, however I hope they drop standard cars all together and run with premiums.    What happened?   What was the reasoning for the disallowing of that goal?   12x18 is perfectly fine mate, no rush :)   Feel the same way! When I get a new TV soon i'll definitely re-buy it in 3D.   Thanks mate, appreciate it! Saves me a lot of money as shipping the prints from Etsy to Australia is $15 on top of the print itself!   Hey do you think you could make a print for the Japan, Australia, Britain and Belgium? I know it seems a lot but if there's an easy way to do it myself I am more than happy to!   Would people here agree that the years for when the writers strike happened would have been pretty bad? 2008 to mid 2009?   Personal favourite is Recognizer by Daft Punk when [Sam Flynn first enters the grid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6V69KaG4a8)   Here you go mate :) [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8OZpmIWcxg), [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WfrHk6xdJMw)   Fucking loved this movie, and loved this scene especially. The music and cinematography are sublime. Was anyone else reminded of Hotline Miami in this scene?    I still haven't been blown away by a car chase like this in any other film. Sure there have been many great car chases since this one but none have managed to be as unique as this one in my opinion. Just such fantastic use of slow-mo as well as cars flipping over. Not to mention they built their own stretch of highway just for this scene.   EDIT: Chase starts here [3:32](http://youtu.be/pHAm-zcXie4?t=3m32s)      Haha yeah, Byron is in NSW. I've should do a drive up there sometime, it looks really scenic.    So was this a right hand drive La Ferrari?    Special Operations, sounds rather mysterious which also makes me wonder why James Bond has never driven a Mclaren?   Judging by the Byron Bay canopy in the top right, I would say the state of NSW in Australia, however I have never seen a NSW plate that looks like this.    but you must not touch    I enjoy Michael Mann's lighting and digital camera use, I look forward to Blackhat even though it hasn't gotten the best feedback.    I find Driveclub pretty relaxing, just go on a time trial with it on fast time lapse and drive a point to point. Not trying to beat a fast time but just driving how you want.    Anyone know if it has fixed the Mantle load times for AMD users?   What does that mean? I can't see their comments?      They probably overhyped it because Gearbox showed off a completely different game...   One can dream, can they not?   Has there been any word on the what regions it will be available? You would hope that Sony would let people around the world watch it instead of it just being on the US store.   The CG has not aged well :/   The BMW FW26 aka [Walrus Nose](http://www.carwallpapers.hu/check.php?im=BMW/WilliamsF1_FW26_A/2004_BMW_WilliamsF1_FW26_A_010.jpg) will alwas have a special place in my heart.    The ones posted on neogaf were posted by me...   Bonus [Bentley in the snow!](http://i.imgur.com/KTbNSkW.jpg)   Thanks mate!   It's a shame the G27 isn't supported :(   Change the shutter speed. If it's /8000 it will make the car appear still. The lower you go the faster it will make the car appear to be moving.    Thanks man :) Glad you liked them!   Making split screen is actually a pretty difficult process. You essentially have to render what's on screen twice and also do a lot of bug checking. So if split-screen were there in DC it would look pretty bad compared to full screen single player. The manpower required to make split-screen is not worth the effort considering how many people actually use it.    I think it's Wild Turkey and coke   You need a usb that's formatted as FAT 32. When you take a screenshot on the PS4 you can just transfer it to your usb by navigating to the "captured video/images section", from there you can view all your games and select which images/video you want to copy to your usb :)      Really? I thought that was a great scene, showed how disassociated these characters had become when it came to females.       Nice you must have gotten a dope as fuck ATAR to be doing undergrad med :) Good luck, my family are all doctors so it's hard work haha   Damn MK looks amazing in 60 fps.    Still upset about Tron Uprising :(   Hadn't heard this tune before this episode but I had a hunch that it was Moby!   Ah this video, was there ever any follow up on why he went apeshit at the end?   Has a different tone to their previous album but I am really loving this song.   What kind of limo do you drive?   If it's 60 FPS with fast load times and all DLC, then yes. I never got to experience ME1 and only played ME3 once without any of the DLC. So yes, if the bugs and other gameplay issues are fixed it would defintely be a buy for me.    You mean Otm Shank right?   When I first saw this film I didn't really enjoy it at all to be honest, but upon the second viewing I actually did end up enjoying it quite a bit. It's not a perfect film but I really love how it's shot and how it portrays the drug game. Plus the music in this movie, well all of Mann's films is amazing.    Yeah to be fair Michael Mann does a lot of research when he is making his films, Heat was the first film I had seen where it used proper gun handling techniques and unaltered sound. The guy goes real deep into getting things as realistic as possible.       He played Azog in The Hobbit iirc   Looks like South Korea will be attempting to do something kind of similar in the future with [8 City](http://travel.cnn.com/korea-8city-tourism-hub-incheon-789461).   He confused the shit out of me with the Fight Club blu ray, it loads the menu for some crappy Drew Barrymore rom com and then it slowly starts to artifact and break down into the fight club menu, pretty cool actually.    Hugh Jackman in prisoners is when he most looks like Joel.    I've only been here a few minutes, what's going on?      What? No!   Seriously if people are still hesitant about watching this show, don't be. This was one of the best episodes of television I have seen in a long time. Especially given that it's a show on CBS, this is not too common. The first 2 seasons may be a bit hard to get into as it is procedural for the most part but once it gets firmly into it's serial nature it will become one of your favourite shows most likely. Easily a must watch.    Tags: shiiiiiiiet, you gay, this ain't what chu want    **LOVE**  the [Matrix Reloaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-URQ4sMzBvA) teaser. I still enjoyed the sequels in their own way compared to the first one and this teaser brought the hype. Not only did you get a glimpse of the second film but at the end the teaser you learn that it will be concluded in a third film to be released the same year.    I would say the years that John Carter and Lone Ranger were released might have hurt them that year.    Damn they missed out on the daughters retarded running style.    Annoying that you have to purchase a new Blu Ray player since I was hoping that my PS4 would be play it. Hopefully the players aren't expensive.   Man I miss these guys, personal favourite of mine [Milkman vs Mailman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTBIHXwSLNE)   One can hope that FO4 isn't cross-gen. I doubt it would be though since memory has been a very large factor in why the games run like shit sometimes.    A more recent pick for me was John Wick, fucking loved the choreography.  	112

 Huckabee appears have confused the 'Militant gay community' with 'Americans who are not intolerant Assholes'.   I must have missed the news. When did the Kansas GOP have a mass lobotomy?    Everything's big in Texas.  Even the stupid.   Once again, Republicans take joy in finding yet another way to punish and humiliate the poor.  I'm not much for religion, but I like to imagine the moment when these GOP Christians present themselves for admission in heaven. Jesus will open his Bible, rub their noses in Matthew 25, and send them on their downward way. Edit:  Grammar   [Twat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twat) is in an excellent insult for these self-congratulatory, divisive, thin-skinned politicians. Vaguely obscene, and insulting to both their manhood and intelligence. I may need to start using for our own dear Scott Walker.   There are a number of ideas floating around, including a couple in the article.  But the issue is that Walker promised his economic policies would create 250,000 jobs in four years and it hasn't happened.  Instead of admitting that the projection might have been off the mark or that no Governor has enough control over an economy to make such a promise, (or even, heaven forbid, admit  that his policies might not give the results he expected) he's always blaming the protesters or the media or Obama or just about anyone else. Accept any responsibility for the lackluster economy in Wisconsin?  That's not the Scott Walker way.   Wisconsin ranked 40th in private sector job growth for the 12 months ending in September, said the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Walker has called hiring in his state the "gold standard" for measuring his performance.  But it must be somebody else's fault. Anybody else's fault.       It's a long term political strategy. [Because you know what educated people tend to do?](http://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2012/nov/05/larry-sabato/education-level-tied-voting-tendencies/)   It's not just this law. It's the whole culture of intolerance and hate that permeates the Republican politic.  If you're skin is dark, if you aren't rich, or if you don't love Jesus just the right way, the Republicans are itching to pass a law to make your life more difficult.   How often does this happen? I hear about this all the time and I've never seen anyone buying luxury items with an EBT card. I've only seen slightly embarrassed people buying everyday groceries.   When the Democrats adopt this issue, they shouldn't make it about the 1%, but about [the .01%](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/chris-rock-inequality-rich-people_n_6248392.html). They probably won't though, [because] (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/01/chris-rock-inequality-rich-people_n_6248392.html)...    Here we have today's most predictable headline.    Ornette Coleman's [Sound Grammar](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMFhCoobptCZLRf_XA_5bM6eUD2ru9GaQ)   His greatest album since the 1950's.   Our current income and wealth distribution are a choice, not some iron economic law.  If voters ever wise up to that, we'll see better wages.  As long as they keep falling for the trickle down-job creators -investment scam, they'll stay poor.    Unfortunately, beating down on the least successful and unfortunate has been good politics for a long time.     But it doesn't keep our little "Scottie" from being an obedient pooch for America's moneyed interests.   Lucian Leape, an adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard Universitys T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told PolitiFact, "I think these data are reliable, and the ACA (Affordable Care Act) deserves credit." Leape, who has been studying preventable hospital deaths since the early 1990s, credited improved data collection and the work of Partnership for Patients, "which has been a serious  and successful  effort to engage hospitals in achieving specific goals, such as reducing infections." **He said its the kind of effort he and others called for a decade and a half ago but "never got before the ACA. Hospitals were improving their safety slowly on their own, and this gave it a big boost.**  But what does he know about correlation and causality?   In other words, hospital deaths in general were already on a downward slope prior to the health care laws passage; its just accelerated since then. The authors of the report that Obama cited also hedged a bit on the causes for the decline, writing that "the precise causes of the decline in patient harm are not fully understood."  Seems to me they addressed that.   Self promotion is a full time job.  Ted can't be distracted by the legislative process.   I would say that "low cost methods of manufacturing fossil fuels from plant/animal waste" is a form of renewable energy.  Replacing coal (which is the real problem) will probably be a multi-pronged solution, a better grid, using natural gas in combination with solar and wind, or maybe a solution we can hardly imagine or think possible.  I don't think the Wright Brothers thought their invention and those barely functional automobiles would replace the train as the main methods of transportation in America within a few generations.   Bernie, run for President already, will you? You're not going to win the nomination (any more than Ted Cruz is going to), but you could sure change the conversation.   Not long ago cellphones were unaffordable for most people, and a computer was something at a university or business that you waited for a turn to use. The communications and computer power we all have now were almost unimaginable just a few decades ago, and at a far lower price that very few anticipated.  I would argue we could effect the same change in energy.  A couple of decades of research and spending could change energy production and distribution completely, the same way communications and computing power have changed. Sticking with the fossil fuels is looking backward, like insisting that an IBM 360 mainframe and a AT T landline will serve all our future needs.    The problem isn't going to fixed by taxing the wealthy, it's going to fixed by changing the economic system. Between [1979-2007 period, after-tax income of households in the top 1 percent of earners grew by 275%, compared to 65% for the next 19 percent, just under 40% for the next 60 percent, 18% for the bottom fifth of households.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States#Post-1970_increase)  I can't imagine that the top 1% started earning 275% more because they've become so much more productive and insightful.  We have a political party wholly in the thrall of the wealthy, and it's serving them very well.   The best way to infuriate Christians is not by ignoring religion, but by suggesting they're not taking following Christ's teaching.  Kasich trolls such Christians pretty well himself ["And I was saying how amusing it is to me that the conservative movementa big chunk of which is faith-basedseems to have never read Matthew 25."](http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/how-arrogant-prickly-smart-john-kasich-would-upend-2016-20150306)    Because she has more balls than any male Republican legislator?   That'll fix everything.  Good thing Florida's legislature is concentrating on the crucial issues.   Only 16 out of 45.  Almost 2/3 voted against.   I would like nothing better than to see Walker go on a military base and tell everyone being an Eagle Scout makes him fully qualified to be their commander in chief.  This guy is either hopelessly deluded or hopelessly cynical.  Possibly both.    But still, whenever I hear talk that the Republicans intend to tackle inequality, I cant help thinking of Deep Throats adage: follow the money.  If you do that, you can readily understand everything the GOP has been doing for last few decades.  Edit: typo      Cutting education spending is key to a prosperous America.    Probably true. If I heard that Cruz been smokin' up with Willie, it would improve my opinion of him.   Vote Republican! You don't want any rights or protections at work, do you?   Obama has his priorities straight.  An antibiotic resistant bacteria could kill a whole lot Americans than ISIS ever will.    I would go with Joan of Arc. That would allow him to fully express his heroic martyrdom.    That's why it's all the more surprising when he does something that makes sense.   Check out the ratings for Ted Cruz at [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/) , [Factcheck.Org](http://www.factcheck.org/2015/03/factchecking-ted-cruz/) or the [Washington Post's Fact Checker] (http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/wp/category/2016-candidates/).  Why does this guy still have any credibility at all?  Except for on the subject of [toilet seats](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/statements/byruling/true/).  He's a real truth teller when the subject is toilet seats.   Ending refundable tax credits and tax subsidies for business?  There are now two things I agree with Bobby Jindal on.  The other being when he said the Republicans needed to stop being "the party of stupid".       ...hoped GOP voters misunderstood  Has pretty much the GOP election strategy for last few decades      [PolitiFact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/allen-west/) has rated 72% of Allen West's statements Mostly False, False, or Pants on Fire.    Perhaps we've underestimated the man.  Maybe he says these things because he has a finely tuned sense of irony and sarcasm.   When you have a [exceptional talent for dishonesty ](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/), it's a shame not to use it.    I hadn't read it. That's hilarious.  Politifact has rated one Ted Cruz statement as wholly true. It was about toilet seats.   "Today the global warming alarmists are the equivalent of the flat-Earthers," Cruz said. "You know it used to be it is accepted scientific wisdom the Earth is flat, and this heretic named Galileo was branded a denier."  This clown can't even get his [basic facts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_affair) straight. Galileo was called a heretic over his heliocentric theory, not over the shape of the earth   Other income indicators also that show Wisconsin is heading in the right direction under Governor Walker, Patrick said Monday ...But UW-Madison economist Laura Dresser said **income growth in the state for decades has been concentrated among the top 1 percent**. She said that would explain the decline in the percentage of families considered middle class by federal standards, even if incomes have risen recently.   That would be exactly what the GOP thinks is the right direction.   Why not? Using the aircraft carrier as a prop worked so well for George W. Bush.   The actual math is this: $108 billion divided by 12 million equals $9,000. ... Aides declined to explain or comment on the inflated cost estimate.  Really, what could they say? "Mr. Sessions stands by his inability to do long division."     Check out Ted's history at [Politifact](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/ted-cruz/).  2% of his statements are rated true. 2%! Even among politicians, this guy manages to stand out with his lack of integrity.   [Gop_hates_God](http://np.reddit.com/user/GOP_Hates_God) has posted a great collection of Bible verses that Republicans never seem to cite.   No, they pick and choose the verses they like.  Kind of like they do with global warming data.   Ted Cruz , proving once again you can drop a load of BS without actually lying.     Seems to me Walker promised his policies would reverse that trend and create 250,000 jobs in 4 years.     I would like to see a billboard with Scott Walker's picture and this Bible quote on it.  Or most other Republican Presidential candidates for that matter.   I prefer to think of us as South Carolina North.   Don't blame Walker!  It's somebody else's fault. Anybody else.   Yeah he is. Anybody who would say this "I was saying how amusing it is to me that the conservative movement  a big chunk of which is faith-based  seems to have never read Matthew 25." is my kind of Christian.   Even a dog finds its ass every once in awhile.  Much better than the old line about a stopped clock is right twice a day.    George Will is like one of those aging Baby Boom rockers. He might have done some interesting work in the 70's , but he's been repeating himself and getting increasingly less interesting for decades.   No, of the potential Republican Presidential candidates, I would prefer Kasich. Though he seems like a long shot.   If you'd prefer polysyllabic words, we could say he's sanctimonious, unmannerly, and solipsistic.  Asshole is just shorthand.     If you did a web search for Senators Hate Ted Cruz on Sunday, that Foreign Policy article wouldnt have even come up on the first Google page. It was supplanted by titles like Why Senate Republicans Hate Ted Cruz, GOP Still Despises Ted Cruz, Everybody Hates Ted Cruz and the generously titled How Unpopular Is Ted Cruz Right Now? Answer: very.  TL DR: Because he's an asshole.   I think most liberals are awake.  It's the working class whites that need to catch on.    I cut an afternoon of high school and saw Buddy Guy (with Junior Wells) in 1973 at a blues festival.  He was great then too. Been a good long run for the man.    If he's telling us he's going to be an extraordinary useful tool for the bankers and billionaires, I'll go along with it.      The charts showing gerrymandering and money in politics are more than a bit sobering.  Not much of a democracy we're living in these days.      Scott Walker's Wisconsin - a high profit, low wage paradise.   However, when you include all taxes,  taxes [are not particularly progressive](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/19/heres-why-the-47-percent-argument-is-an-abuse-of-tax-data/) in the United States.   You look at this budget and you wonder why Republicans are accused  of not having a sense of humor. They obviously know how to tell a good joke.   "You dangle $700 million in front of the Louisiana Legislature now, and it's going to be spent as fast as green grass goes through a goose," the treasurer said  The party of fiscal responsibility in action!   Muhammad Saeed al-Sahhaf is the true intellectual inspiration for America's conservatives.   The Iranians were clearly made aware of the contents of the letter, but the GOP are claiming doesn't count because it wasn't actually sent through the mail?  Seems the Iranians see if [differently](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-iran-nuclear-talks-20150316-story.html)    And check out the article if you want to read a fine example of NRO's hysterical hyperventilation Obama is desperate for a deal with this radical-Islamic, terrorist-sponsoring, IED-detonating regime. And he wants Republicans to shut up about it. If Obama finds this Republican medicine bitter, he should stop pouring his own acrid elixir down their throats.    Lie is such a harsh word. Let's just say it was a [drafting error](http://www.jsonline.com/news/politifact-debunking-scott-walkers-wisconsin-idea-drafting-error-claim-b99440321z1-291066791.html).   Well as long as it's not someone from the present, like Scott Walker. Besides, if Scott Walker becomes President, our future leaders will likely have Chinese names.    Bobby Jindal is angling for a position at Fox News.    If I were Walker, I don't think I'd want people to look too closely at his time in office in Wisconsin.  I can just imagine the attack ads if he's the Republican nominee -  'Scott Walker couldn't find criminal activity in his own office - Now he's telling us he can lead America against terrorists?'   Also no one in Florida is allowed to say Voldemort out loud.   Read the article and tell me if you think these position changes seem like a change of conviction or political convenience.    Once you decide the truth is flexible, everything is easy.      I bet Ted Cruz is pissed.    Somehow I don't think the ALEC approved Wisconsin Supreme Court is going to show a lot of sympathy to this lawsuit.   A politician with guts. Feingold was the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act.   Could you imagine the reaction on Fox News if the Democrats tried this stunt under a Republican President?  Yet now, the outrage seems somewhat muted.   They ought to make it their campaign slogan -  Putting our party's interests ahead of America's security.   The GOP = 35 years of Higher Profits and Lower Taxes for the Wealthy, Lower Wages and Higher Taxes for Everyone else.  Everyone else really needs to wise up.     Perhaps, but if you strip it down to 3 it'll take awhile to crap it back up.    Why not a 3 tiered tax rate?  Almost as simple and would generate more revenue.   And it could be adjusted as economic needs changed.  Not enough investment capital? Drop the rate on the highest tier. Not enough consumer spending.  Lower the rate , or raise the amount of income  taxed, in the lowest tier.   How about we use the same level of proof that we used to justify invading Iraq?     Adults with dependent children can participate in KanCare, but only if they have incomes below 33 percent of the federal poverty level, $7,770 annually for a family of four.  Am I understanding this correctly?  If your family income is $2000 per person, you're not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas?     Just when you think politicians have reached the limit of ludicrous self-promotion, somebody raises the bar.      It would be more surprising if Walker continued funding this program. Renewable energy threatens the interests of his backers.   Specifically you want to thank the [Milwaukee suburbs and rural Wisconsin](http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/wisconsin-2014-fall-election-results-map-281509401.html).    If you're looking for a President who does what the lobbyists want, you can't do better than Scott Walker.      Then I'm sure ALEC is in favor of lowering the wages down for bankers and CEO's ... Wait, or do they mean somebody else's wages?  The American worker really needs to wise up that there's an obscene rakeoff going on at the top. We can't have decent wages and social services while supporting a greedy upper class.   Unsurprising turn of events.  The GOP should adopt a new slogan - 'Vote Republican - You don't want any rights or protections at work anyway.'   Either this is a pretty good prank or you need to check your links.   And now his going to [France](http://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/money/2015/02/26/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-plans-european-trade-mission/24057149/).  Maybe he'll compare handing the union protests to the Charlie Hebdo terrorist attack.   Nobody is better qualified to lead the fight against terror than the guy  who couldn't find [criminal activity](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/walker-scandal-who-got-convicted-why-n35886) in his own office.   I'd call Inhofe an imbecile, but I think he doesn't quite measure up.   Fraudsters gotta fraud.   Sounds like something out of Charles Dickens, doesn't it?   The GOP game is to concentrate wealth at the top.  Why that isn't obvious to everyone, and why the Democrats don't make more of an issue out of it is a continuing mystery to me.    I think everything is working as planned.  Most of the earlier tax cutting was on income taxes, and are being replaced with 'much regretted' consumption taxes and fees, which fall more heavily on lower and middle classes.  I used to believe the good sense of the American people wins out in the end.  Now, I'm beginning to think it's their gullibility.   By all means, let's listen to the man who told us the Iraq war will pay for itself.  Who knows what new inanities he has to tell us?   Republicans being incredibly misleading ... you know, I think I've heard this before.   Yes, it is a bit hyperbolic, and I believe I first read the remark about studies about health, which are particularly polluted with sponsored 'studies'.  But it is also true that industry looks for scientists who are already inclined toward the viewpoint they want. (I'm not saying the scientists themselves are dishonest. I assume they legitimately believe their arguements.) You notice these industries didn't pick a random professor of atmospheric science to study the problem, they funded the one who was likely to say what they wanted to hear. Sponsoring studies with an outcome in mind that would be to your own financial and political advantage far more 'negligent to science' than some skepticism about a study and its funding sources.    No not really.  Studies sponsored by an industry tend to support what the industry wants.  They look to hire researchers that are favorable to their industry, and if the results aren't too their liking, they're not required to publish them.  Obviously, there are studies from independent sources that aren't biased, but generally they aren't sponsored by anyone with an agenda.    Mr. Bush and other presidential hopefuls said the presidents patriotism was not in doubt. But Mr. Walker repeatedly said he did not know. On Saturday, he said he did not know whether Mr. Obama was a Christian.  The Democrats should also play this game.  Some former Presidential candidate should accuse Walker of hypocrisy and dishonesty, and then everyone can say that they don't know if Walker is a hypocritical liar, Make it part of the public discussion.    Want to know what a study says?  Don't bother to read it, just look at who paid for it.     Retired homeowners rarely seem to understand is that the quality of the school district is a big part of what makes up their home's value.  They'll save a few dollars on their tax bills, but might lose it several times over on their home's equity.  	116

All I can remember is getting into a debate with the band about where to sign on a vinyl. Aaron started by saying that you shouldn't sign on the grooves. Geordie signed on the inner circle. When Trent came along, all I could muster up was, "To groove, or not to groove?".   TLDR: I'm lame.   We meet again.                The live version from Still is so good.

 Thanks for your upcoming detailed answers.   So just list the nickname and wait for people to respond. Be sure to let us know when someone gets it right. Have fun!    Feel free to expand it to coaches/ESPN personalities/players' wives/anyone associated with the NFL   You can also tell us his name if you want.  No pressure.   It's fine to add draft qbs.   I want your 'No Guts No Glory' picks for teams you know deep down are not appearing in one of the next 5 Super Bowls.  Sure you can give us your scrub picks of teams that everyone is positive won't make it...  but I want your interesting choices as well and WHY you don't think they will appear in a Super Bowl over the next 5 years.  Have fun and show your work!   Basically the teams that you are very confident will play in a Super Bowl.  You don't have to think they will win.  Just represent their conference in the next five seasons.  Name those teams and tell us why.      Honest question looking for honest answers.   Big Thanks!

 I want to be clear that this isn't an absolute to me.  I don't believe in "I don't believe it, so it can't be true."  That said, it was a combination of two things.  In first grade I was very into Greek and Norse mythology.  People used to believe these over-the-top stories.  Now they believe new ones... it just made sense to me that in the natural progression, people would believe something else someday.  This was in addition to seeing a diagram of the various systems inside the human body.  I saw that it was a machine that was self-sufficient.  The soul was totally unnecessary and had no place in it.  And so at 7 I stopped feeling god was true.  I couldn't undo that feeling.       Oh no.  It freaked me out, because it was indicative of how far he would go to avoid things he didn't want to do, but I made him an appointment with the optometrist.  It was really cute to watch him stare at things for a month after.  I think he'd forgotten what leaves looked like.    If that is something people really believe, they should take a look at the number of African American males drafted during the Vietnam War.  The draft is in no way impartial.    I apologize, I didn't Google the statistic, that was just what I'd heard back in high school.  I'll edit it.    That is actually a great point and something to think about.  I believe that it just hasn't been on anyone's radar.  Apparently in the 1980's a plan was made to have skill-specific drafts for Health Care personnel that would include women, but the plans were never acted upon.  It's interesting, but I think the draft just isn't a priority in light of all the other pressing issues we have at the moment.       but it is a necessary evil to exist.   Source please.  In the context of the United States today, there is no reason whatsoever for the draft to exist.  My views are not "convenient," they are what I believe.  I'm sorry if that doesn't fall in line with the box you're trying to shove me into.     If you're interested in my opinions on specific events in history, please PM me and I'd be happy to discuss.  My opinions on the use and execution of the US draft vary by conflict and aren't relevant to this thread.  Edit: grammar   Is this a serious question?  We haven't used the draft since the Vietnam War... we've participated in 15 military conflicts since then.  Through voluntary enlistment, obviously.    Sorry for double replying, but I had some more things I wanted to talk about here, upon thinking about it.  I think that we don't make the draft a priority because at this point in time, it's a non-issue.  You register, but can you even imagine how the nation would have reacted if they had drafted for the controversial war in Iraq?  It would have been pandemonium.  You have to prioritize here.  You register for the draft, you get a free razor, you'll never be called into action because the times have changed.  My main focus on civil rights actually has nothing to do with feminism.  It's to do with educating the people in my area about assimilation of Native Americans.  I live on the edge of a reservation and the amount of racism is unbelievable.    If you asked me to give my complete agenda as a feminist, it would merely be that I want white men to speak out when they see things that are unfair, even if it is going to be unpopular.  This isn't unique to feminism, but to that casual homophobic remark that is made among friends, or that racist joke someone made that you don't agree with.  Instead of laughing along, I'd like to see white men recognize that they have the responsibility of setting the expectation for what is acceptable and what is not and use that power for good.  This doesn't seem crazy to me.    I like things that are uncommon or unique.  I like it when a guy is wearing a vintage bowling shirt or gas station work shirt with the wrong name on it.  I like guys who recognize baggy corduroy pants are mega comfortable.  I like it when they dress according to what size they actually are, rather than going with XXL at 140 lbs soaking wet.  Just preferences, not deal breakers.  My husband is actually one of those people who wears the same thing everyday just in different color variants.        If I saw a protest against the draft in my area, I would 100% be there.  I posted an article as a response to one of the above questions.  Many mens issues are actually covered under feminism.  My heart breaks for men who have been sexually assaulted and feel they cannot get help.  I find the fact that men are nearly ~~twice~~ four times as likely to commit suicide to also be a very real issue.  Now, I'm not a super active activist.  I work full-time, I have a 8 month old daughter, and I spend 6 hours every weekend volunteering with a hospice, but I do what I can.     You're taking issue with the wrong thing.  There are about 25 good reasons to abolish the draft.  It's a broken system and one we're never going to return to.  On the off chance you actually care about educating yourself on the real issue, here is [this.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/storyline/wp/2014/10/16/america-may-never-have-a-draft-again-but-were-still-punishing-low-income-men-for-not-registering/)   I call it "my downstairs mixer," which I do to amuse myself.  It's a bastardization of the phrase "Downstairs Mix-up" as coined by Old Gregg in the Mighty Boosh.     Probably at the point it came to my attention that he couldn't see clearly even fifteen feet away.  He'd had glasses a decade ago, accidently sat on them, and had such bad anxiety he couldn't bring himself to make an appointment and get them replaced.  I felt totally overwhelmed in that moment.    I'm not sure why you downvoted me.  Clearly you don't actually care about responses, merely about making a statement disguised as a question.    As a feminist, I find the existence of the draft to be unfortunate.  I don't think it should exist at all.    Giving birth. I gave birth 100% naturally, and let me tell you, there are a lot of things your body does to you that makes it not any where near as bad as they tell you. I got a second degree tear pushing, and while I felt the blood from it when my skin broke, I didn't feel any actual pain. Too many endorphins.   Granted, actually getting to the point you can push is pretty awful...    Because what you're talking about is found at /r/unorthodog !  Both my dogs belong there.  ;)   Do yourself a favor and watch "Let me In."  It's time to take a break from that Uncle Buck, Problem Child bullshit you're clearly inundated with.    Try this instead: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2oijc5/girls_of_reddit_when_the_guys_arent_around_what/cmnfnr3?context=3  I should start a "Best of late_night_grumbler" subreddit.    That's very strange... you gel with "I feel so lucky you wanna hug me... what rhymes with hug me?"  That's not very pithy imo.   Really?  I thought that was hilarious!  He said "witch hunt" in the context of Harry Potter.  I'm laughing as I type this!    P.S. I hope you didn't just down-vote me because you didn't get it... You'll prove him right!    I would be very, very careful, and ask in a subreddit that isn't this one, since you're probably just going to get some very dangerous suggestions.  Good luck!    Well, I'm not really sure what you're driving at, but my sister lost 20 lbs. by walking 20,000 steps a day and eating oatmeal with unsweetened applesauce two meals a day.

I have two:  "In my head there's only you now, and this world falls on me.  In this world is real and make believe, but this seems real to me."  "You feel the tugging of the world, so soft and slow, turning you round and round."      This isn't what you're asking, but I've got a good story for you...  I used to work in a call center scheduling appliance repair appointments.  I had scheduled a refrigerator repair for this elderly man.  He went with this gem : Well, Georgie, now that you've taken care of my fridge, you can take care of me with your sexy voice..."  I just about died.     I appreciate your support! :)  It's funny how you can never really predict what will resonate with people.  I woke up that morning to 19 replies and 1000 up votes and it was all because some ex-boyfriend tried to pass this off as fact because he'd heard a politician say it on the news once.  It was such a weird thing to think that I never forgot it.    Excitable Boy by Warren Zevon is pretty dark.  This just comes to mind since I'm listening to the album right now.     This is actually super awkward.  Mine is "Women can't participate in trench warfare because they will die from a yeast infection if they get too dirty."  I'm sure I'd spend A LOT of time explaining that I don't actually believe this and being admonished for public indecency since we shouldn't talk about vaginal infections.    You should absolutely take the quiz on the AKC website, but the King Charles Cavalier Spaniel is the closest thing to a one-size fits all dog.  They are well mannered, quiet, affectionate, easy to train, love children, and only require a bit of exercise.  ~~They suffer from very few medical issues as a breed.~~    Edit: Strikeout, see comment below.   It would be one of those things that would force me into conversations all the time. "Well, that takes care of that."  Uh.. what exactly?    I collect antique buttons, and one of them reads simply "Ask me what happiness is." I have no idea what this means, and I don't wear it because I don't like to talk to strangers.  Ahaha!   Seeking psychiatric help is not as stigmatized as it is for our male counterparts.    In the US, I think it would be assimilation of the native Americans.  This went on for 150 years.  The fact that my mother grew up not five miles away from a reservation but only learned about this from me at age 49 is unconscionable.      I know I already posted, but I wanted to give you some practical advice upon thinking about it.  The classes are all taught by individual professors, the curriculum is determined by that professor.  You may have what looks like a "freshmen level" course on your schedule that is actually a senior level class due to the person teaching it.  You are paying for your transcript.  If at all possible, talk to your upperclassmen before signing up for classes.  Try to get an idea of whether the level is accurate.  You don't want to take a super difficult class in addition to 18 credits and then pay for that bad grade just because some asshole didn't get the memo that this class is supposed to be "freshmen level."    If you really had your heart pinned on that "Just wait until college, everything will be different" spiel they give you all through High School, please be advised there is an awful lot that is just like High School.  Bubble tests and group projects still exist and you'll spend more time reading the opinions of others than you will engaging in your own abstract thought.    AAA doesn't have online payments or paperless billing.  What the hell, AAA?     I can't speak for my generation, only me... however I will say it seems to me that my husband's generation (he's 39) has a taste for irony or "pretend liking."  They're a very sardonic lot.  It strikes me as rather self-conscious and joyless.    It's to connotate that you are incredulous.  It should always be the question mark first.  You're asking a question... with spirit!  Try rewording that sentence to reflect the opposite... it's not possible.  :)     Everything happens for the best.  Uh... What?    How dare I answer an opinion based question with an opinion?   Obviously, however, it misses the point.  Rather like Joelle.  Look, it's Joel or Noel or Elle or Joann, let's not be crazy here.  I'm saying this as a person with a superfluous letter in her 9 character, four syllable name.    Katie is supposed to be a shortened version of Katherine, right?  So what is up with "Kade" and "Katy?"  I'm also not very impressed with how there are about four different ways to spell "Brit-knee..."  I don't really want to have to think this hard to take down a common name.    If that is what you think, you need to try the Reese Stix with coffee... holy smacks, guys, it's life changing.    As a salaried employee who was under a lot of pressure, working the 56 hour weeks while pregnant was very hard.  I didn't feel well, I was over-worked, and I was hormonal.  I spent a lot of time having to close my blinds to my office, ugly cry for ten minutes, then pretend like it never happened.     Sounds good to me! :)   Absolutely, that would be just fine.  I just don't want to have to deal with using a wet brush, it seems unsanitary.  If I could apply wet and have it become dry without having to use a sponge or brush, that would be great.  I really like a chunky pencil eyeshadow too.  Those are very convenient.  A moisturizing stain would be great.  I have a dual one that is a clear balm on the other end, and that works very well. :)   I hate bananas.  Looking at them makes me want to cry.  I hate the smell, I can't touch them.  I don't know if I was raped with a banana at three or what, but goddamn it, I don't want them in my house.  Go away, banana.    Thanks for giving me the chance to complain about this.  I just had the asshole who runs mortgage come in here.  He's super bossy.  Like "Call Steve." Instead of "Can you call Steve?"  He also treats my time like it means nothing, having said he'd come up to see me now and then not showing up for 30 minutes.  We have e-mail for a reason if you're on the phone, man.  But then he has the audacity to run a damn guilt trip on me as he's leaving because I'm not super friendly with him "Hope that wasn't too awful for you...."  It was, thanks.  Get out.     To whoever downvoted me, I hope you realize how ridiculous it is that the John Mayer song is now above Neil Young.  You should be ashamed of yourself.    Highly pigmented eye shadow that doesn't have fall out.  I don't like that my stupid Urban Decay Naked 3 palette is a best selling $54 purchase, but has to be used wet to actually be visible.  I also have to use Vaseline under my eyes to wipe away the fall out using it dry.  Eye liner that starts smudgeable, but becomes permanent, like the 24/7 by Urban Decay.    Lipstains vs. Lipsticks, I've never come across a lipstick that didn't leave my lips flaky the next day.   The Candlelight powder by Too Faced is one of my all-time favorite purchases.  I use that instead of a foundation as I don't have blemishes.    Cortez the Killer - Neil Young   "How to Win Friends and Influence People" - Dale Carnegie   You don't fully appreciate how apathetic people are to you as an individual until someone calls your attention to the glaze-over the minute you quit talking about the person you're talking to.  Thanks Dale for proving once and for all that loneliness is the human condition.     Bitch please, I always know where I want to eat.  If my indecisive husband didn't turn down all my ideas, we'd be in business.  Indecisiveness has nothing to do with gender, it's to do with being weak-willed.    They aren't compensated well.  The average professional musician makes $40k a year.  Try living on that in California.    Helium!  Seriously guys, you should look into Helium as an alternative retirement plan.  It's a finite resource that people use at any celebration.  It's cheap, but will become a luxury!    If "Bat Outta Hell" is your cuppa, you'll love "For Crying Outloud." I mean, there isn't an overblown resurrection scene, but it is completely over the top.  I like to sing BoH to my baby.  This is, at best, irresponsible parenting, and at worst, child abuse.    Right.  I simply can't relate.  Why won't you let me love you?   2deep4me ;)   Look out, guys, I'm going to say something controversial.    When I was a kid, Iowa's state sign read "Iowa, you make me smile!"  They changed it a few years back to "Fields of Opportunity."  It should read "Fields of opportunity for seventh generation Germans."  Ahaha! Seriously though, don't you move to small town Iowa and expect people to accept you. They wave, but they don't actually want you to say "Hello!"    Well, it's been awhile, but I know we never used style guides in high school.  You should just see what happens if you use a comma where you would naturally pause in a sentence as a guideline in your college papers.    Abra.  I try to interact with him, he fails to respond in any way, and then POOF! He's not there.    I'm pragmatic enough to have tried. She is, however, pretty stubborn. If I say that she's gotten really loud, she'll say "I know, it's intentional." Which is totally untrue. The only thing for it is to get really quiet so she has to pipe down to hear me, but try maintaining that level of unnatural manipulation for any period of time.    Bought myself the "expensive" mimosa and ended up getting tunnel-vision drunk on accident.  I still remember my husband saying to me over the late-night supper he bought me to sober me up "What have we done?"   I see what you did there, but I want her to get quieter.  This damn Stonehenge she made me is too small too, but this is the bigger issue. ;)   She gets really loud after about an hour.  She is seriously ignorant of the volume of her voice.  She'll start normal and crank it up to about 11.  After a day with her, I'll have been clenching my teeth so hard I have a splitting headache.  I need a nap after visiting her.    I haven't actually gotten very much parenting advice, but I did have someone give me some when I was 18, and I was touched by the fact that he'd bothered.  My best friend's dad was chopping up some mangoes on a wooden cutting board in the living room.  He said to me, "You can buy fruit, put it on the counter, and watch it rot as your kids walk by it or you can cut it up and serve it with dinner and watch them eat it.  You'll have kids some day, so this is my advice to you.  Take the ten minutes."   Looking for closure in the "Dads who abandoned their families, why/what happened?" thread.    Utilize the seven second rule on the freeway.  In addition to being able to guarantee I have enough time to brake completely instead of rear ending the car in front of me, I'm also not blinding them with my headlights at night.    Yeah, man, seriously no judgment.  I would literally trade away years of my life for a few hours with him as an adult, no matter what kind of person he was.  I still miss him.  I think about him every day.  Just do what you can.  Your son may not appreciate it now, but someday he will.  I promise.      Hey man.  My father died when I was 12 years old from an accidental drug-alcohol interaction.  He was a drug addict, an alcoholic, and he was violent.  I didn't know him.  I have two memories of him.  When I was two, he and my mother were screaming at each other in the living room.  I was sitting on a braided rug pleading with them to "Stop it."  The second was when I was four.  He met me and my little sister at a park for two hours.    I have to second what Kazuke86 is saying here.  If, heaven forbid, anything should happen to you, you have to think about what that will leave your son.  I will never know my dad first hand.  I'll never know if he ever thought about me, if he loved me.  I can only guess.  It would be a huge comfort to me to have even just one little thing to remember him by.  Regardless of the things I've heard, I would still love to have been able to see him in person and to form my own conclusions and build my own memories.  He is half of who I am genetically.  I'm told that I do little things with my hands and my head like he did, but I don't know that.  By the time I was old enough to be able to choose to contact him, he was already dead.  You need to do this.  Please.  Leave him something.     Ours is a pretty amber color!   Well, semi-truck and pickup truck. I can see why it's silly, I guess.   I don't actually have any idea what you're talking about.  Colonel Sanders was a total caricature masterminded by Dave Thomas.  The Colonel would probably have NO PROBLEM with these commercials considering the fact that he willingly turned himself into a parody of a southern gentlemen while he was alive.    This isn't related, but did you know that his daughter was actually married to John Wayne Gacy, the infamous rapist-serial killer?  Beyond that, he managed stores for him at one point and there are photos of him in the leisure suit.   [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Sanders) Other Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Thomas_(businessman)   Well, I can't speak from a lawyer-ly standpoint, but I can tell you that the laws are different from state to state.  Here in Minnesota we are in what is called a "no-fault" divorce state.  It doesn't matter who was worse.  It takes two to tango.  If you don't have a pre-nup, don't expect damages.    So THAT'S where the Canadians got it from!     How's the weather down there?    This is probably too specific, but the stupid change machine in our break room was very loud and every time someone used it some original person would say "Jackpot!" Finally I made this up: "If I had a quarter for every time someone said that, I wouldn't need to use this change machine!"    Right after my Great Grandpa passed away, my Great Grandmother told this one anecdote over and over that took place a few days before he passed.  They knew he was dying from colon cancer, and he'd been sent home to rest.  The family started arriving from out of state to say good bye.  One afternoon he was napping on the couch.  When he woke up, he was surrounded by family members.  He said to my Grandma what she thought was "That was a hell of a week," and she said "The next one will be just like it," and he corrected her "No.  I said that was a hell of a wake."  I didn't get the black humor until I was a grown-up.    My mom used to regularly trot these out:  "Well, you can do whatever you want, but you know how I feel."  "I know you're going to do whatever you want because you think I'm stupid."    I received a speeding ticket.  I got lost approximately 50 miles out of the way on the way home from a poor-person's dentist appointment (meaning it was at night and about 150 miles from my home).   I'd tell them right away.  The last thing I would want is for my employer to think I'm suddenly coming to work hung-over and half asleep.  When I got pregnant, I was a salaried employee who was expected to go above and beyond.  Despite being pregnant, they made me fly cross-country five times in six months.   That they call the part that covers the engine of your car a bonnet.  What is that about?  Way to make a muscle car sound like a walk on in "Little House on the Prairie."    (Yeah, this was tongue in cheek.)   One time I came into the kitchen of the Chinese restaurant I was working in, and there was a decaying deer hung from the ceiling.  Now, I'm not saying that I think they were serving it, I don't.  But I do think they left it in the back of a truck open for a few days because the smell was unlike anything I've ever encountered and I come from a family of hunters.    I only have two dream jobs: Lead singer in a Warren Zevon cover band (I'm a girl and not enough people know who that is), and Namer of Paint Samples (I don't think this is all there is to that job, but I can't find any additional information).   I literally have no idea what was going on in 1030.  Too lazy to Google.  I'd probably be killing a lot of rats?  Covering my hair?  Sticking a copper coin up my hoo-ha so I don't die in child birth? I don't know...     My least favorite is Hannibal.  Not only is it loud-quiet to the extreme, the wine filling up the face is uncannily like watching the logo bounce around on your DVD screensaver... it never finishes (hits the exact corner) no matter how many times you see it.    Feminism is synonymous with misandry.   My old apartment had a HUGE window on one wall. The neighbor would leave the porch light on all night, so I couldn't sleep well as it was bright, and my dogs would bark at things moving in the driveway. I asked my husband to turn it off after an hour (I was very pregnant usually already in bed at the point it was turned on, the dogs would wake me up), but he didn't want to offend the neighbor. One day when the light had been on all night and all of that day, I went out with a broom and very lightly tapped the lightbulb, breaking the filament in it, so it appeared to have burned out from being on all the time. The damn thing was nine feet up, so it wasn't like they were going to change it. Ahahaha!    This isn't HEROIC per say, but a silly thing I did for the purpose of making a delusional person happy.    My high school boyfriend lived out in the middle of nowhere.  This did not stop his mom from being very into Halloween and talking about trick or treaters and preparing for these people she imagined would come to her house.  Now, I was with this kid for years.  The third year came and undeterred by the lack of show the last two years, his mom was ready and pumped about the trick or treaters.  I put a change of clothes behind the bar next to their back sliding glass door.  I dressed up like a boy (wrapped my midsection in a beach towel I held in place with a belt), put on gloves, and a full head mask, snuck around the back to the front door and trick or treated.  She talked about this trick or treater every year after. I never told her the truth.    By the same ticket, I was in total disbelief when I heard about your cream soda being a totally different color and that you sell Tylenol 3 without a prescription.     Would you alert the authorities? Exact vigilante justice? Do something else entirely?    Well, I tried to help you by digging around a bit myself, but what I'm seeing is that people who have trouble being fed aren't being studied.  I found a great article on girls in Ghana feeling pressured by the media to be thin, but it states right in the article that all girls polled are attending school and have regular access to food.  I'm sorry I don't have a good source for you, but it just stands to reason that if you have to go to considerable effort to survive, your appearance and need to exact control would be low on your list of priorities.  Hunter-gatherers have to stay busy.    I don't think this is really what you're driving at, but eating disorders such as bulimia and anorexia are unique to first world countries.  You will not find them in places where food is actually scarce.  It is a disease of convenience (despite being serious).   Useful things you never have when you need them... like a tire pressure gauge.  Or nail clippers.     Probably the lead singer/song writer of a death metal band.  He's going to be very disappointed when he finds out my morbid interests don't translate in any way to my appearance.    I don't do this, but I'm guessing that it's for the same reason they paint their lips black or dye their hair bright green... it pleases them to do so.  They like the way they look.  The assumption that women preen simply to attract partners is very silly.   50 Cent.  He's tough, resilient, business minded, objective, and largely considered to be nowhere near as smart as he actually is.    [No, his autopsy confirmed he DID have a skin disease.](http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/07/showbiz/jackson-death-trial/)    If you really mean my name, it would be "We don't follow her logic either..."  If you mean if I as a person were a brand name it would probably be "Only 3% joking at any time..."  	101
 I laughed way harder than i should have at this lol.   When is ruined king better than blood thirster on Ashe? Is blood thirster always the best choice?    How can you get into challenged 3 if there are already 7 million people in challenger...?  	3
 Matt Kemp is getting ownage on the Dodgers.    Channel 451 on Dish.    How can I watch on direct tv. I can't right now because the Warriors game is blacked out.    It's a good thing the stadium is half empty or else the boos would be deafening.    This was (allegedly) Gucci Mane's response when the judge asked him If he was guilty of assault.    I don't feel too attached to any team other than the giants, but I like underdogs, so I've been pulling for Seattle recently.    162*-0   That makes sense and I do like that new rule. I don't like the clock though.    What is the point of all the time saving measures? Is it to attract new fans? Somehow I don't think people who are unwilling to watch a 3:00 game are all of a sudden going to get into a 2:45 minute game.    My first word was also ball. If it's any indication, your son will likely grow up slow and unathletic and be forced to live his sports dream vicariously through others.     I couldn't have picked a better week to get the flu. I plan on spending the week on the couch watching baseball.    I'm trying to figure this out. [Here]( http://www.baseball-reference.com/games/head2head.cgi?teams=STL from=1964 to=1979 submit=Submit) are the Cardinals head-to-head records against every team they played against from 1964 to 1979, the years Brock played for the team. The A's aren't listed. The only answer can think of is that this was a spring training game, but I can't find stats for spring training from those years.    With Peavy and Cain hurt, what are the chances Bum pitches again tomorrow?    Propane and propane assessories.    David Aardsma would be able to shut this game down.    I could go for some Tony Torcato right now.    Someone gif that dancing lady!    Why do managers go to the bullpen to get the lefty/lefty matchup against Crawford? He rakes lefties.    Tuffy Gosewisch sounds like a computer generated name on RTTS.    Definitely not a pregnant woman.    Never thought a Matt Kemp double would cause me to fist pump.       Let's have a good season, guys and girls.    Same here. Already got my tickets for 4/11.    This is just how he sells the fight. He doesn't actually mean it.    If you hate him so much, why would you want him to get a ring?       Ah, the classic "Stephanie's Team." Good choice.    Does the bare finger actually go in or is it all done with the leotard as a barrier?    I see this alluded to originally on this subreddit, but I don't know what it means.   I hate it when people compare Kris Bryant to Jesus. I mean, he's cool and all, but he's no Kris Bryant.    Baseball is a better sport when the Cubs are competitive. I'm really excited to see what they do this year.       Expected this to be college basketball for some reason. Good on those kids. I feel like it takes more courage for middle schoolers to do this.    I loved Selma. Thought it was up there with Boyhood for my favorite movies of the year.    He always looks like it, then he gets hurt.    My brother is a young gay stylist. I can't wait until he's old.    Is downtown busy on Tuesday nights?    I'm obligated to drown my sorrows in /r/Kings.    Which is somewhat surprising because /r/49ers makes me want to drink bleach.    As others have pointed out, we probably wouldn't have won the WS in 2012 without him. Given that that was what he was brought here to do, I think most fans don't regret signing him, and that's just from a baseball perspective. He was one of the best people on the team while he was here.    Really hoping he does well. He deserves it.    That's too bad. Vernon Street has a lot of potential. I was just there and made a mental note to come back and check out Hagar's.    http://imgur.com/N89oZ82  Nothing too out there, but I'm wearing the Old Navy slim fit OCBD that was featured on /r/frugalmalefashion last week. It fits well for a $22 shirt. The jeans are also Old Navy and I'm wearing beeswax CDBs.    *Pseudo*-intellectual assholes.    Joe Rogan wishes he was there to say, **"OOOHHHH!"**   Opera House Saloon does it on Wednesdays and The Station does it until 9 on Fridays.    He mad, bro.   Quick. Name 1 running back you would rather have than Marshawn Lynch with the ball on the one yard line.    There's no logical explanation for that call. You could argue that they were hoping to surprise NE with a pass, but that was the worst play call I can remember. There is no running back in the sport I would rather have in that situation than Marshawn Lynch.    In that situation, is there a single running back in the league you would rather have than Lynch? Why throw?    That tortoise just swooped on the hare's girl. Not cool...   Baldwin "mooned". NBC just won't show It.   Lol. Are we watching the same game?    Should we tell him guys?    Someone needs to give these mods a Snickers.    Nationwide taking the dead child approach to advertisement. That's a bold move.   Well that Nationwide commercial took a dark twist...   He's like a hybrid of Andre the Giant and Bubbles from Trailor Park Boys.    I guess you're just different like that :-)   Dude, you know he's not real, right?    Well, they did kill him after all...   SkinnyJew    Why is Lynch even there?    Trujillos or La Casita's?    OP deleted his comment. What was the bet?    Ecclesiastes 9:10  *Whatever job your hands finds to do, do it with all your might.*   The comment is deleted. What was the bet?    Check out /r/gainit.   Does Dolly Parton have any redeeming qualities?    How embarrassing for the team he's playing against...   Doctors say the baby came out with decent velocity and late break.    You think our religion is a *pseudo*-religion?    *I Can't Accept Not Trying* by Michael Jordan. It's out of print, but you can still get it through third party vendors on Amazon. It's short, but worth a read every once in a while.    Pseudo?   Maybe he was aiming for his arm and missed? Hard to believe a kid would just punch an adult like that.    WARNING! Don't read these comments if want to keep the magic.    If you go to a larger university, the gym probably offers rec classes that meet once or twice a week for a couple months. You can do anything from martial arts to ballroom dancing. It gives you a chance to try something new and meet new people. Also, go to club meetings. Universities have student organizations for just about everything.    Can someone explain the appeal of *Kid A*? I listen to it a couple times a year hoping I'll finally get it, but I just don't.    Check out [Lincoln Durham](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9UYF043WBw feature=youtube_gdata_player).   This inexplicably makes me so happy.    My fourth grade teacher used to make me SQUIRT.    How long have you been gaining? For me, if I don't have meals planned out in advance, I start to stress about not hitting my caloric goals.    My New Year's Resolution is to listen to 3 new albums each week. Here what I've listened to so far:    Prince - Dirty Mind  The Strokes - Is This It  Notorious B.I.G - Ready to Die  Modest Mouse - The Moon and Antarctica  Shovels and Rope - Swimmin' Time   Wilco - Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  Bright Eyes - I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning   The thing about shower beer is people like to make it sound better than it really is. But, yes, you just take a shower like you normally would, but have a beer while you do it. I always find it takes me longer to finish a beer than it does to shower, so I'm left with a wet bottle. 5/10   Before each game, each team gives the referees 12 footballs. The Patriots use their 12 and the Colts use their 12, so each team uses different balls. An underinflated ball, while harder to throw a long ways, is easier to catch. It's easier to grip a ball that is underinflated and it will be less likely to bounce off of a receiver's pads.     That's interesting. OP claims to be in the US, but he's written some things that no one from here would say. He called college 'university'. He called an apartment a 'flat'. And he said Jenny's SIM card came out of her iPhone when she dropped it. My money is on this story being fake and it sounds like OP may be British pretending to be American.    Firstly, a PI isn't going to give live updates. Secondly, what phone has iMessage and a SIM card that will pop out when dropped on the ground?    In order for this to be true either (a) the PI is filming Jenny and Carly and Zach somehow has a live feed of it at home or (b) the PI is sending OP live updates. Neither option is how PIs work. This is fiction.   "SILVA'S HURT!"   Dancing is weird, because you don't really expect anyone to be good at it. The "best" dancers in a bar/club are the people who are the most confident in their moves.    Yup. Thought to myself, "I wonder what OP will say about Michael Vick."    I've heard people call this album a work of genius. I've heard it a couple times all the way through and, while it's a good album, I wouldn't call it outstanding. I'm curious what the rest of this subreddit thinks of it and can someone who loves it explain what makes it great to them?     Someone should do an "essentials for a home bar" for every budget. It's easy to build a home bar when you're willing to put several hundred dollars into it. I would be more impressed with a guide on how to create an adequate home bar on $100.     You know how Facebook asks for places you've worked. He probably tried to write Cal Mart, it auto selected Kmart and now he thinks it's kmart's fault.    I remember who we played that day, but who did the Dodgers play? I don't recall.   I prefer the game played on September 12th.    That sounds like a bad rapper name.    M'Allah    My dad owned several Sizzler locations in the 80s and early 90s. What part of the country was this in?    I LOVE Little Hurricane. Unfortunately, they remind me of other, more popular artists like the White Stripes or Black Keys and I haven't come across anyone lesser known who remind me of them. When I saw them live, the opening act was Lincoln Durham. He's not the same musically, but I bet you would appreciate his work.    This is an outstanding comment. It's interesting that great movies like *Hotel Rwanda* and *Million Dollar Baby* aren't talked about as much as films like *Team America* and *Anchorman*, which are both, and I say this affectionately, stupid movies.    Another interesting point you made is that children's movies seem to be talked about more. I think the question that neither you or OP asked is: Who is talking about these movies? Since most of Reddit tends to be in the 18-30 age range, it's not surprising that we still talk about the movies we liked when we were kids. *The Incredibles* still gets talked about, but is that because it's a great film or is it because we loved it when we were 12? My guess is that if Reddit had as many 30-40 year olds as it does 18-30 year olds, *The Incredibles* would not be mentioned as much as a film that that generation grew up with, *The Little Mermaid* for example. In 10 years, Redditors will probably talk about *Frozen* the same way we talk about *The Incredibles*.    This album was my introduction to Prince and after listening to it in its entirety, I wasn't impressed. I thought the vocals weren't loud enough and I couldn't make out what he was saying. But since it was the album that made Prince a star, I stuck with it and listened a few more times.   After a few listens, I fell in love with it. I live the catchiness, especially of the first two songs, *Dirty Mind* and *When you were Mine*, I love the thinly veiled (maybe blatant would be more accurate) sexual innuendo in the lyrics, and I even love Prince's high pitched vocals.    I was a big Jose Cruz fan as a kid.    Man, Keon Clark. That's an interesting story.    He gonna eat da poo poo?    As much as I want a great fight, I think JBJ Is going to outclass DC.    As if I could be any more excited for tonight.   	108
 He'll go.   What a great title.    The Grand Budapest Hotel - Museum Scene   I couldn't stop thinking about The Master for weeks. I must've rewatched that thing 7 times in fewer days.   He was once caught cheating on his wife via hidden camera, ironically.    /r/juxtaposition    Sister Christian - Boogie Nights   Holy shit that's awesome.   ...what?   Well Holy Toledo   Well, fuck.   For those who don't know, Paul George is really damn good.   Plus Michael didn't use a bow. So he cheated.    That movie is about happiness.   Em looks like a lesbian that hangs out at a slam poetry club   Oh no. Megan is Missing is such an atrocious movie.   She could do a reading of Mein Kampf and I'd doze off to it.   As much as I'd love that, it's not going to happen. Elba's already said it.   Good thing it's on wheat. Otherwise that'd be a bit much.   Chance  I can't think of anything Id wanna change   Anyone got a link to any videos of these moms straight up attacking a child in a skate park? I'm sure some exist somewhere.   I always thought that There Will Be Blood and No Country For Old Men could switch and still work nicely. What are other movies that work this way?     I said it before, and I'll say it again. They should have gotten Mark Strong. He's an excellent actor who excels at playing an intimidating, stone-cold badass. Plus he's naturally bald, so that won't look weird.  http://1serial.tv/uploads/posts/2014-02/1393572396_7.jpg    Hay now...   C'mon Jerry! The Dark Knight Returns! It's canon!   Paul Thomas Anderson is a huge fan of Sandler's early comedy movies, like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. That's apparently why he hired him.   Plus....all those goddamn puns.   I've seen the pilot. It's *fucking bad*, like they took some of Mulaney's jokes and ran them through 10 other FOX sitcom writers and a clich machine.

Ha  If you had said overrated I would've understood where you were coming from. I'm gonna need you to explain why you think it's bad.   I agree with some of these, but I don't understand how you can think that the Avengers is not overrated, but Inception is.  Then again, Robocop is your favorite movie.   Wow.

 Appreciate you making such a comprehensive post. Been interested in LC for sometime now, this is extremely helpful.   Would way rather have Moore. Gausman has proved nothing, probably one of these guys that will take another year or two to start putting it together    Nope, your trading the number 1 pick for like a 3rd rounder(8 man league). Pitching is replaceable, elite hitting isn't. Why does it have to be Felix? There's plenty of productive pitchers you can buy low on right now. Chris sale is probably going to dominate tonight, trade some schmo for him before his start.      This should be the top comment   Larry Johnson from KC   The NFL is an utterly spineless organization.    It's a great idea in theory, but once other teams start having their catchers lose time with injury they start dipping into the same pool as yours, and it can lead to frustrating waiver situations.   Ehh you lose in that one. Kemp isn't going to keep this up, he's bound to regress. And while Upton is great, he's a what, 2nd/3rd round pick this year where Kershaw was a 1st. Who are his other top hitters?   I like Souza   Wow intense offer. I wouldn't do it. Simply because it's a lot easier to replace pitching than elite hitting like that. Would he do Jones for Kershaw?   You win HUGE in this one. Take it before he comes to his senses.   I'd stick with Gattis   Thanks for doing this guys, like what I see on the site so far too.  In a Weekly league, 6x6 scoring. Who would your rather start? Jonathon Niese @ CHC, CC Sabathia @TB @KC, Drew Hutchinson @ HOU, CJ Wilson vs COL, Yordano Ventura @ TEX   Wow this is a really tough one. Definitely a fair trade. I think beltre has the edge, I'd take it.   I think both of those are very fair trades, and good on you for not trying to make something terribly unbalanced. Not sure how Cozart could really qualify as a huge upgrade though, who's her SS?   Def neil walker. Rockies aren't going to be home at all this week they lose a lot of their appeal. Walker's batting 2nd in a pirates offense that's been heating up with mediocre pitching to face this week.   Too risky for me, I'd sit him.   Yeah I think you win in this.    Who are your other options? Archer's been good but yanks have been mashing and this start could unravel pretty quickly.   Paredes. Dickerson isn't going to be at home at all this week and that substantially downgrades his potential.   Yeah I think it's worth throwing Alvarez in there. RHP is how he makes his money, Pirates have been hot, and Williams isn't very good.   Weekly league, 6x6 scoring. Who would your rather start?  Jonathon Niese @ CHC  CC Sabathia @TB @KC  Drew Hutchinson @ HOU  CJ Wilson vs COL  Yordano Ventura @ TEX   Stupid question, but is this a sunrise or sunset?   Familia, but you can't really go wrong here    Not really that bad. As a yankee fan selling high on big tex was a great move. Injuries will be inevitable with him this year and he has much regression to look forward to.  EDIT: spelling   Hisashi all day baby   You're not wrong in your assesment, just be aware this guy is a bigger con-man than Bernie Madoff. Once you feel like you can trust him he'll completely implode and ruin your overall stats.  -Someone who's not at all bitter.   Gotta go devon travis. He's been raking and is batting in the best offense in baseball.   It's more fun taking risks and having them pay off than playing it safe. Facing a high octane offense and one of the best pitchers in the league? Sure, but fuck it this guy is 5'7" and can throw a 103mph fastball.   Back to his normal shenanigans   Seeing a lot on almond flour, would like to know your thoughts on that and any other alternatives   Takes guys a while to adjust...I think it's worth holding. Surprised no one wants him, I've been trying to buy low and the owner won't budge.   Who else is available at SS?   Yeah it's not like you'd even have to hold him very long before you found out his diagnosis.   Oh dear   You could get Tanaka for next to nothing right now. While you take on all of his risk, you could also have another Ace in your rotation for the rest of the year.   You could get an RSS feed app and get an update everytime your players name pops up into google news   I'd say D'Arnaud. Because he's on my team and I want him to do well.   How in god's name do you have Alexei starting in an 8 team league?  EDIT: Sorry, to answer I'd choose Correa, Buxton is probably gonna be called up way late.   Vetoes should be removed from the league system. Commissioner should have sole discretion and only block a trade if there's collusion.   Meh I'd drop Murphy for him. Who else is available?   Haven't tried it. Honestly Draft is the most fun I've had with dailies, highly recommend.   Stanton is older, doesn't steal as many bases, and hits for lower average. Trout is at the top in all categories and more importantly does it consistently. Stanton is way more prone to slumps, and doesn't have Albert Pujols hitting behind him.   To buy-low or to avoid....   From what I've read the issue is more with the Angels manager who isn't so much interested in playing the most offensive capable catcher. It makes sense, but bad news for Carlos. That being said I'm unaware how talented he is as far as calling a good game.  EDIT: spelling   Good move on your part   Yeah, I honestly just wouldn't trade him in a dynasty unless it was an utterly unbalanced offer. Not only does trout have the highest ceiling but he has the most consistency, there are never question marks surrounding him, truly one of a kind.   http://images6.fanpop.com/image/photos/35100000/Norman-leon-35112912-245-150.gif   Anyone available on waivers?   Depends who you're dropping for him, but most likely yes, could be a great bat to have on the bench. Definitely yes if you're in a daily league since you can leverage his matchups a lot more effectively.   http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Greg+holland   Do it   I'd say Aoki's a great choice, after him Fowler.   74.2%   Yes, drop him, I'd rather own cozart   I'm in a similar league and am holding. Will probably wait to see by June. Wouldn't be surprised if he has to do a 15 day DL stint at some point. Probably depends how many bench spots you have.   If Saturday's fight was considered a boring, defensive battle, how can I watch an exciting heavyweight match?  I'm a noob to this, would love to get into boxing, just would like to watch more aggressive fighters that are in their prime.    Lester   Can you expand on why you consider Miller one of the better hitters? I get that there's high expectations for him each season but his end of year stats always end up being a disappointment, so far it looks like more of the same for 2015.   Definitely, wouldn't be surprised if was owned 100% by the end of the season   Honestly I'd try to sell high on him in a few weeks. Not to be a Debbie downer but high altitude play wears the body down, I'm doubtful he'll so healthy come July.  EDIT: ...I'm dumb. Thought it was Cargo we were talkin about-    Yeah I'd trade him. His power isn't coming back. He'll hit for good average and probably get a career high in doubles, but don't expect anything better than last year. Look him up on fangraphs, he's getting older and his peripherals tell the same story.   Alex Wood. Surprised he's not being mentioned here. Off to a rough start but he'll finish the year better than everyone's precious Carrasco.  	64

 We'll just sit here and watch the other people and see what they do...   soooo muchhhh sodiummmmm    Tons of really amazing Asian food places within walking distance.  Downside... lots of Asian drivers :(.  FYI I'm Asian and even I know that driving around here is more defensive than anything else lol.   Currently using MyFitnessPal but this app looks more sleek.  I'm really excited to try this out!   Those eyes, the floppy ears, the paws... can't handle the cuteness overloaddddddd   Oh my... the font choices...   Ehhhh that's terrible.  Poop awayyyy!!!   I like how your first reaction was to shit on their car... lol   Great photo!  Thanks for sharing it :)   Throw on a piece of pineapple and call it a Hawaiian taco!   I've stopped there a few times and never noticed the baklava milkshakeeeee!  That sounds delicious!   Soooo deliciousssss.  Their matzo ball soup is amazing as well.   Drove from Miami to Key West and it seemed like 1/2 the houses had these.  Love them :)   This movie made me so sad and angry at the same timeeeeee!!! The rage, the tears!!   I think it's cause he is so confident around women that it takes them by surprise.  He also does have a nice voice and I bet he knows how to sweet talk.  I don't think he's ugly, but he definitely gets hotter women than you'd expect.   :( a day of suffering and cringe moments have given you an awesome story to tell.  If you can survive that, you can survive anything :D    Lol lol I wasn't upset at her when she wore the same color.  I felt more bad  for her cause people noticed.  It also didn't help that it was the first time I'd seen her.... so I didn't know who this extra bridesmaid was lol.  I can't imagine how badly you must had felt.  Good thing something always goes wrong at weddings so hopefully your crime wasn't the worst.     Lol that happened to me at my wedding.  My husband's friend brought his girlfriend (without telling us) and she showed up in a dress that was the same color as my bridesmaids.  She sort of hid from us the whole day lol.     agreed.. this really was a very sad sad photo... lol   Loved the video! It was food porn at it's finest.  Great choice in music as well.  I was hungry and relaxed both at the same time...hahahah   I never realized that her eyes and nose reminded me so much of Kristen Bell!     I will try this recipe this weekend!   Hi guys!  I love chewy chocolate chip cookies but I can't seem to find the perfect recipe.  I've tried Alton Brown's the chewy, the NY Times recipe, and a few others.  I love chewy cookies that are almost like a macaron. Any help would be appreciated!   When I'm in an elevator at night I sometimes still think about it.  Sooo freaken scaryyyy   I know the whole thing sounds so strange, but I'm definitely not drinking or have anxiety about flying.  The worst thing flight I've had was from LA to Denver.  Then it took 5 days before I felt better :(. I'm not sure about dehydration, but maybe I should drink more water the day before flying. This whole thing is just such a mystery and I haven't met anyone else that have had this problem.   I've never seen a doctor for this because I've always assumed that altitude sickness pills were only prescribed to patience going to places with high altitude and not just for plane flights. I really want to travel more but being sick on the plane is seriously no fun :(   I'm actually not afraid of flying and even though I dry heave, I'm not actually nauseous.  I've tried to suck on ginger candies but the dry heaving doesn't go away.  I've tried taking Bonine but it didn't help either.  One time I took NyQuil which helped me fall asleep, but after 2 hours I woke up with the same symptoms plus body aches :(   I've gotten altitude sickness the last 4 times I've flown.  The first 30 minutes I'm completely fine.  Then after about an hour I find myself dry heaving and breathing fast the rest of the flight.  I don't know what to do.  Any tips would be greatly appreciated :D  Thank you.   The crust on the cheese steak reminds me of a fig newton...    I can just imagine a bunch of redditors trekking through Koreatown in search of the mountains lol :D   I like Popeyes better... hahahaha   Yeah I can imagine! With multiple layers, it might end up being more like a lash tint.    I love to use Mango Butter and Shea Butter in all of my soap recipes.  The combination of the 2 give a great feel to the bar itself as well as the lather :D   I make soap and sell soap, but I still love trying out other people's products :).  I love looking at the ingredients label so anything with fun or exotic butters always catches my eye.  I love an all olive oil soap but I know that it's going to be a little slimy in the shower and have little lather.  I don't personally care if it's colored, but I do LOVE a good exfoliation soap for my body.  For my face I like an unscented or very lightly scented with essential oils, uncolored, bar of soap made with lots of olive oil.   Thank you so much for your detailed review!! It seems to do a great job lengthening.  I wonder if it would be even thicker if you applied more coats.  Then again it may never come off hahahah.  Thank you again!      Your blog is great!  That carrot cake looks delicious :)      Hey guys!  My blog posts are mainly travel photos but I also have a few recipes and photos of my handmade soap.  Take a look at my blog and let me know if anyone wants to do a guest blog with me :D http://www.test_subject6067.com    Wow California??  Super jealous!  Seems like every place I've looked here in Southern California have been dry deserts :(   Looks delicious!!  	41
 I would crack up if my kids built catapults. Sound like a fun teacher    It really does! my students and I had a long conversation about it the other day after class and few of them said they would try to vegetarian for a couple weeks and see how it goes. Never preached about it just lead by example and answered their questions    We had a swing set with a little platform that you climbed up so you could go down the slide. I used to sit up there and play with my toys. About twice a month I would fall off backwards (5feet) and get the wind knocked out of me. I still can't explain how I always feel off of this thing.   I just made this mistake I am all red and broken out. Do you have any suggestions to help my skin heal?   I think it is a Scottish fold cat   Take a cotton ball with viniger to it  that should help break down the glue   Damn and here I was feeling bad that I only see my SO every three weeks. I am sorry for your loss of dick my dear.   I live in the southern US and sandals are completely acceptable (and considered professional) as long as they aren't flip flops.    This is some frank underwood shit   Bus boys typically get tipped out by servers so yeah it would be cheaper to have bus boys , but fun to have dogs   It was pretty much like bartending anywhere else except I wore a corset.    It was kind of a kink themed club    I agree with you I try to eat healthy but tofurky and vegan cheese are great to have around when I just want to make a sandwich for lunch. I recently moved close to a grocery store that has tons a lot of  vegan options and it makes staying vegan so much easier.   I actually used to bartend at a club called restraint. So yes.   Yes ,thank you that is what I meant to say . it was early and I was on my mobile. But yeah bus boy dogs would be awesome!    What of instead of bus boys, restaurants just had trained  dogs you fed scraps to, and then they took the plates back to the dish washer. Edit spelling and stuff   There is no pain quite like "I spent an entire class on this and you still didn't get it" pain. I feel for you.   Same thing happened to me had to get off the stuff . I called it orthotripsyco.   It takes a couple shark weeks to get the hang of it but I have been a convert for 2 years now and I love it! Good luck.   I have a huge book of page protectors and everyone contains everything I used when I taught the lesson the year before and if something didn't work well or I thought of something better to do I write it on the front of the notes for the day. Works well for me.    The miseducation of Lauren Hill...one of the few albums I bought new and still listen to regularly. I love every damn song   I play an instrument   Hanks or coast have great seafood fleet landing is OK hymans is a tourist trap   The part of the brain that controls your feet is beside the part of the brain that controls sexual attraction ...just something to think about. Actually my psyc professor told me this I have never looked to see if it is actually true.   I worked while I student taught and it was awful but it is possible. Do as much on the weekends for your job as possible because you will likely be too tired during the week. Let your mentor teacher know you are working . I also took out a small additional student loan so that I could cut back to 15 hours a week every other week which helped me not feel so burnt out.   I won teacher of the year as a second year high school teacher.   Are you talking about primary sources? I am a little confused about what expository writing means. Reading like a historian has great lesson plans for US and world  history. Hope that is helpful.   I am nearing the end of my second year and I am starting to have more of a life work balance my friend who are in their 3rd and 4th years say they do very little at home.   I too can go without oral and enjoy other types of sex and my bf is very good at it. I just don't enjoy being eaten out that much. Bet your man feels the same way fuck the internet sometimes.   If you do this I think it would be great if you did it kind of like crash course and had different videos for different teachers. Like teachertube secondary teachertube middle and teachertube elementary. I would have loved this my first year ! Let us know how it goes   I interviewed for jobs in Asia a couple years ago before taking a job in the states. a couple questions that were different from standard teacher interview questions  were how do you plan to adjust to culture shock? How would you handle language barriers with children? How long do you intend to stay in the country?  Everything else seemed pretty standard I was offered the job but decided to stay in the states.   What subject are you interviewing for?   Ginger dread man   Not a sex Ed teacher but a high school teacher one of my students had heard that if you took ear wax from your ear and put it near a girls vagina that if she had an std she would pull away from it and if she didn't she wouldn't move. He wanted to know if this was true ...I asked him to repeat the question like three times because I couldn't believe how dumb it was. I informed him of the many ways to test for STDs and that was not one of them.    I didn't tell her it was me because I didn't want to start crying . I told her that I would pass the message a long to the right person and thanked her for calling to let us know she was doing better.  	35
 Fifa    Liz Lemon is fighting the Nazis?    I once drank vanilla extract when I was 10 and I was so upset and sick    Not necessarily a teacher, but the president of my university awarded me scholarships even though I didn't apply for them. 3 times.      You could hear me well "go back to Texas" to Arod at a Yankees game in 2005(?) on ESPN   30 Rock and 3rd Rock from the Sun   I guess I sell brands and dannon's danimal yogurt    They know something    Good point!   I've been binge watching 3rd Rock from the Sun on Netflix and it got me wondering about this   I'll be majoring in either History or Psychology.     I'll be transferring from a 2 year to a 4 year soon and I'm wondering if the top universities are actually worth the cost. The only advice I've gotten so far is from 1 person and she has told me that I should go to a state school and then go to a top university for my post grad degrees. In my situation cost isn't that big of a deal.    So I'm stuck to sleep over at someone's house tonight. Was stuck last night too. Had to sleep on the floor. So my roommate and I were leaving work and he was driving, he didn't say anything about us going to his friend's house again. I was planning on taking a nice shower and making some BBQ chicken for dinner. So now I haven't eaten in several hours, I feel gross and Im exhausted. I also get to look forward to sleeping on the floor again tonight and possibly not eating until the morning. Also going to work in the same clothes, unshowered, teeth unbrushed and phone dead. I would've love to have at least been told that this would be happening tonight. I mean what the hell bro.    Beautiful.    Is your brother Vali, the 30 Rock writer?      I just wanna add that instead of Mathway I use Cymath because it gives you step by step for free. I'm not sure if they have an app though    You're looking good and a lot happier man keep up the solid work!    I see it too and it's pretty creepy looking    Considering how deliberate the trip was and Reus was without the ball... it was very bad.   I dropped my phone 3 times watching this gif. There's no way I would be able to hang from there   This local Chinese buffet banned sugar packets from being on the tables because I poured a few packets in a cup then got a refill of Pepsi and it exploded on the waitress.   No problem, I mean my only experience is having taken art history classes, but that's what helped me do well.    It's hard to tell what's tongue in cheek on the internet lol. Yeah that was bad. Hacking the stock market if possible would be damaging to the economy as well. Also one persons voice can unite millions. If there was someone with the goal of terrorizing become popular and then using those people to act out terror then that would be bad too.   Yeah those are actually very crippling. In my opinion though, on second thought, something that maybe wouldn't kill anyone, but really cripple the moral of people would be harsh too.   Nothin'   Larry David. His complaining would keep me entertained.   Attack the nuclear power plant in my region. Takes out power, workers and of course the nuclear aspect would be horrifying.    Know the style of art your critiquing and know the history of the style.    One of the Pokemon games, in pretty sure it was Silver or Gold. What I remember most was getting frustrated that Hoothoot kept fighting me. It wasn't my game, but my brothers friend's game. I picked up where he had left off (right after picking the first pokemon) and this is also the first time I ever got mad because of a video game.       I currently work at Lowe's and it's insane how some of these things get by associates. It makes me wonder how many times I've been tricked.       West Ham United 1 - 3 Manchester United   Van Persie, Di Maria, Rooney  7   The DVDs have them. They're the only place I've seen them.    The only place I've found them is on the DVDs   So what's some high grade chocolate I should try?    Manchester United 4 - 0 Leicester City   Falcao, Falcao, Mata, Rooney  21   That says "will" not "may"   So we should organize something to get him an English girlfriend?    Sounds like the mob   YES! It's Al Di La! Thank you so much!   Okay so I realize that this will be very tough to figure out considering the abundance of italian places in Brooklyn. I recently went on a trip to Brooklyn and we were taken to a very small and nice italian restaurant. Unfortunately I can't ask the person that took us to the place. So I'll try to narrow it down with the details I know of. Okay so the waitresses there all wore black and white stripes and had red bows or something around their neck. They served water in a tall green bottle. The menu was all in italian. It's also only a few blocks from the Barclays center and farther from the water than it. Now that's all I can think of. I'm really sorry. I can't even remember the name of the street it was on, normally I'm good at remembering names, but this slipped by mind.    I DONT CARE IF THIS IS REAL OR FAKE WHENS THE NEXT UPDATE  	45
    Did you ever feel like you were close to reality or death? Do you remember what the coma felt like?  	2
 Oh on the disk it had "18" on it so I just assumed. But that's good news             I went to see them last October and before the show, we went to some stores. The sales associate who was in her twenties asked if we were going to the show. We said yes and she said "They're awesome! They did a really great cover of a Johnny Cash song."   This is my first post here and I wanted some feedback. Don't mind the numbering of the paragraphs. Those are for a personal purpose.  [Here it is](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B54RInQXb2CRU1BGSXJ6OFd6TEU/edit?usp=sharing)  Also, I wouldn't mind some title advice as well. NDE is a working one.  Thanks in advance for any advice/critiques!   Obviously District 9.    King Leonidas' [death scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kj11Pj2T7Bw) in 300. It's so beautiful and tragic. His whole life he had been taught to not fear death, but in this moment he realizes what he'll be leaving behind. His love. And for the first time in his life, he feared death.  "My queen! M-my wife. My love."  Edit: Also wanted to add that it's beautifully shot and beautifully acted by Gerard Butler.    Weird question, I know, but I don't drink and also happen to be a non-alcoholic drink enthusiast if that's even a thing.   I'm looking for places in or around Memphis that have good/interesting/unique/strange drinks. Sodas, juices, whatever as long as it's non-alcoholic.   A strange request, but I'd love some info.    /r/Retiredgif      She was wearing a blue bikini I think? Also the background had a playboy symbol.    Max Payne   I think this might be the right answer. People hear Adam Sandler and they think over the top comedy. You go see Punch Drunk Love and it's Sandler actually acting against PTA's great, but unusual directing, and when you combine this with the strange story, it's easy to see people not liking it because it's not what they think.   One of my all time favorites. I seriously think it's one of the best movies ever made.   I watched it recently and it still kind of holds up well. Especially the Island of Lost Dreams one.   The 3 kinds of comments in this post:  "Fuck Gamestop" Yeah yeah we've heard it all before.   "This is why I pirate games. Because I'm sending a message to the man!" No it's not. You pirate because you'd rather get something for free.   And finally, "This should be in the game. I bet it was but they just took it out." You should not be surprised and should expect this by now. I'm with you in that it sucks, but this is normal now. In fact it's weird if games don't have preorder bonuses now.    Only two kinds of people use the word "rubbish". British people and snobs. I hope you're British.    Niell Blomkamp   That show is fantastic! I've been waiting for season 5 to show up on netflix   Watching my youtube subs is a nightly thing with me. I have netflix, but I don't watch it as much as I want to.    I have the [Nine Inch Nails logo](http://i.imgur.com/d57qOpn.jpg) on my finger. I like it because it's not really noticeable and it's my favorite band.   I miss my senior year of high school. Best time of my life. I was happy, I got to see my friends everyday, I didn't have bills or responsibilities. All I worried about was how I was going to make the next day fun.  I also had this film class. I miss that because I got to make short films with my best friends.   I think I just miss my friends. Once I graduated, I only stayed in contact with like three of my friends and I only got to see them like once every week or two.  But yeah, I just really miss my senior year. Great friends, great teachers, classes, and a great, happy life.   I'll just get on Youtube. Like tonight I spent hours watching live performances of bands. It was great. Sometimes I'll just listen to a podcast while pacing around the house.      It's from a Korean Company called Plain Archive. To me it's like the Korean Criterion. They take certain movies and give them really great artwork and stuff.   They do it every couple of months. But unfortunately they sell out fast. The newest one, Blue is the Warmest Color, sold out in ten minutes. If you want to stay up to date on what they're doing and new releases, I recommend following them on Facebook.    Under the Skin         "The finest cigars, the finest wine, and a .22 cal gun."  Not bad.     Naw this chick was I think Korean? She also appeared to be on a train   It's a short video too. Help?   Recently I've been thinking Brandon Routh would be pretty good.    I kind of hope it's more Avengers/Guardians in tone and not Xmen. Power Rangers is awesome but there's always been this fun cheesiness to it.    He's one of the few directors that puts a lot of work into the writing and characters  His movies are shot really well. The composition is great and there's just something about the lighting in his films. The camera work is also always great.  His writing may be self indulgent, but it is always sharp and smart. His movies are some of the few that I actually enjoy listening to just as much as watching. He makes pretty entrancing conversations between characters that really hold your attention.  I think he does a good job of pacing a story even if it is long. He knows how to move a story forward.  His films have good consistency. I don't mean his films are consistent with each other, but his films by themselves are consistent in tone.  I personally don't find his movies boring, though I can see how someone would. He makes entertaining movies that almost always have some sort of fun quality to them.   I find him to be sort of a breath of fresh air. He only makes movies like once every couple or so years. He actually takes some time to makes sure that it's quality work. Yeah, not all of his films are perfect, but I think he still makes above average films consistently. And I do think there is some nice uniqueness to his films. Even if it's something we've seen before he manages to find a way to turn it into something different.      You should get The Thin Red Line and Tree of Life on blu-ray. Some of the best looking blu-rays out there.   Goodfellas is not as good as everyone says it is. It's a good movie, but definitely not as remarkable as people say. I have a hard time considering it to be in Scorsese's top 5.  Gravity, aside from its technicals aspects, is incredibly bland. In fact, it's pretty below average.  The Rock is not the best action movie ever. Not even close.  The Godfather is boring.  I think Terrence Malick is one of the greatest directors of all time.  I think The Tree of Life is one of the best movies ever made.  I think The Matrix Reloaded is awesome and not terrible. It's still a cut above most movies that come out today.  I think The Dark Knight is one of the best crime movies since Heat.  Only God Forgives was one of the best movies not only of 2013, but of the decade as well.   Romeo+Juliet is a national treasure!  Also, while I think a movie can be great with a simple plot, I think Gravity instead just had an incredibly flat, thin plot. The movie is a technical marvel, but that's where the good stops. At least for me it does.   But....Raging Bull....   In terms of the "new" Bond films, it doesn't hold up against Casino Royale.   I personally think Punch Drunk Love is the best PTA movie.  Also, the piano/Brittany Spears scene is probably one of the best scenes from a film in the past decade.    That doesn't really make them wrong though. He's a good director and Pulp Fiction *is* kind of a good movie. This sounds more like the mindset, "It's popular so it's bad/you don't really know anything about film."   I can most definitely say he's one of my favorite directors and I could totally give some legit reasons.   Dancer in the Dark is so sick though. At least to me it is.   So just for clarity, are you saying that every Kubrick movie besides Strangelove is terrible or Kubrick has made some good films but Strangelove is the best?   So what does karma *do* in fallout? I've always had good karma in fallout, so I don't know how bad karma affects the game.   Yep, high speech in NV will get you through, and out of, so many things. Definitely makes life easier.   When I played Fallout 3, I had never played a Fallout game or an Elder Scrolls game. So in Fallout, I had no idea you could just wait. It made playing so tedious because I had to just wander around until daytime in order to go to stores and stuff.  In NV I went into the quarry after playing for only like two hours.  Also, repair is the best skill and I don't know how I could have gotten through that game the first time without it.   I think the last time he played a character that was different from what he usually does was Coach Carter   Bigger stars have started in worse movies.    Yep it's like a private screening!   Unlock the open blue sports coat you get at level 14. I wanted a sweet blue suit. Once I got it, I was kinda done with online.   I really want to say Only God Forgives, though I can't figure out why. There's just something about it. I can totally see it being a classic in 40 years.   I can't speak for everyone, but what made it great for me was the theme of fathers and sons. I have a close relationship with my father and this movie really got to me emotionally. I also really loved the fact that it felt like a Greek tragedy play with its clear three act structure. I can totally see people not liking it though. I thought the reveal of what happens to Gosling's character was a great twist I didn't see coming.   I don't know if it will be considered a classic, but it will always be one of my all time favorites.    1. The Raid 2  2. The Rover  3. Under the Skin  4. 22 Jump Street  5. Grand Budapest Hotel   Yeah, we live in a day and age where everyone is so cynical about everything. We always assume the worst when people do or say nice things. Not everyone is trying to say something or be passive aggressive. Sure, some people are like that, but there are also people who just like being nice and helpful. There doesn't always have to be something someone is trying to get out of you by being nice.    I mean, don't most parents want their daughter(s) to get married and have kids anyway? I don't see how them being Mormon has much to do with that. I mean, yeah, Mormons are big about families and think its important to have one, but I feel this doesn't have that much to do with them being Mormon. It just seems like they are really pushy and happen to be Mormon as well. I mean I know plenty of people like that. Hell, my parents do the same thing with my older sister and we're not Mormon.   It had to do with a fox. Like all the games had this fox character and it was a series of mini games, and one mini game was keeping bubbles in the air and not letting them touch the ground.      I think it's awesome that we can still get movies featuring an actor who has passed.    I have a drumstick that was used and signed by the drummer of M83. After the final song he signed the drumstick and threw it in the crowd. It's all cracked and stuff. They may not be the biggest band but they are one of my favorite bands so it's really cool to me.    I think it just depends. I love working on films and tv shows. Started as a hobby then I worked for a production company for five years and loved every day of it.    The Raid 2      Context?   I honestly think you should see it for yourself. It's been pretty divisive. I've heard some call it one of the worst movies they've seen, and some call it one of the best. I guess it all depends on what *you* want out of a movie, and what you're looking for in one. Just make sure you set your expectations right for what it is. Know what you're getting yourself in to. If you go into it thinking it will be a post apocalyptic sci-fi action movie, you'll have a bad time. It's a drama that is set upon the backdrop of the post apocalypse and it takes its time.    The thing that makes Robert's performance great is that there is so much subtlety in his portrayal of his character. There's so many little things he does that make it fantastic. It's not some bombastic performance full of expressed emotion. He says so much with his expressions and mannerisms.    I honestly think he stole the show. Which isn't easy to do when you're co staring with other great actors. I always wanted him to be great because I knew he had the capacity to be a great actor. He really showed what he could do. One of the best, if not the best, performance by an actor so far this year.    Just saw The Rover last Friday and it might be my new favorite movie of the past decade.  If not that then No Country for Old Men. It's one of the few movies that is almost perfect in every aspect.  The Raid 2 is also close to being number one.  The Tree of Life is probably the movie that affected me the most emotionally the past decade.  Man, there's just too many.   I wish there was an option like in the Skate games where you can set a checkpoint. I'd set one on top of Chilliad and ride down it all day.    Yeah, I remember reading that during the uprising scene, when something messed up, they had to spend almost an entire day resetting things.    Tron Legacy was not only gorgeous, but had a killer score as well. Probably one of the best scores of the past decade.   That and the music      Matrix bullet time on the roof. I saw that and my jaw dropped. I had never seen anything like it at the time.   I have a legitimate question though. Doesn't that small percent become irrelevant if you live in an area where one of those deadly spiders live? Like doesn't the probability of encountering a deadly spider increase if you live in the native area of it? I feel like .0015% *is* insanely small, but I live in an area where brown recluses and black widows are the norm, so that small percent means nothing to someone like me.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGWM4dFRc9Y   Right [here!](http://www.hexmedia.tv/)      Yeah, I think he needs some time for people to forget about him so when he comes back we'll all be like, "Oh yeah! I forgot about him!"   Maybe time will heal and we'll forget his past. I mean people kind of forget about Robert Downy Jr's past now that he's a mega star. Then you think about it and go, "Oh yeah, he was super messed up and everyone thought he was going to end up dead."  Shia just needs to pull a Robert Downy Jr   Oh wow I have your autograph! Neat! I'm super excited to see it. I've been holding off watching it until tonight because some friends and I are having a scary movie night and my friends little brother will be there so I'm happy we'll all get to see it!   The movie was panned by most people and critics but I think it gets massive points for its creativity and originality. I love it!   Blue Valentine: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=f4IN6NFukF0#t=67   From 12 Years a Slave: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=lAHReSSV1IA#t=118  Strong runner up from Shame: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dE2NuKD-U4g   No I think he's a really good actor too, but he totally has the capacity to be a *great* actor. Look at A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints as an example. He did amazing in that. I think all Shia needs to do is completely disappear from movies and the public eye for like 5 years. Then come out of nowhere with a movie that has a great script and director behind it.   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2367066/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1  I was wondering if anyone who's seen it could tell me about the content in there and how much sex, violence, and language there is. Like is it all pretty pg-13 or more R?  Friends and I are having a scary movie night and I want to watch this but his little bro who is 14 will be there also and I don't want to bring something filled with gore, sex, or f bombs.    Those lance explosions were just so visually satisfying.   Who makes them? Is there a company? Are they given the entire movie to choose footage from or are they given specific clips? How involved is the director? Are they story boarded? Who decides tone?  I just really am interested in the process because I've always wondered.    I wouldn't call Martyrs a horror. More like a drama where horrific things happen. It's not really scary, just sad and depressing.   The [Matrix Revisited](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0295432/?ref_=nv_sr_3) is like a two hour documentary on the making of the Matrix. Really really in depth.  And if you're in to behind the scenes stuff, I highly recommend getting the Ultimate Matrix Collection. It has 35 hours of behind the scenes stuff.         Take a movie and switch the perspective of it. What movie would be interesting to see from the perspective of one of the other characters in it?    I'm actually pretty excited about this game. I'm not the biggest fan of Battlefield as a series, but the idea of taking a game like Battlefield which, despite its apparent glitches, is for the most part technically impressive and then putting that into an urban environment with police sounds interesting.   Battlefield for me has been a lot of the same recently. I think it's a cool idea to make a swat game.    No Country for Old Men  I think it's one of the few movies that is technically perfect in almost every single way. The writing is great. The cinematography, the acting, directing, sound design, and editing are all near perfect.   It also has a great simple yet deep story and characters. It's also an incredibly well paced film. It never drags. It always feels so tense and so tightly done.    Right at Your Door is a terrible movie.    Man, Ivan Ooze is a great villain. He had some great lines.   Same here. He got a girlfriend, they got engaged, then moved in together. When you have someone around all the time you apparently don't need anyone else.    So how does a video rental place help me? Genuinely curious, not sarcastic   What's black lodge   I posted a couple of weeks ago about needing one actor and one actress for a short. I got an overwhelming response from the guys, which is great, but no actresses.   Are there any local communities or organizations where I can reliably find an actress? We start shooting very soon and have found our guy but need our girl. That's all that's left for us to do before shooting.    I feel like the Matrix doesn't fall into this category. It's pretty much clear to the characters thirty minutes in what's real and not real.    I might have worded that weird, but at work today a bunch of ink spilled all over the laminate flooring. After spending hours scrubbing the floor is still stained.   I look at my hands and see they are covered in ink. I think to myself, "Oh great, I'll be cleaning my hands forever." But to my surprise my hands were rid of any trace of ink after washing my hands for like 2 minutes.   So what makes skin hard to stain? Why was this ink so easy to clean off my hands but impossible to clean off the floor? Did it have to do with skin, the ink, or the laminate flooring? Regardless of whether this has to do with the material of the flooring or not, my question still stands: What makes skin so hard to stain and all around resilient and resistant?   This very thing happened to me in the Sims 3   I disagree. Even though Avatar wasn't the best movie, I loved the world and universe they built. And I'm excited to see more of this universe. Apparently one of them is suppose to be about the oceans of Pandora which could turn out awesome.    I'm currently waiting for mine as well as the Wrestler in the mail and I'm so ready for it to get here.  Also, Art of Flight bluray. Nice.   I work a very physical job where the dress code is pretty lax. All we need our uniform polo and just some jeans that aren't messy. However I find working a physically demanding job in jeans not comfortable. I jokingly said to my boss, "What if I found sweatpants that looked like jeans?" to which he replied, "If they look like jeans then whatever."   I don't?   Are jean sweatpants a valid option?   No no I mean like a bank heist movie. I want a full movie like the Dark Knight opening. It was so entrancing to watch that opening scene. Take that, then give us a huge section of them setting it up and then pulling it off.  Edit: Sorry for my opinion?   That movie still holds up pretty well effects wise   I'm waiting for a Nolan heist movie.    So this pair of jeans I've had for like 2 months have just ripped. I guess from being worn out. Are there a brand of jeans that are pretty durable and will last and won't ware out or rip easily?   The boat reminds me of the one from Never Let Me Go   There are only 5 games that would get me truly excited for this new generation. Of course they may announce new IPs as well.  Skate 4 (Which doesn't seem likely)  Rock Band 4 (Which doesn't seem likely)  The next Elder Scrolls game (which doesn't seem likely)  Fallout 4 (Which could happen)  and Red Dead Redemption sequel (which who knows)  I'm just kind of not interested in really any of the already announced games. I really REALLY hope there are a good amount of surprises and new ip reveals this E3 and it isn't just more of what we have already seen.   I haven't gotten a new console yet because I'm just waiting for that game that will make me say, "Okay, I *need* to get a new console." So far, none of the already announced games have made me say that.    Gatsby. Ain't no party like a Jay Gatsby party cause a Jay Gatsby party don't stop?   Exactly. Immersion is very powerful. My cousin served a mission in Brazil. He study Portuguese for like three weeks then left for Brazil. Didn't take him long to adapt to the language.    I told the people I work with that I went skydiving with my long term girlfriend who loves me.   My coworkers now think I'm a very cool adventurous guy. I've never been skydiving and don't have a girlfriend. I'm very lame, boring, and single. It's nice having people think I'm cool for a change.    I was driving to work on a very rainy day. Like it was hard rain where you could hardly see anything in front of you.   It was a four lane highway and a guy driving in the opposite lane went by me and hit a huge puddle, splashing water all over my windshield. I lost all visibility for like 3 or 4 seconds. I panicked but knew that as long as I kept my car straight I should be fine. But I hit a puddle and hydroplaned while driving blind. Went into a ditch and rolled a few times.   I wasn't seriously injured. Just a few scrapes and was sore. But when I lost visibility and hydroplaned, I thought to myself, "This is it. This is where I die."  I seriously thought I was going to die.    So where are you the dozens of other times people ask questions that have been asked before?   A film that you already own that's a prized possession or crown jewel, or a film you long to have a part of your collection, whether it exist or not.    Charlie's Angels would have to be mine. What's yours?   So I'm looking for a new show to obsess over, but I'm looking for one that's just half an hour long instead of a full hour. The reason for this is that I have a hard time watching an hour long show because I feel like I'm not getting far into the show.  Like for example, in a 3 hour period I could watch 6-8 episodes of a half hour long show. Whereas with an hour long show I could only watch like 3 or 4. I just don't have a lot of time unfortunately. I totally wish I did cause I would totally watch the heck out of Breaking Bad and House of Cards.  I'm up for any genre. So, what are some really good and entertaining 30 minute shows?       This was very well said and encompasses my exact feelings about Drive.    It's a romantic drama about loss, love, and the beauty of life. Cheesy, I know, but that's what it's basically about.   And thanks for the heads up on where to post this!   I think it's just the opposite though. I know John Carter will be about a dude named John Carter. That title tells me *exactly* what it's about. And besides *tons* of movies have titles that tell you nothing about the movie. In fact, some of the most successful movies have titles that don't tell you what the movie is about and they did well. Also, there have been many movies where the title is just the character's name, just like John Carter.  Honestly, the title had very little to do with the movie flopping, and was more the fault of the marketing and advertising team.   Yeah I have an email. Message me and I'll give it to you.    Romantic drama with an emphasis on drama.    Hey sorry we do already have someone doing the score. But if you have any samples is love to hear them. I'll keep you in mind for future projects because it'd be nice to work with someone in the same city as me.    Yeah I'd be interested! Message me   Haha there is none   Nope. I mean it'll make it hard, but I understand. I work a job too. We all have day jobs. We would film when we can.    Charles is way too cool to do something like that.   We're looking for two actors: a guy and a girl who look like they are in their mid twenties or older. Are any of you guys interested? At all? If you are, then message me. Any questions? you can ask in the comments or message me.   Don't worry we're legit. I mean we're not big, but we're real. We have a crew, but no actors. We could use some help finding people. We had posted on our facebooks that we're looking from people, but no responses. Just a bunch of likes. So I figured I would turn here for help.       Man, that movie's great!   Samsara. Quite possibly *the best* looking blu ray out there. Jaw droppingly gorgeous.  The Tree of Life is another stunning film. The creation of the universe scene *has* to be seen on blu ray.  No Country for Old Men is another great blu ray addition, as well as the 2009 Star Trek.  Only God Forgives was one of the most beautiful movies to come out last year. Absolutely stellar cinematography. The look and music of this film are enough to warrant a blind buy if you've never seen it.  The Matrix is a great one as well. Especially the Ultimate Matrix Collection box set that has 35 hours of bonus features. That alone makes it worth it even if the film itself doesn't look good, which it does in fact look great!  Immortals, while a not great movie, is beautiful. Now is that enough to warrant a buy? That's up for debate, but since you can get it for a cheap price, it's not a bad addition.  Fantastic Mr. Fox is a great addition! Especially now that it has a Criterion release. This is a very pretty film that looks stunning on blu ray.  Lastly, 300. This film has some of the most beautiful cinematography of the last decade. I find it to be a must own blu ray, but that's just me.    I like this one because I buy blu-rays based on two things: If I love the movie and if it looks really good.   It's very hot and very humid where I live, and I have to wear a suit every week. How much of a fashion faux pas would it be to wear a short sleeve button down with a suit? Are there ways to make it look good? Or is it just a straight up no no?  If so, what are some ways to stay cool in a hot humid environment, while still being business formal?  Guys...it's *really* hot here.   My absolute favorite genre of books are crime by far with mystery at a very close second. I love Mystic River, Gone Baby Gone, and No Country for Old Men.  I'm a very visual person who really loves movies as you can probably tell by my favorite books, so it has always been hard for me to get into books. But there's just something about a good crime or mystery book that gets me super interested.  It doesn't necessarily have to be about cops either. Also, if it has some good violence, that'd be great! I also am really into crime stories that are dark, tragic and don't usually end happy.    'Cloverfield' should have gotten an NC-17 for use of the words shit and fuck over a hundred thousand times.  What?   Lex Luther discussion starts at about the 12:15 mark for those interested in only that. It's not much info, but it's Eisenberg's thoughts.      I know the bomb didn't malfunction and I shouldn't have said it did, but something still happened to the bomb that made them have to go in and manually detonate it. I mean you're totally right though that it was relevant to the story, but my point still stands that it's cliche.   I should preface this by saying that I've never seen a Godzilla film besides Roland Emerich's.  Overall  I thought it was alright, but underwhelming. I'll get to the positives before the negatives because my positives basically echo everyone else.  I thought the movie looked great and was shot really well. I also thought the acting was actually pretty great. Cranston was of course fantastic and I'm glad to see Taylor-Johnson getting more roles. And Watanabe and Olsen, despite how little their characters contributed to the story, were really great as well. Godzilla's design was fantastic as well as the kaiju's designs.  Now the negatives. The human drama might have been too much, or at least pointless. I felt Olsen's character was a little pointless and didn't do anything except give our hero something to lose.  I honestly think the final battle would have been so much better if it happened in daylight instead of night. It was already hard to see things with all the smoke, but then the darkness made it even harder to see things.  This brings me to my next complaint. I don't know, maybe it was just my theater, but did this movie look a little dark to anyone? Again, this was probably just my theater so this might not be a problem with the movie.  I found the sense of scale to be lacking. I could totally *see* the sense of scale, but I couldn't *feel* it, if that makes sense. Like the creatures looked huge but they didn't feel huge. I couldn't feel the weight. Like at the Hawaiian airport when Godzilla stepped right in front of the windows, i feel like there should've been more bass or the glass should've cracked or shattered, but it was just kind of soft for a monster that size. Also, the final battle didn't feel huge. Buildings were crumbling and falling over, but it just sounded too quiet. So I guess that's a problem with the sound design. I also thought his roar was kind of underwhelming.  I honestly think the whole military "blow up the monster/aliens with a big bomb, but the bomb malfunctions so some person/people have to go on a suicide mission to manually detonate the bomb" thing is so over-done and eye-rolling. I think it would have been so much better if the military was all like, "All we can do is just hope that these monsters will kill each other of and pray we'll survive." Like, why couldn't humans just stand aside and follow Watanabe's advice and "Let them fight"? It would've made for a more entertaining movie if it was 30% human drama and 70% monsters fighting. Instead of 80% cliche military stuff and 20% monsters fighting.  The last complaint I have is that it should have been either Godzilla vs the military with no kaiju , or Godzilla vs kaiju with very little military action. I think it was just way too much to have Godzilla vs kaiju vs military. All the military stuff should have taken a back seat, but instead, the military stuff was driving the whole thing and the monster stuff was riding in the trunk.  I know I sound like I hated this movie, but I don't. It's not a bad movie at all, I just personally found it underwhelming.    Parties. Seriously. Don't want people waiting in long lines outside 4 bathrooms.      D3 The Mighty Ducks   The first Saw is actually a really good movie.   No. No slipcover. If it did I'd keep the copy of fight club, lol. I live in Memphis.    A few months ago my partner and I started work on a romantic drama for our next project. At the time I was excited because the story was great and the concept was great and we were looking forward to doing a different kind of film.   Fast forward to today and I'm about halfway through writing the film and I've just...lost all interest in it.   Over the course of the last few months the project has been behind schedule due to life(school and work). So I've gone from being really pumped about the project to being kind of stressed and just uninterested in it. I really want to put my heart and soul into every project I work on but my heart just isn't in this project.   It's not in my wheelhouse or my interest. I love writing crime stories and mysteries, so going from that to a romance is so...different for me. I'm never sure what to do and I'm worried the end result will be not that good with a shallow story, bad characters and really nothing special.   I've just lost so much steam. I think that the worst part is that while I'm writing this film, there are a handful of other projects I'd rather be working on. We've had to make creative changes to our romantic drama in order to make it work and a lot of these changes were things I liked so I personally don't feel invested in it at all.   The only thing keeping me going is that my partner *is* excited about the project. I can't just drop out. Not now. But I feel my lack of interest in the project will end up hurting the final product.   Any advice? Any way I could regain interest somehow? Should I drop out? I'm really lost here.    I recently got a gift from a friend that turned out to be two blu-rays I already have. So I figured, instead of selling them somewhere because I don't know where to sell them, I'd try to trade them to you guys! I don't really know how this goes, so if you are interested in one of them, or both, just let me know!  	153
 I just got the Heroine Kiss Me Volume and Curl today after waiting 2 weeks and I have to say... I'm really disappointed, especially since this mascara gets so much love from this community.  This mascara makes my lashes so clumpy and they feel *crunchy*- like how your hair feels if you've used too much hairspray.  I literally did the wiggle at the roots and brush up, and waited about 30 secs to let it dry and tried a second coat, which just completely grouped my lashes together.  If I do a gentle rub along my eyelid when my contacts move about, my lashes move together and stick together.  Did I get a complete dud or am I doing this thing wrong- does this mascara need to be dried out a little to work better like the Lanme Hypnse? Was anyone else really disappointed with the results?   Oh my goodness! I'd love to have whatever you don't want anymore , I'm still a newb at the AB game. This is so kind of you, thank you.   I'm in the UK and I'll pay for shipping if you'd like   Yeah, they're described as 'neo-liberal'   I'm trying out the exact reverse to you with regards to Vit C, I've been using a SAP for three months and find that's there pretty much no difference in PIH or the evening out my skin tone, so now I'm waiting for C20 to arrive to test out.    I recently started using it consistently and have noticed its cleaned out the blackheads on either side of my nose but not the ones on my nose, where my blackheads are deeper and pores are larger.   The best thing for acne I have used is Rx benzoyl peroxide, which I use on my back and occasionally on my forehead.   If you're looking for something for an occasional pimple then I would highly recommend hydrocolloid bandages, they've totally changed my life, I don't even pick my spots anymore!!   Fellow Chinese gal here, I totally got the whole wet hair thing and no cold food before periods thing. I normally like to think of myself as a logical thinker and have always felt that Chinese Medicine lacks scientific theory and proof but man, the cold food thing really seems to pack a punch.  I have experimented several times with eating ice cream, drinking cold water, not wearing socks on cold floors whilst try to keep as many controls as I could and when I did, I got the worst back pain on my periods. When I stopped the cold food and 'han qi' a week before my periods, I would get no back pain at all! Obviously I'm not able to say that it definitely works but it does make me take caution.  I think the cold water thing may also be due to the fact that tap water is basically a no-go in China. I know that in Beijing, its still pretty dirty and so we always drink boiled water thats been allowed to cool a little. It may also be due to the older generations' experience, when water was less processed and even dirtier.   Oh I see, well just do what you're comfortable with! Have a fun trip!!   Well I have the sleek palette, use a matte cool brown to put under the cheekbones and the highlighter on top of your cheekbones. When I travel I just get some highlighter on my finger and dab or swipe onto my cheekbones or if I'm ging somewhere special- the high points of my face i.e. my cheekbones, bridge of my nose and my cupids bow.  I just turned 18 and honestly, I would advise against wearing much makeup, especially when travelling long journeys or living outdoors. Do you normally wear makeup?   Over the last year or so, I have had the worst lips in my life so far. I used to just use vaseline or Carmex on my lips but then they became so dry and flakey and painful.  I then tried Blistex Intensive Mositurising balm and their balm for cold sores, they solved the problem overnight but they did nothing in the long term. I also shelled out for the Nuxe reve de miel balm, but that also failed to sufficiently moisturise my lips.  I have now changed to Hurraw's vegan lip balm and oh my goodness, this stuff is incredible. I apply before bed and wake up with soft lips and just dab on gently about twice a day even though I drink around 2.5 litres of water a day. I have the Lime, Earl grey tea and cherry one (which is tinted red).  I do find the more balmy ones such as the Nuxe reve de miel work better under vaseline, to seal the moisture in.   I would suggest forgoing the mascara and just using an eyelash curler, especially if you're using a waterproof mascara cause its such a pain to get off and you won't be able to with just baby wipes. I go camping and road tripping quite often and find mascara is just a bother, I normally just do highlighter and contour using a contour kit, curl my lashes and tinted lip balm with SPF.  Wearing adequate sunscreen is really important too, especially on your body.  BTW baby wipes are also really using in cleaning pots and mess tins if you don't have access to running water!   Thank you!! I did try to search YT and pinterest for 'geometric nails' but the exact thing I wanted didn't come up, sorry! I have posted the inspiration picture though, I just freehanded it by copying the forefinger in that picture   Thank you! Neither actually, I have a black striping brush that I actually used in my first attempt at nail art but found that the lines looked too thick and so for this one, I used a 0.38 Muji gel pen which looked much better but harder to control for my left hand.   Thank you!! I think the hack is not actually using a striping brush- I used a 0.38 mm Muji gel pen for the black lines and although my right hand looks like a hot mess, I imagine it looks way better than it would've done with actual polish!   I thought I'd post the inspiration for these nails [here](http://content.asos-media.com/~/media/300414115043en-GB/Images/uk/2014/05/01-thursday/NAILS-WITH-LOUISE/nail-art-intagram-mananails.jpg?mw=398)  I'm not quite able to sit still for a full nail art session with waiting times so I did a lazy-girl-shortcut   I'm warming up to it but the original inspo was just a few nails bare and nude on the rest  edit: added the inspiration picture cause my description sucked   Oh my goodness the search function... I'm pretty computer savvy and it still took my about 20 mins to figure out how to use that thing..   Thank you!! I'm not too keen on it either but unfortunately I don't have many colours so I could only leave it bare.   noragrets though because this paint job only took 20 minutes all in all!!   I feel like the proces have gone back up, my OST C20 I bought 3 days ago was $10.66 and is now $12....  I just went on the [old.roserosestore.com](old.roserosestore.com) to check on my order status and the C20 was $10.66 too... huh.

Thank you!   Its best to soak first to open pores and wash your body with soap to remove some oils first.  I normally use hot water (I'd say 39 degrees celcius if we're being specific) to bathe in for about 10-15 mins and let my hair mask soak in, then wash with soap.  The soap is super important, you'll find that the mitt won't just 'slip' all over your body. Then long strokes with pressure (sadistic but you need it) up and down until you turn red and these rice shaped bits of nasties start to form on your skin.   TADA, you're now raw and in pain but exfoliated!!!  	22

    My grandfathers first wife was a pedophile. They divorced right after having their third child together. All of my step uncles have at some point in their life been caught doing wrong things with younger girls. Makes me wonder if pedophilia is inherited also.   I get this every game! It's so annoying omg!   Felch   Don't go to the movies. Go to piratebay.   Yay, I love aldi!   Would need a sandbox for his shits.   Sigh reporting is for faggits   Never been so cluster fucked at a rave like this shit event.   Wonder why divorce rates are so high in america. Lazy american women hahaha.   Or just marry non american women.   Haha this is great.   It not only looks great but smells great and plenty of room for stuff under it. What a genius.   Hamburger helper and ramen noodles don't count as cooking.  	14
 Karma       Chairman Pao is an elitists gatekeeper.  Down with censorship. Now if we could only get rid of moderator ProtoDong from r/technology    This woman is an elitists gatekeeper. Down with censorship.    ProtoDong need to be fired like  chairman Pao      I am not a scientist. Would like the scientific community to research my idea and replicate it in lab. I also believe that Joe six pack should have the freedom to try any alternative medicine he wants.  You sound like an gatekeeper. Freedom of speech buddy.    Personal attacks is a sign that someone is losing the argument.    Yep, it is called freedom.  This is not the USSR.   Then show idea too your lab if what you say is true.   I want it to spread with or without testing. Then the gatekeepers won't be able to supress technology. Trust me if enough people hear about idea someone will test idea in lab.   The Wright brothers or Tesla did not go though "proper channels" when building there ideas.   Amen brother.    Ditto.   Thank you.   Good info, buddy. Did you notice that they use blue LEDS not blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulbs. Blue spectrum hydroponic bulbs works much better and faster than blue LEDS. Plus the light is safer. The airforce is also using powerful light to disinfect rooms from MRSA. I will provide a link in a min.      It is a weed grow bulb buddy. If it caused damage to skin people would be sueing hydroponic grow bulb companies . People work all day, legally in colorado, under these bulb. Thank you for expression concern just please keep it civil.    /u/ProtoDong go away. It is not slander if it is true.   You are wrong.  I made a video where I tryed to treat a mrsa infection with benathonium cloride/ epson salt and alternating hot/cold. I did not use the 1000 watt bulb in this video. This treatment was a failure not my combination therapy that includes a hydroponic bulb. Got it buddy.    The problem is how would I infect the mice with mrsa. Not safe except in a lab setting. Also. I am an animal lover,even mice,  so I couldn't do this. Answer  you question buddy.   Please keep forum civil.   I don't mind that you disagree with me but you language is uncalled for buddy.   Yep. Moderator /u/ProtoDong need to go away and stay in /r/technology where he belongs.   /u/ProtoDong it wasn't advertising. It is a open source free idea I am giving away. Also you could have contacted me before deleting my post from the first page. Also, your rude language was uncalled for. Please leave me alone.   /u/ProtoDong I contacted the moderators from /r/conspiracy about your rude language and trolling behavior. I don't want your posts deleted. I just requested that you and your trolling buddies leave me alone. Go back to /r/technology. This is the conspiracy subreddit. So leave me alone. Ok. Buddy. From proud Veteran.   /u/ProtoDong is a /r/technology moderator.  The rule of reddit don't apply to him. I messaged the moderators of /r/conspiracy about his behavior. I don't want his posted deleted I just want him and his trolling buddies to go back to /r/technology and leave me alone. All his rude post's had negative points but overnight most of his post are now positive.   This is the moderator from /r/technology who deleted me after getting over 600 upvotes.   /u/ProtoDong you are a  moderator. Go back to /r/ technology. Stop trolling or does the rules not apply too you   Must obey gatekeeper.   Good link. Thank you.    If I get blacklisted from this site that is where I may end up.    https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ftUpxtCWHBU   I think it's funny. Rise against the machines.   Also why is the moderator /u/ProtoDong  and his buddys from r/technology up voting his rude comments. Went to bed at 3am and his comments where all negative and now they are all like magic positive. I thought the moderator's where suppose to be neutral. This post has 92% upvote, so leave us alone.   You didn't even watch the entire video. In the video, I stated that I was going to go to the hospital to have my infection cultured. The proof is in a lab result currently in my medicial record.    LoL   I have an after video on my youtube channel.    Goodnight buddy.    It is called freedom buddy. Don't pretend you care about what happens to other people. If you were a caring person, you wouldn't use such nasty language.    I think you are wrong but even if you are correct. I don't care. It is call empathy. When the law become lawless you must break it. I don't  care about your fear tactics. Go troll some place else. Quit pretending  you care about me. If I go too jail so be it. If you want to have an intelligent coversation of why I am wrong I am all ears. Name calling doesn't prove you know what you are talking about.      Please be honest. I am a big boy.  Can handle it.   By heating up and cooling down my arm, this increases blood flow. More white blood cells get to the source of infection. This helps in the healing process. I am too tired to answer the rest of your questions. Message you tomorrow.    No it isn't.  It is only a criminal offense if money is exchanged. The government can regulated medicial commerce not  medicial speech.  I have 1st amendment free speech rights.   Yea and moderator /u/ProtoDong has too wait until I am at the top of page one before he deletes my post.    Thank you.    Ok. Sorry tired not thinking completely straight.   Also, look at the spectrograph of a blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulb.    Yep. That is one of the papers. There is many others. Go to blackwell synergy and do a search.    Blue spectrum light is already FDA approved for the treatment of acne. So moderaters statement is nonsense. Also 400nm blue light acne treatment uses a 12 watts LED bulb. I use a 1000 watt blue spectrum hydroponic grow bulb. This extra power increases penetration.   Google 400nm mrsa or blue light mrsa. Then get back with me.   I have had like 15. Around a dozen treated with antibotics.  Then my last three, treated with my combination therapy.  	51
 And all the other points? I would like to know where you got your facts from.    What's your source on the north having more slaves? The other guy already spoke about NJ, so what are the other states that didn't give up their slaves? If you say MD or KY, remember that they were already under marshal law.   we were fighting to keep North troops out of our homes because they were actively making grabs for our land.  What land were northern troops grabbing before secession?  There was also the issues of state rights  What about State's rights?   massive taxes that were slowly driving us into crippling poverty  What taxes are these? Are you referring to the shipping tariffs?   Yes,  Sherman's March was devastating. But do you have a source for the rapes, murders, and burning people alive?   There were no saints on either side, but that doesn't mean the south was fighting for the right thing?       Well, it is if you're talking about The Stormlight Archive. In the real world though...   No silly that's the other guy.   I am a stick!   Can you translate the first sentence of Genesis for me?   5'9. My dad is 6', and my mom is 5'. I guess I'm lucky I'm not shorter.   Nope, gap year before college. 18-19.   Not eligible because I was on a gap year trip. Change it to let me in and I would sign right up!   If that was the primary grievance, why did the disengagement from Gaza lead to more conflict?   How about Jews have the right of return to Israel, and Palestinians have the right of return to Palestine? Is that such a difficult concept?    It comes from a coding behavior, where the asterisk can stand for anything. For example, searching "re\*" will give you any word that begins with "re", like red, read, reddit, or redemption. So searching "trans\*" gives you trans, transperson, transman, transwoman, etc. It has evolved to mean any permutation of the word trans so they don't all have to be mentioned.    And strange considering a nation which did not allow its people to freely leave the nation allowed Jews to leave by the hundreds of thousands from 1948-1980s.  OMG, do you actually believe this? Rofl. There was a massive Jewish migration to Israel after the collapse of the soviet union even though they are allowed to leave the whole time? You might type well, but you're still crazy.   You misunderstood what I was saying.  I don't think I did, considering your next sentences.   The Messiah is (sic) perfect  No, he will not be.  Humans are not perfect.   Very true. And the Messiah will be human.   The Messiah would have been able to follow the OT laws perfectly.  Nope, as I said, the Messiah will be human, no need to be perfect.   Of course Jews still follow those laws, but the entire point of the OT was what?  To teach us, of course. After all it is called the Teaching.  They also don't believe in Jesus. That is a concept which is part of the entire point of Christianity.  No, Judaism, is not Christianity - Jesus. The theology, even just about the Messiah, is very, very different.      The laws of the OT were so impossible for human beings to follow, they were meant for a perfect being; The Messiah (as Christians and Jews see it)  No, Jews do not believe this. The laws are for all Jews.   The first fruits   No, read the text carefully. Able gave up the *first* of his flock, while Cain gave of the fruits of the ground. There is a specific herbrew word for first fruits, bikurim, that is not used. Sacrifices are supposed to be from what you can produce, but what does it say about a gift when you don't give it from your best?   Because this wasn't about meat vs. veggies, it is about the best vs. the mediocre. Able gave his best, Cain gave his regular stuff. Which would you regard as a better gift?    This is because Judaism/Jews predate the modern separation between religion and ethnicity. The best way to think about Judaism is that it is a set of laws for a tribe, the Jewish people. The tribe got dispersed and carried their rules with them. You are part of the tribe if you were born into it by its rules, or you gain nationality by becoming a citizen - in modern times, convert.  Does that make sense?   Now for your other points:      They still are Jewish. Someone can be Jewish, no practicing, or even having rejected the religion and their family lineage is not traced back to eastern Europe, or it's a weak connection which normally wouldn't be used to identify race. It doesn't make sense.   First, Jews trace lineage back to the expulsion from Israel, not to eastern Europe. Only a subset of Jews, Ashkenazim, are from Eastern Europe.  Second, the connection isn't so much used to identify race as your national/tribal affiliation. Think of it like this: Once you gain American citizenship, all your children are American citizens no matter where they are born. All their children, your grandchildren, are American even if they never enter America. Now just have the extra step that it must be your mother, not any American, and you've got a rough equivalency.  I just don't get how if I marry a jewish girl who's father is a north African Jew, mother is christian Caucasian. We get married and ignore all religion. Our kids would be Jewish?  See the nationality explanation above. The only difference is that for your kids to be American you have to register their birth an the embassy, but for Judaism is automatic. (Minor point: She would not be Jewish by traditional Jewish laws, so many Jews would not think she was Jewish and therefore her children would not be either.)  What is your thoughts on people saying something negative towards Israel as, 'Those Israeli...?'  It's as good (bad) as any other prejudice is. The problem is that many people say this to cover up anti-Semitism, and you only have to prod an inch for it to come out. It makes Jews assume that its not said with good intentions.   Exactly the title. I followed the guide for step: extended, and tried to do everything exactly as they said. But whenever I boot up skyrim try to load and old save or start a new game, I immediately get a CTD. Any ideas?  Edit: [Here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LspA1T2d8ZYBY7LIcJA5VGPjrpk9bRx8aQZsFFhBtEg/edit?usp=sharing) is the Papyrus log. I'm sure something went wrong, I just don't know what.    Honestly, she sounds contrite and probably means well, but she doesn't deserve you. She doing this just to relieve her own guilt, not for you at all. Never talk to her again.  On the other hand, do remember that you weren't exactly being played, and that the person you were talking to was probably real, even though the pictures of her were not.  Take the lessons you learned over the years and apply them to the other things in your life. Good luck!   No, it would not at all, as evidenced by Deutoronomy 18.   while putting zero effort in understanding the fact that blood sacrifice is a huge part of the atonement of sin for the Jews  Because it is not true.   In Judaism, if their prophecy doesn't come to pass.  If their *positive* prophecy didn't come to pass. A negative prophecy can be averted by repentance, which is why all those you mentioned are still considered prophets.   1. Wikipedia: People accuse Israel of the motive, but no evidence. 2. RT: 3 buildings were destroyed for a reason unspecified. No buildings have been built there before or since. Includes a blatant lie: "All previous destruction of Palestinian homes in the E1 zone has resulted in Israeli settlement construction." There is no Israeli settlement construction in E1. 3. A bunch of links; only one mentions this topic. It is an Haaretz editorial, which only says this behavior is "historic." Again no examples. 4. A video containing a 30 second clip stating that farms are being "bulldozed by settlers to build illegal settlements," No sources, no details, wrong information. (Settlers don't have bulldozers, the army does.) And Press.Tv is not a trustworthy source, IMO.  5. Israel bulldozing illegal West Bank settlements  Look, I think the current settlement policy is a horrible idea and wish there was a change of leadership in the Israeli government. But opposition should be based on truth, not lies.   Of course. As I said, Rashi is not commenting on the preposition, but the mention of first of the flock, but not first of the fruit.   Not me, but he emphasized it to show that is says "of" not "first of." That is the distinction.   Because giving a gift that is not your best shows that you don't value the person you're giving to. The same principle applies to sacrifices to God.   What? One says first and one does not, it has nothing to do with the preposition. That is what Rashi comments on.   Name one time a Palestinian house was bulldozed so that a settler can build on it.   Because ISIS is nowhere near the border with syria.   It is downloadable only, there is no way to transfer it.   Pre-zoloft: Yes  Post-zoloft: No. Unless I haven't done so for a week or more.    Yes, they should. But in the views of some, France does not.    Wouldnt be so bad if the settlements were on empty land.  They are.    False. It was better than Christian Europe, sure, but nothing like without persecution.   Over 150,000 Palestinians have been forced out of Area C over the years  Source?    Certainly it has significance. The polytheist/Atheist would make a similar cry against claims of monotheism as a way to box you in from using your own text and history to explain/define what you beleive about God.   What?  No. You don't have to accept what is written with respect to Christianity as true but to reject it out of hand as part of the argument itself is disingenuous. Like the Moslem, you a Jew can claim it has been corrupted or misinterpreted/manipulated.   I am not claiming this. You are claiming as proof that Jesus forgiving sins means he is God. I am saying that the only thing we know is that Jesus **says** he forgive sins. Unlike everything else in the NT, this is something he said, not something he did. Therefore, this is not a proof.  Because the Op self identifies as a Moslem and that was how my response begin. Jews clearly make different arguments.   Looks like we pretty much make the same argument here...    It has no significance because it is the central claim that is being disputed.   Others : Jesus is not God!  You: But what about healing others, mastering nature, forgiving sins and raising from the dead? [This shows he is God!]  Others: Many other prophets healed others, mastered nature, said God forgave sins and raised from the dead. These do not make Jesus unique.   You: But Jesus forgave sins of people directly, showing he is God!  Others: That is the claim that the NT is making, and is tautological. For Jesus to forgive sins, he must be God. The only proof we have of this, even through the NT itself, is Jesus saying so. Claiming to forgive sins does not make Jesus unique.  Make sense?  He also is reported to have said others after will do these and much greater things (JN 14:12) so not being unique isn't the significant qualifier.  Ok, then why did you say that these acts are ignored? And even so, we're talking about people **before,** not after.    The only two ways we'll ever get it is if God reveals it directly or we build a time machine. Neither seem likely anytime soon, but we can hope!   Huh? He's not trying to prove that this happened, just that it is not shifting the goalposts like you claimed.   You're just going back to Jesus is God again. The things the NT claimed he did were done by all the other prophets and did not make him unique, aside from him saying that he is God.    Elijah and Elisha. Go through their stories, they are pretty interesting. Note that they did not "claim to forgive sin," but claimed that "one's sins were forgiven by God." Subtle difference.   It doesn't. It is an argument against your disproof.    Yeah, fan-fiction is usually substandard and bastardizes the original material. Shouldn't be surprising.   C.E. and B.C.E. were first used extensively by Jews in order to reference the Gregorian calendar without having to reference Jesus. The argument over whether it is "our lord" or "the lord" is ultimately irrelevant, since both are a direct contradiction of Judaism. Taking your title literally, do you believe Jews should not use C.E. and B.C.E in their own writings and lessons?   You could not say the same about God, because God by definition has always existed (YHVH probably means something like The Eternal) and exists outside of what He created (see the Kabbalistic take on the creation story). Therefore, God can be excluded as per-existent, and the waters cannot    Rashi is saying that if you're taking it literally, you must think that the first sentence reads "In the beginning of [all]" with the all omitted. But if it was the beginning of everything, there could not have already been water! Therefore, the sentence does not have an all and indicates that the story is not literal.   Which ones?   Then why didn't they make peace before there were any settlements?   So as long as the soldiers don't bear your insignia, then you're not attacking anyone? I bet you think that Russia wasn't "engaging in war" in eastern Ukrain either.   They are quite open to inspection  Hahahahaha   The Palestinians, whose only real crime is to live in the occupied territories and got caught in the middle of it all, bear little responsibility for those wars,  Look up [Haj Amin Al-Husseini](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haj_Amin_al-Husseini) and then say that again with a straight face.   Arming Hezbollah and Hamas and encouraging them to use those weapons are not "causing a war"?     I can't decide whether you're serious, in which case you know so little you shouldn't be commenting on this, or not, in which case I have no idea what you're trying to say.  If it's the former: The tunnels made are built by Hamas dozens of feet underground, lined by cement to hold them up, and take months to dig. The exits are only dug just as fighters are exiting to make sure that it is not found. And you think these are tunnels for the poor workers who want to work in Israel? Just FYI   What exactly do you think tunnels into Israel are for? There are no checkpoints on that border, but border crossings, like for two separate countries.    You must have a really bad spanish teacher, the o and a mean male and female should be one of the first things you learn.   No reason as to why... I'll message the mods. anyway, here was the full post:   Edit: It's been approved, yay!      Again, this is especially not helpful for the bar/club question.  I think this thread was deleted, because it is not showing up on new...oh well.   Of course there isn't one magical way, but we don't want to come across too strongly or be an asshole, so "just take a risk" or "put yourself out there" isn't helpful. This advice is how we get in the "friendzone" or going home without a date in the first place. How do you do it?    There have been a couple of threads up on how we do act. We all know that neither the RedPill approach or the Nice Guy approach is the right one, but we don't know *how* to show interest without being seen as creepy or aggressive. So here's the thread where you give us all advice! What is the difference between aggressive and confident? How do you hit on people without being a PUA? What are the signals that tell you that the girl wants you to go further or to stop?  We know a lot about what not to do, but what **can** we do?  Here are some specific questions, and I'm sure that some other shy guys have more!  Situation: Bar or club  1. I see someone attractive that I want to hit on. What are ways to show interest? What is a good way to start a conversation? I've seen ways that seem rude (getting in their body space, bumping into them on purpose and then introducing yourself, etc.), but is there a positive way of getting and maintaining attention?    2. While dancing, how to start dancing with someone without breaking boundaries they might have? I have heard girls complain more than once about guys getting to touchy, and I've seen girls willingly start to grind immediately. How to tell the difference?  Situation: A friend   1. I have a friend or a close friend that I am developing feelings for or am already interested in. I have no idea whether they like me back. How do I convey this without being too creepy or violating boundaries? What level of touching is ok before having an explicit conversation?   2. I have a friend or a close friend that I am developing feelings for or am already interested in, and I think they are returning my feelings. What are the appropriate steps to take? What is a good way to bring it up, and what is a good way to back out if I'm wrong?  Situation: An acquaintance or passerby  1. I see someone on public transport, on the street, a diner, etc. Is there any way to approach without being a creep? There's more than one article or thread we've read that women don't like being seen as sex objects everywhere they go, so this is a fine line to walk.  2. I have a distant crush on someone I see fairly regularly, like class or work. We might say hi once in a while. What is a good way to approach for the first time? Is it better to try being a friends first, or to ask immediately for a date?   I'll add anymore if people give me some!  One last thing: We don't want to be Nice Guys, but we're shy because we don't want to be like the assholes we see and that our female friends complain about. We are invested in our identity of being the nice, responsible person, and we don't necessarily want to change that outside of being less shy. As the threads on /r/AskMen have shown, the messages being sent by both society and people around us are confusing, to say the least. We want to be a nice person as well as get hookups/dates/relationships, depending on the individual, but not be creeps.   Please share your general advice as well as for the situations I described above!    Funny thing, it actually is a Jewish fast day today. It is one of six on the Jewish calendar, including yom Kippur. You clicked on a shitpost and learned something new today! Comment if you want to know more. :)   Funny thing, it actually is a Jewish fast day today.  It is one of six on the Jewish calendar, including yom Kippur.   You clicked on a shitpost and learned something new today! Comment if you want to know more.  :)    Because this puts the final nail in the coffin of a negotiated solution while Abbas is head of the PA, and also probably drives the Israeli electorate to the right for the upcoming elections.   The the ~~Joooooos~~I mean the Israelis!   So Jews had the right, in 1948, to make a country wherever they wanted? Good to know!   Please stop having so much money   The actual story is probably that Jesus was a normal baby, and the virgin part was made up so it would appeal to the people of pagan religions when Christianity began to spread.   I'll add this to my list of bad Christian prophecies. I already have two and nobody ever takes me up on them to argue. :(   Google is this decade's Bell-At T. It just sells off all your info instead of price gouging you!   Oh lordy, here we go again.  The prophecies:  Correct: 3 (but see disputations about genealogy)   Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 2  About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 4  Not a prophecy: 5  Not about the Messiah: 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29  Psalms: 6, 9, 13, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26   Psalms is not prophetic, it is very nice poetry. You can try and prove otherwise, if you want to try...  Malachi 3:1 - Probably not about the Messiah, and even if it is, their interpretation is nonsensical.  Daniel 9 - This is not about the Messiah. [See here.](http://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/counter-missionary-2/texts/daniel-9-a-true-biblical-interpretation/)  10 points - These are all pretty stupid post hoc connections. They are not "foreshadowing" of any kind.  Please, even for Christians there are better arguments than these...   The problem is that standardized testing has been shown to favor the rich.   Pray tell, what exactly did that piece of information show you?    Christianity is not the same as all theism. Yes, it has a lot of contradictions, but why don't you look at the other options instead of throwing everything out?

[Source](http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/resources/mappingpeace.pdf)   Mmmmm. does that fedora fit snugly on your head?    Through much of 2008, Israeli and Syrian diplomats discussedwith the assistance of Turkeyterms for ending the state of war that has existed between them since 1948.   In the [first source](http://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/resources/mappingpeace.pdf) quoted in wikipedia. Your move.   Before I even get to your argument, what does anything have to do with Syria?   In historical terms, Israel and Syria have been in a state of war since 1948  [Source](http://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_syria_the_view_from_israel141). I just picked one off Google, there are a lot more. **You are wrong.**   I can concede this logic is sound, but I don't think that this would be done unless another goal was achieved as well. Otherwise it is politically too risky.   why does Israel has the right to break the air space of another country, to draw bombs on it infrastructures and move out  **Because they are at war, and the IDF is attacking military targets.** How long will it take to get this through your head? This is what happens in war. If they don't want this to happen, they should finally make peace.  When Hamas send it rockets from Gaza with almost zero casualties, Israel destroyed whole gaza and killed thousands, Oh yeah I forgot that was totaly self defense....  Because civilians were under attack, and one of the primary purpose of a state is to defend it's residents. Again Syria is totally allowed to attack Israel military bases (not civilians like they did in previous wars), but they know they will be utterly crushed.    Israel is not at war with Syria the last time I checked.   You are wrong.   Since the 70's? Since Israel was founded.   Since when is attacking a military target of a country you're at war with illegal?  Of course there would be a reaction! Syria can react however they want, but they know any further provocations would result in a crushing defeat.   Because every other country would hit civilian areas and kill people. No casualties have been reported.   He might be an asshole, but he is also correct.   But it doesn't make sense to destroy air defense in a targeted airstrike, because Israel gets around the anti-air batteries in different ways. Assad will just replace the S-300s.   Israel and Syria have been at war for *over 60 years.* Why the fuck do you think that this has anything to do with ISIS?   And what evidence do you have for that?   Of course not. There are two targeted strikes, probably aimed at weapons for Hezbollah, and that's it.   Did the person you applied to say anything about right or wrong? I think you have preconceived opinions that you're pushing on others.   Knowing the IAF, it probably didn't happen. If it did the IDF will tell the Israeli public sometime today.   Because anti-Assad = pro-Isis! I forgot that the world was black and white, thanks for reminding me.   Two boxes and two people. So much cooperation.  Why is this news again?   PC and Wii U all the way   It's about Jerusalem being restored. I don't see what is so complicated here...   No, but I would like to :P   Thanks! do you have a link to that?   Oh well, thanks anyway.   Damn,  I didn't think of that.  Do you know of any good cheaper ones?    I have the s340. Is there any way to install an optical drive?    oooo, I get it now, especially since I read the motherboard manual. I put the psu in, and the rest will be tomorrow!     don't forget to install the if shield  Now I'm nervous, and I can't find anything on google. You're probably making a joke...at least I hope so!

  You can't get a refund just because you didn't like it  I disagree here. I buy a kindle book, I can return it. I buy digital album from Amazon, I can return it. Amazon doesn't ask me why and how far I got into the book (they ask, but for survey purposes). You buy a book from B N, you can return it back, even if you read it.  Some people always going to abuse the system, that's part of doing business. some people are taking third refill and throw the full cup to the trash.    You are paying for an experience  I'm not paying to watch a movie, I'm paying for having a good time. I'm not paying for words on paper, I'm paying to enjoy reading a book. If I didn't have a good time, I didn't get my money worth. Sure, it's partly my problem, but it's also partly the seller problem.   Guess what. Make good music, make good movies and good games, perform good shows and 99% of the people won't ask for refund. In fact, your business will double because people won't be afraid to take a chance and try your experience.   **Most people aren't trying to game the system**.   that is really a luxury, not a right  Of course. I never talked about some basic human right or whatever. Just something that I expect from businesses I work with.   OP, do you know this guy? if so, please tell him to contact me.        -- Joe Nasa, chief recruiting officer.   Yeah, I don't understand the other responses in this thread. You buy a product, any product, you are not happy with it, whatever the reason might be, you should be able to return it and get a refund.       I don't think it's a fair comparison. Hannibal, the films, had only two legit movies: the Silence of the Lambs and Reg Dragon (the other films were written just to cash in on tSotL success). In both of them, Hannibal isn't the main character.   In fact, Anthony Hopkins Oscar winning performance in tSotL was limited to 15 minutes only (second shortest performance to win an Oscar). So the fact that he made a legendary villain in such a short screen time, spending most of it behind bars, says a lot about the actor and the writing/directing.  TV Hannibal gives lots of time to explore the character and his motivation. 2 seasons in, where the second half of each season is devoted to Will/Hannibal conflict, gives a lot to work with.  TV Hannibal also had enough time to introduce another character: Dr. Bedelia Du Maurier (Hannibal's psychiatrist) which is a whole new avenue of character exploration. And on that note, I also like to add that TV Hannibal can allow itself to be very slow with lots and lots of one-on-one talks.   With 2 psychiatrists (Hannibal, Du Maurier), 1 psychology professor (Bloom) and 1 criminal profiler (Graham) (edit: I'm adding +1 psychiatrist as Chilton) - almost every conversation feels like a therapy session. So no wonder we understand the characters better.  The TV show main challenge is exactly the opposite: keeping some mystery to the character (which I think they are doing a great job at).     Boyd said it: just admit you want to win.   I'm still waiting for someone to correct me instead of just d/v. In fact, the top answer is the same as mine:   Transsexuals have had surgery. Transgender have not.   Exactly what I said. Plus, not all Transgender will have surgery, while Transsexuals are actively working towards it.      Sounds a lot like my gf.   I'm scared to click any of the link. I'm gonna wait a while before coming back to this thread. # scarred for life   I'm with you on that idea. I don't see it as a white problem and it certainly didn't start with white people. No borders will make the world better off.    More like:   Please choose your nationality...

They work to change their gender, usually through medical intervention. It's a medical condition (GID).   Transgenders usually just switch and play with their gender. Move back and forth. It's more of a social identity/challenge and less physical/medical issue.   Transsexuals know their true (mental) gender, it's not what they were born with, and they are working to achieve it. Transgenders, however, don't commit to their true gender, and they feel comfortable in both genders (or don't feel comfortable in any of them).     whatd u do c  I'm assuming c is short for cunt.

Yeah, I was annoyed also. I mean, you got fucking Snowden for an interview, why waste time making stupid jokes? but I think the interview advanced well. He's a comedian, so I guess humor is his comfort zone, which is understandable and it's not like I know any better about these sorts of stuff.   Overall, he got the message a cross and wasn't afraid to criticize Snowden/NYT. I also liked that Snowden didn't try to sugarcoat what they called "the fuck-up". He simply said mistakes happen, and being free also means dealing responsibly and accepting those mistakes, instead of silencing everyone.   Is there a way to order it online?      Most govs don't care, don't have the budget nor the tech nor the connections and influence over tech companies to pull off this kind of surveillance program. Also, some of them truly believe it's wrong. I'm sorry America, you are on your own (maybe with the UK, Russia and China close behind ).   I'm not sure what would be the definition of superpower, but the Israeli army is considered to be on the top 15 in the world.   http://www.globalfirepower.com/countries-listing.asp  It is very powerful, especially in the context of OP's argument.

Edit: yes.   I was disappointed the hashtag didn't have any results.   I'm Joe Disney and I would love to buy this story. Can't believe none of my writers thought of this (I'm looking at you Bob Pixar).   Yep, that's exactly how I do it. I also want to mention that the leftover pulp is great for cooking. You can keep it in the fridge and later add it to many dishes. I also make oatmeal milk the same way (skip the soaking or just soak for 10 minutes).   Sleeping is white privilege.     That's right tumblr, I said the "o" word.  Horror in shock? Oppression is probably the most (over)used word in tumblr. If we make a word cloud from tumblr posts, oppression will take half the fucking screen.   If you gave germans your word and they were stupid enough to release you, you are even more stupid by returning back to the camp. Honor got nothing to do with it.   If you can't walk the walk, at least talk the talk. Self delusion is easier that way.   You know when you rewatch a film you liked and you think to yourself: god, why did I like it, it's awful? The opposite happened to me when I recently rewatched the first film. I though: hmm, why didn't I like it the first time? the film isn't bad at all.   What's the total length of the trail? Great work and awesome video.    Right.   Winning an argument - something that wasn't accomplished on the internet since 1998.   It was in the front page few hours ago. Dude, keep up, and stop taking breaks from reddit.   I'm thinking Nightcrawler.      It's like saying that you are inspired by athletes' quotes only if they won the first place in every event they ever participate.   People may struggle with depression every single day in their life. They fight the urge to end it all more often than not. The fact that they lost just one time, doesn't write off all their struggle and erase all their wisdom to that point.  Successful people with depression is, all by itself, very inspirational. A successful career is hard work day in day out. Regardless on how it's ended.  Anyway, all that besides the point because as other have mentioned, it's not his quote and he was a terminal patient who decided to euthanize himself.   The right way of quoting that is either putting the character's name (Sean Maguire) or the writer's name (Matt Damon, Ben Affleck). If there's a picture of Robin Williams, then it should be RW in character.   In movies it's more common to use the character's name because there are sometimes multiple writers and they aren't always that known. Where in books it's a mix between the character and the author.    Quick (serious) question: he says *entered* Africa. Did they migrate to Africa from somewhere? I always thought that Africa is where humanity started. Or is he just using entered as evolved?       When a popular non economic publication says: *the stock picking era is over*, it's probably a good time to start picking stocks.      PRIVILEGE!!!    Also, again, privilege.  Nailed it.         Or... you used to believe a lot more pranks back then.     it takes practice which he doesn't seem to put in from the free throw line and never has  Maybe. I don't know his routine and I can't/won't defend him. So not putting any effort might be the case. Maybe he doesn't give a fuck, plain and simple. What I'm saying is that it's not likely. I also say, that as a general phenomena, we don't see correlation between improving shooting percentage and practice (at this level, I'm not talking about amateur players).   Well, I can't tell specifically about Rondo. I mean, the guy is a pro player, he has any motivation in the world to be successful at his profession. And if it's something as easy as practicing more, he's probably doing that already.  He used to hit 60% at the start of his career and fell to 30% this season. This is either an abnormal reading (same as LeBron getting 4 points in the finals, or Kobe getting 80 points, but on a larger scale), a new trend, or he might hit a mental wall in his performance.   Either way, I can't believe that simply training more or shooting extra 100 shots after a game (which he probably does) is what's gonna make a difference here. It might build confidence which is good, maybe take some pressure off, but it's not like this will improve his eye/hand coordination by 100%.   TV show subs are best left unsubscribed during the season and visited on demand.    The best one is when he talks to (and shoots) the fake cop in Outlaw.   Maybe Im crazy, or Im just having a hell of a day but did you just give me an order?   Yeah, you are right of course about the LoLN. I should have added that it's given as a way to explain my point, but not as something that mathematically describes the game.  Anyway, my point is that player's stats are pretty much locked in a tight range, and it takes practice to keep it that way. Saying that players with low % should just practice more, is being a little unfair to them. Most of the players in the league train close to what humanly possible with guidance from the best trainers in the world.    Put the shots in and get better at a skill that is required for your fucking job  It's really not that simple. If you (or any other human being) start playing basketball regularly, you'll reach your average numbers pretty quickly ([Law of large numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)). After that, it'll be very hard to change those averages. Doesn't matter if you'll get $1m a month, if you shoot x%, you'll shoot x%. Sure some players see different stats over the years, but they are few and the change isn't very significant (1SD plus/minus). This change isn't often contributed to practice but to other factors like health, fatigue or just abnormal readings.  And some anecdote: Kobe Bryant is probably [the hardest working player in the past 2 decades](http://www.businessinsider.com/kobe-bryant-work-ethic-2013-2?op=1). His [FT% ranges](http://i.imgur.com/XBJcKOS.png) from 82% to 85% without any trend. His FG% ranges between 42% to 46%. That's extremely narrow range for 20 years pro career. It's like none of this practice really mattered.  So the fact is that practice around the clock is needed just to keep you on your averages.    Yeah, but I don't put automatic trailing command. I adjust it manually. For example, I can put the stop below the swing low. If the position still alive after few days, I might place the stop based on weekly chart. If the position moves up (or down if it's short) I might use ATR. If the stock had a trend that never violated X days moving average, I might use that line as a moving stop.  I must say that in my experience this is **a low probability** setup. Meaning, 8-9 times out of 10 I stopped out at a worse price than if I had just liquidized at target. However, the 1-2 exceptions usually make up for it. The hard part is keep doing that until it pays off.   Plot twist: the CEO of HRC is named Tammy.   One cannot. You gotta trust the source. Most hacks that replace libraries and executables (i.e. dll, exe files) do some kind of memory scan/write. Those commands are identified by virus scanner as malware. Most key-gens will be picked up also.  Virus scans are good for legitimate files that you aren't sure about the source. For example, when you download Windows installation (without the loader). Or when someone in some forum uploads a file that you aren't sure about.   Good for him. Any comedian that's worth something gotta upset somebody. He's lucky the bar for upsetting (or should I say triggering) isn't very high today.   Jamie Oliver (site or ebooks).   They're good, but you'll get positive results for some legit hacks.   For me it depends on different factors. First, some of my systems are pure quant, so I always take 100% at target. Second, with some of the manual picks, I tend to place a stop near the target and let it run. The longer the position survive the more comfortable I am with wider stops (my trend is validated). Third, if the position is too big, which usually means that I miscalculated the volatility/risk, I'll trim large part of it at target (getting the risk wrong typically means I got other things wrong). And last, if it's the end of a quarter (like today) I tend to be more conservative and book profits early.    That's probably because how effective Google is in promoting recently published pages. If your searh term matches a recent page title, you'll get it as one of the top results.

In addition to what was said by others, those war refugees will probably be able to return home once the fights are over. And if not their exact home, then at least their country.   Palestinian refugees are currently denied this opportunity.     I live outside the US, so the default maps aren't good for me. I read that you can use open-maps?  That depends on where you live. [OSM](https://www.openstreetmap.org/about) is created by the community, so street names/locations/tracks/trails will be as updated as users updating it.   Check the website and see if it's good enough for you (probably is). If not, you can either buy Garmin maps or try other methods to obtain those maps.  Just a quick addition: you can download OSM to Garming from [here](http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/).   Okay, i'll be a minority here: I always listen to music. Doesn't matter if I ride on my road bikes or mtb (or hiking or running or basically any other activity but swimming) I'm always with music. I simply can't imagine myself doing something without a soundtrack, that's a big part of my experience.   People say it's dangerous and you should listen to your bikes and the traffic. I'm not arguing with that, I guess there's a point here.   Gap: stocks that open considerably above or below yesterday's close. It's wrong to give a hard number here, but basically you want to start with stocks that opens with 5% gap or more. For volatile stocks you want a number higher than that.  Volume: you want here also a considerably high volume. Lots of money changing hands mean the stock has a potential to move a lot during the day.  A good time and place to start is earning season, and look at companies that report [before the open](http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111 f=earningsdate_todaybefore) or [after yesterday's close](http://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=111 f=earningsdate_yesterdayafter).      The statement 'university is a waste of time and money' is wrong. You can argue that **certain** degrees are wasteful for **certain** people with **certain** goals AND with different abilities.

High IQ is a burden, sometimes I wish mine was lower so I could interact with the common minds.      Here's a relevant thread from the other day: http://www.reddit.com/r/bicycling/comments/30i35n/sub500_cycling_wardrobe/    Thumbs up to the businessman who saw the potential in this market. I would cringe just by the thought of making such a sign, so I hope he overcharges them.    Is the quality of the bib shorts good enough? [this one](http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/2015-Cannond-Garmin-Cycling-jersey-and-bib-shorts-men-only-Top-Jersey-bib-tights-maillots-bicicletas/1442107_32281859408.html) is ridiculously cheap.      this.   Kindle, or any other ebook reader (and some good books to go with it, of course).    Rachel also says "justified" to Drew Thompson while Raylan is there, in probably one of the best episodes of the show: Decoy.   That how you Justified it?   Well, I look at it differently. I don't think it's a matter of friendship or respect. I think they have a strong bond. They feel connected. Same age, same childhood, similar hard families, weakness to the same woman... and almost similar fate (Raylan can easily image himself in Boyd's shoes and vice versa). They were also exposed to each other (Raylan letting Boyd leave after his father died, Boyd taking him to Nick Augustine). So I would say it's closest thing they have to a family.   He aplexed Mike one time too many.   This comment gave me rage chemicals when I read it.   The movie is an almost 20 years old sci-fi and still holds well today. On top of comedy, action and drama blend there's also great timing and a very nice soundtrack. Not a single dead minute in that movie.   It's also worth noting that it was the second movie Luc Besson directed and wrote in English (after Leon: The Professional, which is also worth watching in case anybody missed it). Great launch to his career.    Just to add to the snacks point. You should plan on consuming at least 200 cal every hour, preferably 100 cal every 30 minutes. So make sure you get enough, and time your eatings.       You need to be a goddamn murder wizard to pull it off.   Yeah, like Hannibal. Think of him as a super villain and it all makes sense.           I don't think the "no experience" is related to his physical and weaponry ability. You can be a super soldier, black op, spy and half alien. But if you never worked at a county police, never filled forms, never talked on the radio the way police officers do, never picked up the language, you'll be spotted immediately. So unless they cover that particular point, it's obviously unrealistic.   I personally don't mind, because that's the premise of the show, that's the foundation. So by the end of the first episode, you either except it or you won't enjoy the story.     Yeah, there's some weird vibe to it that I can't put my finger on. Anyway, it also gets better through the seasons, which is good. I didn't like the first season that much, but the writing and action got better and better.   Do you remember reddit circa January 2015? fun times.   That's the correct answer. Any business can combine projects and roll loses, the IRS isn't stupid, eventually you'll have to pay. This done mainly to avoid paying participants based on profits.    If only murdering women was as challenging as killing the queen.    But how can we hear if our ears aren't real?    The Office at its highs offered more than TV. It was, as [Louis CK put it](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/n9tef/hi_im_louis_ck_and_this_is_a_thing/c37exfl), so human. It was somethign that would have made Dickens beat his ugly wife in anger.   You summed it up well. I enjoyed the first season, but I can't say I'm looking forward to the second season for those exact reasons. Another show that fall down this hole is The Affair.    I think it's much more complicated than that. [](#s "He's being an asshole, right. But he's also a scapegoat, a victim, an outcast and totally depended on their good will. He built trust, and he was able to being an asshole in a personal way.") I think it was written nicely.    Person of Interest is the only 20+ ep/season I'm following. I think Arrow is also nice, but I lost interest. And I think 20+ episode format helped me, it's just too tiresome to follow.    And he keeps running. I bet he's the number 1 running actor, with more mileage his belt than some professional athletes.    ...until you realize you are down to 80PSI because of a puncture.       I bought used bikes last month. The first thing I asked after the size was: 'I hope it doesn't come out weird, but did you, by any chance, molested a child or participated in child molestation or the general elections?'   2 party system magnifies the problem. And I didn't say I want to "get rid of money and politics", I was pointing out that unlimited money fueled elections skews the familiarities of candidates.   Let me ask you this, do you think there's a significant downside to cap each candidate spending, let's say $200M, and also cap the ad time?   This works well in many democracies and I don't think people in those countries see it as limiting.     Also because politicians who won't support the rich guys have very little chance of even becoming known. Especially in a 2 party system, in which the party as a whole has a strong interest to promote the people who can bring the most money in.   Yeah, they can just let the user chose measurement unit.   Probably the same for Neil Young. Except the quality difference.   This is so deep. To me, it represent how tumblr users, white young women who don't stop talking, see themselves.    Can't take credit for that, just sharing.     property is used to exploit others while possession is not  If I'm not mistaken, property creates value beyond personal need, i.e. any means of productions. So any land/factory/machinery/computers that are used to create stuff to be sold to other people are considered properties, and therefore, according to anarchists/communists cannot be privately held but belong to the common.    Just a quick edit: maybe not belong to the common, but to all the workers who are working on that property.       Exactly.    That's very nice, gz. How many breaks did you take? I'm always conflicted on how to time mine.       I have a ton of miles on my back. Three buldging disks (a tear in one), stenosis of the nerve route and spondylolisthesis. I suffer from sciatica and after games I often cant sit in the car on the drive home, which has made for some interesting rides. Most nights Im bothered by severe cramping in both calves while I sleep, a result of the same damn nerve routes, and the list goes on somewhat comically. Thats what you deserve for playing over 1,300 NBA games. By no means do I tell you this for sympathy  especially since I see these ailments as badges of honor  but maybe I can bring some clarity.      Cool, thanks.    Frittata is easy and works well with many veggies.  Pasta in one pot is also good for veggies.  If you want just veggies and you think they are about to go bad, simply roast them in the oven or fry them. They can be freezed easily after that or serve as a side dish for almost any main course.   From what he said last year, the injuries aren't bad, he doesn't suffer pain, and he can do physical activities. It's just playing NBA is, obviously, too much to handle and probably too risky.  I'm glad he stopped playing while he's still healthy and young (relative to normal people) and I hope he'll live long and happy.   I know your post is about that badass slice, but I have a question about the commuter. What wheels/tires did you put on it? I'm thinking about converting my old road bikes to commuters.    Do you recommend any particular vacuum sealer?   Best line: their stuff is shit, but your shit is stuff.     a show that always showed things exactly as they happened  Exactly. And this scene was showed through Tony's eyes. Hence, the blackness. If you watch this scene, you'll see his POV is established few times before the ending. There are also some foreshadowing done throughout the season ("you never see it coming", "all turn black", "you don't hear the gun", etc.).   The best thing about this line is Rylan preaching to another guy, while he himself being the number one asshole in Harlen.    It's less a matter of the show being funny or not, but more a matter of structure.   **Drama** is about conflict and resolution through action or personal change that often comes through a personal discovery process and sometimes life changing choices. **Comedy** is structured to serve the "joke" (or the absurd). Comedy conflicts are often based on misunderstandings or miscommunication for a reason: they don't require tough choices and personal change to be resolved. At the end of the comedy, the characters are usually on the same place as they started.   Now, obviously this is a broad generalization, and we are lucky to have shows that are good in mixing and bending those structures.  However, in most shows is easy to tell where they lean or where they spend the most time. OitNB is drama (that is often funny). As an opposite example, Louis is a comedy (with some strong drama elements).      Link to the article in discussion: [The Irrationality of Alcoholics Anonymous - The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2015/03/the-irrationality-of-alcoholics-anonymous/386255/).  It's an interesting topic. But like both women say, there is mostly anecdotal stories (which they both use). The studies do support the social interaction that comes with AA meetings (and obviously can be arranged by other programs). The "12 steps" is however questionable. Yet it can be looked as a framework. For example, let's say I have a training program that allow people to get into shape and lose weight (that's equivalent to the social part of AA, meaning, that part that works). I also build my program around 12 steps in which I encourage the participants to reflect on the lives and what not. That might not be very helpful, but it gives some kind of framework and leveling experience.    /r/fishtank are a racist bunch!    you don't hear the sarcastic demeanor    you've already stated once that I'm perfect  Looks like someone else didn't get the sarcasm.

I remember when I was few years old, thinking to myself, while my mom was breast feeding me: "damn, tits are nice, I should play with those when I get older, but not with my mom's cause that's creepy and unorthodox, unless you are part of a culture where it's expected or maybe in a parallel universe."  I didn't know how to express those thoughts until I got to age 2.    But this exact post disproves your claim. Case in point, people not complaining about Asians making more money.   Anyway, you use an unrealistic claim ('let's say we had a perfect society') to avoid dealing with realistic issues ('we are not even close to this'). I think there's fallacy hidden here.       Hard the generalize because of different road conditions, but I would say a flat every 1000-2000 km is very reasonable and on the low side. So for you, a flat every 2-3 months is expected. If you have good tires and high pressure the only thing left really is to watch the road and hope for the best.   I didn't want to post a list to avoid giving wrong sense of confidence. A bike mechanic will be able to do the job 100% better than you and me. Since you ask, here's a very short list:  * **Wheels**: if you can you wobble it from side to side, it probably has some damage. Does it clear both sides and rotate straight? broken spokes?   * **Brakes**: worn pads. Touch the wheel or the tyre. (brakes on general are hard to test, because the cables are hidden)  * **Chain**: Rust. Can you pull it easily out of the teeth? that's usually a sign for a worn chain.  * **Pedals**: Smooth spin, rattle free.  * **Frame**: look for dents, especially at the ends of each tube. If the fork looks bent or asymmetrical, it's a big red flag.     Every few months, on 500km per month, isn't that bad.    This week I bought used bikes. The process was simple: 1. Meet with the seller, see if you spot anything wrong with the bike 2. Take it for a ride, the longer the better, so bring proper clothes, shoes and something to leave as a collateral (I left driving license) 3. If all good and the bike fits you well, arrange a second meet at local bike mechanic that will examine the bike (suggest the seller to split the bill). If the mechanic gives thumb up, complete the transaction.    For those wondering about the other 8, I was able to verify just 7:  * 2Pac  Greatest Hits (death Row, 1998)  * 2Pac  All Eyez On Me (death Row, 1996)  * Eminem  The Eminem Show (Aftermath, 2002) * Eminem  The Marshall Mathers LP (Aftermath\Interscope 2000) * The Notorious B.I.G.  Life After death  (Bad Boy, 1997) * MC Hammer  Please Hammer Dont Hurt Em (Capitol, 1990) * OutKast  Speakerboxxx/The Love Below (LaFace, 2003)    how about converting to minutes? i.e. ((12\*60+15)-(11\*60+30))/60?      I totally understand him. I mean, here's a man who can raise more money for charity than all other cyclists combined, and here's another man with feelings. And we don't want to hurt his feelings while being disrespectful now do we?   Sure thing. My two main devices are Android phone and android tablet. Usually during the day I'm with my phone, reading casually. At night I like using my tablet for better reading experience. Now, I'm not saying it's a huge issue by any means, but it's a real nice QOL. When I open my tablet, I need to skip all the posts that I already saw on my phone.   I don't think it's something that needs to be solved on Reddit's level (i.e. using the API), it's a sync between BR (much like Amazon Kindle software that can sync the last page you read in each book across all devices in which the software is installed).  Anyway, maybe a nice feature for you think about in the future versions. I'm glad to see you read and respond to users. I have tried several apps and I keep coming back to BR, it gives me the best experience so keep doing what you doing.   Because when I googled "Mark Malik seemed to have a knack for making money" 2 hours ago, the first link was to this post.    Google the first line, click the first link, repeat.         It's also not a very easy listening album. Almost no hits. They play Money, Time and Brain Damage mostly on Classic Rock stations. I always felt like those songs became hits because the album was successful, and not the other way around (album sells well because of good songs in it).   I didn't say that I know this is the case, but it's naive to assume otherwise. Like you said, unless there's a way to sniff traffic (which is probably encrypted) and prove otherwise, why people assume Amazon doesn't know what's going on *their* devices?    I know that, like other people commented, a pro thief will steal your bike if he wanted to, regardless of your lock. However, you should lock your bikes properly against *casual* thieves, which are the majority: dishonest people passing by and see an opportunity.  Against them , what you need to do is:  1. Get a decent lock/chain that can't be cut easily with a cutter. Small U lock are great, but they also give you less flexibility.   2. Get a massive lock, that isn't a combination lock.  3. Lock the bike to an object that can't be broken, cut or easily removed from the ground.  4. A combination of u lock and cable is good.  5. Use the U lock to wrap the object, the inside frame and the front wheel. Use the cable to wrap the object, back wheel, and rear triangle frame and maybe the chair if you have enough room below it to pass the cable.     Some people are going too far to avoid traffic on their commute route.    I have the app installed on several devices, and I usually browse with visited posts hidden (on a side note, I find it much less convenient now that toggling this option is on the third menu level). When I switch to another device I need to skip the posts I already read. Is there a way to sync this?  Thanks. Awesome app.   I'm sorry, but you have to assume they have. Unless you completely block internet connection on your kindle, you have to assume that Amazon reads *everything* on your device, including your epub, pdf and text files.   And just to add, they don't do anything with mobi/awz4 files, but I bet they are aware of their existence on the device. There's simply little they can do about it.       -- Michael Scott   I really wish more people knew about the Beatles.     My dog is sweet and loving, but if you grabbed her leg and twisted, she would bite you  And here's the thing, even if the dog just *feels* you gonna do that, it will bite. They operate on instincts.

Rumor has it, the only reason Hitler didn't invade Russia before 1941 was because of an epic rap battle this guy had with the German soldiers on the border, claiming he had every right to be there and not make way.

I once bought a sweater with a zipper with a colored chinese looking mythical dragon stitched into the back. It was awesome and super expensive for me at the time. Sadly it got stolen at a party a few months after I bought it.

My "white whale" is a muppet show of some sorts that got recorded over my vhs tape of the episode of pokemon where ash meets Snorlax. (The tape is broken because of rewinds)  There was a scene with a muppet that was showering, and he peed in the shower and it was hilarious as a ten year old. I remember me and my cousin competing over who could hold their laughs the longest.     Every child should grow up with an animal companion. So as to learn that animals are people too.    I think they are probably like humans. Some are friendly and some are evil bastards.   Really? This was a part of a popular kids-show called "FF" when I was a kid.    This. The Sandsnakes might be the worst portrayed characters of the show.    I see this everywhere. However they are not more sadistic than humans.   *Doctor Who  Sorry for having to be THAT person.   I loved this growing up. Doktor Mugg is a Swedish television series, named after the program's title character. The series takes place in the fictitious town Dasseborg (Outhouseburg) and revolves around toilet humor, mugg and dass being colloquial terms for toilet in the Swedish language. Other important main characters are Kapten Filling (Captain Skivvies) and Walter Closett.  Doktor Mugg tries to force the citizens to buy his invention "Pruttomobilen" ("The Fartmobile"), a mobile toilet.  **tl;dr**  The show is about a villain trying to make people buy his own product "The Fartmobile".      I don't think he is so much for income tax as a "wealth-tax". Income tax is not the most efficient in accomplishing what he wants to do, for the exact reasons you mention here.

She had a second secret email account on a separate private server whilst serving as Secretary of State. And that's a fact, easy to check out. Nothing mass-media likes to share very often. For obvious reasons.    I thought that was self explanatory...    And you think Democrats are better? Clinton has a fairly well documented history, and was really quick in deleting her secret emails on her server when it became public knowledge.   I've been there once, and the monkeys are really rude and childish. She seems to be made of the same stuff..   I'm glad to hear it. Hope is alive.

 It may look that way...but it's a massive indoor slip n slide!      "The flabby face will be refreshing" - Thanks Japan!      The situation at Martin Place in Sydney remains an ongoing one, and one from which very little concrete evidence has emerged. In fact, a statement aired on the ABC - "All we know is a crime is taking place" - remains the truest assessment of the events thus far.  And yet, here we are with this - a rushed out special 2pm print edition of the Daily Telegraph containing potentially one of the most vile, deliberately inflammatory, fundamentally wrong and wholly speculative front covers in the sordid history of Australian print media.

Thank you for pointing out another one of what I'm sure will be ripe future of errors.

You don't gotta tell her you were masturbating.    And correlation=/=causation.    And erection could have presented a problem that was previously unseen without masturbating have caused it.     Just go to the free clinic.  Use the internet.  Find where one is.   You're 17 not 5.  Be a grown up man and take care of your own penis.  Mommy doesn't own a penis and she doesn't need to take care of yours.   If she thinks you should not masturbate then she is giving poor medical advice anyway.     And stop diagnosing yourself.  You're not a doctor.  So go find one.     Yup.  I'm antiwar now.     As I'm finished here in the Philippines, I plan to start a new company.  Clean room growing conditions.  "Medical Grade" High quality custom designed genetic strains.   Mostly just waiting on it to become legal federally first.       In GA, you're required to pass a standardized test to graduate.  At least you were in the 1990s.    It didn't matter if you had all the credits and a 4.0 GPA, no test, no graduation.   I remember a few challenging it, even then, when the standardized test craze really took hold.     You don't need to tell her you were masturbating.  All you need to do is ask to visit the doctor for a private matter.  She will likely guess it has to do with your penis.  If she presses you for information, you just tell her, "If the doctor feels that you need to know, then he will tell you."   Just so you know, you're entitled to medical privacy and the doctor is required to keep your discussion confidential  as long as you aren't placing yourself in danger.    I don't think you should assume it's from masturbating.  Especially if there is no pain because injury in your penis would likely cause pain.   I think the doctor should be the one to tell you what it is.  Not your mom, or your guilt.        Look at you; all cutely linking his username to get his attention and tattle.     What are you... the hall monitor?     This is the first time I've heard of him and I'm a homosexual.     If they want to make voat.co more appealing, they gotta stop doing that.

What's for sure, is that many users there are attempting to figure out how to be not like reddit, whilst circle jerking a shitload about how they aren't reddit.      Organ re-purposing.

I slapped a "Proud supporter of the NAACP" sticker on his truck.      I don't know if it's related but the next time I saw his truck the sticker was gone but it was all dented and busted up all over.     Musta not noticed and parked it at a big meeting.       I live in Olympia Washington when I am stateside.  I am as liberal as you can get... but, because I had a small Iraq Vet sticker on side window of my truckbed cover, some "hippies" sprayed my fucking truck with shit like   GWB = HITLER   "REPUBLICINS" SUCK   BABY "KILLR"     Im a socialist for fucks sakes.

I am currently living in the rural Philippines, which is not unlike rural Indonesia.    You are correct, most cases go unfounded.  Even the doctors here are of poor quality.  They will diagnose a small child with "weak lungs" and then place that child on anti-tuberculosis medicine. When all the child had was a cough from a chest cold.    So... even when they do go see a doctor, it's likely he isn't going to know what the fuck is wrong with them.  The standard of medical knowledge is like from 1913.     im gud learnt!

I don't think you can completely discharge them with ch. 7.   I could be wrong.   Oh sure.  As I said to someone else, don't ask me if it makes you a piece of shit.  But the bankers are pieces of shit.    And anyhow,  the bank gets to write it off on taxes and we the people foot the bill for our Constitutional right.     So if I have been paying for others to utilize this, I don't really feel bad about utilizing it myself.      That's why you put some of into a car and an idiot purchase like a 4K television (that is 120hz but only supports 30 fps hdmi).    Then you just look like an idiot to the judge.

I'm trying to find it but there was a car within the last 5 or 10 years that sported non petroleum based plastics.  It's was just a gimmick for environmentalists but it shows we can do it.     We can make plastic from cannibus... it could be an economic boom if it weren't for our government getting in the way.    Tetsuo: The Iron Man.... is that you?   It really is a shame we are still using petroleum for plastic.   There are plenty of other sources for plastic that are ripe for development.  Including plants.  I believe there was a car recently that sported plant based plastics for interior pieces.   When a company enjoys record profits for decades but cannot survive a year without laying people off, we need to examine why our system is failing.

He just get kept out back, behind hell, where Satan goes to try out his collection of love slaves.   But why?   I mean... you'd think it'd be less.   More time in the cell, fewer guards needed to watch them.  Fed in the cell so no need for cafeteria seating for them..

 Wait, why not?  If we assume that poverty is the deciding factor in homicides, and consider that while 1/4 of the black population lives in poverty, only 1/13 of the white population does (using /u/AsthmaticMechanic 's numbers here), why doesn't it make sense that there would be a lot more black on black murders than white on white?  /u/idledrone6633 pointed out that there are more poor white people than that there are poor black people, /u/AsthmaticMechanic put these numbers into perspective by looking at them in terms of percentages.   If /u/idledrone6633 's argument was that poverty cannot be a factor because there are more poor white people than poor black people, then /u/AsthmaticMechanic 's post certainly answered his argument.   If they are trying to say that then they're whitewashing history.   There's an argument to be made for the reason being primarily economical (because of the degree of the industry's reliance on slave labor) and only secondarily racially motivated (dehumanization of 'the other'), but if anyone's trying to say that the main cause of the war had nothing to with slavery, they're fooling themselves!   Ooh, well put!  I'll remember that one for the next time this comes up!   Thanks!  /u/sembello: rebuttal?   Hey Kevin!  Don't worry about it!  All the best with your personal situation, and thanks for all the excellent work that you do!   Fuck, how did I not catch that mosf obvious of connections?!   Gotta say, your response made me chuckle a bit. I sort of imagine you as Ignatius J. Reilly from 'A Confederacy of Dunces'.   and will change the laws  Well, I'm sure our neighbouring galaxy will do away with those pesky laws of physics for you, no problem. If that does not work, you can always ask the Greek pantheon, or maybe Nicolas Flamel.   I'm not knocking you for your vision, you are free to believe in whatever you wish. All I'm saying is that this impulse isn't exactly a new thing. Humanity has sought ways to live forever since its beginnings. Early on these desires were mostly sated through religion ("everlasting life through our Lord and Savior"), before slowly becoming a scientific pursuit (Alchemy, anyone?) progressing towards more reliable scientific endeavors, genetic modification, for instance.  In the last couple of decades there has been vast progress in halting the process of aging. The human life span has never been as long, and it will grow longer in an exponential fashion.  Yet, let's recognize that we're in the business of prolonging life, not transcending it. In the face of the inevitable decay of the universe, we're no further than Moses with his stone tablets, or some mad scientists in his lab in the 16th century.  It does not exist now, but may likely, if it take ten thousand or ten million years what of it? If it comes from Earth or deep in Andromeda, who cares.  This is the same impulse that drives religion. No proof, just the stubborn belief that we're special, that we are the only thing since the beginning of time that has just a beginning, and not an end.  I'm not saying that it's wrong or right, I could not possibly know that. All I'm saying is that it has nothing to do with science, and everything to do with the desperation that mankind has felt ever since evolution gifted/cursed us with self-awareness, and thus the awareness of our own demise.  Personally, I believe there's a lot of value in recognizing our own mortality. For me, a perfect day spent with my loved ones is that much more significant because I know there won't be an infinite number of them. I know that this way of reasoning doesn't work for everyone though.      Believing in a space where laws of nature and logic no longer apply and you get to live forever?  Congratulations, you have just founded what we like to call 'a religion'. Make it a good one!     I just find it adorable that people think this level of outrage will last. Give it a week, discussion on the topic will be down 95%.  It has *never* not been that way.    Unless you implement reddit's favorite method for population control: eugenics ^^TM .   Don't count on it. Even if the technological progress allows for longevity, there is no such thing as "forever" in a decaying universe.  So even if science figured out how to stop all mechanisms of aging in the next few decades )(color me sceptic), all you could possibly hope for is to live a very, very, very, very, very long life.    And there one is! Amazing!  It took me less than 10 seconds to find this in your comment history:   Nevermind the fact that the current state of the USA has it that by default men are not US citizens unless they sign up for the draft. Women got all the rights and none of the associated responsibilities, and thats just the way these poisonous little radical fucktards like it.  That's a pretty neat magic trick, /u/kgtx!  	13

 She is so cute I can forgive the stupidity.   The issue in here is that you are not allowed to talk about those issues freely without getting nazi card. It is also immigration problem when you look at crime statistics and people behind them. Well it is also fault of immigration integration.  Also it is not miniority opion anymore. People start to see issues in their daily life and when they try to talk about it or bring the issues up they are called racist. And because they are called racist they dont want to talk about it anymore. Since nobody is freely talking about issues anymore, there is no healthy public conversation, instead people will vote somebody like "Finns Party". Where one of the leading figures is convicted of "provocation against people" (not really sure about the translation). So instead healthy conversation and actual tackling the issues the pro-immigration people has pushed us to this sitation where most people voted most anti-immigrant party ever.   Hooray, immigrants are such forward pushing force for nations. Seriously, people wake up, it is not rasist to call out the issues immigrants bring in, it is statistical fact and realism.   There is lot hot asian chicks, do it man!   Most of the scene groups run their own FTP servers. It is also extreme hard to get in those servers without proper referee. They have some next level security and rules too.   This still dont do same things as tiling-wm. Tmux is cool and works fine with terminal apps but try to do same with browser or any other app. Btw does OS X have multiple desktops?   Ihan validi pointti, mutta luulis ympristnriskien hoitamisen onnistuvan alle 100millin.   I still dont get it. So because Sweden is paying more to immigrants than Finland, we are not allowed to complain of the level of support we give to immigrants? I think you just want to brag, but I dont want to live in the country that has same immigrant problems as Sweden got right now.  EDIT: Difference is that you guys are proud of your immigrant status and how "human" you act, but we dont really give a shit.   I dont see why my comment has anything to do with you being swedish, but i can see you are acting like proper swedish :P   This will be cheaper anyway, because we already pay LOT for immigrants. Sometimes it is even more than regular citizens get and it has been criticized and it is one of the reasons for "Finns Party" success.  The problem with current system is that there is too many different type of social security. System needs lot people to figure out  who is allowed to have social security and how much. Calculations show we can have savings with new system because we can drop all the burocracy.   So is IRC, FTP and DC++, they are just the places where the actual releases come to torrent sites.   There was also Napster, Limewire and Kazaa?? :P   And FTP or DC++ does not?   What? Where are you from? Sound like stone age system to me.   We europeans like to believe in facts and it is statistical fact muricans are fat, get over it.   In sock!  Edit: socks has always been popular way to save money, it has done by multiple old people over years, you think your wisdom is greater than thousands of old people?   What if I told there was piracy before torrent sites.   Yeah, I was thinking OpenBSD router :3   Lievsti erikoista politiikkaa.

I was just waiting for Augustus Gloop to pop up in that water.    ...and your friend needs to be tested for diabetes.   amazing. Thanks!   This Special and Season 2 of Maron on Christmas Eve! Really hope ol' Freckleface can make an appearance on that show one day. Maron + Burr = Genius.   I do not like Nordstrom. Regin is more versatile, and there are other Rockford guys that could provide more of an offensive spark if needed. So what's the point of even calling him up?   Well, feeling better about the three goal lead, not sure why the trend is developing to back down with a two goal lead. (See game against Caps, See game against Flames)   Will Brandmeier be harassing random Wisconsinites on his podcast? Somehow, that doesn't seem quite as fun.    Listening on the WGN app (delayed)... Update: SHOWWWWWTIMMEEEEE!   How 'bout a little SHOWTIME in this shootout!?!?   Well, I thought that was funny. Have an upvote.   I really hope that Judd Sirott can get a shot in the play-by-play booth some day. The guy has so much enthusiasm, and does tons of homework before the game. I listened to him do play-by-play with the Wolves during that period of time that the Hawks were shit. He was electric with Brian Noonan.   Well, let's not pretend that Foley and Eddie O are the greatest.   Olczyk: "Here's a tip for all you young hockey players, see how Johnny Toews has his stick on the ice, you have a much higher percentage chance of scoring with your stick ON the ice."   Foley: "And with that goal the Hawks should take some momentum into the TURD period."  Then... 30 seconds of silence   Racconto the worst? I've been eating that stuff for years; the Pagliacci brand isn't bad either. Pick some up at [Serelli's!]( http://serrellisfinerfoods.com/) We used to buy jars of that stuff every Christmas Eve, there's no way that cheap-ass Centrella brand is any better.    Julie Unruh.

Oh, someday, sam, he chases them away-yay... FEEELIN' robblerobblerobble stowwow made of concrete, yeah....  What's so hard to understand here, good sir?    I suggest that you do some research about the year 1968. It was a huge turning point which led to years of many Black Chicagoans distrusting law-enforcement (among other things), and many White Chicagoans feeling unsafe in predominately Black neighborhoods. At the time these feelings were justifiable, but they've persisted for decades.    You didn't hear? [Rob Zombie is not fun anymore.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW0KrpmfcTU)   That music just brings visions of [this pregame animation.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmFkbxUkGo4)   Do we really need to keep referring to Carcillo as an "enforcer?" Yes, Rosenbloom calls him an "agitator" in the article, and that is what Carcillo is. Yet I've seen a dozen articles since last weekend stating that the Hawks have brought back their "enforcer."  Is Carcillo really going to police play on the ice? If a John Scott-type boards one of our guys, what is he going to do about it other than make a bunch of noise and take an undisciplined penalty?   From what I remember Carcillo's fights were usually retaliatory when he was here.     START A SORRY RECEIVER LIKE CRABTREE, AND YOU KNOW THE RESULT YOU GON' GET!!!    Sanders. It's his week to get in the endzone... (hopefully).

Or you can just sport a Steve Poapst flair.    Billy Red face and Mac!!!! This better be on Hulu Plus!   Hello, career gurus.  I'll try to make this as to-the-point as possible, but I apologize in advance if this turns into the Unabomber Manifesto.  My wife (age 27) and I (age 26) both work for the same company, but at different sites. We are reading specialists who work in the clinical setting; that's about as descriptive as I'm getting about the private company we work for. We both have had previous management roles in the company, but upon relocating to Chicago (my hometown/where my wife has decided that she wants to stay forever) we have limited opportunities for growth within our company, and have since taken pay cuts.  I have a teaching degree, but my only endorsement is in Social Studies; it has been way less fruitful trying to land a classroom position here in Chicago than my search in DC. (I got one on my first interview there). My wife does not have a teaching certificate, but is going to get her Masters' in Special Ed and her IL License. She'll get a job in 2 years, not doubting that. I'm considering doing a 9 month program to get my endorsement to teach Special Ed as well. (We both have a number of years working with this population in the clinical setting).  Here's how the proposed Grad School costs break down: Wife's Masters' Degree: $35k My Endorsement: Probably $12k  I feel like my wife is a bit of a spontaneous person and not a planner like myself. I can't really see these costs making life too much easier at the moment. Especially if we are multiplying our debts 4 or 5 times. I hate to say this to her, but I'm starting to think that when we move out of our nice $1300/mo apartment on the Northside this December that we won't be able to live in a place this nice for the next decade. (We won't be getting rich as teachers, but the expected salary would probably be about $48k with increases; that's about 15-20% more than what we make now)  With this outlook, should I focus on how going back to school may maximize our earning potential, and provide more for our future (a pension plus a 403b plan, rather than the 401k that our employer matches 10%) or is will this make us highly-qualified, yet broke educators?  Any thoughts appreciated.  Thanks!      Hello! I wanted to gain some perspective on the value of an LBS1 endorsement as a job candidate. I have an IL Type 09 certificate with a grade 6-12 designation and a focus in social studies. (...yes, only social studies...)  Would doing a 9 month endorsement program for LBS1 increase my chances of getting a classroom job next fall? Or, is a position as a Special Ed teacher really dependent on Special Ed licensure?  I have 3 years experience with students with special needs in the clinical setting.  Thanks in advance, and keep up the amazing work and dedication!    Dear someguy, May smokin Jay spread the wealth, and may the Forte be with you.    CAN WE CUT THE LEASH ON FORTE, ALREADY? TIME TO DECIMATE THE CHEESEHEADS!   Cooks will see more looks while Floyd is left in the void.    the one about his vision of the apocalypse is hilarious, and needs to be made into a movie with "the barely recognizable Michael Richards"      Not to mention that you can get a slice of deep dish pizza the size of a dinner plate with no wait at all. (Which would otherwise be a 40 min experience at Giordano's)   Eh. I like the way things turned out. We can still kick ourselves for taking Skille over Kopitar in '05. There are few guarantees in the draft. After Ovi and Malkin, there is a huge drop-off in this draft class.    "Rex is our Quarterback."   Is it just me or is that Windsor looking a little off CENTAH?   Here's to hoping Harbaugh has an epic meltdown after this one!   Ha. When I lived in DC I'd drive down to Mt.Vernon, VA to buy Pastorelli's pizza sauce. "Imported" from the West Side of Chicago.   Marconi and Racconto are the only acceptable giardenerias. Well done.   Gotta love ol' Billy Red Face during hockey season. One month away, but I'll definitely be tuning in for this psycho.   In the spirit of Boston taking this title... [Here's one of the most hilarious anti-Blackhawks rants ever](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upZ4CTfA6pQ) Start around 1:30, just about died of laughter around 3 mins in.   Great tribute. We always have bets to see what round my Dad will draft Robbie Gould. He's grabbed him as early as the third. He restrained himself until the ninth  this year.   Pssh. I'd expect nothing less than Murray Craven.   As is Byfuglien! No hate for Daze, really unlucky with his back problems, however.   Was there for our first meet up, out of town Sunday but looking to get back out there soon.   Or if you're considering Championships in the last 30 years it goes:   Hawks, Hawks, Sox, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bulls, Bears.   My wife would probably get a job in a few weeks after graduating. She's great at networking and communicating with professionals. In fact, there is a few schools that have already inquired about hiring her in the short amount of time she has decided to leave the company, but she's been inhibited by the fact that she doesn't have a teaching license.   I'd have to work harder for sure, but my track record is good and getting an endorsement in Special Ed should help my chances. It's just that the Chicago area teaching job market is completely flooded with people like me, so the endorsement would hopefully set me apart. Part of me wants to explore the job market in other places (like her home state of Florida) where prospects seem better.    Oh, I'll never miss DC or taking 90mins to drive 6 miles.  	61
    THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ENJOYING THE POST. I JUST CHECKED YOU OUT AND FOUND OUT THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN AROUND REDDIT FOR A LONG WHILE (ATLEAST DIDN'T MAKE ANY POSTS OR COMMENTS) ASSUMING YOU'RE NEW TO [/R/ALLCAPSMOTIVATION](http://www.reddit.com/r/allcapsmotivation/), I WOULD JUST LIKE TO LET YOU KNOW THAT LOWERCASES ARE NOT SOMETHING WE APPRECIATE AROUND THIS SUB.. (I WAS GENTLE WHILE WRITING THAT, ACTUALLY WE FUCKING ABHOR, LOATHE, AND HATE THE GODDAMN LOWERCASE LETTERS WITH ALL OF OUR FUCKING HEARTS.)  AND APPARENTLY YOU'RE AN ASPIRING WRITER (IF I'M NOT WRONG). DO SHARE SOME OF YOUR WORKS HERE IF YOU THINK THEY ARE RELATED TO WHAT THIS SUB STANDS FOR. IF NOT YOU CAN PM ME THE LINKS. I'M AN ASPIRING WRITER TOO SO I WOULD TRY TO READ THEM. ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR WRITING.)  GO KICK-ASS.   The collection contains short poetic/prose pieces.. I'm an aspiring writer, and sometimes I pen my heartfelt words on Tumblr and other social media. I've collected some of them that I've written recently, around some 25 short works.  Art is something that intrgues me with its grandeur. It makes me think better and feel more lively when I do my writing. So, I would love to see my writings blended with beautiful illustrations. If anyone is interested in this, please PM me your email id and I shall mail you the document containing my works.  (Please note that I won't be using your art work for any kind of money earning, so I won't be able to offer you any money in exchange to the work you do. This is purely out of passion for the art.)  Thank you.    Ok. Thanks for clarifying the doubt.   I have something for you. I too am still a guy who can not understand poetry well.. I needed English prose translation of epic poetry (such as Paradise Lost) that was already written in English. I'm that bad.. (also English is not my native, I'm from India) But here is the catch: Poetry, when felt and enjoyed, tastes as good as honey.. I'm not kidding. I don't understand most poetry and yet I keep reading it now and then, for it has some jewels written in its sentences, sentences that standout as quotes.. I read poetry especially to dig out such sentences even if I don't understand what is going on in the entire poem. I do this because I am not prepared to miss the sentences like:   *"Beauty is truth, truth beauty,that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."* just because I don't understand poetry (by the way the above are the closing lines from John Keats' *Ode on a Grecian Urn.*)   But I also mostly enjoy Edgar Allan Poe's poetry very well.. I fell in love with poetry itself only when I read Poe's short poetry, primarily, *Eldorado.*    **Eldorado**  Gaily bedight,   A gallant knight,  In sunshine and in shadow,  Had journeyed long,  Singing a song,  In search of Eldorado.     But he grew old-  This knight so bold-  And o'er his heart a shadow  Fell as he found  No spot of ground  That looked like Eldorado.     And, as his strength  Failed him at length,  He met a pilgrim shadow-  "Shadow," said he,  "Where can it be-  This land of Eldorado?"     "Over the Mountains  Of the Moon,  Down the Valley of the Shadow,  Ride, boldly ride,"  The shade replied-  "If you seek for Eldorado!"        And another poem by Edgar Allan Poe has the following lines, which is what interested me to look into Poe in the first place:     *All that we see or seem*  *Is but a dream within a dream.*    And I prefer short poetry over long ones.. *Mary Olivers* is a new poet that I'm planning to look into soon this year.   Last year I read Peter Ustinov's *Loser.* I felt extremely happy when I reached the last page. When I finished the book, it felt like I came out of a boring place with a relief that came from knowing I don't have to go back to it ever again.   Hmm.. I'm pretty sure wands aren't involved in apparation. I don't remember anybody using a wand while apparating. I guess we need some expert's opinion here.   I felt extremely dissatisfied when the Dumbledore's Funeral (chapter 'Phoenix Lament') was not there in the film. Albus completely deserved that respect, but David Fucking Yates didn't think so!   But nobody uses a wand to apparate, do they?   The collection contains short poetic/prose pieces.. I'm an aspiring writer, and sometimes I pen my heartfelt words on Tumblr and other social media.

THESE ARE THE WORDS OF OUR OWN FELLOW BROTHERS HERE.. HOPE YOU LIKE THEM. LET THEM PUMP YOUR FUCKING GUTS UP WHEN YOU ARE IN A FUCKING NEED.     MY OTHER DREAM IS FOR THIS SUB TO HIT TEN THOUSAND SUBSCRIBERS. GOD DAMN THAT WOULD BE MOTIVATING.  THAT WOULD BE FUCKING AWESOME.. I WANT IT WITH ALL OF MY HEART. I'M TRYING MY BEST TOWARDS THAT AS WELL.    I'M GOING TO FINISH KHAN ACADEMY MATH THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER. EDUCATION IS PRICELESS.  THAT'S A GREAT IDEA. AND YES EDUCATION IS PRICELESS.   IM SO PUMPED FOR LIFE  I GUESS I TOO AM. THANKS.       I WANT TO BE ABLE TO SAIL AROUND THE WORLD AND EXPERIENCE ALL THE DIFFERENT CULTURES I CAN (AND MAYBE HUNT SOME PIRATES IN SOMALIA BECAUSE FUCK PIRATES)  MOD BROTHER, NOW THAT WOULD MAKE A GREAT PLOT FOR A NEW TV SERIES OR A MOVIE OR A FUCKING AWESOME NOVEL. YOU AND YOUR WIFE SAILING ALL AROUND THE WORLD WHILE PROTECTING PEOPLE THAT ARE BEING TROUBLED BY FUCKING PIRATES. YOU BOTH CAN BE REAL BADASSES IN THE HEARTS OF THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS.    MY DREAM IS THAT IF I KEEP DOING MY ABSOLUTE BEST EVERYDAY THEN I'LL BE ABLE TO SORT IT OUT AS I GO.  THANK YOU BROTHER FOR THE RESPONSE. YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS IS VERY INSPIRING. I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST AS YOU MARCH AHEAD TOWARDS THAT BEAUTIFULLY MYSTERIOUS DESTINY OF YOURS.   IT IS SO FUCKING RARE THAT ONE WOULD SPEAK OF THEIR DREAMS IN LIFE FROM THE BOTTOM OF HIS HEART. LET US DO THAT TODAY HERE IN OUR FAVOURITE GODDAMN SUB.. LET'S SHARE WITH EACH OTHER WHAT WE FUCKING WANT TO BE, WHAT WE FUCKING WANT TO DO BEFORE OUR TIME IS FUCKING DONE IN THIS WORLD. ALSO TELL WHAT YOU ARE FUCKING DOING RIGHT NOW TO REACH THAT DREAM.  I WANT TO BE A GODDAMN GREAT WRITER. I WANT TO BE AN ENGLISH LANGUAGE NOVELIST. BUT ENGLISH IS NOT MY FUCKING NATIVE LANGUAGE. I'M FROM INDIA. SO I'M READING BOOKS AND ALSO PRACTICING MY WRITING SKILLS BY WRITING SHORT STORIES IN ENGLISH. I'VE ALL THESE REALLY COOL IDEAS IN MY MIND AND I WANT TO PUT THEM IN MY WORDS. I'VE TAKEN UP THE JOURNEY IN THAT DIRECTION.  NOW, BROTHERS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO ACHIEVE YOUR DREAMS?     Andy Weir's short story, [The Egg](http://www.galactanet.com/oneoff/theegg_mod.html), reflects this perfectly.   It was midnight and I was hungry. (telling)  *It was 2AM. My messenger on the Facebook chat window was beeping, usual good night messages probably, but it can wait.* I thought as I made my way into the kitchen to dig out anything edible that was brought in by me when I wasn't such a lazy idiot as I'd been since morning.       A fist clenched, then unclenched slowly.  Perfect.. He just became angry and then he tried controlling himself. I just *saw* that in your words..    Cool   You just really showed.. Thanks :)   Yes, definitely one of the most powerful moments shown in words... And I was just making fun of myself :)   Thank you so much for the response :)   Long back I discovered a [writing advice from Chuck Palahniuk on 'showing, and not telling'](http://1000wordseveryday.tumblr.com/post/54758529019/writing-advice-by-chuck-palahniuk-in-six) here. It had been an immediate help for something that I was doing then. I would really like to know more of such tips and techniques. If any of you guys have any resources (articles or anything) about *"show, don't tell"* rule of writers, please share them here. It would be an awesome help :)   I won't deny their iconicity.. I was merely pointing out my apparently mundane memory power :P   I'll tell you the names of the books I didn't like:  * The Divine Invasion * The Man Who Japed  No fun reading those two really. Disappointed. But nevertheless something about PKD makes me feel interested in his works. I've got lots and lots more to try still.   how about naming it "rBooks" as a tribute to this sub???   The way the book ends is pretty deep.. Although I don't remember the names of the characters, I can never forget how the protagonist must've felt when he points that gun at the back of his friend's head. I will always remember that.   Ubik is said to be similar to Inception film... I'm quite excited that there is such a book since I loved that film. This year I've plans to pick up his short stories. I've seen films based on  upon PKD's stories, namely *Minority Report* and *The Adjustment Bureau*.. Since then I'm interested in reading his short stories.   I'm from India too.. What MissMumbai pointed out here is a true superstition in our country.. There were instances during my childhood where friends used to swear on education and all that stuff... It was fun.   It's good to laugh... Watch TV series *The Big Bang Theory* and you might even die laughing. It's that good.    Named after how many people remember that Nelson Mandela died ages ago in prison, except that never happened.  Who are those people that remember him dying in prison?? How do they know that he died there?? Was there official news in the papers or were they also sharing prison with him?    I observed lot of people talking of *Mandela Effect* in this post.. What actually is Mandela Effect??   Melamed was born with muscular dystrophy, which causes progressive weakness and loss of muscle mass throughout the body. As the disease progresses, people with the condition have difficulty doing physical activities like running and walking.  And he kicked its ass like a boss!  Thank you so much for the article, dan17555.      "I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious." -Albert Einstein  It's very encouraging to hear something like that from such a genius.   The following is my favourite quote that talks of similar stuff:  "The future is a choice between what's right and what's easy." -Albus Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.   Well noted.   I showed this to a friend of mine and he said that the OP can impress can any girl with his drawing skills.... Lucky fellow OP!!   unfuckingbelievable!       When you're little and you think there's a monster under your bed, you usually run to your parents. Because you see them as infallible human beings and trust implicitly that they're capable of handling whatever horrible creature is under your bed.   Harry never had that. He had to handle his own monsters. And Voldemort is no different.  These closing lines of your analysis are deeply insightful. Can't deny that. Awesome :)    What lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.  This one was [attributed to Henry David Thoreau.](http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/h/henrydavid145971.html)    We are practically living in science fiction  Yeah.. I feel this sometimes...   I just installed WriteMonkey.. but I couldn't access any sounds in the program... There is a 'sounds' folder with some sound types in it, but I didn't find any option to access them in Preferences. If you know of how to access sounds in WriteMonkey please help.   As you've said that the book is free till Friday I was just trying to download it to my Kindle.. but it says something like $8...?? Why was it not free?? Or is the kindle edition not available for $0.00 in the Indian Amazon market??   THAT WOULD BE A FUCKING GREAT HONOUR, MOD.    Thanks :)   Congratulations for the achievement.. I would like to know how many pages does the book spans into?   (also did I say it correctly when I said 'spans into'??  I am from India. English is not my native.. I too am learning to write!)   Thanks for the information :)   I often wonder how writers use typewriters, which doesn't offer the features of deleting something and retyping it, or clearing off a printed sentence or editing it.. much like a computer keyboard does. To do any of these on an actual typewriter, it would waste lot of paper, right? So, how do writers manage to use them instead of a keyboard or a word document where they don't have to waste an entire paper for every typo or a change in words or sentences they decide to make??   But I want to get the feel of a typewriter and see what's there.. Is there any software that combines the feel of a typewriter alongside providing the features of a keyboard?      I had always liked the concept of this book where the two look alikes from distinct lifestyles swap their appearances and unfortunately it stretches too far and brings in bigger changes in their lives than they've asked for.. I wanted to read the book and so picked it up last month. But to my surprise I discovered that all the characters in the book are speaking archaic English langauge.   So the book is seeming very tough and an extrememly slow read, and it's tough to concentrate on the plot. Because of all this my excitement for the book is dwindling.  I really wish *The Prince and the Pauper* was written in normal/modern English :(      *Outliers* is undoubtedly the best of all his books.. Oh what a grand non-fiction book it is!    Do not go into that good night,  Do not go **gentle** into that good night... the most important word was missing.   :) :)   :) :)   I never really liked the book covers that have something like real pictures on them...    i always saw the harry/hermione dynamic more brother/sister  My thoughts exactly...   If you look at *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* there is something called as Time Turner which is used by Hermione to attend extra classes, it is also the object which Dumbledore advices Harry to use by the end of the book to travel back in time and set things right.. There is not any explanation given as to the working of time turner itself but the story just carries on with its help and presence. So, maybe you can simply come up with something like that and take your story forward.. And also there is a book by Stephen King called *11/22/63* where a teacher travels back in time to stop the assassination of JFK.. I haven't read it yet but you might wanna check that out once.. And most important of all is not what you used to time travel, but how well the plot is woven.. If the story is griping enough, then audience wouldn't care about how it's done.. Didn't you watch Chris Nolan's *Inception* film.. Nobody bothers about what that dream machine was all about but what they do there after entering into the dream realm... So, it depends not on what your character uses to time travel but what he does after time traveling that would interest some category of people, a category that readers like me belong to.  (I'm saving this post.. I would love to see others people's views on your question.)   I'm a guy who loves to read quotes on many things that interest me.. but when it came to quotes on 'Writing' I haven't come across many. It would be lovely if you guys can post your favourite quotes on *Writing* here. Thanks :)  I love this quote:  *"If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it."* -Toni Morrison   Yeah... and moreover the chemistry that a boyfriend and girlfriend should be having between them is completely missing between Harry and Hermione... They're just like any usual great male and female friends.. but such a chemistry was always there between Ron and Hermione. They just have it... I think this whole thing of Hermione and Harry came up just because Emma Watson is extremely beautiful and that we all have a knack for pairing up the best looking girl only with the main protagonist of a story and not with his best friend.   Ok.. Apparently I overreacted too!   Thanks for the clarifying article link...    I hate to read about these plot twists...!! And I don't want to see Hermione paired with Harry... The way it is in the book is the best already.. Let's keep it that way.. Over and done.. Although I love J.K.Rowling I didn't like her coming out and telling that Dumbledore is gay and that she thought of killing Ron's character and now this one... I just don't like such stuff. This just ruined my Saturday.         Thanks, mate, for the encouragement :)   Recently I've started enjoying porn related stuff less and less with each passing day... It has started to seem mechanical. Also I'm not doing much in my other chosen goals of life as well. Now I felt like taking a break from porny stuff and come back here. I love masturbating, but now I'm not enjoying my PMO sessions much they've become monotonous. I guess that's because I've taken too much liberty. Now I'm gonna control my thoughts.   DEAR MODS.. ALSO WE SHOULD MIND THE LOOK AND FEEL OF THIS SUB. WE GOTTA CHANGE THE FUCKING BACKGROUND OF OUR SUB REGULARLY (LIKE [/R/INTERSTELLAR](http://www.reddit.com/r/interstellar/)).. WE SHOULD MAKE IT FEEL ALIVE..  ALSO IT IS TIME WE PUNCH THE THREE FACES STARING AT US FROM THE HEADER AND PUT MOTIVATIONAL QUOTES THERE INSTEAD... OR MAYBE THE QUOTES THAT ARE TAKEN FROM THE POSTS THAT WE HAVE HERE FROM OUR FELLOW BROTHERS..   ALSO LET'S CREATE A CATCHPHRASE EVERY MONTH AND LET THE BROTHERHOOD SPREAD THE WORD... SIMPLY WRITING POSTS WON'T BRING PEOPLE OR MAKE US FAMOUS. WE GOTTA REDEFINE OUR LIVING HERE.. WE GOTTA MAKE OUR LIFESTYLE FUCKING ADDICTIVE FOR OTHERS THAT THEY CAN'T RESIST US. THEY HAVE TO COME TO US ANTICIPATING A NERVE WRENCHING CHANGE IN THEIR GODDAMN LIVES.    THE SURE SHOT WAY TO HAVE A COMPLETENESS IN YOUR EVERYDAY LIFE IS TO ALWAYS FUCKING DO SOMETHING.. EVERY SINGLE MOMENT. DONT SIT IDLE FOR MORE THAN 300 SECONDS AT A STRETCH. ALWAYS KEEP DOING SOMETHING. BE IT READING SOMETHING OR REMEMBERING A MATH TRICK YOU LEARNED A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO OR ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE FOR THAT MATTER.. BUT ALWAYS DO SOMETHING THAT TAKES YOU A STEP FORWARD ON YOUR DREAM PATH. IF NOTHING ELSE TURNS UP IN YOUR MIND, JUST SIT AND LISTEN TO YOUR BREATH... MEDITATE.  REALIZING YOUR POTENTIAL BY EXHAUSTING YOURSELF LIKE FUCK BY DOING THE STUFF THAT IS NECESSARY FOR YOU IN THE PURSUIT OF YOUR GODDAMN DREAM.. THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE FUCKING ALIVE.   REMEMBER THIS EVERY GODDAMN MOMENT THAT YOU FEEL YOURE WASTING TIME. WHEN WE DO THIS WE CAN SLEEP PEACEFULLY. LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS, A PEACEFUL SLEEP IS NOT SOMETHING THAT IS SEEN MUCH IN PEOPLE, RICH AND POOR ALIKE. TO SLEEP PEACEFULLY WITH A HAPPY MIND IS ONE OF THE BEST FUCKING THINGS IN LIFE.   NOW, LET'S GO EXHAUST OURSELVES BY THE END OF EACH DAY AND SEE FOR OURSELVES WHAT A GREAT RELAXING SLEEP WE WILL HAVE EVERY NIGHT.    POSTS GODDAMNIT.. WE NEED REGULAR POSTS TO FUCKING MAKE IT TO THE FRONT PAGE AND FUCKING STAY THERE. LET'S DO POSTS EVERYGODDAMNDAY.  WE NEED ATLEAST A 1000 UPVOTES EVERYDAY ON ATLEAST ONE SINGLE POST SO THAT IT WILL GET FUCKING NOTICED. BUT WE WON'T GET THOSE MANY UPVOTES UNTIL WE MAKE IT THERE AND BE FUCKING VISIBLE TO ALL.. OH WE'RE STRUCK IN A FUCKING DEADLOCK.   BUT LET'S DO THIS.   This should make the front page..    Crazy for sure  Nah.. Not much...   I liked Fahrenheit 451 better.   *I disliked 1984*.. Oh I can actually say that and not get arrested by Thought Police.. Thank you 1984 :)   HIS DARK MATERIALS, Book 1, Northern Lights has be in the North.. Expecting to enter a parallel universe.   Hey guys... a BIG thanks to all of you.. I've found really helpful suggestions from all of your comments... Thank you immensely for that. And I will put your help to best use.   Thank you, all :)   This sounds really promising.. Will definitely give it a shot. Thank you :)    assuming you're American  No.. I'm from India.   You're right.. But I won't be solely writing about them but when I try to create a fantasy orientied story line or something it would be helpful to have this kind of knowledge...    Very informative.   I would like to have a basic knowledge on the world's history.. all that one would deem as important for a writer to know.. Can you please suggest me such books or documentaries that would give me a good bird's eye view on the world's/Mankind's history?? I want to know about wars, color/race discriminations and everything that's vital for my writing. Please suggest..   I opened that link while listening to Interstellar OSTs...!!     woods  When somebody mentions that word the first thing that pops up in my mind is *Walden* by Henry David Thoreau.   I don't read any newspapers... and when I listen to or read various authors' views on global political things, as an aspiring writer I feel that I don't have any knowledge in writing fiction/non-fiction about such things. How do I help myself with this?    we need the books that affect us like a disaster, that grieve us deeply, like the death of someone we loved more than ourselves  I agree with the full quote, however it is not particularly necessary to read only those books that make you grieve.. It might be the case that you're already grieving about something in life and you want a book that casts upon your mind a new light of hope and euphoria. You need books that not only affect you like disaster, but also those that come to you with the relief aids and life support supplies.. for life is not just about loss but more importantly about loving and living.   Oh I had no idea of this before.. thank you so much... But now I'm afraid that War and Peace would be overflowing with these should I plan to pick it up sometime... Is it so?         These are the closing lines of The Martian:  The cost for my survival must have been hundreds of millions of dollars. All to save one dorky botanist. Why bother?   Well, okay. I know the answer to that. Part of it might be what I represent: progress, science, and the interplanetary future weve dreamed of for centuries. But really, they did it because every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out. It might not seem that way sometimes, but its true.   If a hiker gets lost in the mountains, people will coordinate a search. If a train crashes, people will line up to give blood. If an earthquake levels a city, people all over the world will send emergency supplies. This is so fundamentally human that its found in every culture without exception. Yes, there are assholes who just dont care, but theyre massively outnumbered by the people who do. And because of that, I had billions of people on my side.   as always, I upvote anything from Thoreau :)      and then there is the so called 'Docking scene'... of course   I recently read Andy Weir's novel *The Martian* and one of the things shown in the book, [the concern that the world shows towards the safety and survival of Mark Watney, which Mark reminisces at the end of the book while thinking about how the world has unitedly came forward to deal with the situation that is of global level](#s)... today when I was reading a newspaper article about Nepal Earthquake and about numerous countries coming forward with relief supplies and help to alleviate the plight of Nepal after the country faced a destructive earthquake on Saturday... Today I really felt with my heart what Mark Watney was meaning at the end of *The Martian.*  That is what defines us, the Mankind!    Let me please ask you this: What kind of author is H.P. Lovecraft?? Can you please give me a breif in your opinion about his works??    it's also about writing.  I'd love that... and need that too!   Stephen King is another person that I admire very much next to Asimov.. He writes like its a part of his respiration process. Truly amazing.   For me it has been Isaac Asimov.. Ever since I read *Opus 100* by Asimov I fell in love with the kind of life that he had - filled with knowledge and potential. I was stunned by the way he tried his hand at many, many great things that he wanted to write about. He was a true genius and I got to know that in his own words. I recently purchased his second autobiography *I, Asimov.* Looking forward to an amazing journey into Asimov's life and mind, yet again.  Do you guys also have any authors that you love to read when they write about themselves and their life??   hey this one is very good too.. thank you so much..   (But I was surprised that in all the three pics I got from people the girl is moving objects vertically above her palms... I was thinking of her moving the objects that are at some distance, like TV remote or books in a shelf, a bottle from the fridge or something like that...)  But thank you so much for the efforts.. the sketch is very nice... actually she is looking more like a normal girl, which is what I wanted, and especially the expression on her face is very good, it almost suits the setting of my story. Thank you once again, friend :)   *Rendezvous With Rama* by Arthur C Clarke is a top notch sci-fi that's nothing about any war or destruction, it's completely about a new found planet in the space, called Rama.. I don't know about the rest of the 3 books in the RAMA series if war is involved in them. I don't think they do.   These both, Asimov and PKD are my most favourite ones in Sci-Fi :)   ;) ;)   I've currently set out to do lot of things in life, but everyday I tend to fail at focusing my mind on the actions necessary for those things.. I'm also an aspiring writer, so I was thinking in a metaphorical sense about my failed efforts to tame my mind.. and then I came with the sentence: *"Mind is the wildest horse."*  It would be awesome if somebody can try drawing that. Thank you :)      yeah.. this one is fine too... thanks... but can the object be a bit far from her...?? like she is standing at the window of her room and trying to move a book or something which is on a table on the other side of the room... something like that...   anything and everything is warmly welcome... :)   That's a very interesting one.. Thank you buddy :)   Thanks.. I hope so too :)   I'm an aspiring writer.. and art inspires me to write better because looking at it makes me think better and deeper. Right now I'm trying to pen a short story about a girl who finds out that she has telekinetic ability. (Wait, I know what you're thinking. I'm not ripping off Stephen King's Carrie. I'm just inspired from that book and want to try something different with the same superpower storyline. That's all.)  Can somebody please draw me some art depicting a girl discovering/performing telekinesis??    I'm an aspiring writer.. and art inspires me to write better because looking at it makes me think better and deeper. Right now I'm trying to pen a short story about a girl who finds out that she has telekinetic ability. (Wait, I know what you're thinking. I'm not ripping off Stephen King's Carrie. I'm just inspired from that book and want to try something different with the same superpower storyline. That's all.)  Can somebody please draw me some art depicting a girl discovering/performing telekinesis??    Flipside by Adam J Jackson is a great read that you might want to consider.   I love Thoreau.   very interesting... which book..?? author?   a philosopher that he is....   I was reading this book and I stumbled upon this sentence, and at once I realized something very connecting to our everyday lives. We all often think of doing great things, and in such instances when we decide to take up something new in life we actually feel better and uplifted. This sentence reflects that.     	122

She deceives men and drowns them. I wanted to show her as a dead corpse that uses a charm, so that she looks like a pretty woman when out of the water.  I've had some voices wondering about the swastikas on the rims of the guys shirt. So to make it clear. I have no connotations with any extreme right wing parties nor do I keep any nazi or racist oriented beliefs. Swastika has been used for hundreds of years in Poland, before Hitler stole it and spoilt it for everyone. The action of the image takes place in 9th or 10th century. If you want to know more about swastikas just wiki it. There is a really broad and interesting article written about it.       http://www.artstation.com/artist/sarmati[1]  Some words from the artist regarding this piece:  Rusaka is a slavic female demon usually appearing around lakes, ponds or rivers.

Thank you!   i used all 300 characters. can anyone tell?    Torre Abraham Lincoln, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil Construction on the two circular 36-story towers remains empty and unfinished since construction was halted in 1974. Conceived as the centrepiece of Lucio Costas modernist plan for the region, the Torre Abraham Lincoln buildings were intended to be the first in a series of 76 individual towers. The plan was eventually abandoned due to poor material choices and the inability to secure enough of the projects land due to private ownership.   more additional pics and history of the failed project: http://paraisoocupado.com/?paged=2  note, there are two of these that stand side by [side](http://img.weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/abandoned-skyscrapers-torre-barra-rio.jpg)      sketch: http://i.imgur.com/6Gg8h98.jpg   he did a nice sketch of it that lead me to this one that was originally hosted on his cghub page. i'll look around and see if i can find it. i think it was nicer than this one.   that's me!

 Should they arrest god when women have a miscarriage?  Gotta love the American Taliban.   *What's the problem?*      I closed firefox today and restarted (as I have had to do several times now) and lost all my shortcuts. This is the second time I have lost them but not the second time I have had to restart firefox for an issue. This doesn't happen when firefox crashes. Just when I quit/force quit.  *What other browser extensions are installed?*     Adblocker and ghostery.  *Did you read the known issues and search /r/RESissues?*     Yes. I found an issue from a year ago which related to a file on windows. I am on a mac, have most updated version of this software, and am not sure it applies here.  I also get the tips again popping up, so yes, I am sure some file somewhere is being toasted with my settings. Do I need to write a script to back it up several times a day as different names or will a future version do this?    - Night mode: false - RES Version: 4.5.4 - Browser: Firefox - Browser Version: 38 - Cookies Enabled: true - Platform: Mac     Oh good, so they took money away from an anti-gay church?  Good idea :)         You can tell it is old, she is smoking in a diner. Hard to find that these days.         Yeah, they consider it 'stealing' when you get in the way of the city fining someone. Wonder if they have any speed traps in that area and if flashing your headlights to warn people is illegal there?   He is probably one of the kids who work in a sweatshop making the products and he was there inspecting them and putting his inspector stickers on stuff.   Do you know who you are voting for? We could compare records...raygun, bush, clinton, bush, kerry, obama (I don't vote straight party ticket ever).  You know, if the right had huntsman running I would vote for him, and would have in 2012 if the idiots hadn't picked romney.  I don't worship a party so I don't have to kiss their ass and can point out how the two are alike. Both sides hate that.   Independent, not sure who I am voting for yet. But I am amused about how the right whines like little babies on the one hand then ignore the same if not worse on the other.        Is what she did legal or not?  If so, who cares. Operate within the law to maximize your benefits. It's the way of things in America now.      When the right whines about the Koch brothers buying elections, laws, and candidates I will take them serious about being upset about this. Not to mention superpacs, corporations are people, etc.  Till then, they should quit crying about it because it makes em look stupid.      If he can tie it to the bible he might get some traction.  Barring that, I doubt anyone on the right will care.   Should have pepper sprayed the food, might give it some flavor.  Last time I was in CA and had del taco I couldn't finish eating it, made Taco Bell seem like gourmet food.      Been seeing the right pimp that. I guess it goes like this:  "Someone called the cops because two people were fighting. So the cops were justified in how they acted towards everyone else there who wasn't involved."  They want to distract from the actions of that cop and not a single one has yet to explain to me how this new video changes the other one at all.   Perhaps. I post a lot of links. But then I am a news junkie, follow about 700 tv news station on one twitter list and a bunch on another. All the while listening to radio (am mostly and some short wave) and surfing various websites.  Just a hobby :)   Why would someone use a submission bot anyway? Good grief, how hard is it to cut and paste a title and link?   I think this oldie sums it up well. America. Fuck yeah.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MGQaH3-LK54         And we don't hear about all the people who don't kill others, who own guns and don't shoot anyone, etc. News use covers the not so normal things. Weird, I know....                                       It was constructive. People believe all sorts of things and never stop to think about how silly and over the top they are. There is a pattern of such with a certain group of people.   I read it. Now what?   LOL. Right. And we were supposed to believe we would all die from ebola, christians would be put in fema camps, the stock market would crash, all the guns in the US would be confiscated and outlawed, Obama ordered a stand down order and watched people die in benghazi live on tv while playing golf.....  Cons will believe anything.      They are reflective of peoples' contributions to the community.  Someone like you, for example, is of pretty much no value and seem to just want to troll and blather on to get attention by being as much of troll as possible.  You call people 'limp dicked liberals', post BS from a site known to be pretty much lies and trolling, and in your case your karma accurately reflect your worth to people here on reddit. Which is negative.      All these years they didn't say a peep about this. Then, suddenly, they get their asses whipped because America is more progressive now and they want the government out of it all.  Typical sore loser conservatives. WAAAAAH!      Oh....I see. When a white person does a crime he has a problem and isn't 'normal'.  When a black person does a crime it is because they are black/ their 'culture'/etc.  Christian does a crime. Don't mention the religion. Muslim does - only mention the religion.  Sadly, that is how it works in the US these days.   Because polls are fickle and you can get what you want out of them many times.  Remember how well romney was doing according to the right wing? Back in 2012 he was gonna clean up, decimate Obama....I still remember fox/rove election night. They seemed honestly shocked (that's what happens when you live in a bubble).     Well, you have 1 whole link karma - so how about you just post more news you want to see? It isn't hard to do.  Good thing about reddit, people decide what they want, others don't do it for them.   Using Hillary and Squealing in the same sentence does not, in any way, enthuse me at all. Now I have dueling banjos stuck in my head.            Hillary/Bush 2016. Just to screw with everyone.   That way we can go to war with Iran and increase taxes on the wealthy to pay for the war they want and will profit from.  Ted Cruz can head up the DOD, Chris Christie can be made project manager for infrastructure projects, Jindal can head the education department, Walker can head up health and human services or the labor department, and Bernie Sanders can do whatever the hell he wants.   From 2013?  Seems just a tad old. But then, just yesterday I was sitting on the porch talking to a friend about bush and 9/11, iraq, etc which devolved into a discussion about the Carter Administration and bi-centennial celebration and the freedom train.   well done :)   The day of our wedding I watched Charlie and the Chocolate factory. I haven't watched it since then (that was 1985).      "Be in the world, not of it."  I don't care one wit what someone's faith is or how they choose to live, or if they choose to be subject to rules of their church/synagogue/mosque. I only care when they decide that what they believe, based on fear of their god, is something they want to push on the rest of society.   Actually, you are posting to yourself right now. There is no reddit. No thread. It's all in your head....   Refuse a design, fine. Refuse to even make a product you sell to others? Not fine.   Looks like I was right. Poster/troll is gone.      If the science is sound, it's sound. But like all science reports, it can be 'tainted' by conflicts of interest.   I'll side with the epa on this one, same as I side with scientists/government studies about climate change and humankind's contributing to it.  Gonna be fun to see if the right runs with this while on the other hand dismissing other EPA studies :)   I rarely wash it. I do choke it at times though.   If not, let me know....lol   Won't work - I can't read Russian :)    "Privacy, above all other things, including safety and freedom from terrorism, is not where we want to go," Steinbach said.  Tell you what. When you give us all access to what the government is doing (tpp/emails/etc) maybe we will think about it. When you think you are the only ones who should have privacy and be protected it make us citizens a tad wary of your intentions.   I don't think I am the one here who seems silly.  I get it, you think of kids like animals to be trained.  And I know 13 year old kids are smart, have 5 kids (youngest is 14) and never once raised a hand to one, cut their hair to punish them, etc. Rational people can handle things in a rational manner.  When you have to resort to such things you are doing something wrong.   You seem to be trolling this thread - is this something you have done and now feel a need to defend it?  This dad abused his power - I am guessing he is a conservative that feels cops can kill who they want for any reason and that punishment of any form is 'love'. Probably a fundie as well....      My x and I were out driving not long after we had met:  Me: "You're not seeing anyone else right now are you?"  Her: "Uh, no."  Me: "Neither am I. And since we are here together, going to get some food, I guess it means we are seeing each other now."  Her: "Uh. Well, yes. I really can't argue with that."  sometime later on a trip home from visiting relatives for the holiday...  Me: "Ya know, since we hang out a lot and you have nothing better to do and neither do I, why don't we get married?"  Her: "Well...OK. We might as well. When do you want to do it?"  Me: "You pick, I'm easy."  Her: "How about in May?"  Me: "Sounds good to me."  We were married 10 years, had 3 kids, and she died 10 years ago from a serious of birth defects she was born with. She did reject my idea of having chicken nuggets at the reception...can't win em all.                        People get famous for lying and making crap. I think she will give the Kardashian's a run for their money. America. Fuck Yeah.      He cares or he wouldn't have made the comment.  Pro-tip for you Huck: If it doesn't affect your life, keep your mouth shut. Gay marriage, abortion, gays in the military, sex change operations, etc doesn't impact your life unless you make it do so.   Good job. Nice line work/colors and very crisp.    Forgot about that one. I still like ole ZZT at times, but hard to find a copy to run on the Mac.      Well, it IS Florida, so zombies are likely (too much sun for Vampires).               Weren't conservatives, just yesterday, touting a poll about voter ID and how most wanted that? My my my...wonder if they will be pushing this one too?      The issue at hand is how conservatives prefer to govern and handle issues, and he does want to be president.    Here's how it works with some conservatives:   In addition to floating the new bike tax, the budget currently under consideration would repeal the states Complete Streets law. The policy, which mandates that all new road construction and repairs take cyclists and pedestrians into consideration, makes up only about $190,000, or six-one-thousandths of one percent of the total transportation budget  Now he will cut and cut and cut to the point it hurts even more. So when a dem runs part of their platform, to bring things back to sanity, is to spend. Then cons will point and say 'look, tax and spend liberals!'   All the while, these same cons, are for spending more on weapons and wars (which they don't always put on the books....) Which, oddly enough, you never heard them discuss raising taxes to pay for (can you imagine the response by the right if cons has asked for a tax increase to pay for the wars? Suddenly they would all be like 'naw, we're safe enough').  So, what happens (again) is they increase spending for wars/weapons, cut the budget for things we really want and need, and then claim there is no money to pay for those things.      Interesting information, thanks.                                    Toledo is the arm pit of ohio, like Bakersfield is in CA. Both states would be better off without those cities :)   My state is Ohio, home of the Buckeyes - and they don't suck. Just ask Alabama and Oregon ;)                                 [Here is their budget:](http://www.atlantapublicschools.us/cms/lib/GA01000924/Centricity/Domain/12/Compilation%20-%20Budget%20Summary%2003%2024%2014%20ccc.pdf )  (in PDF format, 3 pages)    **Santorum, a devout Catholic, told Philadelphia radio host Dom Giordano on Monday that the pope should "leave science to the scientists."**   Why don't you do the same, Rick? Conservatives in this country blame storms on gays, try to take science out of school texts, and don't believe the majority of scientists in the world when it comes to climate change (and claim that god controls the weather and man has no impact....Yeah, let's keep religion and politics out of science.)                        Uh, I don't have a credit card. I am guessing you assume every human in the US has one? Weird.                        Ah the rich. They work so much harder than others. You can work 60 hours a week in one job, 20 in another, and 10 on sunday and you are still being a lazy worthless bum. Hard work means money (just ask any conservative). These people are far superior to us because they busted their asses and still are 1000 hours a week.  So sure, we should listen to their ideals. They are intellectually superior and much harder workers. What have you done for America? How many factories have you closed and how many slave laborer children have you been able to put to work in the world?  Like moses they have the led the money from it's bondage in our country to freedom and tax havens elsewhere. They have climbed the mountain of the golden calf and brought down to us the tablets, phones, and shoes from the right hand of the children of Vietnam.  Verily I say unto you, the great wealth wielders of this country have shown us the way to the promised land which flows with golden showers from above, you will come to it from shit creek, upon which you will need no paddle.   And there, at border to this land of slave labor for all, at the land where your money where no longer burden your pockets but instead will be lifted up to become the burden of the rich....there you will the rulers they have chosen to allow you to choose from.  Go now, and spread the good news....      Here is their basic ideal (and why it is a sham):  We can all own our own businesses and with hard work can be rich.  If everyone owned a business, who would work for them?? We need workers.  The people in this country who get the most work the least. If we all worked 60 hours a week we all still wouldn't be making the same amount of money. So it isn't about "Hard Work". It never has been.  Those who do the actual work, the workers, at times ask for the same things investors do - a return on their 'investment'. But the right calls workers greedy when they do and whine about how prices could go up.  Investors want the same thing and prices go up? The right cheers that on as capitalism.   I want to do a study of my own on this. Step 1, find a woman who is a bread winner. Step 2, convince her I am worth marrying. Step 3, should be profit, but I don't think I will make it past step 2.                  I played chess in high school. We sold donuts and had insanity tournaments (at my house, play chess for 24 hours straight) just to raise enough money for chess boards and pieces.  If we had a 60 million dollars for our sport we would have food, hookers, and booze, for everyone who came to see our games (and we would pick em up in limos to get them there).  Pretty sure we still wouldn't get anyone to come see the games (we asked for cheer leaders, but that never happened - we even said they could just sign the cheers and the school still didn't care).                  Didn't say it was.  But I suppose we should keep that in mind when creating budgets (unless the treaty is with Indians, we generally don't honor those ones and are still screwing them over like McCain recently did).  It would be interesting to know exactly what all obligations we have and under what conditions. I am sure such things have an impact, somewhere along the line, on legislation, planning, funding, etc.        His pic:  http://imgur.com/DprKVco      Because the debate is a moot point. They already know how they are going to vote and it's all for show.      The constitution is like the bible. People interpret it a lot of ways.  One of the core ideals is that we have a collective interest in the security of the country. And foreign powers aren't the only thing which is a threat to the nation. Pollution from one state can easily cross state lines and impact others and deprive them of their rights, affect their health, well being, ability to farm, produce, etc.   I think things should be a case by case basis at times.  Pot - is something an individual does that affects themselves. And while some can argue it has broader consequences that is over broad and not consistent.  Fracking - a broader issue that can affect many people (like pollution) on a broad scale. I would be against a federal ban but for federal regulations on the safety/environmental impact side of things.   It is, in some ways, pretty simple. What impact does X have on 'we the people'. If it impacts just the people doing it, meh, okay, have fun. As the scope of the action increases so should scrutiny and regulations to minimize negative impacts.   Yeah, the GOP wants to take us back to the 60's and 70's where rivers caught fire, the Potomac wasn't safe to swim or fish in and algae blooms ruled the day.   They would trade every river, fish, drinkable source of water in this country for money. It's so...I dunno, 'Christian' of that fundie party.      From the article:   A few maverick Republicans even argue that the cable network has become so powerful that it's become a problem for the party, not an advantage. Bruce Bartlett, a former aide to President Reagan, wrote recently that Fox allows conservatives to engage in self-brainwashing and may have contributed to Mitt Romney's 2012 defeat by making Republicans complacent about the victory they expected.  "Self Brainwashing", I think, is quite fitting for that crowd.               Well, you should keep tabs 24x7 on what is posted when so you can keep the rest of us up to date since we aren't here as much as you.  Keep up the good work and the excellent commentary. I will make sure to message you before posting anything again (and can you keep track of people I ignore and what they post as well? Thanks! We all need and appreciate your hard work and keeping tabs on all of this).  PS - never friended anyone on here before, but added you so I can run my postings by you each day. Thanks for the awesome help!!   Fox wants to turn the story/dialogue around because these people are known as fundie christians and conservatives.  They have to protect their own. It will be a fluff piece and fundies will start a gofundme shortly after it.   Yes - now, suddenly, the right isn't running all about waving flags and bibles to support it.  Which I am actually glad about. Maybe now they see why so many were against it all back then (and maybe they will pay attention to the left who is still against it and not on board with Obama on this issue).         The more laws you have, the more law breakers you have.  How many laws do Americans break a day? From speeding to pirated movies/music, to selling VHS tapes you have of old shows at a garage sale you didn't get a permit for and didn't put down on your taxes to....well, just about everything.  I am guessing that almost every US citizen has broken the law more than once. We only take notice of those the government chooses to prosecute. And then we make their life hell - from making it hard to get a job, loans, etc.  If you want to break the law - just call yourself a corporation. At least then the most you usually get is a fine which is less than the money you made from your crimes.   insert dog whistle pic here  "Foundation **took**" - no, some groups/people donated.  I can see the super smart conservatives now "Why, a smart charity like the ones I donate to, would refuse all money coming in to it in case someone, somewhere, associated with that money has problems later!"  Those same 'smart' folks rush to donate money to cops who shoot unarmed people and businesses that brag about discriminating.  Yeah, I think I can give the clintons a pass on this. When the right practices what they preach then maybe I will start to take em serious.   Bunch of white folks carrying around guns pretending to be 'brave'.  Hell, you don't even need to carry a gun to be shot by cops in America (well, if you are black). How are these folks just walking around with them? Aren't any cops 'scared'?                  Good.    Optimism about Libya reached its apogee in July 2012, when democratic elections brought to power a moderate, secular coalition governmenta stark change from Qaddafis four decades of dictatorship. But the country quickly slid downhill. Its first elected prime minister, Mustafa Abu Shagour, lasted less than one month in office. His quick ouster foreshadowed the trouble to come: as of this writing, Libya has had seven prime ministers in less than four years. Islamists came to dominate the first postwar parliament, the General National Congress. Meanwhile, the new government failed to disarm dozens of militias....  Sooo.... What we have is a country with democratic elections, they elected people, and it didn't work out.  Just wait - if we get a conservative in power they will call up Libya and say:  **Hi, I'm a conservative from the American Government, and we're here to help**  *Reagan rolls in his grave*      Firefox/Chrome with ad blocker and ghostery. I didn't see any ads or popups so can't really warn someone ahead of time about such things.   I lived there off and on since 1996 (not there now), and yeah - I remember it coming up here and there. It always seemed so regressive.  If a majority of vehicles used no gas I could see replacing the gas tax for roads with something like this (but one would also note that most likely cars would weigh less and do less damage).  It all reminds me of a story about a town in Canada. They were using a lot of electric and generating more was going to be a problem. Might have to raise rates to get an expensive new generator and get online, etc. So they pushed people hard to conserve energy, buy more energy efficient appliances, etc.   They did. So much so that not only did they reduce electric usage by a ton but revenue fell. Which meant less money to maintain the grid/production. So....they raised prices.   There is a stable point where a system pays for itself. Prices go up to cover the cost of maint. and such, but oddly, it seems wages never seem to match.   Let me try to give a broad view on this. I went to school back in the 1970's here (elementary school). We had Christmas plays, songs, decorations, etc in my school. We also had one Jewish kid in my class and learned about Hanukkah and had some decorations for that up.  As kids, it was what we knew in real life and this was just an extension of that. I wasn't in a diverse area at the time (religiously/racially).   The problem comes in, imho, in that such things can be exclusive and also opens a door to other things. The religious right in this country hates anything that isn't Christian centered. So if schools celebrated holidays of say, Muslims, they would prattle on about terrorism, isis, indoctrination, etc and so on. Not to mention if some students were atheist and don't celebrate any of those holidays in a religious manner.  As done here, it excludes people who aren't Christian. What has been happening is that other groups (satanic temple, muslims, etc) have leveraged the rules to get in on the 'action' and now Christians are starting to feel what others felt all along. They don't want their kids exposed to religious ideals outside of the ones they choose at home.  Personally I think it can be educational to be more diverse in schools - the issue in some cases though is that the leaders of the school are participating with a captive audience. If you have your morning announcements filled with bible verses/prayer (as I experienced) you have people in power subjugating kids to their ideals/beliefs. A public school draws on a diverse population and those who work there shouldn't be pushing their beliefs on kids.  Schools are for educating, not pontificating your personal religious ideals. They have things called Churches for that.          Good point. Will have to see if I can find more on this and see if they just blew that off.   I am sure some 'bright' person in the assembly there will suggest a tax break. It will go like this "Look, if we let you file taxes once a year and claim a deduction for miles for work, everything will be just fine! Not that it helps you each month when you need it, but you don't really need money now, just that once a year - and if you file a simple form you won't get to claim it...but meh"                       Prediction: Phone companies will start robocalling people offering them to block robocalling for a mere 9.95/mo.   Bring it brother, bring it to the floor, while I jump around shouting thank you jeebus!  We are the only nation the lord has blessed (other than Israel; let's open our tax wallets and support them without question, hand them welfare, take it from the poor here for weapons there) with his grace and spirit of freedumb.  We cannot abide the sinners in our midst. The harlots who dress in such a way as to make men sin, the homosexual who perverts what god himself made (well, he didn't make them I guess, or he wouldn't be perfect), the liberals whom spout their nonsense about science/love/kindness/acceptance of others.  Yea, I say verily unto you my good brother, bring it to the floor that we may hear his word evermore.    Yeah, but them there dumb liberals don't understand the truth of fundie/isis/etc religion. That's why smart folks vote for amazingly gifted scientists on the right like Ted Cruz, etc.   You can sit here all day showing them proof in the bible about the first murder and it won't move em a bit. If you want to really upset them - tell em that god is the one who controls the weather and if tornados/floods/etc hit towns (usually because someone somewhere in the US likes gay people and lets them have freedom and life) - they will insist they have 'climate science', 'weathermen', etc who can 'predict' the weather. You can't predict when god will judge sinners (note: divorce, drinking, eating shrimp, etc aren't sins - just being gay is).  Folks like us, we are absolute geniuses compared to them, we know the truth.

             The media's job is not ostensibly to present both sides of an issue. Doing so leads to "false balance," which has been especially apparent in scientifically settled issues such as anthropogenic climate change.

 Thank you for that.  I just wish they could of gotten all the sound at the same levels.  And...that didn't really explain anything.  lol.  Do people think that the hound is still alive? Hoping for an epic battle between the two brothers?    lol, opps. No,  20k.  Big brain fart.   2014 ST2, $23K with 20k miles and no problems what so ever.  [Edit milage]   I love my ST2. I didn't want black leather, navigation, or a sunroof.     What is Cleganebowl?  I've read all the books and seen the shows, fyi.    Socks.  I bought a pair of the yellow toed ones by mistake and was surprised when they rang up for  $15 for 6 pairs, but said fuck it.  Been several months and they still feel new! No thinning, no loss of elastic, and no holes.    Yes you do.  A jack is not supposed to be used as a stand/support.    Even with the sound all the way up, I couldn't hear what he said...   Fuck that. I would of just called the police.    In the eyes of the law, strength has nothing to do with it.  She physically attacked him multiple times. Slapped and pushed.  He had every right to defend himself.  He didn't punch her, he didn't kick her, and he didn't choke her out, he held then threw her.  Man or woman, lay your hands on me, and I'll knock you the fuck out, then tell the police I feared for my life.  Guess who'll go to jail? It's on video? I promise, it won't be me.    Ok, sure.  But you can't filter the salt out of saltwater is the only point I'm making.    WHEN WILL THIS STOP BEING A THING?!   Ok, then sorry for "correcting" you.    What? Are you implying you were being sarcastic? Or you think I am?  I'm not.    You can't filter saltwater.    Speaking generally about filtering saltwater is a good way to die.  Drinking saltwater is no joke, and people need to be made aware how dumb the idea of just filtering it is, so they don't end up trying it in a survival situation.    Boiling tens of thousands of gallons of saltwater to make fresh water, is hardly what I would call "cost effective".   No.  Why waste good water?  If they have enough water to dilute the saltwater, then they wouldn't really have a water supply issue...   The salt is fully diffused into the water.  No amount of filtering will take the salt out.  It's like trying to filter the sugar out of sugar water.  Isn't going to happen.    You can't just filter salt water.  You'd have to boil set up some sort of distillation rig.    Dude, it's not that hard.  Make the tag, part of your pre swing ritual.  I line up behind the ball to look at what I'm going to do, and as I step into position, I click the butt of the club to my hip.    His issues is no reason not to buy this.  I love my game golf and have zero issues with it.    Ha!    You're not having a positive impact!  Pull your head out of your ass! Someone is going to hurt someone, because of YOUR actions.    But that's my point, you're not saving anyone!  Speeders are just going to pass you on the right (endangering other), and possibly retaliate against you (endangering yourself and others).  So keep up the good work, dickhead!   And you trying to stop me from passing you isn't putting people's life in danger?  Your putting your own life in danger, idiot.  Go read a newspaper about how many people die in road rage incidents.  Keep up your attitude, and you're going to run into a real asshole, with a gun. Or just someone like me.  When I find people like you, I will pass you, and when I get in front of you, I'm going to slam on my brakes.  I've had people get rear ended, by the next guy that was trying to pass them.  Then I just drive on.  You trying to stop me from saving 5 min, could cost you hours.  Or worse.  Try to consider the mentality of the people you're trying to fuck with.    Then I'm going to pass you on the right.  You're not making the world a better place.  Why don't you grow up and stop thinking you can control other people?    You can tell yourself that, if it makes you feel better.    Then get ready to be passed on the right, then brake checked.  People like you are what cause people like me, to cause people like you to get into accidents.  I am an asshole and there are people worse than me on the roads.  Do you really want to provoke us?  Do so at your own risk.  Hopefully you don't drive around with your family.    And people die everyday from starving.  If but some shitty fast food or fuck up a meal in cooking, I'm throwing that shit out.  Don't try to guilt trip me out of speeding.   How about you quit cruising the passing lane?    I know it's illegal, and I take that risk and accept all responsibility for my actions.  That being said, get the fuck out of the way, please and thanks.    Are you the police?  Are you God?  If you're not either of those, then mind your own fucking business.  Don't  start shit, and I'll be in and out of your life in seconds.    Preach brother!  I wouldn't be passing in the right, if the ignorant masses weren't in the left!  I don't cut people off, if I pick the wrong lane and loose a few car lengths, I deal with it and pop into the next hole.  I'll pass the guy taking his time up there eventually.    I love when people forget to talk dollars and cents.  I drive a Ford Focus ST, and my dad has a tesla and asks if I want to race...   Don't ruin this...   I. Would. Die.    Sorry, not completely turn into them.  Just at the moment of impact, as I hold my lane and speed.  Of course I'd brake, but I'm not endangering others, but blindly changing lanes or going into the shoulder. There could be a bike or pedestrian I didn't see.    Fuel stabilizer.   If you can afford a BMW, you can afford to buy pre-made thread!    I got the gamegolf shot tracker. It doesn't track the official pga handicap because it doesn't take slope into account, but I like it.  I'm able to review my game, see where I need to spend the most time practicing, and it tracks my stats.   I used to use mybogey.com.  Web site that does use slope, but since they are not affiliated with the pga, they can't say they give you an official handicap.    Local munis that are having problems, should open up the course to this game.  lol.    I read only 70%. 100% would be awesome.     I'm sorry, I thought this was justiceporn.    And that is why I started my whole point with stating that I don't know the laws in England...  But besides the house issue, go try to buy drugs, get robbed, and then call the police.  Let me know how that pans out.    I'm tired of dodging people who don't look.  Next guy that comes into my lane, I'm turning into them and letting them buy me a new car.    There's an old saying: you may be able to afford to buy a used Mercedes, but you can't afford to fix one.    So, if someone breaks into my house, I have to politely ask them to leave first?  No.  I shoot them and it's 100% legal. Same goes for store owners.  That man was committing a felony and the store owner stopped him.  It's wasn't "something he didn't like", it was a fucking crime.   You can't try to sell drugs, get robbed, then call the police to try to get your drugs or money back, just like you can't try to steal and get your ass kicked, then try to call the police.  Criminals have no recourse.  That is the whole reason the Mafia first came about.    I'm not sure about laws in England, but here in the states, it's perfectly legal to use force to stop someone from committing a crime.  There's an age old saying, criminals have no legal recourse.    It's a type of AWD. Not full time, used to gain traction, up to 70% can transfer to the rear and 100% to each wheel (or something like that). Plus it's the 2.3L with a turbo that will "put out well north of 315 hp".  Only manual transmission.    Teach me, please.    I bet that's a bad ass bat!  I want one, and then I want to start playing softball!   Years ago when I first started, I played a Yes!  I loved that putter.  But a putter isn't going to fix your putting.  Time will.  Putt on home on a rug to find your feel and stroke. Each day before golfing, you have to spend time on their putting greens to get a feel for their speed.    The hot deals are based on availability.  If they start booking a lot of times around that hot deal, then it comes off sale.   Kind of sucks, but it's not bait and switch.  That would be if you booked and paid for the hot deal, then they charged you the added amount later.   	53

 Thanks onotix, my friend suggested that, but I felt like we should do it ourselves. We work well enough together to fix our own mistakes so the RRF can help some other poor soul. Good advice though!   I haven't ran into scripters yet (that I know of), thank god. I would probably just stop playing if I did! That would be so frustrating!   It did sound like you were attacking me, and I apologize for fighting back, I was still frustrated by the game. Yes, good thing I know now, won't leave home without it! It probably was a proximity thing. I'll be as cautious as possible next time.  I think the difference between us on point 2 is that I play in empty servers every chance I get. I, unlike most people, prefer to play a zombie survival game rather than a bandit survival game, because I sincerely believe humans won't be murdering each other in the apocalypse but trying to stick together. We read somewhere online that certain vehicles were vanishing on certain versions of servers, and we tested it to verify it. They respawn back where you found them, without your items in them, but in the same condition (fuel, wheels, etc.) as you left them.   "3." Okay, I admit. We were virtually making out... We'll stop that...  I haven't learned the aggro ranges for zombies when it comes to sight yet. It seems a little uneven at times so I prefer to hide rather than walk through towns.  All in all, have an upvote for giving me advice. I'm no longer frustrated so I can take your advice willingly and not feel like you are disagreeing just to disagree. Thanks biscuit!   I really enjoyed this post. It's always a pleasure to see into someone else's mind so profoundly. I really appreciate it.   1. Yeah, didn't know what Morphine was at this point. Never had to use it until those moments. I was in third rounding the corner, and he happened to be at the corner of the door right as I turned it. It didn't have to do with my cautiousness. 2. I disagree about the searching the outer woods. I never do it, and most of the players I ever see are playing in cities or the inner woods. I'm not stupid enough to hide it in the inner woods near cities. We don't play on highly populated servers anyway. The bus wasn't stolen, it vanished because of the known glitch. 3. We stick close to each other so we know where each other is located, and we role play. We were walking down a thin alley that didn't have much room to move around. Your argument is invalid. We don't play PVP anyway.  There is no reason to ever crawl unless you're role playing or goofing off.  I 100% disagree with this. I usually role play, so yes I will be crawling, but even if I'm not, it's usually the only way to go through a town during the day without being seen by a zombie.  Finally, we play the game to make it feel real. Killing myself and respawning is stupid and not enjoyable. If my leg is broken, I have to have my buddy come back to get me.   The only time in my post that I crawled was the one time leaving the building, and the other times were when my LEG WAS BROKEN. lol Can't really do much about that...   I like everyone here! To OP and the guy with a lot of numbers in his name (is that from lost? I don't watch it...) why did you name your cats Dexter? Mine has claws and made my friend bleed pretty badly once. Hence, Dexter!   Day one, I'm doing fine, enjoying myself with a buddy. Have quite a few cooked steaks, good enough weapons. We're in a barn, and when we're ready to leave, I crouch walk out the door (no zombie sounds at all), and one appears around the corner right when I exit and when he turns to me my leg is instantly broken. Luckily buddy killed him, but it took an hour to get to a place that had morphine (we were near the sobors, and guess what, no morphine anywhere).  Day two, find a bus, go hide it in a very, very remote area, and when we come back, it's gone. If someone took it, that's fine, but the area was remote enough where it seemed like it just vanished because of how the game works.  Day three, crouch walking with a buddy, skirting the left side of a small building, him on my left, and all of a sudden I die from what I assume was him pinching me against the wall. We were hardly moving, and I was probably at 10,000 health, good on everything. I just died instantly.  Same day, a bit after I respawn from the above death, I'm crawling through a doorway (forgive me for being ignorant to this happening) and I break my leg somehow. Crawling straight through it mind you, not trying to turn or anything. Friend is all the way up at the NW airfield, and has to run the 10,000 meters to get to me and administer morphine. I was crawling towards the Cherno hospital (spawned near Elektro, made it to the southwest end of Cherno before I broke my leg). He beat me to it.  Hours of games lost because of random broken legs. Needless to say, first priority every day now is having 20 morphine in my bag at all times.  **TL:DR - Break my legs and die randomly from the environment acting unnaturally. This being addressed in the standalone?**  PS - I love this game, and I hate to complain. But I want to play it in relative peace, and these bugs make me afraid to move anywhere close to my buddy, buildings, etc.   Mine too!   I truly appreciate this reply. It is advice I will not take lightly. I might take you up on the offer to message you as well. Your last sentence really does hit home. I appreciate you giving me the opportunity to see into the mind of someone who is going through this, since she won't allow it.   Heh, that was adorable, I do feel a bit better now!   You have shed a lot of light on my situation. I'm on the other side of things, the one who was broken up with. I'll assume you're right and leave her to figure things out for herself. I feel helpless not being able to do anything to help, but that's the problem with depression I guess. Thanks for inadvertently helping me out happyvocal.   My girlfriend, well, exgirlfriend, just broke up with me because she was in your same boat. I hate to ask your advice, but I feel like you have wisdom. If I stay calm with the situation and just be there for her, will she eventually let me back in? It sounds like that's what you would have done.   http://i.imgur.com/cKHdV.png  75 kills until the F2000 removes the FAMAS from my top. I use CQB weapons for everything!   Ha yeah. My friend who was in my OP just said to transfer them to Black. He did the same with his, to white. You don't have to catch pokemon and trade if you do it like that. I just want to keep my prized collection.    TexasAndroid mentioned a similar thing. I already own Diamond, so I'll probably do that. Thanks for the suggestion!   I didn't know you could hold them all in Diamond! I have Diamond, so I might go catch 1000 pidgeys. That would be a good solution. I own at least one of every generation aside from Gen 1 where I own them all. As soon as BW2 come out, that might satiate our desire to play, but honestly none of the games compare to HG/SS in my opinion. It might just be my nostalgia playing tricks on me though.   Losing those great pokemon is terrible... I have a Haxorus on Black, my pride and joy, so I feel like I can't delete it.   I would shahaahahahhahaha (close enough?) but I love how well it worked with the DS touchscreen. It wouldn't be the same :(   Hah, I know how that is... I want to do that, but my friend and I usually do this really nerdy thing where we both start over at the same time and, while taking our time, we move along the routes at the same pace. Which means we can't start over at different times. I'm honestly tempted to just buy another copy at this point! haha   Thanks! You know what I'm talking about... Some of those evolution conditions are just insane. We can't get Purugly because we both got Platinum, and it's only on Diamond or whatever. It's just silly how they did that. We wanted to get everything ourselves too, so we never used the international trading system thing. I will be buying the new games, but SS had the best interface imo. Transferring pokemon in boxes with the touch screen? WHY REMOVE THAT?   I want to play again so bad... But I was so close. We both were. We need maybe 30 more Pokemon to complete the National Dex, but they're the stupid ones like Spiritomb or the ones you can only evolve after you have fed them skittles on Route 40 at Sunrise while holding twelve ethers in your backpack. Should we leave our games as they are, monuments to hours of hard work and determination, or should we allow ourselves to experience the joy of starting the best games out of the series over again?  Btw, we have no shinies, but I got the Pokerus, and we have the code-only ones like Mew, and we also have the ones that you have to work for like Feebas.   Gif is pronounced "jif" though!  But anyway, this is awesome. Make more fucking dumb things please!   Thanks for everyone's replies. I'm on PS3 unfortunately so I can't upgrade my system, but I will definitely try reinstalling my system game data. Thanks for the post BeyondCR. Hopefully we'll see some improvement in the meantime.   I'm not looking to start a riot, just so you know. I was just searching the internet to try to find any link where DICE stated they know the problem exists. It is game breaking for me, and I would like to know if they plan on doing anything about it or not. If anyone has any links I can read it would be awesome! Thanks!   This will probably be buried, and may not even be the right place to ask, but how would I go about joining the team in my future? I'm a 20 year old student working for an Aerospace Engineering degree, wanting to do what you guys do. Am I on the right track?   Target accepts returns on Halloween costumes.

We have two restless piggies, but they both have short hair so I haven't needed to cut theirs. Blob (the longer haired one) just sits still. Could try putting the piggy on a table and distracting it with a pile of grass while you trim the hair. Just be really careful of nipping the feet, ears and their bits and pieces below.

 I just heard it on the radio. So fucking hyped these guys are at it again    Sounds awesome mate!   Ill let you know, someone is getting back to me on a trade.    Hi,   i have a few [juices here from VE](http://i.imgur.com/C6smCER.jpg) that iv mixed to 3mg, I'm not too fond of them and no one i know really likes them so i just wanted to see what i can get for them.     I have some Grandpa Joes - 40ml  Caramelised  tobacco - 30ml  Watermelon Slush - 15 ml  Ghost blaster - 12ml  Death by guava - 28 ml   Cinnamon cookie - 13ml   All measurements are guess's but i think they are accurate enough.  Please don't mind the labels on a few of the bottles, i tried steeping in a slow cooker on the keep warm setting which worked like a charm but the bag i put them in had a hole which damaged the labels.     If there is anything you like let me know, i live in Melbourne and would rather meet up to trade but if thats not an option shipping can be arranged.   Cheers.   Edit - I'm not too fussed on what i get for these, i cut my losses long ago and am just clearing out, ill take any sort of juice that tickles my fancy (3mg preferred) just let me know what you have :)       I had a fast tech delivery arrive on the 24th. God damn was I stressing haha.   I also got some juices from VE at the same time.   Sorry to hear you missed out :(    Yeah i have already lost myself to the joys and wonders of coil building.   At the moment i'm using a 30w hana clone with a lemo, and i just got an order from fast tech with all my new mechs and attys (all clones) so i spent the better part of my night playing around with them.   I'm loving my dark horse clone ontop of a nemesis. Looks and feels great      Alright cool thanks alot!  I have been interested in going into DIY for a while now so this may be the perfect excuse!    So are the concentrate's just straight flavoring or are they like a doubler?   Yeah i'v got some on order but i have to wait until after Christmas. I used the last of it yesterday so i'm not too stressed haha   merry Christmas to you too    oooooooo perfect, Thanks!   Yeah i already have nic, out of VG though so i cant mix anything until i get that :(     Im looking for a vendor who may stock some sort of  "peaches and cream" flavoured juice.    I would prefer an australian vendor for logistical convenience but if you know of any over seas vendors let me know.  Thanks alot and merry christmas!   Yeah I have come to accept it.  I guess if thats the only thing worth complaining about then im doing alright.    So iv been off the analogs for a month now, the only downside to the whole thing is the little wet spot I get on my mo when I exhale. My facial hair is a god damn vape magnet. Drives me bananas.   Anyway, thanks for being the awesome bunch of guys and gals you are. Happy holidays!   Throwing my name in!   	13

 As a Medic main, I never use the Gunslinger unless I undergo surgery to become a Texas Rattlesnake.   I meant three seconds in general being a game changer, I can see where my miscommunication could be a bit of an issue or whatever though.   Hard Countering Snipers isn't that bad when you consider that Sniper hard counters Medic/Engineer/Scout/Non-DDS Snipers/Uncloaked Spies. Then you give Sniper a bottle of Piss and the Bushwhacka and he counters anyone that feels like whipping out the Melee of their choice for a friendly game of "Let's fight with swords n shit".      Vaccinator isn't even that good anyway so it basically *only* counters Sniper in that regard, denying Kritz doesn't deny damage. Just shoot an extra rocket at the nerd and he's gone. Use some communication to tell your team that the other Medic has Vax and then wait for the Med to go down before popping your Kritz.      It's not bullshit to good players, only bad players have issues with enemy gamers using this. For example; You.   You say that now but it takes like 3 seconds for a Scout to cap last on most 5cp maps.   I think   bind [key] +reload;-reload;+reload;-reload    Might work, but I'm terrible with binds so it probably wont.   So you're saying it's better to play without 6 people?      It's not even everyone doing their own thing, they all work together on the smaller bots and have individual strengths.    Does this really counter hackers? This seems more like it's just a way to counter Sniper in general.

Using the weapon that is known to be overpowered makes you a cunt.   I've used LMAOBox in the past and still have no idea which ones are hacking. Fun fact, I have the LMAOBox loader [on my toolbar] (http://i.imgur.com/FT8ogyH.png) but haven't used it in over 3 months.   This is what love is.   Demo still has an easier time, and he has splash damage against the bots. Demo takes less skill making it easier to play. Why do people want to break the meta so much? It works as well as it needs to.      This happened to me yesterday but I was a Soldier doing sick jump n shoots.    You never see the Flunkywear Scouts and Samureye Demos? Boing Boing.   Wow that used to suck.   LnL doesn't make you a Demoknight, it makes you, for lack of a better word, a cunt. There are booties that make you need to be a knight, there were no grenade launchers in the days of old.   Caber isn't a weapon.      Nice joke, very funny.   The Skullcutter is the best Melee weapon for Demo in the game if we assume that the Caber is not a weapon.   Caber should be banned. Screw that thing. That much damage from a Melee is too much. And I main Direct Hit Soldier, I know when a weapon is overpowered.   I have Mouse Wheel Up bound to my Primary, Mouse Wheel Down bound to my Secondary and Q bound to Melee, you might want to do something like that if you use the Zatoichi, it's been useful to me alot.

My mother asking how I went shiny as dentist.   Sniper can do his job better, Demo can do Snipers job + Demo's job of the tank. Soldier needs the Buff Banner to give extra damage for the team. Engineers goal is make sure his buildings stay up and bait sentry busters.      The meta is the best way to play because it is the fastest and easiest way to play for the most part of the game. I said it before and I'll say it again, The gamemode and the meta are like 2 years old I shouldn't need to explain this. Look at Google.   **Damge falloff**   Reddit doesn't like these kinds of comments, it's like 'Nice work, upvoted!' or 'Happy cakeday!', it doesn't contribute hugely to the conversation. I don't understand this website.   "Selling Dead Presidents Berliner's Bucket Helm 15 keys pure" would sound pretty strange. Buy my hat. I hate this thing buy it.   Dude, an unspoken rule of Reddit is that if you get downvoted by more than -5 points, you're probably wrong. You're just digging a deeper hole of losing comment karma.   I think the Cloak then Jarate through the crack really sells this.   A combination of both, every class has a specific role to fill and can fill it perfectly. Scout does the best job at making giant robots easy to kill and can collect money, Valve even made the Scout the money class by giving him health for collecting cash. Soldier gets easy damage and can work crowd control + the tank, the Buff Banner allows for extra damage on everything. Demo can kill uber Medics by right clicking. Heavy is just a Heavy, easy damage. Engineer kills anything not hit by the players with his sentry. Medic has a shield that prevents all incoming damage and has Kritz for easy kills.      The gamemode and the meta are like 2 years old I shouldn't need to explain this.   There's a difference between worshipping it and knowing that it is the best way to play, it has been shaped over the time of MvM to be perfect for getting through the missions with the least amount of trouble.   I completely agree with you there, but outside of the job it does have it's about as useful as glass doors on a Submarine.    [I bet you were laughing your ass off when those bans happened] (http://spinoff.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/dwaynejohnson.jpg)   It's overpowered on defence, as said before by /u/moodRubicund, you get pure dominance over an area, however, it's a borderline horrible weapon otherwise.   That Pyro is a Spy!   Fun Police engineer usually uses the Pomson. But in this situation I'd say the Pyro wins.   Smoking is very easy to see, but I find it hides your face if you have it low, I'd recommend Steaming over Smoking but that's just me.   None because SV_Pure sucks ass.   Meanwhile, Max Box is aimbotting with an Aussie Minigun.   Ah, piss tits.   It's better than the puns.      Why should I? The meta is solid.   The loot is cool and all, but I can finish a mission with a good team in less than 30 minutes, playing with hackers is much easier, but I don't rely on it. The time it took to beat it was still about 30 minutes.   Playing a tour with players who know what they're doing is almost the same level of skill for me as playing with hackers, all I had to do was collect money and watch, that's my job anyway.

Also check the classes dead and alive, if there's a Scout down you should start to leave, you will be outrun unless they are BFB or you are Quickfix meaning you won't give them the full buff of hp when they're at the fight.      I personally pocket my friend because I know he's good, so I sit and wait for him. In a game without a friend to work with you should normally be going to the fight.         Not everyone is enjoying them, not only do they make people wish a swift death would come upon everyone involved, they make what looked like a legitimate discussion turn into a load of comments that are either "Boooooo!.png" or something like mine.   There's no reason to bring these to the main sub when there is one created for those puns.      I don't bring Samus Aran rule 34 into the Pokmon rule 34 sub.   These jokes should go to tumblr.

You shouldn't really be shooting so much that you hear it, only when the person you're healing dies or you are really in danger should you be firing to damage people.   Sorry about the "suck ass" thing but but that's just the way I speak and I write how I talk most of the time.   So like   bind mouse4 "cl_yawspeed 1000"   bind mouse5 "cl_yawspeed whatever the default is"?   Kill a Medic in one hit use the other two to kill the Soldier or Demo, if it's a Heavy you're screwed, but you can still kill so much with that. Reloading is also a thing that happens.   The worst part is that it exists.   You know how some weapons reward skill? This and the Frontier Justice are not those. Backstabs are easy and frustrating, sapping is also easy, I have farmed Diamondback crits from a BONK! Scout and it sucked. Same with FJ kind of.   I like my Strange Pocket Heavy because I named it after the Heavy main I'm friends with. I also have a Rocket Launcher that says he's bad.   Can you give me that script, a have a Pybro who I'd love to be more useful to me. He's good but I've seen him get backstabbed way too much.   Guys just grab the Overdose, it may be a piece of trash but if you just killed a Scout or something with the Ubersaw and you're at 100% all by yourself, you can run slightly faster to get to a team member to heal them. The damage penalty is like 10% which is maybe 3 hp per syringe, I wouldn't know because I use the Crossbow, but it's so much better than the stock and the Blutsager.

Edit: DH isn't actually banned, a lime scout told me it was. Probably because he doesn't like getting 1 shotted.   Alright, let's use this as footage to make Valve nerf Heavy again.

             That was so quick reaction by monkey .               poor boy :(                     TIL that the natural world's long-distance flight champions are seagoing birds that fly up to 6,000 miles nonstop.   I have one word for this..."Cute".           	21
 D'aww shucks   I wish I could give you one zillion upvotes. It's really frustrating sitting in my car smoking a joint in complete darkness, worrying about who may have seen me, my smell, my eyes, the judgement - everything. Work needs to be done to make this legal throughout the whole country.    This what I've been saying for so long! I get stoned, chill with my friends, watch a movie or play some games, and make myself food. The worst thing that happens is I eat too many Doritos or Skittles. Essentially harmless. On the other hand, some people I know pride themselves on how much they drink, how drunk they git, and how many times they puked.  It's so backwards.    I love this sub so much. You guys are the best!   I wouldn't say 100%. I catch a lot of flak for smoking  (I'm a college student) and this surprises me. My more conservative friends can't wrap their head around the fact that I'd rather chill with some good friends and bud than go get hammered at a party.    I actually did research with Nike one semester and worked to develop a similar technology. It would relay every impact to a computer on the sidelines, allowing for a real-time analysis of each athlete. We were told how innovative the idea was, but when it came time to reveal our prototype and do a talk about the work behind it, nobody was interested.  Not sure why, though.    Dual 18650 ABS box mod with a green limited edition Royal Hunter RDA   No I'm on the East coast, actually; it's been downpouring all day.       That sounds wonderful right now.    Haha that sounds funny. Unless you were on the receiving end.   	11
 do you think they will even enforce this? you're not allowed to smoke at bus stops either but people still do it      will never happen in a million years in this country they'll run a scare campaign about people who have died from it and it will never get off the ground  they would much rather continue fighting the failed drug war   at least he did it in practice and not the race   For me in my region most servers on the browers are the surf maps and what not for some reason there are no normal map servers   I think that speaks volumes about the quality of other maps...  They all should be balanced well instead of favouring one team over the other    i highly doubt they'll keep him they are already eying other drivers like bottas  will be a shame but his performance hasn't been great  if he goes we'll need a new driver for hilarious radio messages   should this be something a school teaches or something parents/friends should help people with if they don't know how to do it?  personally i always used an accountant because i found a cheap one and he was able to find a lot more savings then i would of.   though doing taxes isn't that hard      the issue is casual doesn't let you exclude maps and the other maps in that group are good   i really don't get how people can play it so much especially the people who've been playing CS since it came out   i would rather some variety playing the same map over and over gets boring even if it's a good map  besides if you know nothing about a map you learn it by playing it   its like some people just can't get enough of it that they have to constantly vote for it a gazillion times  just played a few rounds of casual for fun and dust2 was voted for 3 times (twice in a row) happens every day  maps been out for like (15 years?) you would think people wouldn't want to play it every 5 seconds    it's still awesome as well so much better than diablo 3   of course they knew they just didn't care  they know gamers will pre order/buy it anyway   they could of used any respectful Muslim (community leaders or just your average joe) instead of using this dickhead  they used him because they knew it would cause a stir and that's good for ratings.    it's good that they got the warning the dickhead should never of been on the show in the first place     bank transfer paypal or bitcoins dealers will always find a way if we go cashless   considering how much money they spend on a race you would think they could get better trophies   the thing that annoys me the most is when people put unpitted olives on pizzas and in salads     this entire situation is beyond pathetic now it's obviously brought up now to get the Aussies to buy the book   used to work at maccas don't see how this will work at all stores especially those with only 1 or 2 grills  eggs need their own grill (different temperature can't cook them on a meat one etc) so that would take a half of a grill out all day long that could be used during busy periods for meat     so what business model is a local hardware shop that employs a few people going to implement when a Bunnings opens down the road?  many small shops are in similar situations      McDonald's is like that everywhere both franchise and company owned  however they won't raise the regular crew pay much higher than the minimum as they are unskilled if they get into the manager positions the pay is actually pretty decent   lot of people think pay rises are always good they don't think of the people who will lose their jobs/have shifts cut or the fact that businesses will hire less people     it was criminals he killed people don't tend to care about criminals which is why the movie and what not was so popular  a extremist muslim threatening terrorist attacks is much different to that even if he didn't carry it out     many businesses might not hire as much staff now or they will reduce the casual staffs shifts (over 18's mostly) to the bare minimum   many small businesses struggle to stay open as it is you got to remember they have competition with other small business and the big businesses that come in and screw them all over  lots of cafe's and what not  don't open on sundays because they just can't pay the increased rate   doesn't matter that mallah didn't kill he's a Muslim terrorist that threatened Australians   How much are businesses going to raise prices now they are paying employees more?    Big business yes small businesses might not be able to afford to pay If they have a few employees   Wasn't it criminals that chopper killed? If so that's why people see him as a hero you don't see other killers that killed innocent people lifted to that status  In regards to the Muslim terrorist once you make threats you'll never lose the status of a terrorist    considering the book is about making bombs etc it's not a good idea to try and import it giving the current situation with all the terrorism laws etc  you're just asking for trouble   yep consumer advice, the usual dodgy tradie bit, something on binge drinking and hoons   lots of people grew to hate them because of it the next election greens got far less seats   should we hand out cotton wool as well.. entire generations of kids played on those just fine   who didn't see this coming terrible idea banning smoking in a jail  won't be surprised if violence rises substantially even after these riots       i don't even own a home it's the reality of the situation and many people are starting to move away from the city to get a affordable house  areas like gosford etc are cheaper than sydney and it's only an hour and a half by train to the city   I know it's a beta but it really needs more content it's still fun but playing the same maps and modes is getting boring   Too bad you either find a house that's affordable or you rent closer to the city the house prices are not coming down any time soon   They can if they move out of the city but many are not willing too as their job is likely in the city and they don't want to make the long commute      people standing on both sides of the escalator.. ffs stay on one side to allow people to walk up/down them   only walked out of one and it was because it was a commission only shitty sales job where you are supposed to sell some waterless car wash crap in a can to people in a car park  part of the interview was to follow one of the workers around to see them in action i just walked off and went home  no where on the application did it state that was the job and i needed stable work not a commission only sales job   never found either Amy Poehler or tina fay funny   not surprising given how many Americans believe in creationism   41% of Americans are stupid   as long as he is at williams i doubt he'll ever get another shot at a WDC  williams won't win as a customer team   i think many companies would jump at the opportunity to buy one of these if they can get a house done in 2 or so days they will be able to take more jobs on  builders now take a few jobs and spend time at each over the course of a few weeks  besides it's still going to need people to load and maintain it   apparently the average age of bricklayers is going up as well not as many young people taking the job   many people have lost jobs over the years when something better has been invented  if this robot can do it quicker and cheaper it will replace brickies in the long run   what Australian company would have a distribution network like coke though?   Coca-Cola already uses its distribution networks to deliver drugs for HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and malaria in a number of African nations, in partnership with the Global Fund, supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  coke would have good distribution networks i don't see any issue with this if it helps aid  	54
 Was she in a car when she told him that? He told her to swerve. I assume she's in a car then.   So he has one cart on there at that moment, and that makes him lazy?   Fuck off with this 9gag shit.   Sick of seeing him. Like someone said before me, stop giving him attention please.   In a deleted scene, Rose and Jack tried to both get on but the combined weight was too much for the door. James Cameron also teamed up with the Mythbusters and tested it out. They confirmed that only one person was able to be on the door and have it be able to stay afloat.   I thought that too.   That's true.   My fucking life right here...   It was way to easy to take it another way.   Congrats on getting it fixed! My father has the same situation.   I knew I saw a famous queen perform it!

It's a taboo in a lot of countries and I don't agree with it but if you put it in their perspective, it's no different from other animals. Americans view dogs and cats differently than people in the East. In their culture it's completely ok to do this. Yes it's fucked up, but you have to look at it their way: in a lot of cases it's either eat or starve.   I didn't know that. That's pretty smart. I used to smoke and never heard of doing that.   This was posted already today, 6 minutes before you, but that one is a repost already. Repost of a repost.   Cigarettes in the freezer?   There is nothing wrong here...

 /r/atheism   They are every bit as nutty as the bible-thumpers.  edit: Thinking back on it, nutty is the wrong word. I should have said they are as quick to attack others who don't believe as they do as the bible-thumpers. God, tons of that crap was just plain vicious.   Ooooh, good one. I wonder if we can get "antfucker" mainstream.   I have to disagree. I'm reasonably sure they aren't plants, and pretty damn sure they aren't minerals. They think and move on their own accord. Pretty sure that falls under the animal umbrella.    It was taken in a friend's backyard about 8 years ago when he thought it was just fog.  He was right.   You wouldn't need string, just something to tap the tops of the DVDs while hiding on the other sides of the shelves. Far too easy to stage.   Well, odds greatly favor other life. There is, of course, doubt until it's proven.   THANK YOU! This is exactly how I feel. I mean, come on, did anyone see anything in the example video that didn't look like debris, or floating particles, or water droplet (really? you could see the image behind it refracted upside-down), or a glare? And crop circles have been debunked over and over, and yet people still believe aliens are coming to earth to draw pictures in fields. The simplest way to quickly produce a giant image, by knocking down wheat. How easy is that? No way a human can do it? How about a group of friends looking to have fun and having the time to plan it all out? Jesus christ.   lol Same here. I click a post on Reddit News, click to open in browser, click the little Imgur link underneath, then can watch on the Imgur site in my browser. It's ridiculous, and anymore I just skip those videos on my phone.   Mine does this on ICS. It only does it on the lockscreen or pull down because the time is automatically shown elsewhere, and since having 2 times shown on the phone is a bit redundant, it's making room at the top for more notifications.   Why would you have multiple tvs playing different videos? Who likes to listen to multiple songs at once?    Don't use rokus for what you want, it will not work right,they'll never show the same thing at the same time, so you definitely can't have sound on them both.   Look for a hdmi transmitter instead. Read reviews, google a bit, and look to see if they can use multiple receivers. Much simpler option as well.    Wouldn't work at all, there are 2 rokus. They wouldn't be in sync. He needs something wireless that is controlled by the computer, not the receiver (roku).    Can confirm? Why, because her legs are missing? You, sir, must be an expert in your field.    When Tia Leoni turns to her father right before the wave gets them and says "Daddy" in Deep Impact always hits me. Not a great movie, but I'm a single dad raising my daughter and it destroys me if I think about us in a terrible situation like that.    It's my cake day? Huh.   And I'm a dog man, but haven't had one for many years. No particular reason, but my dogs I've had over the years have always found me. I don't go looking for a pet, it just happens.    Oh, well if everyone else was fucked up, it's perfectly fine to drive high. Nice logic.   Fuck dumb-ass kids who want to drive stoned. Of course you should have been reported.   This is exactly how I think I would be if I was an officer.   What's wrong with normal Titanium Backup backups? You can just save only the apps you want to reinstall in a separate folder, and batch install them.    Noticing foreigners is racism?   I hate overseas support myself. I have a terrible time making out what they're saying. I don't hate others for their nationality, I just want to talk to someone without asking them to repeat themselves the entire discussion,and still not catching everything they say.    I drive a car.    Because guys will sometimes spend their limited cash on lift kits, roll bars, brush guards, huge mud tires, etc.   Exactly speaking, you're talking power, not size. I've seen some big ass trucks with a straight six in it.    That would be more power, not bigger.   edit: though a certain amount of size would be needed, it doesn't mean bigger is better.   Yeah, if you need to accessorize your mullet.    I've met guys with huge shlongs (usually hear about them from someone else, btw.) They almost always say that they have problems with getting laid. Women generally don't like painful sex.   Gotta disagree there, depends on what aspect you're considering. Heating costs, cleaning, repairs, etc.   Why's that?   I always give 0 tours a chance. When I see their set up and/or upgrades and they're terrible, I'll say something. Let them know what they're doing wrong. If they're willing to listen to others, and try to get things right, then awesome. I'll help carry them as much as possible. But the ones who won't listen (I always ask if they speak English first, just to make sure), and refuse to turn on voice to hear us (really?), yeah, I have no problem with a kick. This tour is costing me time and money, I really don't want to waste either on a fucktard.  edit: I have 41 tours, just started in Dec, have 4 aussies, and heavy like a champ. The first thing I did before playing was READ THE FORUMS. Saved me a lot of hassle, and I've only been kicked once (for AFK, but I deserved it.)   Neat, but it's only built for the sake of making something cool. You can put a grate on the ground with 4 or 5 inch gaps and the cows won't walk on it. We have plenty of them here in Illinois.    Helium - App Sync and Backup will do that, I believe. If not, just search through the slough of backup apps on the market. I use Titanium Backup for that myself, but it's for rooted phones.    A large group of individuals are currently in talks to get the rights to it. It's a slow process with no promise of fruitful results, but it's ongoing. Look through some previous posts for more info, as well as spiritual successors in the works.    City of Heroes. It'll be years before anything overtakes that.    I've had sex in a pool, didn't bother us at all. It was actually very freeing, position wise. We did decline swimming invites for a while afterwards.    [Android permissions explained, security tips, and avoiding malware ]( http://androidforums.com/index.php?threads/36936/ )   Facebook is a massive power-hungry app when everything is working correctly anyway. I think it's got the top spot, in fact. There are alternatives that are much more friendly to your cpu. Fast for Facebook is what I use.   I realize this really doesn't answer your question, but I wanted to put that out there.    This one always seemed like it had a bunch of content in it, but I found it insanely boring. The only enjoyment I ever found was in seeing how fast I could spin the spinner.    TV system, not TV.    The little guy who dives into the bathtub? I took him with me to see King Kong in '76 and lost him. I loved that guy.  :(   I was looking for the dumbest, gayest board game ever, but it seems I've been beaten to it.    Ugh, could a more boring game exist?       Yup, Google stopped letting other apps like GrooveIP use their voice numbers for wifi calls. Which means you have to have Hangouts. Which means older phones can no longer make wifi calls from their Voice numbers that they've had and used for years over wifi.   Sucks.   Wait, that isn't a joke pic?   I've always heard the word "duvet" but for whatever reason never had the occasion to learn what it was, or the curiosity to find out. So it's just a blanket you can put different coverings on to change the look of it? It's purpose is to save money by owning one blanket with multiple coverings instead of owning multiple blankets? Or is the main reason for having one the ease of cleaning it? I'm assuming both.   And onions. I've never seen this without yellow onion rings as well.   What, all at once?   Whelp, with my prime membership I'll have my Joy Bidet C-1 (I chose a different model after reading reviews for a bit) on Saturday. I had no idea these types of bidets ever existed.   Apples and oranges. I would consider sand castles as art because you're molding and sculpting. This is really just squirting colors in and getting random results. You could say that paint splatters on a canvas is art, but that would only be worth anything (if it is) because of the name of the artist, not because of the result. Kinda like  a cd of Beyonce screaming random words for an hour. Abstract, perhaps, but worthless standing on it's own merit.    So now I know that kids think 30's and 40's is old.   The radio stations do it, too. It's weird when you listen to lots of radio, then hear the same songs from a different source. They sound slow as hell.   You can always just uninstall the keyboard you don't like.   Congratulations, you are the first person on reddit I hate.   So here's an upvote, I guess.   AT T and T-Mobile GSM phones use a SIM card. Verizon CMDA phones can't have the SIM slot, so those phones are limited to pretty old models on 3G only. I'm using my old Droid X2, and from what I've gathered it's probably the best Verizon phone you can use.   Now, I've heard more than once that some folks can get 4G Verizon phones to work, but every discussion I've had with someone from Straight Talk says otherwise.  edit: Talking Android BYOP here.   Well, the softer the material, the easier the drilling mostly. Fine silt that's highly micaceous though puffs up to the point where it seems like twice as much comes up out of the ground that what there should be. When you have to shovel spoils out of your way, it's a bit tiring. Running sands are probably the trickiest. Sand can have so much water in it that it flows. When you're drilling with hollow stem augers, it wants to flow up into them. Took a lot of headaches to figure out how to drill that. When I'm coring rock, I think limestone is the easiest. It pinnacles, so you can go in and out of it as you go down and you have to exercise extreme caution, but when coring with wireline I have the barrel spinning as fast as it can go, and can hear the rock sing. Excellent moneymaker there.   But the easiest drilling is moist coarse silt. It isn't packed too hard in the ground, it's so soft I can almost push augers into it, and backfilling is quick and easy.  edit:grmmr   Ugh, that gamey, liver-like taste. Can't get past it.   You have no idea. Soil is so extremely varied, that different professions have different ways to classify it. Drillers tend to follow the examples of the geologists and engineers they're drilling for.   On a flight that was stuck on the tarmac for a couple hours I found that they let you listen in on one of the radio frequencies on the headphones. Dulles was packed with planes, and everyone was held up everywhere. This controller I was listening to was amazing. He was talking to god-knows how many pilots and just rattling off instructions for a half-hour straight. It was art. He finally said he was done, and a crap-ton of pilots were giving him praises and thanks. I couldn't even imagine trying to wrap my head around what he was dealing with.   A geotechnical driller's perspective...  Very generally speaking, soil, outside of rock, is really just gravel (crushed/weathered rock), sand (crushed/weathered rock and minerals), silt (crushed/weathered minerals) and clay (minerals mixed with organics).   If you look at the particles of each type, you'll see gravels are much larger than sands, which are much larger than silts, which are much larger than clays, though silt and clay can and often do appear the same. Silt particles are generally roundish, where clay particles are flatter. If you add water to both, the soil will fall apart to nothing, but the clay adheres to itself and becomes sticky.   Organics/peats are almost always part of the topsoil (the nutrient rich top 15 inches or so of the earth which contains the root systems of the plants in any given area.) Below this you'll really only find more than traceable amounts if there are tree roots or the earth has been disturbed or something like that.   And then you have loam, which is really just an almost even mixture of sand, silt, and clay.   That's most of it. What you're walking on and looking at is the topsoil. It can vary greatly, but it's pretty much gravel, sand, silt, or clay, or a mixture in whatever proportion.    Why would someone downvote a comment offering a suggestion?  Because Reddit.   Yeah, the old ones didn't have the copy protection signal screwing up the copy back then.    Kinda true, depends on the settings. I had mine set on the highest quality, and 2 rokus would lag. I run it off a nice gaming tower.   	62
 This is what happens when you bring murder charges against police officers for political reasons.      Except society isn't all in one boat together.  Everyone has the freedom to make their own boat, no matter how big or small.  Or swim if they want to.   Ahh the Democrat Party's favorite word: **free**   More intellectual midgetry.  You can't refute the content, so you attack the source.      Pee sitting down.   But let's get back to those horrible Christians.  /s   Obama has been 'cleaning up someone else's mess' for the last 7 years?  World War 2 was won by the Allied forces in less time.  How many years until Obama is responsible for the forces under his command?    The left is conveniently forgetting that Hillary Clinton supported the Iraq war 100%.   If the left really cared about US troops dying in combat they would be critiquing the current President.  75% of all casualities and **92%** of Marine casualties in Afghanistan have been under Barack Hussein Obama.   You only had to go back 70+ years to find an iota of evidence supporting your anti-white racism?      The idealogues of Reddit who drink the honey of capitalism yet deride it have no interest in hearing accounts of those who have actually lived in a controlled, socialist environment.   Democrat tactics to undermine American institutions and gain power are working.   Democrats want only one entity to have power: The Federal Government.  Just listen to the daily Reddit clamor for more subservience.   Everything was surprisingly realistic until this.         In 2009 Iraq was more peaceful than Baltimore.      He's also the Republican pick by the Democrats.  The left cannot beat a truly conservative candidate.  The media knows this so they push middle of the road softies.   Do you care to read the article and provide anything meaningful?

Great idea! Let's ban opposing viewpoints!  More Stalinism from the oh so intelligent Reddit left.   What an amazing analysis with world-class geopolitical insight!  Hundreds of Redditors are on the edge of their seats, waiting for further words from your lips.         Can't refute the content so you attack the source.  Weak.   But....it was a video!!    /s   You have a lot to learn in life.  Good luck to you.   Not **one** out of 19,000?  This is still your belief after officials in Philly have been caught committing vote fraud?   In case you forgot, Obama received 100% of the votes in 59 Philly districts.      In America money can be earned through hard work.   You have obviously never done this.   Why did some random mining company in Russia donate $1 million to the Clinton Foundation?  The State Dept. granted uranium rights in Wyoming to that exact same company.  Draw your own conclusions.   The law doesn't apply to Queen Hillary.   Can anyone tell me why a random mining company in Russia would give $1 Million to the Clinton Foundation?   "No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State."  Edit: TIL Hillary supporters will downvote the raw text of the Constitution.      No one cares.   Curt, no one cares.   Still blaming things on Bush and Reagan after seven years of Obama being in the Whitehouse?     The same way you save the dodo.    You don't.  Go worry about something else.   The Patriot Act requires a warrant.  What is happening now is far beyond what is law.   The state-loving Obamabots will take their Dear Leader over the Constitution any day.      Yes, our people in Benghazi were delivering weapons to Obama's freedom fighters in Syria.  Sending American TOW Missiles to terrorists?  Yes we can!      America will collapse due to overwhelming debt from entitlement programs.   When you get 5 minutes of life experience, you'll see what a snobby, elitist comment this is.   But...Bush!!  You do realize Obama has been President for 7 years?   Socialism is for sheep.      Politi"fact" is a partisan website.  They are serving an agenda, not facts.   But let's give the IRS authority over our health insurance.   The space to the right doesnt look like a spot, so he's not double-parked.  Also, he could be handicapped.  So what exactly did he do wrong?   Was it these guys?  http://theinstance.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/SpiesLikeUs-Still4.jpg   I've gone to all black schools and lived in all black neighborhoods.  You?   Please name the inner city private Catholic school where your classroom is out of control.   I highly doubt it.   Aren't government-run schools great?    I think this would be a wonderful opportunity to pause for a moment and give thanks for the many great contributions of the Democratic-voting black community and their culture to our society.  Their peaceful and generous nature make them ideal neighbors, lending testimony to their exceptional family values and parenting skills unrivaled by any other culture. Their commitment to academic excellence enriches our schools and serves as an example to all who hope to achieve prominence as a people.  Real estate values are fueled by the influx of African Americans into an area due to their caring and respectful nurturing of these communities, an example of all they have achieved by their enthusiasm for self improvement through hard work and a self-reliant can-do nature.  Without their industrious and creative drive, we would be poorer as a nationpresently enriching the cities of Spokane WA, Chicago IL, Philadelphia PA, Washington D.C., St. Louis MO, New Orleans LA, Los Angeles CA, Flint MI, Baltimore MD, Pontiac MI, Newark NJ, Cleveland OH, Atlanta GA, Richmond VA, Memphis TN, Birmingham AL, Camden NJ; and lets not forget Detroit, MI, the tourism capital of the world!   Some people just need to be killed..   Hillary took millions from foreign countries while she was Secretary of State!  wait...      And dicks fuck assholes.      "The future must not belong to those who insult the prophet of Islam."  Barack Hussein Obama      Absolute one-sided tripe.   I'm still waiting for the naive liberals to tell Baghdadi that he's not a real Muslim.   Another day of intolerance from the left.  Silence and destroy those they disagree with.      Brave of you to admit that, but kids are going to do what you do, not what you say.   "America favors the rich."  Biggest lie of the decade, meant to divide us and destroy our republic.   Israelis deserve to not have their neighborhoods rocketed.  Israeli should yield nothing, because it will not stop the terrorism.    The intolerant Palestinians won't stop until Israel doesn't exist.        George Zimmerman was "white Hispanic".  She's "white ethnic".   I am a scientist and absolutely do not believe people are causing the earth to warm.   Now the petulant boy king wants to control the press.       Sure, Democrats save the crippled puppies and Republicans kick old people down a flight of stairs.  "Today's heresy is tomorrow's orthodoxy."  As half or /r/politics Redditors will be conservatives when you gain more life experience, this saying rings true.  Think about this whenever someone of conservative persuasion is shouted down, ridiculed and mocked on this sub.  Always question the mob.        	92
 Have you played in Shelton? It would be a long ride but I promise it's worth it!  http://www.dgcoursereview.com/course.php?id=4390      Power Grip    Here in Kansas City, Dynamic Discs handles the lost discs.

 Liechtenstein thanks you for your support.   Wait, wait, wait, wait. You are putting a "police force" in my borders without my permission... And this *isn't* a declaration of war?   Currently, Liechtenstein is in a state of war, but as soon as the conflict ends, we would gladly sell you equipment.   Yep. I'll have my wiki updated by the end of the day.   Liechtenstein is asking the EMU for help/intervention since this declaration of war by Poland, another EMU member, is unjust. Tuva ceded Kaliningrad to Liechtenstein fairly. If Poland had indeed been in negotiations with both the former NSF and Tuva (which Liechtenstein was unaware of) they obviously saw the nation as unfit to lead the territory and chose not to cede it to them or else they would already have it. Liechtenstein tried to make agreements with Poland upon hearing about their interest in Kaliningrad and they took the first deal. I request that Poland be removed from the EMU and other member nations help Liechtenstein in this conflict.  [meta] And let's be realistic. I have one of the smallest countries in Europe. I really can't win this on my own. He has at least two people blindly following him without question.   [meta] Actually, Sealand got claimed around a week after I annexed it. I think the claimer is inactive, but i never re-annexed it, so I only have Kaliningrad. Sorry I haven't updated my wiki. I have to research a little more on my military now since its grown a lot with Kaliningrad and I have work in an hour.  Edit: in fact, I just checked the unclaimed countries list and Sealand is on it.    And the acid rain.   As leader of Liechtenstein, I am taking this moment to formally announce the conclusion of negotiations for the joining together of our two regions! Kaliningrad will remain the name of the Capitol, but the exclave itself will be Knigsberg. In recent years, the economy and population of Knigsberg have been falling, but Liechtenstein is hoping to boost its economy by making it Liechtenstein's center for overseas trade. On top of that, we will also be taking advantage of its amber deposits, fishing, boat, and auto industry, and tourism to boost the economy as well.  Liechtenstein has also made a deal with Poland to insure safe passage of goods to and from our ports in exchange for a percentage of goods that enter and leave the area.   I guess I'm just thinking in US terms. There are so many more automatic cars in the US, even older ones.   Maybe because they're making more cars automatic or with paddle shifters?    We understand and thank you!   Liechtenstein would like to invest in the hologram projects. We feel this is a great step forward in communication technology and would like to see it become the norm.   Liechtenstein would like to negotiate the annexation of Kaliningrad Oblast since it is an exclave and not connected to the main land of Russia.  Its name will most likely become the previous name of its capital, Knigsberg while the capital will remain Kaliningrad.   Its population sits at just over 940,000 at the moment and its GDP is about US$14,000 per capita. Unfortunately, both have been falling. Liechtenstein hopes to reverse this buy boosting investors and helping with overall quality of life.  The population is currently 86% Russian with the rest being made up of various Eastern European demographics.   We hope to make use of its ice-less ports and make it Liechtenstein's center for sea trade. We also hope to utilize its tourism, amber deposits, fishing industry, and boat and auto manufacturing to continue to boost its own economy and help our own.   The Kaiser gladly accepts the Freefold's huggies.   Liechtenstein is formally offering SHIT squads and other aid to all affected countries that request it and is joining in the search to end this terrible group.  Anyone who needs assistance need only ask.  Edit: I misspelled my title and am sad.   Liechtenstein is willing to send SHIT squads to all who request it.   Yeah, I'm struggling for ideas as well.   They'll arrive ready for operations in approximately one month.   Liechtenstein and France jointly developed an off-road reconnaissance and transport vehicle, the AT-23 Spectre.  (http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/25mxbk/event_liechtenstein_and_france_reveal_at23/).  The base price is US$600,000 per vehicle and they will arrive ready for use.   Hey, now. Don't start this.   Despite all efforts put into monthly searches for Bogeymen, we have come up with nothing.  This is a sad failure on my own part and I apologize.  However, simply finding nothing does not disprove the existence of the Bogeyman.  He is a wily beast and Liechtenstein will immediately begin researching new ways to catch him as our previous ways are archaic and outdated.  Do not worry, citizens, this beast will be caught.   The aircraft will take off and land vertically, but the rotors will be able to turn to allow the aircraft to maneuver and move quickly.  When the rotors have been turned a full 90 degrees the aircraft is predicted to be able to reach speeds of over 100 knots, however, the horizontal speed isn't the main goal. The main goal is to have a veihicle that can hover and provide air support and recon in combat zones and be able to arrive and leave the combat zone quickly along with being stealthier than current VTOLs (Sort of a get in, get out type vehicle). The aircraft will be piloted by two men and be armed with a 20 mm Gatling gun at the nose and hold eight MIRV-style rockets for anti-armor and building attacks. More information will be released as research continues. So far the research is expected to take between eighteen months and two years.      We can only hope.   All beds are to be overturned quickly in attempts to surprise the Bogeymen and all closets are to be prodded around in with a stick or stick-like object. When asked about this strange mandate, Hchste Kaiser would only explain that he was afraid and that this menace needed to be stopped. This procedure is to be performed on the 2nd of every month beginning next year.   I'm here and I'll be trying to be more active than the past few weeks.   Not much has happened in the past year. Our great leader's only public declaration was to make vaccines mandatory for all citizens. However, he has promised to be a much more active leader in the coming years.    Liechtenstein would like 10,000 for US$800 million.   Sorry, guys. Not her.  http://buttonsandbeaux.tumblr.com/post/40777836124/happy-thors-day-folks-feast-your-eyes   Cult/Misleader - Dead and Divine   The Hchste Kaiser was unavailable when this was posted.  ~Signed Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429   We understand. We'd still be happy to provide a donation to speed research up. This is a technology that we're very interested in.   [meta] Haha! [/meta]   From here and onward, all citizens of Liechtenstein are required to receive  vaccines. Those who refuse will be quarantined until they agree to be vaccinated. People wishing to immigrate to Liechtenstein are now required to show proof of vaccination. If they have not been vaccinated, they will be given one week to be vaccinated or risk deportation.   Liechtenstein would love to help finance and research this project in exchange for rights to continue research and manufacture upon the project's completion. We're prepared to offer US$10 billion and a team of researchers. This combined with Liechtenstein's current personnel armor would be a great step in military advancement.   Welcome back, man!   Liechtenstein: Present  **Resolution #0004:** Nay  **Membership:** Aye   Liechtenstein and France are proud to announce the completion of their newest advancement in military technology! After some setbacks, the fully customizable Titan Infantry Armor is being mass produced and used by France and Liechtenstein and is for sale for approximately US$5,000 per suit.  Quick description: The armor is made of a weave of spectra fiber and Kevlar, is made up of paintable panels on a suit that can be added or removed for added mobility/protection, and the armor is fully customizable to the wearer's ability. The second part of the armor is the helmet. It is made of the same materials, covers the entire head, features an HUD that displays location, weapon, and other information, an eye piece with zooming, night vision, and other abilities, and can be fitted with a gas mask and oxygen supply.  Once again, each suit is also available for export to any country under any specification and will arrive combat-ready for US$5,000 or more depending on specs.    Original research post:  http://www.reddit.com/r/worldpowers/comments/26jmgl/event_liechtenstein_begins_researching_new_armor/   France said he'd be a little inactive this week. That's probably why you haven't seen him much.   Sweet   Sorry I've been so inactive. I should be able to start posting regularly again within the week.   I get it. I completely agree.   Is that partly because of Beartooth's last few tours? Because the last two times I saw them they were with ABR and BTF, and then MMF.   Liechtenstein relinquishes power to you.  Meta: I didn't see this yesterday. Welcome to the game :)   I'm still here.   YEESSSS   [Meta] Hah, it's no problem. [/meta]    We apologize for the inconvenience. If we ever decide to dominate the Earth and more space becomes available, we'll inform you first.   Considering that's over 800% of our population, I'm not entirely sure of that's possible.   O ja   It's good to be back. However, the influx of new people makes me nervous.   Over 6 years ago, due to threats to the nation and the world, Hchste Kaiser closed the country's borders and only allowed those on important business to enter, and even then, only after extensive security precautions were taken. Today, though, the great leader of Liechtenstein reopened the borders for public travel and immigration! Hchste Kaiser was asked what made him finally decide to reopen and was quoted saying, "I forgot to open them after a few months..."   Well, today anyone with a passport may now enter Liechtenstein for whatever reason they please, be it the scenery, our famous jam covered women, or simply to worship our wonderful leader!  **Disclaimer:** Not all women in Liechtenstein are covered in jam.      Everyone is job in Liechtenstein.   ~ Signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein /u/test_subject7429   Alright, I'll admit I was wrong in the way I reacted.   I didn't say I didn't know.   I was upset because he wasn't backing it up, he just denied what the others were saying. Not because I wanted to actually know.   There. That's all I wanted. You're right. Thank you.   I did?   Why don't you actually back it up instead of arguing the same way my 12 year old brother does?   You can put your flair on yourself in the sidebar. Just so people know your title and what country you represent.   Liechtenstein's 6+ year effort, the former subway station turned bunker is finally complete! This bunker is, for now, to be used for research and storage of government rations, weapons, vehicles, etc., but its true purpose is in fact a shelter in the event of a nuclear holocaust/meteor strike/other threat to all life on earth. Due to Liechtenstein's small population, the bunker is equipped to sustain a good portion of Liechtenstein's citizens for years.   Guarded by a large blast-proof gate, it is equipped with living quarters, water purifiers, air filters, environment suits, research and medical facilities, a command center, and more. Despite Liechtenstein's readiness, we truly hope that this bunker's true purpose is never actually needed. The bunker is also equipped with office space and storage facilities for Mann Co. Liechtenstein will always be willing to expand the bunker to make space for any country that is willing to pay and aide in the development.   The bunker is also home to a large meeting room and living quarters to allow for lengthy meetings between multiple world leaders to discuss business in a much safer and more private setting.   What about Liam Neeson simply as Dad   I couldn't stop laughing when he started talking.   Perfect.   If you help fund, we would be willing to send you part of the first batch of suits when they're finished.   Liechtenstein has been working on a bunker for years. We may be willing to negotiate expanding to allow for a small amount of space for Mann Co.   Liechtenstein and France have begun planning a new type of lightweight armor for military personnel. The armor will be made of a light plating sections attached to a suit. The material being used is a weave of spectra fiber and Kevlar. The plates will be separated along the suit to allow for easy mobility, but it'll be possible to add plates for situations where less mobility and more armor are necessary.  If this is successful, the armor ahould be able to resist a moderate amount of small arms fire and withstand anything less. The plates will also be camouflaged to allow for tactical use in any environment. The armor itself will be able to be upgraded and customized as the wearer sees fit.  Along with the suit, we will also be developing a helmet made of the same materials that covers the entire head and face of the soldier. These helmets will be fitted with a radio, a heads up display displaying information on the location (elevation, coordinates, temperature, etc.), an eye piece that allows for night vision, thermal, telescopic, etc., and in some cases, the helmets will be fitted with an oxygen supply. More information will be released if more research is deemed necessary.  This research is expected to take, if all goes according to plan, around 18 months.  As usual, this technology will be available for export upon completion and beginning of mass production.  Edit: some more stuff   We forgive you.   DO NOT QUESTION THE MOTIVES OF LIECHTENSTEIN!   Liechtenstein requests that this rail system goes through our nation. We are prepared to offer labor in return.   Liechtenstein's delegates have succeeded in negotiating the annexation of the micro nation known as Sealand. For the time being, Sealand will serve as an Atlantic watch post, small boat rest area, and marine study facility until future plans are complete.   Establishing a better relationship with our close neighbors is definitely in Liechtenstein's best interests. We will consider this.   Liechtenstein feels that a more permanent relationship between itself and France would definitely be beneficial. Especially after already experiencing working with France.   Liechtenstein is looking for a more permanent partner (or partners) to continue helping with military equipment research. This would also open a permanent free trade agreement between Liechtenstein and the country in question and Liechtenstein promises to help that country in its own endeavors. The first project will most likely be Light Personell Armor.   ~Signed, Hchste Kaiser of Liechtenstein, /u/test_subject7429   Hchste Kaiser is happy to attend   You're not alone. That movie is the shit.   As we said before, Liechtenstein fears no one. However, this expansion isn't militaristic. At least not at this moment.   Liechtenstein fears no one.   Liechtenstein has sent a diplomat to the teeny tiny nation of Sealand to discuss joining together our two great nations.    We'll send all available workers to aide in the construction immediately.   Liechtenstein could help you in planning and building this barrier. We have a lot of experience in wall building.   It's the Great North Land I think.   Though I fully trust my citizens, I agree. BACKGROUND CHECKS: REAPPLIED!   Liechtenstein is a fully militarized country. All citizens are trained soldiers and I trust them to the fullest.   [Meta] I'm pretty sure news posts aren't to be used unless its Sunday.   Hchste Kaiser has hereby made all firearms legal to privately own. Citizens no longer need background checks or any form of identification to own different types of firearms. All firearms minus government weaponry are now available to the public. Hchste Kaiser has also proclaimed April 12th to be national Go Shoot Things Day. All citizens are required by law to participate in this holiday. All of these rules have been implemented in the newly passed You Get a Gun, You Get a Gun, Everyone Gets a Gun! Act of 2023.  Edit: HCHSTE KAISER RETRACTS THE NO BACKGROUND CHECKS PART   I'm active!   Thanks!  	91

 Almost any food with protein will have all 9 essential amino acids.   The animals being raised for food suffer immensely, and there are far more of them suffering and dying each year than there are dogs and cats that we care for. If you care about animals it only makes sense to address the area where the vast majority of animals are suffering.  If you don't think you can go 100% vegetarian right away then you can still cut out most of the meat you are eating from your diet. Tell your parents that you would like to avoid meat, and they will likely be more accommodating too. Even when you are eating out or with friends you will be surprised by how often you can find meat-free options if you look for them. You can easily have a huge impact in lessening animal suffering with only a minor effort to choose more animal-friendly options.  Finally, keep in mind that you can stop eating meat, and don't hesitate to go fully vegetarian when you are ready. You may find that many of your peers are already doing it!                                                               Ultimately ethical veganism is a boycott intended to lessen the demand for animal products. Other animals do not possess all of the capacities that a typical human would have, but they show responses that appear quite similar to our own reactions to suffering when treated in many of the ways that would cause us to suffer.  [Utilitarianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism) is a common school of ethical thought amongst vegans. Utilitarians view an action as good if it maximizes the amount of goodness (generally judged as increasing pleasure or happiness, and minimizing pain or suffering) that is expected to occur as a result. While many ethical vegans will openly admit that they enjoy the taste of meat (evidenced by the numerous meat alternatives available for vegans today), they recognize that the harm caused to other animals to produce these products almost certainly exceeds the pleasure they gain as a result. The boycott that is veganism lessens demand for these products, and correspondingly supply will decrease as a result.  Another way of expressing this is in the principle of [equal consideration of interests](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_consideration_of_interests). That is to say that the interest of any individual should be given equal consideration where, and to the extent that the interest exists. This isn't to say that all interests are equal, experienced equally, or that all animals possess interests, but that where there are interests, we should weight that interest proportionally to the intensity of the interest and not discriminate on any other basis.   You vegans are so extreme! :P               Go on. I want to hear more of this story.            Vegans don't care what you eat. They care who you eat.   Other animals are individuals with lives and desires of their own that ought to be respected. A vegan is only going to speak up to the extent that someone's actions are violating another individual's rights. This meme clearly demonstrates a gross misunderstanding of the issue at hand.                                                                                 I use /r/friends to keep track of what redditors I like have posted without having to look at all of their profiles individually.   Isn't it amazing how these things find their way into vegan neighborhoods just by complete coincidence? ;)      Cruelty is cruelty, and suffering is suffering. Everything else is arbitrary.   In the Matrix humans were bred for the purpose of being used to generate energy for machines. Did that make it okay for humans to be used in this way? Did these humans lose all rights solely because they were bred for a purpose?   Full Quote:  Just how destructive does a culinary preference have to be before we decide to eat something else? If contributing to the suffering of billions of animals that live miserable lives and (quite often) die in horrific ways isn't motivating, what would be? If being the number one contributor to the most serious threat facing the planet (global warming) isn't enough, what is? And if you are tempted to put off these questions of conscience, to say not now, then when?   Jonathan Safran Foer         How many internet points does it cost to get banned?    Just want to throw in my vote for /u/justin_timeforcake. I have seen the great job they do on some of the other subreddits they moderate. /u/justin_timeforcake is an active part of /r/vegan and participates in vegan discussions across reddit. I think they would be a wonderful addition as a moderator for our subreddit.   Hey infinity!   I have noticed a lot of people referencing your username instead of mine. I do try to clarify, but getting the message out to everyone is near impossible. I hope you've been enjoying some of the nice things people have been saying about you, even if it is by accident.  -test_subject7471   Nothing I do is all that hard. Everyone here could be doing exactly what I do. There are plenty of other redditors that have more karma than I do (for now).  As far as tools go, I use a tool called [Reddit Scheduler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-scheduler/ekdpobinhbpdigokooncmmmamhmjfigl?hl=en) to get links to post at the times I want them to. It gets the job done 80% of the time, but 20% it will mess something up and not post anything else until I uninstall and reinstall it. It is also generally inconvenient to use, but it is the only thing I have found for making a lot of posts to reddit at the times I want. It would save me some trouble if someone made something better.  I also use [Reddit Later](http://www.redditlater.com/analysis/) to tell me when the best times to submit to a subreddit is. Unfortunately it just looks at when the most popular posts were submitted, which is a bit different from what time I should submit a link to get the most karma. It also tends to have a small sample size for a lot of subreddit since it only looks at posts since the first of the month. Improving upon this tool would also help.   Thank you all so much for all the kind words. This has made me so happy.   I'm actually taking a bit of a break from reddit for the next 10 days to do some real world activism, so I won't be on much. I hope you all cover for me in my absence.                                                                Every major dietetic organization in the world goes out of their way to publish statements that "appropriately planned vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. Any diet needs to be planned appropriately in order to be healthy. Yours is no exception, yet somehow you think that no matter how you slice it vegan diets are unhealthy. That takes some serious delusion.    You are benefiting right now from iodized salt, enriched flour, fortified breakfast cereals. It is widely recommended that any women who could become pregnant take a folic acid supplement. We are all living longer and healthier thanks to fortified and supplemented foods.   /u/Zhaey provided links to statements from all of the world's most prominent dietary organizations to back up his position. What evidence supports your claim?   Why does it matter what humans did historically or if humans are classified as omnivores if vegan diets are just as healthy?   **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  **[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**   A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.  **[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**   With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.  **[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**   A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ... Studies of UK vegetarian and vegan children have revealed that their growth and development are within the normal range.  **[The Dietitians Association of Australia](http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/vegan-diets/)**   Vegan diets are a type of vegetarian diet, where only plant-based foods are eaten. They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.  **[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**   Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.  **[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**   Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns. Australians following a vegetarian diet can still meet nutrient requirements if energy needs are met and the appropriate number and variety of serves from the Five Food Groups are eaten throughout the day. For those eating a vegan diet, supplementation of B12 is recommended.  **[The Mayo Clinic](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/vegetarian-diet/art-20046446)**    A well-planned vegetarian diet (*see context*) can meet the needs of people of all ages, including children, teenagers, and pregnant or breast-feeding women. The key is to be aware of your nutritional needs so that you plan a diet that meets them.  **[The Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada](http://www.heartandstroke.com/site/c.ikIQLcMWJtE/b.3484249/k.2F6C/Healthy_living__Vegetarian_diets.htm)**   Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can provide all the nutrients you need at any age, as well as some additional health benefits.   The majority of soy and corn being grown today is fed to livestock. You can't get more calories out of a slaughtered animal than you fed to it originally. If we stopped raising livestock and ate the plant food that we are already growing we would have more than enough food to feed everyone in the world (although we would probably grow less corn and soy and more of other crops).   But clearly the abundance of vegetarians that are happily thriving throughout the world is evidence that killing animals for food is needless.   You would certainly hope so if he is making statements like this.   The pope PMed me and admitted that he was telling millions of Catholics to vote brigade by downvoting non-Christian content. [Here is 10 hours of our conversation as proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=taO0TOwSF3U). The mods of /r/vegancirclejerk need to ban the pope.   Wouldn't it be even worse if the dogs had suffered their entire lives in conditions that livestock typically endure?  I know that we are used to livestock being raised this way and so we are predisposed to minimize how bad it could be, but any way I try to think about it the animals being raised as livestock almost certainly suffer more.                                          I just looked up Miller, Budweiser, and Pabst. The large majority of all of their beers are vegan.   Also Fanta does not include any fish... Where are you getting these ideas?   [List of vegan beers](http://www.barnivore.com/beer). Most beers appear to be vegan friendly.   It is also not uncommon for humans to die in construction. Many more humans die from pollution created by the electricity you use.  I think you would still state that you believe that humans shouldn't be murdered for profit despite the fact that you are using electricity.                           Full Quote:  Hold then the same view of the dog which has lost his master, which has sought him in all the thoroughfares with cries of sorrow, which comes into the house troubled and restless, goes downstairs, goes upstairs; goes from room to room, finds at last in his study the master he loves, and betokens his gladness by soft whimpers, frisks, and caresses.   There are barbarians who seize this dog, who so greatly surpasses man in fidelity and friendship, and nail him down to a table and dissect him alive, to show you the Mesaraic veins! You discover in him all the same organs of feeling as in yourself. Answer me, Mechanist, has Nature arranged all the springs of feeling in this animal to the end that he might not feel? Has he nerves that he may be incapable of suffering? Do not suppose that impertinent contradiction in Nature.  -Voltaire, *Dictionnaire philosophique portatif* (1764)  Explanation: In the 17th Century, Ren Descartes had advocated the idea that animals were mere automatons, or complex machines, and that lacking a soul they could not suffer. Followers of Descartes ideas, who Voltaire and others referred to as Mechanists, conducted gruesome experiments on animals with little consideration for the unimaginable misery the animals were forced to endure. The quote above was Voltaires response to those who were conducting these experiments with no consideration for the well-being of the animals involved.                              The issue isn't what they are being fed. The issue is that you will always need to feed an animal more nutrients than you can possibly get back from the animal's corpse.  If you want to be able to feed a large human population as you indicated in your prior comment then the way to do that is by having people consume plants directly instead of feeding plants to other animals and then consuming the animals.   There have been many times when scientific ideas have been censored in a similar fashion because people didn't like the conclusions. Far too many people today view philosophy as mere opinions, but whether they like it or not there are factual statements that can be made about individual wellbeing and the consequences our actions have upon others. Not everyone will agree with Singer's views, but he at least makes a good attempt to back up his views with solidly supported evdence on what the consequences of our actions will be, and is open to being shown that he is wrong if better evidence suggests otherwise. Censoring a world-renowned philosopher like Singer is a disappointing short term setback for philosophy, but as we have seen with controversial science, even with strong opposition accurate ideas win out in the end.   We could feed far more people than there are currently on earth if we weren't feeding so much corn and soy to farmed animals.    I'm a neurologist. QED   Do you also hate white people because they have a habit of blowing up the Oklahoma City Federal Building?  Don't hate a group of millions of  people because of something a handful of individuals may have ever done.   Have you heard how they talk about [black sheep](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_sheep)?   Proof: There is a guy with flair on /r/science   Undercover investigators with several different groups have gotten jobs at dozens of randomly selected farms and slaughterhouses within the past couple years. Every single time they come back with video showing horrifying conditions and terrible mistreatment. Even the industry acknowledges that mutilations like dehorning, debeaking, tail docking, and castration all without anesthesia are common. We know that many animals are kept in battery cages and gestation crates and those that aren't are rarely afforded much more space. Nobody should be able to buy these products anymore without acknowledging that they are paying to support animal cruelty.   Go gather the evidence and get it published in a peer reviewed journal then. Science isn't done by repeating "I'm a neurologist" on the internet, and you should know that.                                                                  I like how Google highlighted the Kip in Wi**kip**edia.   You continue repeating those same poorly designed studies and misrepresenting the conclusions of others despite being shown the flaws several times.  There is overwhelming consensus among dietary experts that appropriately planned vegetarian and vegan diets are healthy for all stages of life. You are like someone who keeps pointing to "gaps" in the fossil record as evidence that evolution did not occur.  **[American Dietetic Association](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864)**   It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes.  **[Dietitians of Canada](http://www.dietitians.ca/Nutrition-Resources-A-Z/Factsheets/Vegetarian/Eating-Guidelines-for-Vegans.aspx)**   A well planned vegan diet can meet all of these needs. It is safe and healthy for pregnant and breastfeeding women, babies, children, teens and seniors.  **[The British National Health Service](http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/Vegetarianhealth/Pages/Vegandiets.aspx)**   With good planning and an understanding of what makes up a healthy, balanced vegan diet, you can get all the nutrients your body needs.  **[The British Nutrition Foundation](http://www.nutrition.org.uk/publications/briefingpapers/vegetarian-nutrition)**   A well-planned, balanced vegetarian or vegan diet can be nutritionally adequate ...

They differ to other vegetarian diets in that no animal products are usually consumed or used. Despite these restrictions, with good planning it is still possible to obtain all the nutrients required for good health on a vegan diet.  **[The United States Department of Agriculture](http://www.choosemyplate.gov/healthy-eating-tips/tips-for-vegetarian.html)**   Vegetarian diets (*see context*) can meet all the recommendations for nutrients. The key is to consume a variety of foods and the right amount of foods to meet your calorie needs. Follow the food group recommendations for your age, sex, and activity level to get the right amount of food and the variety of foods needed for nutrient adequacy. Nutrients that vegetarians may need to focus on include protein, iron, calcium, zinc, and vitamin B12.  **[The National Health and Medical Research Council](http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55a_australian_dietary_guidelines_summary_130530.pdf)**   Alternatives to animal foods include nuts, seeds, legumes, beans and tofu. For all Australians, these foods increase dietary variety and can provide a valuable, affordable source of protein and other nutrients found in meats. These foods are also particularly important for those who follow vegetarian or vegan dietary patterns.

I've been straight edge my entire life and vegan for 7 years. They are both things I see merit to, and I can see some loose connections that can be drawn, but beyond that I don't see them as being deeply intertwined.   27.

 Not yet. I plan on working on one and have it out by the end of July. I need the money (poor college student with minimum wage job), but it will be on the Apple Bookstore.    Hey Redditors! Just started writing a new story set in a new setting. It's set in a alternative version of 14 century Europe, where America is being colonized. Some people are born with a gift- the ability to become one animal at will. However, they keep their ability hidden due to the Inquisition happening at the time. Dinosaurs are also alive in this universe, and are used as beasts of burden and pets, (yes, T-Rexes can be sweet pookies too). That's all I have for now, please feel free to ask questions!   Alternate 14th century Europe and is suddenly a epicenter for magic and creatures of myth.   I have a feeling this little one will be safe.   I want to have mythical creatures as characters. Like a griffin or chimera be able to use magic to become human to blend in. Dijin, fauns, dryads and other beings that can't look human can do this too.   Hey Redditors,  I'm working on a new series about wizards, sorcerers and mythical creatures in the modern day Big Easy and I've come across a problem. Most urban fantasy stories nowdays have some sort of 'hub', school, summer camp or institution set up for the fantastic in the setting. Any ideas on what I can do to make the idea of a 'hub' interesting?   Solids- Ores, patches of dirt that have odd properties, extreme mutagentic abilties that won't kill the affected being.  Liquids- Ooze found underground and floating in water around lakes and oceans. Gas- Found in caves primarily.      Hey Redditors! Whilst in vaction, I thought of a new idea for a hard fantasy series. It takes place in a fictional world named Crerth, where magic can be studied like science. Mages and wizards don't exist and magic is physically present in various states of matter. For hundreds of years the states of magic were studied and applied in various conservatories across the world. The researchers messed up on an blacklisted experiment to open a gateway into a world where magic naturally existed. This explosion of raw magic not only infused part of the population with magical properties, it also sent magical creatures like Grpyphons, dragons and various other monsters into Crerth. The story takes place fifty years after the accident, and revolves around an orphan boy who has magically enhanced senses. Not sure where to go, but I kinda like the idea. Any help would be appreciated!      Hey Redditors,  I've been working on a new world for superhero fiction and I need some help. I've been working on a Arrow-type archer named Quiver, a hero with no powers. I want to introduce powers and magic, but I'm not sure how I can do it. Should it be like a particle accelerator explosion like in the Flash tv show?   A Gifted's power is random. In rare cases, a two Gifted parents might have a child with both powers, but the chances are incredibly rare, like albino rare. Pooka's do need training to fluidly change into their animal form, but after about a year of training they can change without a problem. There is a myth that Pookas powers come from the God of the Hunt, Kartan, but in reality no one knows why they can change.     In Pantaria, sex and gender isn't a major issue, unless it's between a witch and a wizard. If that happens, a reality warper (sorcerer) is born and that isn't good.  Hetero and Homosexual pairings are the norm and bisexuality is applied to almost everyone. Contraceptives are mundane condoms, but inventive mages have created novelty types that enhance pleasure or can literally make sparks fly between the couple (yes, test subjects have died testing that last one). Sex can effect politics, especially when it's around election day. Marriage is a special affair that is celebrated with the throwing of 'glitter rice' and shredded Cunsack, a special fish at the peneical of festivities.    Thanks for the input! Any ideas or questions about the world? I need all the help I can get.   A Gifted's power is random.

Please Lewis, play Scion! http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scion_(role-playing_game)   I like that. It's easy to produce and should be easy to cast spells while wearing it. Any ideas on species of dragons? I know we plan on having a feathered species and possibly and aquatic species, but we need more input.   Nice! You think it might be unisex? We've got female riders too.   It's Medieval fantasy. Plate armour isn't viable because of the weight. I meant along the lines of uniforms, like the clothes that Riders wear outside of battle when on patrol or during missions.    We have plans for a sequal series, so the possibility of a series for kids isn't off the table. Since your interested, any ideas on Rider uniforms?   It's more aimed at older audiences, as sex, booze and blood are shown. We're either going to make it a graphic novel series or a book series, we're undecided.     It's an action/adventure series about three adopted brothers who are raised by a veteran Rider and use their powers to combat threats in a rapidly changing world. They deal with magicly enhanced super soldiers, demons, anarchists and a hyper intelligent dragon who hates humanoid races.   Nice, I like that idea. It's like a flamethrower that needs to be recharged.   He overthinks things and at the start, he doesn't feel like he's confident to face his foes on his own. He has an intense love of learning and literature, leading to him eventually becoming a Librarian in the Library of Reality(think L-Space from Discworld). He sees the book theft as his fault because he was too outgoing with a girl at the counter to notice it was stolen.   Like Team Arrow or Flash. I like it. Any suggestions on teammates abilities?   He doesn't get superpowers, but relies on his wits and magic items to fight. In terms of personality, he's quite and has social anxiety disorder. He's not really a fighter, but his parents bookshop needs that book back, so he puts aside his fear and forms the second identity to find it.    He goes in search of the book. By superhero, I mean he puts on a costume and    Hey Redditors,  I've been working on a new character to add to my shared world of Pantaria. He's the child of two bookshop owners who becomes a 'superhero' when a rare magical book is stolen by a guild of mysterious thieves. I need everyone's help because I don't know if he should have any powers, a team or what kind of gear he should use; aside from a gliding cloak.   Thanks!    Hugh Jackman.

I meant, if you were the kid of any god or godess, but based on your parent (mom or dad), what god would you be the kid of?   Hey Redditors,  Today's question. If you were a demigod, from any pantheon, but based on what attracted the god/godess to your human parent, what would you be and why?   	33
 These are absolutely gorgeous, the level of contrast between the colorful patterns and the black calligraphy. It's just beautiful, the flow of along with the contrast makes them really pop! Is there any inspiration references between the collab or similarities/inspiration in the artists' previous works?   It looks as though you've elongated the fingers too much and made the palm of the hand too small it should really be a bit bigger and maybe even extend past the wrist slightly...I could give a better critique if the original photo was also included for reference.    Also, consider blending the color of the hand's skin tone with the rest of the person's skin tone...Having it all lighter makes it look a bit superimposed...   Hey, thanks! I looked on kijiji and managed to not find these. Haha. Thanks! :)   I'm located in Halifax, Canada. And I'm looking for someone to dread or help me dread my hair...I have fine hair, naturally pretty straight.   But, I've been residue free for the past 8 months or so...Maybe even longer, I use Knotty Boy and Dollylocks bar shampoos. So, my hair shouldn't be too difficult to dread and I am hoping to use the back combing method and palm rolling.   Synthetics can be real hair and can be braided in not glued...   Thank you, wishing you a speedy recovery as well!!    I did it, and I'm very glad I did... Despite how I'm feeling right now and yesterday... My doctor found two spots of endo. I officially have a diagnosis and some relieve.  One of the spots was quite deep on the right side.    Also for anyone who can help it's random but how do you check a merina? I have no idea and can't bend enough to get one currently.    Thanks so much for the recommendations! :)    It's not the first show to keep the awful parts, I'm not saying its a good thing but shows have been way worse about the exact same issue...And if it was all rainbows and butterflies in these people's lives it wouldn't be worth watching...And the male characters have struggles too...One of the male characters is a closeted homosexual and they show realistic issues about that too...It's not like writers are out to get women. It's not every 3 minutes and in some of the cultures depicted in the show its a really relevant issue...Such as in Korea where Sun the business woman is located...And in the second episode she kicks major ass and continues to in the entire season and even prevails over the assumptions made about her because she is a woman in Korea   Honestly the female characters in this show end up being the most important characters in it. But again, if you want to judge it on the first episode and completely condemn it because its realistic in a way you don't like then by all means.    The thing is though...if you think about it the show is realistic in this sense...Women in the world do struggle with that kind of thing, how is it lazy writing to show those issues and then show the very same characters thriving and empowered...I think if you didn't judge the show so harshly in the first episode and gave it a real chance you wouldn't feel this way.   I get that feminism is important and as a woman especially but its a show and its a show that's realistic to how the world is. Especially when it comes to trans women. The issues its depicting here are actually why we need feminism and its not really encouraging the behaviours its depicting...But obviously you're a logical person and you get that...  For example Dexter is about a serial killer but its not telling people they should go out and do that but it gives a realistic depiction of that scenario in most cases...   Thank you so much! These look like awesome suggestions! :)    Reasonably priced, so probably under 20 to 30... I am currently using all drug store brands except my brow pencil is laura mercier...I'd prefer not to pay $58 for one thing...   But, I mostly just want recommendations of what's good and what works for others   Okay, so can someone that is good at make up help me pick out brushes, and good quality make up... I still don't want to go full on glam but right now I'm a noob that only knows how to do brows and basic things like eye shadow.    Also advice on contouring would be appreciated as well but subtle is best        Edit: my eyes are hazel, my skin tone is pale/milky white, my hair is a light copper color, my brows are light like my hair, and my price range is reasonable...I can't afford to pay $200 to have a a starting amount of make up... And I do actually have a bit like brow pencil, blush, white shadow, mascara, and one foundation brush...I have foundation but it needs work...I do like to combine liquid(bb cream) and powder foundations.   Thank you so much for replying, I will definitely treat myself beforehand...Tuesday is coming so fast I can't believe it.  I've arranged for my boyfriend to look after me afterwards so I'm pretty fortunate to know I won't have to do too much with a week off...But, it was still a worry for sure...  Its good to hear the drugging happens quickly, I'm going to be a ball of nerves at the hospital. But, I definitely realize that you're right...My pain is too bad to prolong this and getting a diagnosis is worth it.  I'm so glad to have gotten supportive and encouraging feedback, it means so much to me.    hahaha why in the hell are you looking at this sub then? Don't be a dick bud.      Thank you! I'll likely update this post once its done   I really really appreciate your input...Your experience makes me feel a lot better...Especially to hear about the energy 3 weeks in because I've been exhausted for the past year and a half since my pain got really bad...It was always there but has intensified to almost constant...   Its even better to hear good things about the Mirena because I'm supposed to be getting one and I already picked it up and that was another source of anxiety for me.   I'm very thankful that you commented on my post, thank you so so much. It means a lot to hear so much insight.   My first lap is this coming Tuesday and I'm really really scared about it. I've cried. I've worried. I've become terrified based on what others have said...  I just really need to hear words of why it was worth it, and positive experiences...I get that its surgery and its going to hurt. I basically just need some comfort from people who can understand my situation.   Thank you so much for the response, I called and the lady told me this possibility and then said she couldn't promise anything and hung up on me so this is reassuring.  	20

Everything Ive said Ive posted a source for, and all you keep throwing at me is hypotheticals and deflections.     Oh look it is the old "anti-Semite defense". Even though I said nothing bad about the Jews, and all im doing is criticizing Netanyahu/his government. Im an anti-Semite.

If he was to drop the big one the international community including the US would have to condemn him. Which would fuck up all his plans. But if he dropped a few leaflets he could say (and did) "Hey we warned them."  Plus that school I linked, he and his military knew well in advance that people where taking shelter in it.

 Is it really bashing a news website just to point out writing or grammatical errors any year 9 English student would be rapped over the knuckles for?   I'm *not* arguing about their website, I'm not arguing about their content, I'm arguing (or rather pointing out) that the standards of their reporters' headlines has plummeted.  For starters, "missus" is a really colloquial term I would not have thought any decent editor would be happy to present to the public on a national news website.   The sentence as a whole is something I would expect an 15 year old to write on his Facebook!   I mean can you look me in the eye and tell me that it doesn't come across as rather childish and unfitting of a national news provider?   I could argue I don't "not like" the website. I hate the level of unprofessional journalism.   They do post done good stuff every now and again, I loved their recent repost of a Washington post article about the birth of the internet for instance. But article titles like the one I highlighted are uncalled for.         It's also so damn unprofessional. They do do some good stories every now and again, but Jesus, that's appalling wording announcing a pregnancy from a seriously big news conglomerate.    Interesting it doesn't mention the monopoly over our international traffic in the form of the southern cross cable, or is that not a consequential part of our monthly bills?   Frustratingly they are also my sole source of local news (The Press) as nzherald and other free news sites simply don't cover the smaller chch stories.        I like the design, clean.   "A better camera" isn't bad. But stock is better. (Gs5)   Yes, they carefully used different types of explosions to perform a controlled descent.   The point of an implosion isn't to remove any material as people seem to think, it's merely a tool (when used correctly) to make it easier to deconstruct the building further.

Go options: and select "drive"   To be fair: "we have to compete against cheap supermarket beer, let's look at reducing our prices" said no beer owner ever.   You're not the first person to suggest bar owners shouldn't charge so fucking much for a drink, to be fair they're utterly the victims of their own demise, uni students etc just can't afford $15 for a 1.3 standard drink Smirnoff or whatever (and that was prequake prices..) So seriously, instead of changing with the times (more low alcohol beer, more food options, cheaper/better priced alcohol) they just whine, and bitch and complain how the world's against them.   The other argument I get told is "well there wasn't a reduction in bad behavior when the closing times were changed a while back" and it's like you diving kidding me?  You stupid cunts that should have led to a change in behavior before shit got worse.   Utterly no sympathy.   Disappointed he didn't even have a photo......      Itt: everyone looks up their own country.    Try using sports mode more often.  If in doubt, use the flash.  Always turn on your lights in the room (if indoors)  Your device will default to around 1/33 second (a third of a second) to take the lowest possible iso photograph. Sports mode speeds this up to around half a second, which is better than nothing.  Source of my info: s4 owner for a year, s5 current owner.   Both have no OIS (optical image stabilization) which means your hand has to stay dead still for around half a second! So you learn to make to do without it.   If you legitimately have trouble holding your camera still for a third of a second then I would strongly advise you look at OIS for your next device.    Ok was very clever with wording, it "plays" at 2100fps, but you're right, it's very misleading, hell my 100Hz tv fails to accurately insert frames to upscale, I really don't think this would be very accurate.    Oh Jesus. What the actual Fuck? Look up ignorant cunt in the dictionary, expect to find most of the commenters on that post.   Thanks, not implemented in touchwiz gallery, works in maps but is honestly a but useless, whereas a spiral motion can be indefinite zoom, up and down was shit even on a 5.1" screen.    So as the header suggests, what would it need to employ a system wide spiral motion to zoom in and out of everything from websites to documents etc.   I had this functionality on my Nokia N900, it made one handed usage unlike anything else since.   This would replace/supplement "pinch to zoom" as that inherently requires 2 hands, which (with today's 5 inch plus devices) is not always possible!   Anyway, any idea how this could be implemented, or is it a pipe dream to every see it back?    What's are the most ridiculous reoccurring questions you have to moderate out?    I really would not trust some randoms working at a gas station, especially if they were going to just "pop it into the till" where it would be forgotten about and become beer money when till was counted. All it would take if they forgot to tell the next shift about it, it would have been quickly and easily forgotten.   This way he turned a forgettable event "oh, didn't that guy hand in 50 bucks last night?" Into "oh that wanker the other day, yeah he took the money"  Ironically this probably helped the staff recall the event, also ensured other shift workers knew about the money and ensure it got back to the old lady.

"The companys 2015 flagship is an improvement in almost every aspect over last years model"    Sitting at work fucking cracking up at your comment..   [My face reading this.](http://suptg.thisisnotatrueending.com/archive/6875439/images/1259252418682.png)  There is plain stupid, then there's just **don't reproduce** stupid. This is the latter.         No. As per my comment it's not the media, it's the local residents who aren't waking up to a simple fact they have a severe problem.  However swearing at, and making presumptuous comments at people who aren't blaming the media seem at odds with your angry anti media sentiment.   As proven time after time this kind of violence needs to addressed by very citizens it affects the most, the sons, daughters, husbands and wives if those murdered need to tackle the problem head on, and bring the crime rate down together. The culture of blaming others needs to stop if they're ever to reach a satisfactory outcome (of a more peaceful crime free neighbourhood).   It was a generic statement you arrogant cunt.   find the fuckers who are paying for it, and make their flesh a worthy commodity too.   It's all shits and giggles until someone giggles and shits..   Why is that ageist? No benefits for people my age are not means tested, in fact many are stonkingly hard to acquire, and aren't worth it.  For the record, here's the table for the amount of money you get [for being being on the pension](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/nz-superannuation-and-veterans-pension-tables/new-zealand-superannuation-and-veterans-pension-ra.html)  We pay more to our old people than we do to a [single parent](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/main-benefits-rates/sole-parent-support-current.html)  [Or to people looking for a job.](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/main-benefits-rates/jobseeker-support-current.htm)  And if you do work until you're 65, even on a meagre salary you don't get any support at all.  So yes, it's absolutely ageist, we pay our old people regardless of..  * How much they've worked, * How little they've worked,  * Whether they're still working,  * How much money they own or have in the bank,  * What assets they have,  * How many dependents they have.. * Whether they're in the country *Or ANY of the prerequisites required of the younger generations.  So yes, applying no rules for 1 age bracket, and every rule under the sun for every other age bracket is extremely ageist.      That's fucked up, 1 "white on black" killing everyone is up in arms. 211/216 people killed were black, fucking no-one says anything.   Fuck, how does anyone do anything in that backwards fucking town if they all walk around with their eyes closed?    Honestly, I'm not going to get a pension until I'm 80 (seriously if ever at all), and I can't even apply for a cheap doctors visit due to the government means testing everything for anyone my age, so really not the best person to ask.   As I said, Fuck this ageist culture.   Going to unleash a shit storm here, but seriously: Means test superannuation.  No seriously, let's look at the biggest 'arguments' and show why it's a fucking cop-out.   **"They've paid tax their entire life."**  * For starters, this doesn't apply to immigrants. * Paying tax isn't a fucking retirement nest egg plan, it's called playing life.  **"Why should you punish those who have saved for their retirement?"**  * You're not punishing them, they're punishing the future generation by taking from their future retirement who can't afford it, because you fucked the economy. * Why? Seriously, they listened, they saved, they were never guaranteed a wee bonus for living a long time.  **Let look at a few facts:**  * **We can't afford to keep paying Superannuation at the current rate.** * As a 27 year old who's the sole breadwinner for their family the government has decided I can't get any assistance or even the fucking community services card, despite the fact we're barely holding our head above water by eating into savings. * My generation basically cannot hope to have superannuation. Certainly not at 65, probably not even 70 years old.   So there, fuck your guaranteed money for being old. I'm sick of this ageist culture.   Looks like bluebells Http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyacinthoides_non-script            Don't count me in that basket. I was an angry cynical fuck before my son was even a twinkle in my eye.   I think you just summarised most of America there McCyn.   Actually not. If you factored in our average wage vs cost of living we are actually comparative to everywhere else. Edit: [I'll try and find more, but here's one showing we're comparative to say Hong Kong.](http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Cost-of-living/Average-monthly-disposable-salary/After-tax)   [As usual, XKCD hits the nail on the head.](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/cell_phones.png)   So let's get this straight.. They're fucking over his learning and friends over actually parenting their son and telling him to grow the fuck up and shave?  Yeah, what a life lesson this is.      Indeed. But increasing the price without offering any incentive should be business suicide.  However they made $137M profit 2013, and $165M profit in 2014. and $92.5M profit in the 6 months up til December 2014, so this year is expected again bumper profits.  I'm not saying a company can't make profits, obviously that's ultimately what they're there for. But in the same breath a consumer only has appetite for a certain amount of cost, and Sky are pushing that further and further every year to see how far they can go before it blows up in their face.   That to me seems like an obscenely arrogant way to push up profit at the cost of losing customers.   Seems like someone has analyzed the NZ public, and has done the math as to what they think Sky can get away with at each incremental charge increase.  Given their profit's only going up and up in substantial amounts it appears that this is done purely for greed sake, as they haven't released anything recently to justify the price increase..  I don't know, I'm not a business analyst, but I'm not stupid, so I can see why, (Profit) I just think it's wrong. (Greed.)   In before it's taken out of commission for repairs.   What a stupid bunch of stupid, arrogant suck-their-own cock wankers.  Executive 1: "Shit, we're hemorrhaging subscribers hand over fist" Executive 2: "Oh that's cool, we'll just up the amount our subscribers have to pay."  How the fuck do they see logic in this!?      Yes, the mods are a bit slow on this one.   Yeah, it is to me, but probably not really to anyone else.      there's a fucken webpage highlighting how many cuntbags decline to show NZ on a map: http://worldmapswithout.nz/ So yes, it's a fucking big deal with someone actually does take the time to make a fucking accurate map, actually showing NZ.    That is a rant worthy of the very title. Well done.   Very: Reserve Bank considering new regional lending rules to target Auckland investors... Making it easier for speculators to drive house prices up.   Ah ok, in which case the thermal envelope argument is as invalid as with with the 810.         Actually this makes sense. Here's why:  * Smaller die fabrication could result in less power consumption, thus less heat production, and increased thermal envelope. * The average useage scenario for most people is short bursts of activity, so having 4x high performance cores that are available for short bursts makes sense for ensuring UI responsiveness, quick camera processing. * The 2x medium performance cores which are available for sustained constant useage (think gaming etc.) * And your 4x low power cores for your fitness tracking, background thumbnail and media processing etc.  As the 810 works for short periods, having something use 50milliwatt for 10milliseconds is preferable than something that uses 40milliwatts for 20milliseconds.    And there's another side to that as well, having your dualcore use 20mW at 150ms to get the same result as your octocore using 20mW at 10ms, so it uses more power, but it's significantly faster, so using less power over-all in a 'burst' environment   Actually it makes sense, all phones have a thermal envelope to play with.  Either you can have a 1ghz dual core that can operate at 100% constantly and never hit it..  Or..  You can have a 4ghz Octocore which hits it in 15 seconds.  Now, as you've pointed out, most people don't need their processor working all the time at 100% However most people do want NO LAG, and INSTANTANEOUS response time. This needs immediate grunt on tap.  So where as your dualcore can respond within 150ms at all times Your Octocore can respond with 10ms for your 15 seconds until you hit your thermal envelope.  Obviously people want a faster response time, over sustained performance, so will go for your Octocore.      Oh noes! You can't sell alcohol for 2 hours! And OH MY GOD! They want you to stop selling near schools!?!? How DARE THEY!?  It's not like you encourage excess drinking by heavily discounting wine and beer, that's silly talk.  And hey, unlike pubs and bars, you supermarkets have ZERO responsibility when it comes to dealing with your 'patrons' once they've consumed your product. That's pretty mint ay?  So that's cool. Let em come, and let them buy to get shit faced at home, cause hey, that's not your problem.  (_)   Australia spend $100,000 sending delegates to UNESCO countries to lobby them against voting the reef as "In Danger" which would severely limit the amount of dredging, dumping and otherwise systematic destruction of the Reef by the government.  This was hidden within the "politics" section, despite the severe implications should they succeed.       Yeah, it wouldn't be so bad if the cost was borne by the ultimate winner from those dollars - government, instead of weighing heavily against an already underfunded health department. But I see your point.   Did not know this!    Exactly, you can't turn someone away from healthcare just cause they don't have insurance. However the current system *appears* to not be working in the best fashion as being owed almost $100M is quite shit.   I know people think this is just tourist bashing, but it's just this simple:  Hospitals should be hospitals and help sick people.  They shouldn't be debt collectors.               Yes, watching it for a third time myself!          I understand OP answered your question long term, but shortterm, what does it mean to you?  Not a lot, the biggest impact will be to farmers.  To your average Jo Bloggs in NZ it will mean bigger more noticable storms, more dry, warm drought ridden spells, coupled with higher winds. (Think Christchurch norwesters.)  To your farmers? It will spell bankruptcy for many, especially dairy farmers, which is typically quite water intensive.  We'll also see produce prices rise, as more foul weather will result in bad crops.   I don't know, hence the question mark. I can tell you year ending 2013 $6.67 billion was spent by tourist. However you're missing the point. [Source](http://www.med.govt.nz/sectors-industries/tourism/pdf-docs-library/key-tourism-statistics/key-tourism-statistics.pdf)  Tourists pay for conservation.    I am.   We've fucked the weather up, fossil fuel use coupled with deforestation means we're fucked hard.    Actually small towns like the Franz Joseph makes hundreds (millions?) of thousands of dollars from tourists, some of which is pumped back into conservation.   So ironically by saying "it's bad for the environment" it's quite the opposite   It's fucking tragic. One of my best family trip memories is going to Franz Joseph glacier, and seeing the actual foot of the glacier.  It's depressing to think I can never repeat that same trip with my son.

I don't have a leg to stand on here. Out of respect  to his family I've removed my comment.   Yeah, but more the ability to add rules to it - "only for Wifi" for instance. (On unrooted phones as I figure this would be possible via an exposed module?)  I know there's a restrict background data option for 3G, but for people on limited data plans it still doesn't help if you're conserving your data and you accident open Snapchat, and it starts to load all the featured stories!  But yes, I also miss AppOps.   Far more useful I would think is giving access to like a Firewall of sorts, allowing us to ban certain apps from communicating with the internet, or access to 3g/Wifi?

Ah ok, I presume then I didn't see any social/media backlash due to being in Chch, not Rangiora. Makes sense.   Jesus. Thanks Bruska, that's excellent legwork. I wonder what the stats are for Chch? (I've tried looking them up but couldn't find anything as detailed as that!)   No, you're completely right. It's just funny, there was such a community backlash when they proposed similar rules here in chch, but they've just simple implemented it in Rangiora.  Don't get me wrong, I'm happy about it - I'm too old and ugly to go bars and pubs but I'm just wondering why/how they were able to swiftly put it in place without public backlash akin to that of Chch.   Touch. But I'm curious to know how they weighed this up vs the livelihood of the affected establishments?       thank you Fogeater132, I haven't configured external access yet, as it's going through a Vodafone branded router with no UPNP/port forward configuration options so it keeps failing.

IT'S A FUCKING QUAD CORE 3.8 GHZ. THAT WAS **JUST PLAYING THE FUCKING VIDEO!!**  Any recommendations please?   No. You're right.   I read it and .. just, wow. Their love, trust in one another is complete. They are very lucky to have each other to get through something like that. Thank you, it does change my perspective.    No, revenge doesn't even come into the equation.   My very rough understanding of the law is take into account all the actions, all the facts, without prejudice or feelings. Heavily coming into this is it's the child's mother. We wouldn't be having this discussion if it were another relative.  As I keep saying, as far as the law's concerned, this baby was killed by a mothers negligence.   There's an entirely innocent victim here, and while it's beyond heartbreaking for the mother I feel the weight of the act that was carried out needs to conveyed with a different sentence than discharged without conviction.    It would recognise that there was a victim here. A baby who paid the ultimate price for someone else's negligent actions.  This woman is a victim of her own incredibly tragic making, the baby is an entirely innocent victim here.     No, I would imagine to the mother, no pain is enough as no pain will bring back their child.  I'm not wishing any further punishment on the mother, who as I said will suffer every single day, for the rest of her life.  I just do not believe it's fair to reflect the way this poor child died with a discharge without conviction.    I am.  I put myself into her shoes.  If this were to happen to my son, I would feel like the worst human being out there.  The guilt alone would cause immense palpable pain every day.  Whatever the justice system could do to me would be mere pittance to the unbridled passion with which I would hate myself every single day I lived.  However we must let the law run its course, the police speak for the baby who lost their life, they want justice for her not just split second, but ongoing negligence for hours which caused the baby to suffer.   I'm going to be downvoted here, but this woman isn't a victim, her child is.  For everyone asking for a discharge without conviction can we at least recognise the severe and extreme pain that poor child would have been in before they died?  The simple fact here is a baby, whose entire existence is dependent upon their family, died due to her mothers inattention.  Regardless of culpability this victim suffered before she died horribly, and her sentence needs to reflect that.  To allow her to get away with this with a discharge without conviction is not recognising the extreme pain this baby suffered due to her negligence.    I now I'm horribly disappointed, and even more frustrated with Samsung.      How about you do the decent thing and allow S5 owners to access the Camera2 API? As soon as my warranty's up I'll be modding it just to get decent manual controls.  	131
 Please let us know of your results.   Can we get a confirmation on where you got it from or what? Jesus. I need it in my life.   Sometimes out of nowhere I'll go through a nausea kick, no matter which strain I use. Just had one recently, about 3 weeks ago. Lasted about a week. IDK where they come from but I'm glad they leave lol.   There's no way of knowing whether it will help the worst of your withdrawals, because we don't know how much morphine will be in your tea. It has the potential to get you higher than kratom ever could if it's a good batch, so obviously that would obliterate withdrawals. There's just no way to know without either doing it or doing some fancy pants lab magic and finding out how much morphine is in it. And yeah, definitely a cross tolerance. I mean, maybe if you sip tiny amounts every day, don't even catch any sort of buzz, and just not get sick... I suppose kratom may work again after a while of that. But I don't really know, there's just no telling with PST.    Yep. Nope. Bad idea. Since poppy seed tea is essentially morphine, it would make much more sense to use kratom to get off poppy seed tea, rather than the other way around. Heh. Not to mention, poppy seed tea is a huge crap shoot. You could get 6 mg of morphine, or you could get 600 and fucking die.    Super sketch son.   Same here. It would be cool if the KGs were about 50 bucks cheaper... there's a lot of places that are definitely cheaper than HS... but with HS, I know what I'm getting, and you can't put a price on that.   Never been there, but I've been to Texas. The first time I ever tried ice was in Texas, I forgot to drink water for 3 days and ended up in the hospital. I've been careful to hydrate very well ever since then, especially on meth... not that I do meth anymore.   Probably dippin into OP's kratom sacks.   Somebody in Austin be fuckin up.   Get a tracheotomy done and just scoop the kratom directly into your neck hole.   Why you stirring the pot, son?   Here you go. http://www.freeflys.com/   Sick prices bro.   You misspelled "speciosa" up near the top of the page.   You misspelled "difference" in your motto "Smell the difference". I see you "copyrighted" it, you'll probably want to fix that quick cuz a copyright symbol after a blundered phrase looks sort of unprofessional.   Under "The Truth" page, you have "comeback" instead of "come back", the latter being correct the correct version.   You also have "headyherb@outlook.com" as your email, which could very well be your email, I just wanted to let you know just in case it's supposed to say "headyherbs@outlook.com".  I'll keep an eye out for reviews on your shit. Interested to see what's up.   Me too   I've only ordered from MS twice, both times it was Bali and for some reason I was having a negative reaction to it... never had their red veins. I'm sure MS's other stuff is good or whatever but I haven't tried anything else from them. Some people say the quality is the same, some say HS's quality is lower, some say it's higher, but the one thing I do know is that it's just a better deal. I'm not trying to plug for HS or anything, just sharing my experience. There are vendors out there who are cheaper than HS and supposedly have just as good or better quality but I haven't tried them so I can't recommend any of them personally.   http://www.herbal-salvation.com/cat/Ingredients.cfm/id/RVTPWDR boom. There's a second page with more products on it. That's where the Thai hides. Red vein Borneo is great too but the red vein Sumatran is my favorite. The quality is great. The shipping label says Viable Solutions, LLC. The bags of kratom have strain name, company name, and not meant for human consumption. Not sure which you meant by labeling.   5g when you get up, 5g between 3-5 pm, 5g around 9. Keep doing it even if it doesn't seem to satisfy your urge, because you're not satisfied the way you're doing it now anyway. If you stick to that, each day you'll start to feel it a little more, and eventually you'll get back to feeling good from it again. I've done it in this rhythm for six months and it works perfectly for me. Sometimes I took too much for a couple days and screwed up my tolerance, I just stuck to my usual dose and it went right back down. I have one of those nifty 2 and 6 gram scoops from HS, and a scale, although I don't use either because I know what 2g looks like now.  EDIT: I get up at 6 AM. The timing of your second and third dose are obviously relative compared to the time your first dose of the day is. Second dose should be between 9-11 hours after your first dose, and then your third dose would be 15 hours after you wake up, roughly. Might take some tweaking but I think it would work.   Lol you're on this shit every day, how did it take you 17 days to see it? You must be in a fierce kratom fog. I want.   He surely was.   RVS. RVT. RVB.    Don't ever apologize for taking the test_subject7558's side, son.   Yep, I referred to it in this thread the other day: http://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/comments/2zv9w1/been_ordering_from_same_vendor/  I thought I was the only one who felt that way.   A lot of people say the differences between vein colors are all in your head, but they don't know what it's like to be sensitive to certain veins. It's pretty fuckin blatantly obvious to me.   I just wanted to show you what a healthy log looks like. Why must you hate? I did it for you, man... I did it for you.   As if "Leslie" is a better name for a dude.    IF YOU LOVE IT SO MUCH, WHY DON'T YOU MARRY IT   No, it's a person who sells toilets... sort of like a soda jerk sells sodas. You don't want to take kratom before them because they're notoriously selfish, you should always offer them the first dose. You can't blame them, you would be selfish too if you spent your days trying to talk people into buying something to shit in.   Don't act like you're not impressed.   Relevant: http://imgur.com/i4KwIc9         (NSFW)   Precisely. My grandfather was Phallus Tickler, Esq. Surely you've heard of him.   I suppose that depends who you ask.   If there's one thing I know about redosing, it's that you don't do it right before a toilet jerk, or you're gonna have a bad time.   My middle name is Redose. Boner Redose Tickler.   What.   I always had a crush on Bea Arthur. I'd eat her shit if she needed me to.    Sometimes I run out of spring water and I have to use ginger ale (that I usually chase with as an anti-nausea tool) and I'm always surprised at how easy it is. It's like it fizzes up when it mixes with the kratom and makes it so I can't really feel the powder I'm swallowing, just soda fizz.    Gotta be.   You ever try to taper off the tram? I can't even imagine how tram has you by the balls like that. Kratom does way more for me effects-wise than tram ever has. I don't even feel tram, I think I must be what they call a non-responder.    Why don't you quit being a dickface    YMMV, my nuggah.   I've used it several times for other things and I never received it the next day. It was 2 days every time.   I hear that loud and clear man. It's a pain right in the nutsack.   I'm envious of you then lol. Last time I took a half g of Maeng Da, my skull felt like it was caving in. Weird shit man.   So the only angle they must have is a plan to reveal the strain names after so long then right? That would be the only thing that makes sense. It's still not right to leave people clueless about whether they're uppers or downers or inbetweeners though. Granted, people don't have to take them, but it just seems like a foolish move on MS's part. But then again, they must be doing something right lol.   Unbiased? Why do they need it unbiased? Are they taking surveys from them to find out which ones they like? This is a serious question, I do not know. And I'm not mad, I just don't get it. I am a touch jelly of their sick loot sacks and notoriety though.   Yeah man, I cannot believe that MS hands out samples and doesn't even clue people in on whether it's an upper or a downer strain. Upper strains seriously make me feel like I'm going to have a seizure. Idk what kind of slick bullshit MS thinks they're up to, they could at least inform people of the vein color or up/down effect. You would think they would at least do that for their loyal customers that pay $50 for 100 grams like it's the only god damn kratom source on Earth. But no, it's all a secret fuck fuck game, as if they have secret formulas they don't want other vendors to steal or some shit. I just don't understand what people see in them. I don't get it, and I'm actually really jelly of MS, cuz those mother fuckers are ballin big dog style. Tons of customers paying that kind of money, I can't even imagine what their profits are like. I hope someday I run a legal racket half as profitable as they do.   I have a penis and not a vagina so I toss and wash.   Smoking black tar heroin can stop your shitter right up. A lot of people here seem to believe that the reason your shitter gets stopped up is because we're consuming all that powder. I personally believe it's the effect of the drug and its alkaloids on your body that cause the constipation, not because of the powder physically stopping you up. I can take Bali from any vendor at 18 grams a day and shit like a pro. But if I throw red vein Sumatran into the mix, as I always do, my shitter jams right up and stops working. You could start taking a tiny 8 mg Suboxone pill once a day and you might not shit for a week, and it's certainly not because the pill is causing some sort of obstruction. It's just what opioid(ish) substances do. Am I saying consuming 50 grams a day isn't going to physically obstruct your bowels to a degree? No, it could certainly contribute, but the primary reason your shitter doesn't shit is because of the alkaloids within the leaf, not the leaf itself.    I changed the blade halfway through the shave, no difference. I tried all angles. I might cop some feather blades and give it a shot, but if that doesn't work, I don't know that I want to drop however  much money on a nicer one if it's not going to do the deed.   Some cheap ass piece of shit from eBay. That's why I'm wondering if it just doesn't hold the razor at the correct angle or some shit.   I haven't tried a different blade yet, just the Astra ones that came with it. I planned on trying some feather blades I guess? What blades do you use?   Show him your reddit username, or else.   14 years old and you own a tea company? I need to reevaluate my life.   Ohhhh so you and I just blew their cover? Dang. How could we be so stupid?    What is this burn you guys keep talking about? Do you mean you're smoking it? You're probably constipated cuz you're smoking it bro. Cut that shit out.   Nope, it's on correctly. Thanks though.   Alright, I got a safety razor off eBay for 10 bucks, it came with 5 Astra blades. Sometimes i get a halfway decent shave with it (never as good as with a disposable), other times (like tonight) I can't get close at all. I tried getting these same hairs for 20 minutes, couldn't get them, then grabbed a double blade disposable and immediately eradicated them with one swipe. I changed the blade on the safety razor, did not help at all. I also tried all angles of holding it. I shaved with the grain, against the grain, and sideways. I really want to like this razor. I really do. I feel like a big dog when I shave with it but I don't look like a big dog without a big dog smooth shave. Does it just not bend the blade to the correct angle? Would a Gillette Fatboy really make a difference? Or should I just call it quits and go back to disposables? Thanks in advance.   I took it maybe 6 or 7 times back in the day, and I always took 300 mg. I stopped taking it because it's just fuckin retarded, but I was never sensitive to it like this back then. I dunno but you're right, no DXM ever again.   I took kratom at 8 pm tonight, a full 24 hours after I took the 15 mg of DXM. I can still feel the DXM more than the kratom. I just hope tomorrow morning the shit is finally fuckin gone because I can't deal with this dex glow anymore. The fact that I can still feel it so much is blowing my fucking mind apart.   Go on the darknet and find somebody who will relay and ship the kratom to you in Indiana for a fee.   Why don't you just get a PO box in Ohio? Boom. Problem solved. How you wanna do this? Money order? I got Paypal too.   I have anxiety problems as well. Maeng Da and white veins do it to me too, along with a slew of other symptoms.  I just don't take upper strains and I don't have those problems.    Yeah. I should have heeded your warning.    Yeah they're a bunch of old mother fuckers. Early bird style   Thank Jesus I didn't take thirty mg like I kept reading. I'm really sensitive to some things. I gotta go to dinner with my family at 3 today, I would usually eat kratom right before but now I'm beginning to think I should skip it and maybe tonight's dose too.   I went ahead and tried the DXM potentiation method. I took one 15 mg coughgel thirty minutes before my dose last night. All it did was space me the fuck out and make me feel really uncomfortable and shaky. Sleep was fitful. I got up this morning feeling pretty normal again, I go drop my morning dose and fuckin bam... That bullshit feeling hits me like a ton of bricks again. Now I'm at fuckin work feeling like shit and I'm pissed. I took it last night specifically because I didn't have to work at that time. Am I going to feel it like this at my afternoon dose too? When does it go away? I took it at 8 pm last night. I feel a lot of regret for this decision. It doesn't feel like kratom potentiation at all, I don't even feel the kratom. It's more like DXM potentiation. I feel like I took 150 mg of DXM.   	66
 typical reddit user. wrong again. seen many, many movies, and i like these ones.    agreed   I partially agree they're not perfect films but i dont take them small criticisms and use them to say they're terrible like everyone else. I THINK they're very good films.    not fact   no, your wrong, completely wrong   The Hurt Locker    thanks!   I read that they did but no on the Newswire.  Is it officially coming to PS4? I'd love it if it did.    i need someone to give me $$$$s   just because a movie you dont like has a high % on RT doesnt mean RT should go. get a grip pls, thanks.    I like The Hobbit, Quantum of Solace, Man of Steel, Indiana Jones 4 (what I remember of it) - Dark knight Rises is one of my all time favorites.   Hipster reddit pricks, Hate me all you want - I like these films.    I'd do a Toy Story and Monsters Inc crossover. It's the only one i could think of that wouldn't need any convenient plot points to get the characters together. Say Mike or Sulley goes into Bonnie's bedroom one night, the toys wake and "the adventure begins" so to speak. what would you do? (no hate)  	12
 I'm the guy in the bright orange and black shorts btw.  	1
 I'm not sure what was happening here: someone in the comments said it was a black protest march. So the gun guys decided to make it an open carry march? I can see how that's a bit presumptive maybe but the gun dudes didn't seem to be bothering anyone; was is considered racist to bring guns to a black march? He seemed to be marching in support with the black people, just with guns.. So that's racist? I don't get it. I'm not even into guns or open carry laws etc but why did the gun dude seem like the most reasonable person there? I was confused by it. I was confused by the whole thing.    oh calamari thats another one i love! clams are pretty good too, and mussels and especially scallops! I'll add conch to the list of strange seafood i gotta try!   you are VERY welcome. i can relate to feeling guilty over just about anything; i dont know why but guilt has always been a huge part of my anxiety issues. its like, i KNOW im trying to do the right thing and be a good person but somehow it often FEELS like im just a douche, if that makes sense? one of the hardest things sometimes is taking care of yourself and being kind to yourself. i think because we worry we are just being selfish or narcissistic ourselves, but not wanting to take on someone elses issues because you know how much it will hurt you actually shows empathy, in my opinion, which is the opposite of narcissism. especially if they only want you to hurt anyway.  its like; if you can pull a drowning person out of the water, you can try to help them and give them mouth to mouth and bring them back to you. but if you cant pull them out, if they are fighting you and dont want your help, you have to recognize that before they drag you under with them.   sorry that got a bit dramatic at the end there but i think its still relevant :/ i think knowing you are doing the right thing and dealing with your own guilt issues is a far more manageable task than dealing with other people abusing and shaming you because of THEIR issues. its not worth it, you do not deserve it, you are better than that and although it may not feel like it, there is NO SHAME in saving your own life (literally or metaphorically) if and when it comes to that.  edit: spellings   i can definitely appreciate that. i actually generally like those kinds of "niche" foods (another one thats a super overrated thing i really like is escargot with garlic butter) but now i dont know if ive ever tried cavier. i'm gunna have to do it sometime.   like, im not even saying cavier is gross, but talk about overrated; crazy expensive, tiny portions, status symbol (at least the "good stuff") fish eggs... its pretty weird if you think about it for too long..   haters gonna hate, you just do you, bro.   learn to say the alphabet backwards: whenever people hear thats a sobriety test they are like WHAT i cant even do that sober! then you could be like oh yea? check THIS out ;)   Caviar - its JUST fish eggs people!   i have to go to work 2-4 days EVERY WEEK :(  edit: words  	9
 Some people aren't really into the whole "you just need to get past this first boring thousand page setup book then it gets good" thing   It's intellectually dishonest to group every woman's issue - most very pressing and relevant - with this cowardly act of giving in to censorship   science fiction  noun  fiction based on imagined future scientific or technological advances and *major social or environmental changes*, frequently portraying space or time travel and life on other planets.   do you get points for killing unarmed black people in this game   Never heard of Spatterjay before. Looked it up and it sounds good, added to the TBR list   * *Dune* by Frank Herbert * *The Road* by Cormac McCarthy * *1984* by George Orwell * *A Clockwork Orange* by Anthony Burgess * *Cat's Cradle* by Kurt Vonnegut  cliched list but whatever    Because kicking the crap out of people and burying your emotions are clearly qualities to hold in high esteem   Mainly wondering if there are daily deals within the weekend sale   Any chance any of these titles gets cheaper throughout the weekend?   *A Good Man is Hard to Find* or *Everything that Rises Must Converge* by Flannery O'Connor      Try Jesse Ball      Intent is the key here - it's clearly an act of satire. It's a joke that's meant to be a little bit shocking/offensive. I don't think it's something we should be stringing up the mother over.   What "behavior" is actually so offensive here? It's not like he's reading passages from the book to the class      You aren't alone   Is that what we're basing this on, not quality? You're right that it isn't close, but the movie is better.      Go watch the nutty professor   It's a dumb idea that won't inspire voracious reading regardless of what the kids dress up as - that is created at home over years of encouraging reading as a parent. Let the kids have their fun.   Drive, A Clockwork Orange, No Country for Old Men, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, There Will Be Blood   Jesse Ball's work - *Samedi the Deafness*, *The Way Through Doors*, *The Curfew*, *Silence Once Begun*...beautiful dreamlike writing      also High Rise   harry crews is the best      I like your list. Films I'd put on:  Drive, A Clockwork Orange, No Country for Old Men, Shawshank Redemption, The Shining, There Will Be Blood                  Except it sort of did. ..  http://lovecraftzine.com/2014/08/04/did-the-writer-of-true-detective-plagiarize-thomas-ligotti-and-others/      *All the Light We Cannot See* by Anthony Doerr   From this [interview](http://www.powells.com/blog/interviews/anthony-doerr-the-powells-com-interview-by-jill/) -  DOERR: Good, good! Certainly even though the book looks thick, I think the pages are friendly to readers because there's a lot of white space. I think you can actually turn the pages quickly. My prose can be dense. I love to pile on detail. I love to describe. I'm much more reluctant to give the reader entrance into a character's feeling than describe what's around him or her and have the reader intuit the internal life of a character. I know that's demanding, so this was a gesture of friendliness, maybe. It's like I'm saying to the reader, "I know this is going to be more lyrical than maybe 70 percent of American readers want to see, but here's a bunch of white space for you to recover from that lyricism."   great use of irony, you will go far as a writer!   I love how half of this sub takes being stubborn enough to realize that they only read white men and rather than think "hmm maybe I'm inadvertently missing a large portion of literature that I could enjoy" they just wear it like a badge of honor instead   He's not for everyone. Skip   Mentions is one thing, claiming 99 percent of a book devoted sub hasn't heard of him is another   Anyone with a small familiarity with Lovecraft knows who he is - I think you're overshooting it a bit buddy   The original comment  that is now deleted people were talking about linked to a different review of the same book. I am pretty excited to pick it up as well.        Yes blacks in America had it rough. But with the passing of each year it falls deeper into the past and becomes less relevant.  Did you watch the news at all in the past year? What you are saying is patently wrong.   I used to like NPR but their daily hour of skin color talk and articles is sickening.  Imagine being black and having to deal with it all the time?   No one is stopping black people from writing books. And patting those who do on the head is patronizing and segregatory. When I read a book the author's skin color has nothing to do with how I feel about the book.  Not the point, and handwaving away actual issues that black authors have to deal with. From the article:  Nearly twenty years later, that prejudice abounds: Whitewashed covers, hostile dismissals of "identity politics" and "political correctness" as a barely-veiled attempt to silence us, all-white panels on diversity, all-white anthologies of "the best" science fiction, and continual institutional barriers to traditional publication based on appeals to marketability that really reflect the publishing houses' disbelief in the power and appeal of black storytelling.   There is a huge difference. With black writers, as in this article, the discussion is centered around the push for equality and fair treatment. If you singled out white science fiction writers and wrote an article, what would be the purpose besides a feeling of superiority?   amazingly, you can do both   shit, guess i am a trendsetter                     nice humblebrag post         Reading to babies is something you should definitely start now. It feels useless but pays off huge.   That said you have plenty of time to save up fifty bucks for harry potter    I don't know, I disagree and sort of agree with the author. There are degrees of failure, and I'll always prefer the interesting but flawed over the contemporary. I guess that's the point of the article though, I don't think either of us are wrong.                   Not being aware of what's going on in the world is nothing to be proud of.    Start reading   *A Cure for Suicide* by Jesse Ball   Yes, I'm pretty sure they were in high school   Yes. Sometimes I even do them at the same time      I can't wait to read it, just waiting on the library      *The Devil All the Time* by Donald Ray Pollock      what a rough life      First Law trilogy by Joe Abercrombie   Seconded, a great resource for keeping track of the series.         Doctor Sleep was pretty boring.             Not so much the ideas, but the impact. When I finished reading the book, my initial thoughts of the book were very lukewarm. An OK read, not sure it was worth the hype. Despite my initial reaction, I found myself fondly thinking of it often the next few weeks. Ended up rereading The Airborne toxic event chapters and enjoyed it a lot more the second time   Sam pink, Scott mcclanahan, Steve roggenbuck, juliet escoria, Chloe caldwell, Chelsea Martin, jesse ball, Tao Lin, Ellen Kennedy, michael seidlinger, Catherine Lacey, Amelia grey, Megan boyle, Alissa nutting...  Not sure exactly what you're looking for but something in there probably fits the bill   This is how it initially works, the reason they aren't the same throughout is because teams trade their picks   White Noise by Don Delillo. Took a while for it to sink in for whatever reason   Stick to children's books   While it's true, he does have some novels where he's clearly showing his King influence - *Sunburnt* and *The Sorrow King* for example   That one  is *Off Season*   Yes same guy   Lovecraft,  Laird Barron, Andersen Prunty, Brian Evenson, Jeremy Johnson, Jack Ketchum   Depends on the series. I did it with *Dune* and *Ender's Game* since I read beforehand you can easily stop at the first - they are both more or less self contained novels.   Unpopular opinion here, but I really hated this book. Found it vaguely interesting at first, but as the book progressed there are just a ton of infodumps, and I started getting very bored. I didn't find it funny at all either, just totally didn't mesh with my sort of humor. Also has one of the worst sex scenes ever written   Cool, that rarely happens and that made me smile.  I can see how he could come off as obnoxious, but stuff like directing As I Lay Dying and Child of God made me respect him, and I've seen him supporting lesser known works like *Scarecrone* by Melissa Broder and *Black Cloud* by Juliet Escoria on his social media. Plus I like his stoner movies :)     I'd argue that even though Franco is a shitty writer, he does a lot more to promote poetry and literature than to dissuade people from it. Franco is the man         5 star - *Eat Pray Love* by Elizabeth Gilbert   1 star - *The Easter Parade* by Richard Yates      Not sure about Freakonomics (I thought it was entertaining enough), but for Malcolm Gladwell, it's because he uses a lot of anecdotal evidence over actual research, and uses his writing to dress up what ends up being a lot of fluff                  They are nowhere near Dan Brown/Patterson level of that's what you're asking. Don't be afraid of the series' popularity and the backlash anything popular brings with it. The books are entertaining and intelligent page turners.Give them a try, you might end up really liking it                                    And yet this sub loves other, worse authors. Ender's Game is constantly recommended despite the author being a raging hatred filed homophobe. Wool is constantly recommended despite Hugh Howey being a huge scammer and fraud. They both fit the type of books reddit likes though so they're kosher, unlike fifty shades   This sub is funny. "Who cares what people read as long as they are reading" is practically the slogan here, but only if it applies to an acceptable YA series.   I have no interest in fifty shades but I don't waste my time worrying about how many people read/see it   It is incredibly popular    Who's the clown that brought star fox adventures    Final fantasy tsw is terrible         You're giving him the rub-ins. You can act like you're just being a nice guy, but you're just giving him a subtle "fuck you, i smashed you" even if you're unaware of it.   he's clearly a douche but you also instigated it bigtime   *The Third Bear*, a collection of Vandermeer's short stories, is criminally underrated, it's so good. Check it out         Reading to your kids is so important. There's really zero excuse not to do it. Start the day you bring them home from the hospital. Even something like *Goodnight Moon* or *Hop on Pop* teaches them so much - letter recognition, memorization, vocabulary, phrases, and more. Make sure you interact with them while reading too! Don't just drone on. Ask them questions, have them point things out to you, make it even more fun for them.     	132
 What do you mean "shitty on purpose"? Why?    totally worth it  What was the benefit of pre-ordering it? I've always seen it as a waste of time. It's not like not pre-ordering makes you not get the game.   You must get tired of saying that, lol.   Or maybe the kid was taught to be nice to people.   Looks to me like he does have a leg. Explain yourself, OP.   Yes. Yes we have.  This ending was part of the reason some people believed Reiko to be Shao Khan. This has since been dismissed as false.   So when BAE (whatever the fuck that's meant to mean, I'm assuming it's girlfriend) is home a random guy runs over two other random guys with a golf buggy?   Not me. I always make sure my character specialises in either destruction or archery, for this exact reason.  I thought everyone did that.   Is it just me, or is Uwe Boll known for making fucking terrible films? I mean really fucking bad movies.   Quite lucky. Also, awesome grandad for having a HDPVR.       Wow. You must have been rich. Now at could I afford to buy anything over 100 when I was in school.    He didn't get his finger bit off. His finger was bitten off.    These guys have been through some shit. Sorry they're not ugly bags of steroids as seems to be your preference.   What would you say is a good game?   Considering each character is 3.99 I was expecting at the very least 2 costumes per character. Very disappoint.    Is the guy who voiced that bad guy the same guy who voiced Fatman in Metal Gear Solid 2? Sounded like him at times.    Hackers can be funny sometimes. Take this fella for example. http://youtu.be/zWV5CcR2EY0   No I never mixed my substances. Maybe it did dilate the pupils as you say, but because I was doing pills around the same time period that made my pupils really dilate the coke dilation wasn't as noticeable.   Yeah. Either him or Freeman. I've never thought much of Gordon Freeman he has no character. All he does is kill things with guns (mostly) just like the rest do, except they've got character.  Well, I'm not sure if MC has any character. But at least MC wasn't partly responsible for the crisis he has to stop like Gordon was, lol.    Cocaine never caused my eyes to dilate back when I dabbled with it, ecstasy did though. Jesus Christ.   Left all that shit in the past.    Daedric armour is awesome looking and I'll not hear otherwise!  **places fingers in ears**  Lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalallal   I don't believe this. I've never seen a leaderboard in a mobile game that wasn't topped by blatant cheaters with impossible scores.    Then that kid needs glasses.    At the start of the game it's accurate, if you're not wearing iron armour and bulging with muscles.  At the end Of the game it's just fucking dumb. But then again every time a kid in skyrim opens their mouth it pisses me off. Little shits.    Maybe only humans can be an expendable. Yes I know chief isn't entirely human but whatever.    You'd rather see Marcus than who? I think Marcus is awesome too.    It sounds like he's taking issue with the fact that I mentioned I'd seen it before. Like I was saying it to get some sort of false sense of superiority or some shit.    Depends on how much he ingested and how strong it was.    I have no idea. I'm. Not involved in the project.    On consoles? Unlikely.    That's just like, your opinion man.    In fairness daedric armour looks awesome and badass.  Different opinions eh?   In real life yeah, but in the land of Tamriel seeing someone running at you wearing that is usually the last thing you do.   console.modless   That sounds awesome. Bethesda should implement that into console versions.   Skyrim is a fairly racist land. I doubt other races have kids there.   Doesn't work on console though does it?   If I was out in the wilds of skyrim and someone started running at me in daedric armour I'd be scared. My character wouldn't, but I would.    Then they're wrong. My high elf was bulging with muscles and powerful magical energies. He looks tough no matter what he's wearing.    Thanks. Glad I could make you smile.    It was either him or be ruled by the Scots. We chose the lesser of two evils.    Disregard my previous comment. I just realised the use of the word flaming could cause some confusion/jokes.    Just like the expendables.     It he died having the time of his life.    I know! I've always been sure that they wouldn't be such cocky little shits if they knew they weren't indestructible.    I just wanted to let him know that I have enjoyed that gif in the past, and now he allowed me to enjoy it again today.  And that makes me a weirdo?   Exactly.    Skyrim is always relevant.    Until Elsweyr comes out of course.    It's so you can't fuck up quests. They should give you an option to turn off mission specific NPC's invincibility.    I've never seen an edgy teenage look anything like someone wearing daedric armour. I'm glad I don't have your vision.    I wasn't swinging it around, I walked past her and she felt compelled to comment. Is swinging a flaming sword now associated with homosexuality? I have trouble keeping with kid's mentalities these days.    RIP Uncle Buck.   People still associate the word coloured with race? Seriously though my parents sometimes still say coloured when referring to black people. I always make a point to them about how old that makes them sound.   Not on console :(   Cool!   Leon?   Feel the rhyme!   Does it? What makes you say that? It's an edited version of the box art.   No worries mate.   I was 8 when it came out, I guess that may have coloured my opinion of the film forever.   Shhshshh!! Get out of here with your lies!  Seriously though I was pretty certain that although I made that up on the spot I wasn't the first person to say it. It sounded to good to be something I was the first to say.   "Ya mon."   You think Titanic is far better than Cool Runnings? Get out!   Differing opinions then. I don't care for war films, especially WW2 films.    I'm going to go to my parents house and see if I can dig up the old VHS and a player. My girlfriend is not going to be pleased on our next "date night".  That's cool but... why not just watch a digital version?   when my friend showed me how to kick with both feet at the same time in Duke Nukem 3D it blew my mind. One of the few memories I have of Duke.   I think you're simply reading too much into what is at the very least a bad joke.     they need the contrasting personality  I disagree. They just need to be able to kick an insane amount of ass and look great doing it. I think these guys qualify.   Truthfully?   No I don't want to kiss your egg!   Haven't seen that in a while. Thanks for the laugh.   Was Arnie expendable in Predator?  Was Stallone expendable in Rambo?  Was Statham expendable in Mean Machine?  It's not a post made to ahdere to the strict definition of the word expendable. It's merely a reference to the recent action films starring people who've seen a ton of action in their films, as these characters have seen a ton of action in their games. If you were to enter battle, I'm pretty sure you'd be happy to have these guys in there with you.   I guess they only included people known for being in good games. I know a couple of Duke game are good but he is kinda known for being in shitty games at this point. Forever was the final nail in the coffin.   Hard times make hard people.  Just made that up, copyright Alex Harper!   You've seen what before. The gif? My post? The comment I made? I'm assuming it's the comment I made since you quoted it. Are you upset that you've seen those words arranged in that order previously in your life?   Yeah man, it certainly wasn't a comedy.  Jk. I actually quite like that film.      Agreed.   I haven't seen it for many years.    but is actually quite loosely based on the true events  So like pretty much every other film that's based on true events.   Perhaps I should have included the word "truthfully" in the title.   I did, except nearly half of them are unkillable. I had to reload.   Enjoy ;)   No I don't want to kiss your lucky egg!   I work in the Thom Building.   I see a man who won't take no crap, from no-one!   Apology accepted. I only hope the rampant aggression and rudeness displayed in this comment doesn't become a regular thing.  Nobody needs that.   Love that gif. Always have. I imagine the two scenarios being incredibly similar.   Playing on console you can't kill kids :(  I tried of course, once. I had to reload when the only NPCs left in Whiterun were the invincible ones.   It's Cool Runnings.   Cool Runnings.                        For quick clips I'll use the share button on the PS4. For actual produced videos I'll use my Hauppauge HDPRV Gaming 2.   Mudcrabs, confirmed!   Hey, I'm a millennial (if by millenial you mean someone born between 10980 and 2000), and I had to remember my friend's phone numbers as a kid.  Edit: I meant "1980 and 2000". Not "10980 and 2000". Lol.   If that's the case then we can safely ignore it forever. I can't think of anything more useless than an endless countdown clock.   Didn't look like any sea I've seen.   It's called a househusband.   Not exist. It's pretty weird that she does that.   ...aaaaaand committed to memory.   Exactly. Fuck all the trolls saying "Fallout 4 looks last gen!"  Bitch, have you played Fallout 3 on PS3? Compare that to the Fallout 4 trailer and shut the hell up.   144p  Now there's a resolution I've not seen in a long time.   Because they like meat, but they don't want to be involved with the process of slaughtering them, down to the consumer level.   I'm not involved with the project so I don't know the details I'm afraid. It seems pretty quick to be real time, I assume it's sped up a little, but it might not be. This is just displayed on one of the monitors in reception.   And the textures set to "Almost existing, but not quite."   That was awesome.   This is cool. The fact I can tell who they're meant to represent without any real facial features is a testament to your skill.  But who's the blue guy? James with a bit of chin fluff?         They'd definitely tell if there was a prize   If you knew what the prize was you'd realise how dumb that sounds.   I don't know how well the characters in Mortal Kombat are balanced, they seem pretty balanced to me.  Putting in characters with one variation would surely mess all that up?   I was thinking maybe the 111 meant a November the 11th release date perhaps why not.    Not better people, just people that can do their job without resorting childish insults. I don't know, it just looks like something you'd find happening on a primary school playground.    )  Found it.   This is why I stay out of politics. They're all so childish. It's crazy to see how juvenile the people who run the country are in the house of commons.   Here you go, friend.  http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/388f2p/in_paypals_new_terms_of_service_effective_july_1/crtygac?context=3   Sorry! Fixed.    Then they can stop asking for it.    But the terms of the contract are that they can spam you, if you close your account you're ending the contract so it should void their ability to spam, right?   I'd be willing to bet that if you close your account and therefore end any contract between you and them they can't legally spam you.   Good job I made mine years ago then.   I'll use an xray at the end of a combo if I can.   I agree. With Tanya she has a fatality where she stomps through their midsection and creates a hole just like the one Scorpion's fireball fatality does. Then she stomps through their face and leaves a hole identical to the one Jacqui leaves when she punches through. When Jacqui does that you can see some embers on the inside of the enemy's head, presumably because she used some kind of shot to boost the attack (gunpowder scorches?).  But when Tanya stomps through their face you can also see embers/orange glowing. Just makes it feel a little lazy when you see so many repeated gore effects.    but I think everyone goes "How would that not kill you?!"  Yeah I hear that a lot. I have to remind them that 75% of ALL moves in MKX would probably kill you.   I prefer the current one he employs. It's the most cinematic one by far, the way they fly up the camera, the clouds, the crazy electrical discharge coming from Raiden, it's so badass.   And the second I start getting that shit form them I'm shutting my account down.   Good point well presented.   You'd think so. I imagine very specific lighting is required for the illusion to work.   How little we've actually advanced.   What makes you think it's anything like Bordrlands? Other than it being first person with guns of course.  I think it'll play a lot like Fallout 3. I like to look at it like this. Skyrim made improvements over Oblivion in almost every aspect but sill retained the essence (IMO), I think Fallout 4 will be to Fallout 3 what Skyrim was to Oblivion.   [This one](http://static2.uk.businessinsider.com/image/556df97edd089502528b45d2-800-600/illusion-2.jpg) is simple yet effective.  But [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORoTCBrCKIQ) remains a mind fuck to this day. Wow the human senses are so easily fooled.   The Catholic Church. They can do whatever the fuck they want, including facilitating child rape, and get away with it.   They just have no fucking concept of health and safety laws over there.   This is one remaster collection I'm willing to buy.  I bought the first game (just before the third one was released) and it was better than I thought. I initially thought it looked kind of shitty to be honest, like a poor man's Tomb Raider.  Never got around to playing the others, this would be good to have before the release of the 4th one, which I plan on buying.   I remember this happening a while back. People were saying she was drunk or high on her meds or something, and that the guy shouldn't be goading on. he's fishing for a reaction. Sure she's the crazy bitch, but he wasn't helping the situation.  I think everyone's favourite part was when she called him an atheist muslim.   As long as I can still somehow connect to the internet I'd show them my phone.  And I'd be burned at the stake.   [Straight 100 all day son!](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/52875bf0e4b0b40559bc2145/53bc4abfe4b044938a07ce7c/53bc50c4e4b0f56535625772/1404850381274/sloth-goonies-actor-8axq9xgd-e1392502295660.jpg)   Fine I'll say it!! Awwwwwwwww   I thought the default response to this image was "I ain't got no panties on!"   The ability to not be cuntish to one another.   I read the title as "Capybara Enjoying Butt Snakes in the Park".  I was expecting something... different.   I think the default respsone to these questions is to mix it in with bowls of muesli.   This advert was the first time I heard this song, and I like it. It just keeps elevating as it goes on.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZRp_9zGqHA   I figured you'd have known from the stereotype. It's a stereotype of British people, I'm English.   [BASTARD!](http://www.toplessrobot.com/ShatnerChoke.jpg)   "Let nobody stand in your way! Just..." **pushes closed fingers into the middle of the palm of the opposite hand, like reverse picking a pear** "...do it!"   When I clicked and read the text in the image it was like looking into my own mind from a third person perspective.  I... my...  **Critical hit. Head crippled**   There's a really fine line between bravery and stupidity. The only distinguishing factor between the two is success.   If you're terrified of death you should probably not be in the army lol. Seriously. It would be like being an arachnologist while have arachnophpbia.  I think you either need to come to terms with the notion of death or change career.   Tipping isn't weird, expecting a tip is weird. We understand that American employers like to (and are allowed to) pay their staff fuck-all under the premise that the tips will make their wage fair.  Over here our waiters/waitresses are paid properly so tips are literally nothing more than a bonus. For this reason most people (myself included) only tip when they feel they received service that went above and beyond merely taking my order and bringing me my food. if the waiter/waitress goes out of their way to make my dining experience as enjoyable as reasonably possible I'll leave a tip. Fuck up my order? Any chance of a tip goes out the window.  I should clarify, if I'm in America I'll tip because I understand that it's expected over there. On the flip side, Americans are always welcomed by waiting staff over here because their tipping habits make them seem extremely generous :)   We all have terrible teeth.  To be fair, I kind of support this stereotype. Due to years of eating too much junk food, drinking too many fizzy drinks, and smoking, my teeth aren't yellow, but they're far form bright white.  Also when I was much younger I nearly got braces but complained my way out of it. I wish I'd had braces, my teeth aren't all sorts of fucked up, but they could be more aligned.   Didn't you know? Outdoor Hoga is all the rage right now.   Acting seriously is relatively easier than being funny.   This was on the front page all day yesterday.  I checked out my paypal account (I hardly use it but it's good for the occasional online purchase). Luckily I never gave them my mobile number, for reasons just like this. This is why google and youtube will also never receive my phone number.  Edit: closed off that pesky parenthesis.    So... basically " Make your dreams come true! DO IT!!!"   Because it's 08:10am and I have a job.   I brushed my teeth this morning.  Entirely believable, but a lie nonetheless.   So the marketing worked on you. Money well spent.   Uh... I think you took a wrong turn at Albuquerque, we're not Imgur.   I'm on reddit daily and I can say today was the first time I've seen it. You should take the Stan Lee approach to reddit posts.  Every post is someone's first time seeing it.   I don't think it's unreasonable to get at least 1 alternate costume for characters you have to pay extra for. The fact that Goro, Jason, and Tanya only have one costume each has disappointed me.   I think you may be right lol.    To all the people saying it looks last gen. Go play fallout 3 on a console and then realise how foolish those words are.    So... there's a vault dweller... and he has a dog.  Could this be a true sequel? Playing as your character from last gen with dog meat in tow? Probably not, but the end of the trailer was too similar to the end of Fallout 3 to be coincidence right?  RIGHT?   All I can see is the please stand by message.    a play through with no commentary on youtube.  I actually made that for the main game a couple of years back. Yeah, I guess the story is the main draw, might as well watch it.   Depends on how much weight you want to lose, how quickly your body produces sperm, and how often you can offload it.  So 39.   Oh shit, I don't think  ican top this.  Pack it up guys, /u/ButtwadsMcGee94 just won.   If you were replying to someone called Vulpes Inculta I'm pretty sure they'd be just as excited as you for this news.   But Ronald McDonald killing something with a shotgun, so it balances out.   Women are required to wear a hijab, men are not. What's that if not sexist?   Long story short I have 8 in my PSN wallet and Left Behind is 7.99. I loved playing The Last Of Us on PS3 once, tried a second playthrough but didn't really feel it. How does Left Behind stack up against the full game?  Is it horse armour or The Ballad of Gay Tony?   Saw it yesterday on reddit.   This is as bad as my friend when he said the reason sunsets are orange is BECAUSE THE SUN LITERALLY GOES ORANGE AS IT SETS.  It was incredibly easy to explain to him that this cannot be the case, and then gave him the real explanation.   When I dabbled with reptile I just used L1 instead of pressing 1+3. Worked every time.   So I was right to say yes?   Not the most American thing I've seen, but it's too awesome to not post here. And I'm English.  http://i.imgur.com/6WDf03g.jpg?1   Unfortunately the real reason she wears it is probably more sinister i.e. Sexism  Edit: disregard, it was a stupid thing to say.    Sub-Zero: Started with Unbreakable (love that ice mask) but soon realised Grand Master is simply a better Unbreakable. So I ues Grand master, because that's the one  perform the best with.  Takeda: Shirai Ryu. Because that's the one  perform the best with.  Jacqui Briggs: Full-auto. Because that's the one  perform the best with.  Goro: Shokan Warrior. Because that's the one  perform the best with.  Tanya: Kobu Justsu. Beca... you get the idea.   You said exactly what I was about to say. Thanks for saving me the time.   Nope. My atheism is the result of simply not being convinced that a god exists.   I feel it applies everywhere, lol.   You sound like you know more about this subject than I do, so I'm just going to say yes.   I understand there's an audience that loves screaming in videos, but it gives me insta-rage sometimes. It's like "THE LOUDER I BE THE FUNNIER I IS!"   My head is crippled.   Got to throw those pesky file diggers off the trail somehow!   Fallout was never Skyrim with guns, it was Oblivion with guns. At this stage I wouldn't even want Skyrim with guns. Skyrim is my favourite game but man does it fucking look old now.  On newer, more powerful consoles we should get a game built from the ground up, not just some high res PS3 game.    I'm going to admit that it could potentially work if done right. But I'd rather have co-op.  I think this is what every Elder Scrolls/Fallout fan wants.   Are there planets in the sky in Skyrim? I thought it was just the moons, Masser and Secunda.    Eventually, someone made it through.  Master of exposition right here.   I said it 3 years ago and I'll say it now. I think TESVI will be in Elsweyr. We've had games set in the land of men and elves, but I don't think we've had one in a beastfolk land. Plus Elsweyr is mentioned in Skyrim in much more detail than any other province.  	198

 Probably because they were told to by their parents, or the insurance company told them that they can get a discount if they do.   I haven't driven distracted since I was 19, and drove my car into a 12 foot deep ditch because I was trying to read my mail while driving down the road.  My car was undamaged, but a 2 ton truck Avista had to pull me out.  Good thing I knew Gravy or that would have been a hell of a tow bill.  I don't text and drive, or use my phone and drive.  The most I'll "read" while driving down the road is printed off instructions on how to get where I'm going.  And I do that at red lights.  (what's going to happen there?  They'll honk at me to tell me the light's green now?)                              I grew up, and I don't want a speeding ticket, excessive display of horsepower, racing, and reckless driving charges.  Also, speed kills.  Want to race?  Go to the track.   Don't forget Fahrenheit 451.   One Second After really highlighted how dependent we are on electrical services for modern society, and just how fragile it is.  A History of God showed how all religion is a sham, and how I've been lied to all of my life. about it.         For the same reason I don't believe in underpants gnomes, god, or leprechauns.            Pullman is a pretty safe city.  Break-ins and HIR's are very rare here.  I accidently left my keys in the ignition, and all 4 windows down in my truck yesterday at Sunnyside park, and my truck was still there exactly how I left it when I returned 5 hours later.   A religiidiot would say something on the order o*f "They haven't reached the age of accountability yet, so they get a free pass"*, or something like *"But it's a metaphor, as we're all God's children!"*   So an archaic of "to".  That's almost as bad; Jesus wants to watch kids jack off.   Jesus was a paedophile into bukakke, and he promised that kids who ejaculate upon him eternal life in the kingdom of god.  " But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not, to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven."  --Matthew 19:14 (KJV)            Well, I wasn't really allowwed to as a youth, so when I became an adult, I just got used to being alone.  I only really go 3 places.  the store, work, and home.  If I'm not at one place, I'm likely at home.  Also 32 years old is too old to start to get into the social scene, (especially when I really have no interest in meatspace interaction)  Another thing, I've never been searched for drugs.  Besides MJ is legal here in WA.   how the hell can you tell that by internet?  Yeah, it's plainly obvious when I go to the park and can do a duck call well enough to get ducks over to my area without even a duck call just using my mouth, or when I bark back at dogs, and get into a barking competition with them, and I greet random cats on the street by trilling at them and slowly blinking at them, but how the hell can you tell that by text?  And I doubt 20% of any group is corrupt.  Unless you're in Mexico, that is.  Or basically ALL of the national media in the USA, (and most local sources).         Funny gross shit like Jackass 1 and 2, not disgusting for the sake of being disgusting. a dude taking a shit in a toilet store is gross and funny.  Drinking a whole bottle of Syrup of ipecac and puking to the screen is just disgusting.   LOL @ that.  They already are. :D They are a NFA Destructive Device. :)  But probably.  The media doesn't know shit from shinola about weaponry and the laws governing it.  Hell, they call a 10/22 with an extended magazine an "assault weapon with a banana clip".   No shit, but how would the news media react?  How would the american population react if somebody pulled up to them, and fired light artillery at the WBC and drove off?   I didn't they said "less than $10".  Purchased?  lighters.  I can't live wthout fire.  I always have one on me (or 4).   Jackass 3D.  It was so bad, that even though I pirated it, it wasn't worth my time.  I lasted 45 minutes, turned it off, and deleted it from my HDD.  I'm never watching it again.  It wasn't funny, it was just disgusting.   Air.  Price $0  Value:  Priceless.   Because "being who I am" really has succeeded so far in getting me dates, right?  It's not like I'm going to make strange sex jokes in public places, say "hey watch this", and deep throat a foot long hotdog just to freak people out, and randomly blurb out "Kitty hat, kitty hat, Kitty hat hat!" in public.  The men in the white coats would come, and haul me off to the looney bin.   Changing out an alternator in the dark sucks along with new wires because they fried, and a new battery because you drained it dead, and are now driving home with parking lights for 30 miles SUCKS ASS!   If that was considered a felony, I would get the chair.  Yes, I'm guilty of that.   Done. :)  Thanks for the unofficial warning. :)   With what?  My "environmental hazard" known as my truck.  I already know I need a new radiator, and coolant hoses, and a new front bumper, and a new WWF resivoir.  Yes, I drive a rolling superfund site.  (I got into a collisoin in 2011, and I've been driving it).   ..... Give them a gay parade...... :)   OK, what if the lady offered a BJ or whatever, and the dude said, "What are you, some kind of pervert?  I just want a date with a movie and dinner, pretend to enjoy my company is all I ask, not a blowjob or a handjob.  Does this look like the plot of FMJ?!  $150/hr lady.  Take it or leave it!"  **edit:**  For that much money, I would pretend to be gay, but the most "sexual contact" that would ever ever happen is holding hands, and even then I'm wearing sun glasses so I can't easily be IDed as a "queer"  (word spreads fast around town, and I don't want to be known as a "queer".  Oh god, dudes hitting on me, no thanks shudders.  There's a VERY significant difference between tolerance, (I tolerate whining kids on the aeroplane); acceptance, ( I accept the fact that global climate change may be influenced by mankind), and celebration, I celebrate the 4th of july with explosives that are legal only only 3 days out of the year).  I accept homosexuals, (just like you and me), but am I going to ever applaud butt-fucking as the superbowl sunday show [if it ever happened], NO!  I don't care if it was a dude-dude, chick-dude, or chick-chick.  I'd rather watch a literal monkey fucking a football than that, (and I would still change the channel)   OK, I'm starting to think that these escort services like I treat "designer drugs".  Yeah, they're legal, but can fuck your life up?  I won't touch "designer drugs" with a 12 foot pole, (and I have one), because I had to sit through my neighbor pounding on my door at 0200 because he thought he was going to die.  That was enough to scare me off of that idea.  Fuck "designer drugs".  He refused the ambulance several times even though he was scared shitless.  I went to sleep before he did, but when I woke up the next "day", (all of 1.5 hrs later)  I rolled him over with my foot and said "hey, still alive?"  He grumbled and asked "where am I?"  I told him the address and said "you're alive.  Go home.  Whatever you did, don't do it again"    You can stay here until 1200, then I expect you to make the journey back home of all of 20 feet"  He said "20 feet?"  can you help me to my couch?  I said "not a problem.  Where's your keys?"  He said  "I have keys?"  I said, "Umm let me check your house".  it was unlocked, so I just opened up the door as wide as it would go, and went and got him.  I lied and told him, "you left them in the lock, your house is open, I'll take you home."  He agreed, so I plopped him on his couch, locked the door behind me, and went to work. Dumbass high guy from Lithuania.  I should have called an ambulance.  Still, he refused medical treatment, so from my understanding there's nothing I can do.  I must have asked him 15 or 16 times if he wanted to go to the hospital.  He kept on refusing treatment, so from what I remembered from first aid training, I couldn't do anything until he went unconscious, (but I did first because of being tired).  **TL;DR;**  Fuck designer drugs.  I had one scare with that shit, that's enough for me..   "no mommy, I'll be good girl and lay on the bed with daddy!"      Rich dudes that are lonely, and people on craigslist?            So, I guess it takes a ELI:Sociologist, not ELI5?  Can't say for the cat, but for the dog, I think you got it.   OK, what led person A to be like a dog with his former HS bully, and even a look could send person A cowering and curling up in the corner of the bus seat because she had a beef that wasn't with him because she might see him? And if she happened to sit next to him, he was shaking uncontrollably and try to make himself as small as possible, (fuc getting hit, she hits hard), (almost deathly afraid of a chick none the less), but other cats she tried that with fought back, even though it was futile?   Only after I get it from a choice of prime cuts at the local cannibal shop. :D   OK, among the beaten, why are some people like a dog being punished, (lowered head and make it obvious that they're sorry, trying not go get hit again), but others are like a scared cat, (they know they can't win, but they call names and such, and threaten to fight even though the older and bigger cat can obviously win)?  Is it just because they go with they know what works and will give them the least harm?     There is danger in either circumstance.  It's either "Hit me as much as you want, just please don't kill me" or "fine, kill me.  Just end it".   * The Day After (1983)  * Threads (1984)  * When The Wind Blows (1986)  **DO NOT SHOW KIDS THESE MOVIES!!**         I don't mean the fireworks.   Sweet!  If I ever be rich, I'm hiring one.   Hey, maybe if I hire the same chick enough, she might begin to like me, and will date without pay?  THat would be awesome.  Like jumping off of Granite point, or going fishing, or camping for a night (in separate tents), or shooting, or eating lunch down by the river.  Hell if I know.   "Can you smile like a donut?"  "Yes"  "Show me"  guy does it  "You're hired!"   god damn it.  I aint rich, so I guess I'll piss that idea off.   Where does one find them?   I've tried.  It didn't work.  Now I just go to the bar once or twice a year because I miss people to argue football with, not for chicks.  I gave that up in 2004, (the year I turned 21).  I'm too old to hit on chicks at a bar.  City-data.com backs me up.  Look up Pullman WA.   I honestly don't know how.  I've tried bars, I've tried work, I've tried old FB friends that I used to know 20 years ago.  Got shot down at every one of them.  I know of "why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free", but I can't seem to find any cattle around here, and this steer, (i've had a vasectomy, so keeping with the analogy), still misses the company of a cow.  (and I don't mean fat chicks either).   My dad cut me off in 1999 because I was using too much of his internet time and hogging the phone line, so I ran my own line, and blueboxed an open frequency, and slam dialed every ISP in the Union to get a connection, and started dialing.  I eventually got through to an ISP in Topeka, KS, and I was caught in 2 hours because I only wanted free internet access without tying up my dads phone line.  (I stopped blue boxing, but I kept the phone line).   Everything about what I did was completely illegal, but I was  16 at the time, (I think that's the only reason they let it go, and I convinced them that I had no clue what was going on.)  My dad knew exactly what was going on.  He opened up the camper and said "XXXXXX, you need to take this call NOW.  It's the FBI!"  I knew exactly why I was getting the call.  Not doing that again.  (OK, I was cracking, not hacking).  But I didn't do it for commercial purposes, just "I want free internet".  (defrauding a public utility).  Yes, I kept the phone line, and now my home ranch has 2 lines. :) )   Sweet. :)  Now to get rich enough to actually do it.  Doing it the old fashioned way doesn't seem to work.  ( I mean actually getting them interested in you, not handjobs).  I tried to get somebody on a date from my FB contacts that I haven't seen for over 20 years, and I think I got shot down).  She's a good internet friend, and lives less than 2 miles away from me, but I just want to go have a picnic in the park, (and I don't mean oral sex), not bang her, and still I get shot down).   I doubt it, other than my DUI, the most "criminal" charges, I've ever had is a sheriff rolled up on me laying on the ground looking up at the moon.  He just told me to go home, and I can't lay down in public in parking lots, the street, or sidewalks..  (and he thought I was odd because I was looking at the moon in binoculars.  I think he thought I was a peeping tom or something.)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_9TShlMkQnc  That's country.   I've never picked up a whore, and I don't intend to, the most I've thrown "caution to the wind", is seeing cleavage and a camel toe, and while driving almost lose control because I was "busy gawking at the chick in lingerie on the street".  it made me look twice.    Yes, I got stopped because they wondered why I was swerving.  They asked why I wasn't looking at the road, and I said "because an almost naked lady".  They just told me "In the future, watch where you're actually going, and don't oogle women.  You're free to go."   What's so hard to understand?  He broke down, and was trying to flag somebody down to take him to a petrol station, and I happened to walk out my door at the time, and saw he neded help, so I approached, and it turns out he ran out of gas.  I towed him back to work with my Blazer.  We've been hanging out at each other's houses and watching TV together, and we drink each other's beer. :)  He wants to take me fishing this summer, (if I tow, he doesn't have a hitch), and he's willing to pay for the gas to get to the river.  I got a job contact through him too. :)   Yeah, I guess what I'm asking is are escorts legal, (so long as no sex acts are even considered, they just want a "girlfriend" for the night, and nothing more.)  Somebody to pretend they like the dude, and go see a movie and dinner afterwards, then drop them off back at home, (or wherever).   Ah, that explains it, (I think), so if some dude just wanted a "date" without sexual contact, and was willing to pay for the time, they would tell the "john" to get lost?   Oh, I think Argentina is in the ATL TZ. :)  Would the undercover go for it, or shoot him down, (metaphorically)? Im in PST, (but we still use DST).  So, you're 4 hours ahead of me. :)   Good point, in GMT, it's 0258.  You must be in Sydney or Brisbane.   Umm, I just want somebody else with the dude that I made friends with because I towed him back to work in the Avista truck because he broke down, (out of gas), and I've been over to his house several times, and he's came here several times.  I'm obviously not gay, I just want somebody to hang out with at home.  I sort of am since my wife and SIL left me.  I like having a clean house though. :)   Would a regular whore do it?  (after all, they just want money; and they don't care if the dude paid them $150/hr to watch TV, or give them a BJ).  (No, I'm not going to pick up a whore to watch TV with me, [or do anything else, I kind of like not being HIV positive); I have a dude friend I can do that with).   Myself?  What type of question is this?   Yes, it did.   Uhh, the last time I tried that, I got a call from some local ISP and ATT because I was getting free internet access out of Tepoka, Kansas.  They told me to check my phone lines.  I'm not doing that again. O.o  That was embarrassing to get called in from the camper to the house from my dad. O.o  They almost made it a federal investigation.  I've stopped doing that.   No.   Don't want to.  Social interaction IRL is draining.   Maybe 1 or 2 friends, (and I made one the other day), but beyond that, nope.  I don't like going out.  "hanging out" without purpose is a waste of time.   How so?  Yes, you can trip out to classical music, (on salvia), but not on bluegrass.   Classic rock is the best, IMHO, but I have nothing against most genres of music, (except pop teeny bopper shit).   Around here, my best chances for a decent paying job are working the family ranch, and working harvest when it comes up.  Short of that, it's PRH, WSU, or SEL.  Other than that, everybody pays minimum wage.  (yay pullman...)   Would the undercover go for it, or shoot him down, (metaphorically)?  $150/hr of pay to pretend to enjoy an evening isn't a crime. (at least as far as I know).    Would the undercover go for it, or shoot him down, (metaphorically)?  **EDIT:**  Shit, I meant an evening, not one hour.  That wouldn't even be enough time for dinner.   Breakfast at 1914hrs?  Do you work a night shift?   I've only been to one party in my life, and I didn't have fun.   My 3 bdrm 2 bath house with 2 designated parking spots is a basement now?  What's the main level?  That $650000 house across town?   I have no interest in gaming, and there's no LUG around here for adults.   Temporarily, nope.  I do work back home on the family ranch for money, and it's the best money I've eber made at $11.77/hr.  I wish I could get hired full time, I'd make about 1975/mo, and I would be living with no problems.   Pretty much! :D   I agree with the fans, most are a bunch of rhinestone cowboys, (or all hat and not cattle), but the music itself is decent.  And it's not like country has a monopoly on monotonous themes.    Ever heard a rap song?  It's about how much life in the ghetto sucks, (to get down to it), pimps, drugs, "hoes", or shooting cops, or other black people, and the N-word is used a lot, or shooting up who knows what.    Rock is "drugs, sex, and rock and roll"  Classic Music is mostly about God and Nature, and war stories.  Country is about pickup trucks, God, TV, 9/11, America Is Best, Hard Working men, Urbanization, etc.  Death metal is about being pissed off.  Classic rock (like pink floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon, or "The Wall"), is mostly a life story, but also drugs, sex, and rock and roll.  Blues is how much life sucks, regardless of where you are from  Bluegrass?  I haven't figured out that one yet.  Pop music?  I love a dude, and he doesn't love me back.  I just want to dance, etc.      Being a bully up until the 7th grade, calming down for 2 years, then having the tables reversed on my by the females in my class.  Yes, I deserved it, but I wish I wouldn't have done it in the first place.   Harnessing the power of fire. [ Humans wouldn't be humans](http://www.livescience.com/2764-cooking-cognition-humans-smart.html), and ALL of civilization would have been impossible without fire.   Picking my nose and eating it.   Nope 5'8", and 135 lbs.   I'm in Pullman WA.   All of the above.  Also beta testing new software, and learning about Linux, and trying out different DE's, and getting more proficient with the CLI, and fixing driver issues.  I don't run Debian Sid for no reason.  I like the challenge of keeping it running. :)   With what money?   Another hot pocket.   My computer is my hobby, and watching TV.  Basically, how I've always lived life.   Basically.   Gently fellate himself in front of a mirror while softly weeping, and tenderly fingering his bumhole.   That just by traveling 300KM, you can find yourself in a new country with entirely separate languages and food.  And the Autobahn. :)  I want to drive that someday. :)   That guy who nobody knows, because he hasn't bothered making any friends since 2002.

Invite 5 friends over, and have a game of limp biscuit in your kitchen, then use alaskan pipelines on each other, and give each other blumpkins.   Watch TV and sit around in your underwear.   The Cuban missile crisis goes hot.   Why?   Shit, meant to post it to somebody else.   "Is the sun a planet, or a star?"   Mogadishu disagrees.   Have a place to stay, and a job lined up.   Xerox the $10 bill 100 times.   Shit paper.   Landline phones are cheap. Just buy a new one for $15.   Doing hand stands.   The Alaskan dog sled race   Good point!   I don't think they do think it out, just pulling something out of my ass, but if I wanted to kill EMS workers, I'd report a false fire, (or start one in a skip), report it, and have trip wires on pipe bombs, and shoot mortars (the fireworks ones) at them.  That would actually cause a fire, and severely maim (or kill) whoever tripped the wire.  No, I have no intention of doing that.  I don't have a beef with anybody.  So burning your own house down and sitting there with an AK makes no sense at all.   That's fucked up.  O.o  They don't think this shit out, do they?   That's fucked up.  People wire their house to blow up?  What the hell?  And what the fuck is wrong with the dude that stayed in his house after it got torched.  Fire = get the hell out.  I don't care whether it's the cops, or the neighbor pounding on my door in that circumstance.  I'll go investigate, then get the fuck out.  I was in a house fire in 2001, and ran outside with no pants on to see how bad it was.  Wasn't too bad, so I went back inside and put pants on.  By the time I got out again (maybe 30 seconds), the entire upstairs was engulfed.   OK, that explains doors that are solid, but why for doors that have a viewing window?  Couldn't the person just look out and fire in that direction? (like the house that got the door knocked on)?   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_citizen_movement#Theories  Legislated to give the freed black slaves after the Civil War rights comparable to the unalienable constitutional rights of white state citizens. The benefits of U.S. citizenship are received by consent in exchange for freedom. State citizens consequently take steps to revoke and rescind their U.S. citizenship and reassert their de jure common-law state Feucitizen status. This involves removing one's self from federal jurisdiction and relinquishing any evidence of consent to U.S. citizenship, such as a Social Security number, driver's license, car registration, use of ZIP codes, marriage license, voter registration, and birth certificate. Also included is refusal to pay state and federal income taxes because citizens not under U.S. jurisdiction are not required to pay them. Only residents (resident aliens) of the states, not its citizens, are income-taxable, state citizens argue. And as a state citizen land owner, one can bring forward the original land patent and file it with the county for absolute or allodial property rights. Such allodial ownership is held "without recognizing any superior to whom any duty is due on account thereof" (Black's Law Dictionary). Superiors include those who levy property taxes or who hold mortgages or liens against the property.[14]  Yep, it sounds like they think they are their own nation state.  That's fucked up man.   Wouldn't the door actually be better?  After all, I can punch through the wall, (if it's sheetrock), but there's no way in hell I could punch through a metal door.   WTF is a sovereign citizen?  People think they are their own nation-states?   I was having a beer in my front lawn looking around to "see what I can see", and I saw an officer go up to a neighbor's house, and stand to the side of the door and knock, and then wait.  Why?   Most shootings occur with gang-on-gang violence, and they're not supposed to have them in the first place.  It's already illegal to either supply felons with weapons, be a felon in a possession of a weapon, or do straw man purchases, or modify firearms to be automatic, or to alter the serial number, or import without a VERY thorough investigation, or a whole lot of other shit. (See 18 USC Section 922 for further details.  Yes, subsection (r), is pumb fucking stupid, but the law is the law.)   No, people shouldn't be forced to carry a weapon if they don't want to, (or don't know how to use it, then they shouldn't).  I'm just saying that "GUN FREE" = "Victim disarmament".  Gun control only disarms the people who are willing to stay within the law, not the criminal element.  When is the last time you heard of somebody holding a gun to somebody's head with the express intent of killing them, only to say "wait, murder is illegal, I better not do it or I'll go to prison"?  Never.  But if people had a chance to shoot back, these mass murders wouldn't happen.  I agree with you completely on the lack of professional journalism in the USA.  That's why I watch BBC, and listen to France24.  The only time I even am exposed to American "Journalism" is in my truck, and I keep it tuned to KQQQ and KQZB.   Yes, and he got a $6.1M "reward" in civil court for it.  IMHO, Janet Reno should be locked up in ADX Florence for the crimes she allowed to perpetuate under her leadership.  Also, The government has this thing called "sovereign immunity".  You can't criminally prosecute the government, {or even sue them}, (except under extreme situations).   I think it's Putin.  He wants to reestablish the USSR, and the dude is on a power trip wanting to destroy the world.   Who said anything about race?  If I hire somebody to go kill person XXX, that's organized crime, but if I just go shoot up a house because I suspect person XXX might be there, (or I want to intimidate his family, [or his neighbors, etc]), then I would be a thug.   Ruby Ridge.  They shot his pregnant wife, and even killed his dog.   Kazakhstan?    You're right and wrong.  I have no clue about military history with bands, (why I'm asking), but do want to learn why using such tactics that could get your ass blown to hell and back were employed at all, (why I'm asking).   Every state in the union "right to carry", and "shall-issue".  Just think, what if in that church, What if one person was armed and could shoot back?  For the sake of argument, let's say he's not combat trained, and hits 2 or 3 people firing blindly in the dark before stopping the intruder?  How many people would have been saved? 23. (discounting the assailant).   Given the choice of being governed by the baboons in WDC, or the local mafia, I choose the mafia.  Protection money is cheaper than taxes.  If the government burns your house down because you won't pay, it's "tax collection".  If the mafia does, it's arson.  The government is lauded, the mafia is despised.   The government is legal.   I guess they didn't get much mail then.  I wouldn't bother either.  I do like Maxim magazine while on the john though, so I'd go in once a month at least.   You mean like the government?  What's the difference between the mafia and the government?  The government is legal.   90   holy shit!  Did they have an entire mail bag waiting for them? O.o   OK, hopefully we never get nuked so I don't have to use it.  That would really suck.   That explains how it works!  Thanks!  But how do they know if they got mail or not?  Do they have to ride into town once a week or something?   Nah, thugs shoot up anybody they can.  The mafia only targets men that have a beef with them.  They're a racketeering organization, and a criminal influence, not a thug.   The only reason I know about it is from NWSS.  If your nation gets nuked, the mail won't operate like it has since the mid 1800's.  You have to collect your mail at the post office, and stand in a queue to get it.  But how do you know if you even got mail that day, and you didn't walk to the post office for no reason? (or hitch up your horse and ride into town for no reason)?    Format:       Joe Blow      GENERAL DELIVERY      Pullman WA USA      99163-9999  Think of General Delivery like "station to station" calls.  I'm dating myself, aren't I?   The mafia aren't thugs, they're organized crime, and prosecutable under RICO statutes.  I wouln't classify the Hells Angels as anything, because if you don't fuck with them, they won't fuck with you.  The most you'll see of them is them driving motorbikes on the way to wherever the hell they're going, and lie to your wife "I guess there's a harley convention in town, and keep on driving, (knowing exactly why there are so many motorbikes on the road).   Trumpet and drums.  That kind of gives your position away, eh?         I don't think you understand:  http://pe.usps.gov/text/pub28/28c2_033.htm  How do you know you got mail?   ???    No, like if I send a letter to:  Joe Blow  Pullman WA  99163-9999  How do you know you got mail? Do you have to go to the post office every day?   "A single tear rolled down his cheek, and that is when he realized he loved Big Brother"  Because he was doing so well, but room 101 got to him. Smith now supports Big Brother. We have always been at war with Eastasia...   Thinking about that mule eating on a literal pile of shit, and my dad's reaction to seeing it driving down the road. He almost vomited in the truck, and I had to steer because he was busy puking out the window. :D      Actually, yes. I'm playing off of Jesus/Hey-Zeus. :)   Do the triple S. I didn't see anything.   Mormon knocks at the door of somebody harboring an illegal alien.  Mormon asks the landholder: "Have you found Jesus?"  Landholder says: "Do you have a warrant?"   OK, I know it's hollywood, but why in the movies, is there a drum roll right before firing off the cannon?  I could see that working **ONCE** as a signal, but then the enemy will figure out what it means, and just shoot at the drummers.  (no music, no commands).   No, "Limies" refer to the UK soldiers.  And yes, limes are an excellent solution to Scurvy, (high in acidity, so don't need to keep chilled, and they don't rot for a long time if kept in the bellows of the ship where it's reasonably cool enough like a cellar).   Because "find title" didn't work, and it's still basically the same title.               Just nab it in the first year. After that, you can use it until the sun blows up if you want to.    **EDIT:**  (Please don't use it for the next 5 billion years).   Fuck shooting my 590 indoors, I've already experienced that when I was 8 when my dad had an ND.  I thought he offed himself and ran to his bedroom crying because I thought he killed himself with a 7MM magnum).  But why music instead of the sergeant with a bullhorn?   No shit it didn't exist, but why a band instead of a bullhorn with the sergeant?  Bullhorns have existed since forever.  It's called a large funnel with the end chopped off.  Or cup your hands around your mouth and yell.  **EDIT:**  FFS, I could use a traffic cone as a bullhorn if I really wanted to.   I think I prefer radios. and APCs, and air support.  Fuck the band.  **EDIT** Wait, is that why watching old movies about the civil war or the war of independence, the music changes when actively engaged in combat?   We still do here in Pullman.  We play the Marine corps, the air force, and the army hymns.  This is basically our play list in Pullman:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trZlvpLihHk  I'm just glad that that song "put a boot in your ass" finally died.  It's broadcast live on KHTR. :)     Yes, they do make noise no matter how much they are trying to be quiet.  So I guess thank god for automobiles, hovercraft, the SEALS, and air support with helo lift?   Before the 1700's?  America was too busy being a British colony.   *cough* different frequencies between a 10M radio and a walkie-talkie *cough*   That explains it! :)  Thanks. :)      So they used music like I use a radio?  I think I'll stick with the radio, thanks.   America:  We invented "guerrilla warfare"  While you dumbass limies were lined up making an easy target for us, we had trees. :)  Shoot and move. :)            *cough* Windows ME *cough*   Why do you target NA?  And have you **really** met anybody in NA that hasn't heard of Jesus?  Where did you find them?  Living in a tree?     I'm a dude.   Where your driver's license says you're from, and if an immigrant, where you are authorized to stay on a permanent basis.   I actually can, and no, I don't (much).  Also, /r/autofellatio   I think Ill remain a lone wolf watching CNN having should be in bed about 8 hours ago.  	200
 how many minuets?   Im 16 but I think I start watching around 12 or 13.   She her manager or rather manager for FPS Russia and she just lives with him. She's more of a friend really.   Did the same thing except I said "Attention Walmart shoppers. All items will be 90% percent off for the next 10 minutes. Thank you." And I watched the store turn from a place where civilians buy goods to a trackmeet of sorts in which people rushed through every isle half-jogging, grabbing what they could and sprinting to the cash register as the workers looked at each other in complete confusion. Some middle-aged man had watched me walk up, and me not wearing the typical walmart get-up...ya know the blue shirt with the khakis, and when I had finished my 'announcement' he looked me dead in the eyes while shaking his head and said "Some people just want to watch the world burn." And then he just walked away.   Margot Robbie   Mad Max. I don't want to watch 2 hours of nonsense with no story and if I wanted that then I'd go watch Transformers.   Fake it 'til you make it. Been my life motto.   Producing Music (Mainly hiphop and rnb instrumentals)   Every rendition of Mystique has been very unattractive IMHO. Margot Robbie would be good in the role but I like her as Harley Quinn more.    Filled the parking lot with sand and had a beach party...in the parking lot.   Jay-Z. http://imgur.com/Vzoxr5G   Metta-World Peace   That I am a terrorist because I am indian and indians look muslim while obviously inferring that all muslim are terrorists. Nothing in this world is infinite except for human stupidity.   The Last Airbender. Did you see those CGI effects and that terrible plot. That shit was atrocious.   Ric Flair by Tory Lanez. I get hyped up.    Tootiesee Rolls. The brown little turds. Hate when that shit makes its way in to my basket on Halloween.   Having to to take the piss of a thousand gods when there is still 45 mintues left of a movie when you're at the theaters. (I was watching Ant-Man. Great Movie!)   12 year olds with iphone 6's when I damn near 17 with an ipod touch   Luckily, Denzel was there.   1984 and Lord of the Flies   No, no he IS talking about ballet.   Where you raised on a farm...cause you sure know how to raise this cock.   Simple...when you can fart openly in front of them.   Shawshank redemption, all terminators,all of the Lord of the Rings, shrek, harry potter, toy story, The Godfather, Schindler's List, Rambo, Rocky, Citizen Kane, inception, Titanic, Forrest Gump, ET, Silence of the lambs, Gladiator, Saving Private Ryan, Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, All indiana jones, Jaws, braveheart, Goodfellas, rain man, Good Will Hunting, etc. I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OF THESE BECAUSE NETFLIX'S SELECTION IS SHIT.  TL;DR: Never watched any classic/mainstream movie you can fathom that came out before before 2013.   Any classic movie because blockbuster is gone ;(    The Million Dollar Arm.   You might die before the two-weeks are up.   OoOok Charles   Kevin Hart's stand-up isn't that funny. Movies are funny af, but his stand up relies on yelling profusely and making funny faces. Didn't laugh once while watching a whole special.   I don't think she's hot.   I hated Mad Max: Fury Road.   I'm not a freak but how large of a volume is your load? Can we get a measurement in mili-liters.   Wyoming is irrelavent.   Scarystories to tell in the Dark.   How the universe could have been created. Whether it was God or the Big Bang (which I heard was disproven but idk) since you have to keep asking yourself how that God or the particle even came into existence and it just becomes a vicious loop.   The Dark Knight.  	36
 How do you feel about the current shit storm happening on /r/all?   The saxophone dear god, my girlfriend said she used to play saxophone and I made it very clear the benefits she'd receive if she played this for me. She still hasn't learned it so I guess my benefits aren't all that great.... Wait a minute.   LOLWUT         Blatt, slippin the ref $100   I was thinkin about taking it that route, but I didn't. I've wanted to shake Locke so many times during that show.   Rattle that lock. Not to be confused with Rattle that Locke (a goofy miniseries where the main character, John Locke, can't help but get in hilarious philosophical conundrums). I made that up, don't hurt me.   Roger has been waiting to release his album after David, waiting for the perfect opportunity to be slick   Yep I love the same things about it. Sober too.   Really? I've never heard anything off TFC, and of all songs why that one? TFC isn't very radio friendly, but theres a couple I'd pick before that haha   Oh geez, absolutely this. Impossible to listen to a Spotify/Pandora Pink Floyd radio station for this reason.   Definitely fits, is seems like it's just Part IV? If I'm not mistaken, I sometimes blur the parts together.   It wasn't preceded or followed with anything else off DSotM. It just felt awkard, but I was pumped when I heard it because I thought Time was gonna follow directly after, but never did. What other songs by PF just seem out of place or awkward when played out of context of the album?   Annie Wants A Baby   Their new album, I love Coldplay but their new album doesn't do anything for me.   As a Huge Pink Floyd fan, I'll have to admit that I really don't care for Money.   Their new album kinda grinds my gears. Their first two were immaculate albums, even though I didn't really like Truce as a closer. However, with blurryface, its just mehhhh at most of the times.   Holy shit man, Eddie Vedder was made to sing that rendition!   5 years ago, probably Phobia by Breaking Benjamin. To be honest my music listening has grown so exponentially over the past 5 years that Breaking Benjamin is just my best guess.  Today, probably Wish You Were Here by Pink Floyd. Just an immaculate album.     If Taylor Swift can see it, we can all see it.   Google "Band member name poster" I didn't have any issues.   21 and WYWH  WYWH was my first favorite "song" by them, and then gradually I got into the album that made me love the band in the first place.  Anyone ever see Lord's of Dogtown?   That's awesome! Love hearing PF stories across generations.   On An Island! And Amused To Death by Roger Waters is monumental   Be a chick with a rack and post a picture of you hugging a cute pet   Feynman   I would be shocked by Stephen Colbert's death. I wouldn't be shocked by David Hasselhoff's.   Pink Floyd. Bands can be a product, and I will forever throw money at whatever they do. Even their solo acts.   Great Gig In The Sky by Pink Floyd... shittt that'd be so dramatic         The most recent being deflategate. Watergate was name because it was the name of the hotel! The scandal wasn't Watergategate!   Christopher Walken lives in a WYWH style   Relax, lesbian.   Took me until your comment   Debatably the best instrumental they ever produced. Debatable, yes, but I think it's my favorite. Even though any colour you like is a great track as well.   I'm still a History Teacher fan boy! Can't wait to see him on stage next week!   Is there any public outcry about removing Le Graet in France? I'd genuinely like to know.   What about referees?    But a horse that is allergic to needles, obviously   New skin is Aerodactyl. Ya' know, the POKEMANS. Not really with how it looks, but you get the gist. Still missing Zapdos and Moltres. Guess we won't get Moltres until Riot finishes that Lava map that has been thrown away for ever. And Zapdos, here's where it gets real. Maybe if Kennen electricutes a prehistoric Anivia and it kills her, making her go into eggnivia, it will hatch as a beautiful Zapdos.  TL;DR People still think dreamily of Pokemon first generation   Two sentences, disqualified. Top notch banter though lad   You would be maxcheater if ya didn't haha   Awesome! I'll pass the message along to his brother (the way I actually know Chad) and I remember that story about your club! That's awesome! Have a great day.   I'm honored to say that I know this glorious man irl, and I've never really devoted my allegiances to any team except for now. Go get 'em Chadders!   I thought it was funny how the story has been around for about half the day, and it wasn't posted anywhere on reddit      An absolutely beautiful moment from TFC, such a good narrative and story telling   Yay someone who holds the title as "first player dismissed by coach K" and refused to be a team player as he pissed and moaned every practice. Take that and all your preseason hype and wait for that shit to crash and burn.   Rick Wright was responsible for so much of the Pink Floyd sound. Keyboardists do count!   Underwear? Men's or women's?   A lot of people on this sub spell his name wrong, so by the misspelling on "More" it seems like they're the same people. It's okay bud, we don't blame ya.   I think around the 18 minute mark in AHM   I'm not really into Wiz anymore, but a lot of my friends are since I go to school about an hour from Pittsburgh and I have some friends from Pittsburgh. Pitt is where Wiz is from, and this is more of an older Wiz song that I could actually enjoy, I consider this a pretty good Wiz song, but anything he's put out on the past 5 years or so, I won't listen to.   Twenty one pilots!!   All the conspiracy theorists coming up with theories about how Osama Bin Laden did coordinate 9/11 and not the US government.      along with Where Is the Love by Black Eyed Peas   I think it's barely about roger at all   Yep thats the one I watched!   Okayyyyyyyy surprised the nads off of me   Thanks! This seems incredible, I'm gonna give it a listen the next chance I get.   And I thought it was very well done. Can you guys recommend any other pink Floyd documentaries? Preferably free ones I can access on YouTube or elsewhere.   *ADDED: Besides Gold of course, you rascals. And also would you take the trade the item for the gold?   just in time      Take into account how elections are won these days. You gotta be likeable, good looking, and good social skills etc. the obvious answer is Not Blitzcrank ;p who would be in the presidential cabinet? Sona b/c boobs.   Doggerpillar   /r/politics   Yep! That's the song I recommend to people if they never heard of him   Badass enough to make women bystanders wet to their knees   Sooooo many Sage Francis lines could be posted in this thread, he's amazing   "Raped a pregnant bitch and told my friends we had a threesome" - Tyler, the Creator   "The virginity scarf" - twitch chat 2k15   One of the best PF instrumentals ever   Sage Francis, he used to be a slam poet and now is a killing it as a rapper with very angry lyrics. I recommend Slow Down Gandhi.   One of the best songs off the album    Currently my favorite track off Animals, used to be Dogs, but lately I've really enjoyed singing alongside Roger Waters as Rick so beautifully merges Rogers voice with synthesizers. Such a fun song.   Way to represent WVU, you fucko   What the fuck is hip hopera, people are just makin shit up anymore   You're right, I think while the Final Cut is unfavorable among most PF fans, I think it definitely has some great moments. Post-War Dream, Gunner's Dream, Southampton Dock, Final Cut, and Two Suns in the Sunset are my favorite from the album   * Atlantic City by Bruce Springsteen * Old Man Time and Mr. Moon by O.A.R. * Gunner's Dream by Pink Floyd * Air Catcher by Twenty One Pilots * Dead Sea by The Lumineers * My Blood by Ellie Goulding * Bankrupt on Selling by Modest Mouse    That first guitar solo, I think it's around 3:45? Is my favorite solo off Animals   I've never listened to it while going to bed. I think that that's is most apt time   It's just never been my jam, David Gilmour was still learning how to make a cohesive Pink Floyd album without Roger. On The Turning Away is definitely the highlight off the album for me   No problem homie, echoes, fearless, and one of these days are the highlights for sure. I think on vinyl, echoes is the entire second half   All Pink Floyd albums except Ummagumma and A momentary lapse of reason   Echoes is a song off Meddle :p sorry I couldn't help myself, I'm on /r/pinkfloyd almost daily    Echoes is a song off of Meddle   Echoes is a song off of Meddle  	91
 *sigh*...want.   Sadly I think he's too old.  I think they have an age limit for interns.  What I think I really need to find is someone who owns one privately, in a car collection or something.  Where to find that, I do not know.   Oh, hold me!   What glorious moss!!!   This professor is my adviser for my Master's thesis.  Today he told me that his lifelong dream was to drive the Oscar Meyer Wienermobile.  At the end of the semester, it is typical to give your adviser some sort of thank you gift (bottle of whine, gift card for a dinner out, etc). I say, screw the bottle of wine, I want him to be able to drive the Weinermobile!  Anyone know someone who has driven one, works for Oscar Meyer, etc?  Any leads would be great.   That's a pair of winners right there, sir.   I...love.   Why does it need to be a board game?  Isn't Apples to Apples just a card game as well?   It's only my best guess, but someone had to try it.   YO DE LAY HE, YO DE LAY HE, YO DE LAY HE YOOOOOOOOOO...   Who is it?  I want one!       Hello fellow gardeners!  My boyfriend and I have a Minnesota garden, so while you're probably a bit colder than us, things are similar.    1) This article is short and has a nice graphic showing which things to rotate from year to year, and how to make a rotational schedule.  As for things to plant next to each other, we don't have a ton of space, so we do things like grow beans up our sunflowers, and grow lettuce under our bean trellis.  We stage a lot of things such that by the time the larger plant leafs out and shades the smaller, earlier growing plan, the smaller plant is done producing.  As for things to plant, Charentais melons were small, and FANTASTICALLY tasty (seeds can be hard to find, but PM me and could mail you some we saved), and we had an amazing crop of tomatillos last year, which is great if you want to make a green salsa.  Another fun one that I haven't personally tried, but is good for our climate is the arctic kiwi.  2) We start tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, basil, and some greens indoors, though we start the greens indoors so we can have lettuce and kale early.  We also start another round of greens outdoors.  As for timing, SproutRobot is a nice tool.  You simply enter your zip code and it makes up a schedule for you, and can even send you email reminders and ship you seed, if you so choose.  http://sproutrobot.com/  3) We have gotten all our seeds from Baker Creek Heirloom Seeds and Seed Savers Exchange.  Now we don't buy seeds unless we want to try something new, because we have gotten good at seed saving, and our stock gives us more than enough seed.  4) We have raspberries that were in the yard when we bought the house.  Again, see the arctic kiwi.  As for fruit trees, you could graft some or buy some, but you're looking at about 5 years for them to start producing, so if you plan on moving, you may want to just wait.  Also, while it isn't really a "fruit" per se, we do a lot with rhubarb.  5)  Straw for mulch can be good, but we tried it one year and it seeded everywhere, which was super annoying.  We collect leaves from parts of our yard (and mulch the rest into the grass) and dump it all over the garden in fall.  Then in spring, we turn the leaves into the soil.  We also empty two compost bins full into the garden each year.  Our soil is very sandy, so we are working hard to get organic matter into the soil, and I'm not a soil amendment expert yet.  As for mulching to control weeds, when you mow your lawn, collect some of the clippings and use them as mulch in the garden.  We've had good luck with that.  6) If you have (or can find) an old window, it's easy to build a cold frame, and that can extend your season on either end by a few weeks.  Habitat for Humanity has ReStores where you can buy used and salvaged construction materials, and that might be a good place to look.  If you're looking for a good book that covers a lot of this stuff, The Backyard Homestead is fantastic.    Hope this helps!!!  PM me if you need melon seeds!   More like DAT ALL OF HIM.  *grrrrrowlllll*   Cool!  What program(s) did you use for this?   I think a TC book club is wonderful!  I can't guarantee I'll be very available until May (I'm in the middle of my master's thesis), but I'm very interested in being involved.  I could plan meetings and find locations too.  I drive a lot, so I mostly listen to audiobooks these days.  Any books I sit down and read are for my thesis.  I work my way though a lot of young adult fiction, mostly because it's easy to follow while driving around the city.  I'm just working my way through N.D. Wilson's 100 Cupboards trilogy.  As far as adult fiction, I was an undergraduate English lit major, so I have a solid handle on that too. :)  I'll join this sub so I can stay connected.  I'd love to be a part of it.     The blue shirt with the sleeves rolled up...with the forearms...oh my.   What do you think about climate change?  Have you noticed changes in your lifetime that have shocked you?  How things looked when you grew up vs. now?  I'm doing my thesis on climate change and its impact on sense of place.   This was the stuff of nightmares in gym class.  The racquets were terrible.   I show in the Morgan circuit.  I started with Morgans as a kid, when I became interested in horses and a girl at school invited me over to her house to meet her horses, which were all Morgans.  From there, her mother directed my family to a nearby Morgan farm that gave lessons.  15 years later I'm still at the same barn!  I've also shown Saddlebred and Hackneys, but Morgans will always be my first love.    It's hard to explain why I love Morgans so much more, but I feel like they have a certain spark to them.  So many of them have undeniable heart, and HUGE motors!  With both of my horses, you only have to say "whoa", never "go"!  They bring 110% to every ride.  Also, Morgans are smart -- sometimes too smart!  And of course they are beautiful!  As long as you don't need a big horse, they are the total package.     I'm so happy to know this is a thing!  I've tried to describe it to others as "being able to vibrate my eardrums", but now I really know what is going on in there!   Am I the only one attracted to OP?  Maybe minus the colander.     I miss Albert Heijn on a daily basis.   Can we clone him?    There is a couple down the street that has horses on their property and regularly rides them around the neighborhood and adjacent parks. I would love to get to know them, and their horses, and see if they ever need help around their small barn when they are out of town, etc. What is the best way to go about introducing yourself? I don't want to just show up on their property -- that might be seen as trespassing. What do you suggest? Have you had people approach you on your land about your horses? How did they do it? And how did it make you feel?  I board my horses, so I don't have a good feel for what its like when someone approaches you about your horses on your own land.   For me it all began when a new girl came to my school in 4th grade.  She and I hit it off and she invited me to her horse show that weekend to meet her horse and watch her ride.  I'd never been to a horse show before, and was only familiar with western and jumping when it came to riding, but she had a Saddlebred and showed saddleseat, and I was instantly in love.  The following year, another girl joined our class who rode huntseat and had Morgans.  I really fell in love with her Morgan, and when I figured out that Morgans could do saddleseat, I pursued it.  My parents contacted a local trainer, and I'm still with him and his team of trainers 15 years later.    I got my first horse when I was 14 and showed her as a saddleseat horse, but it turned out she wasn't really built for saddleseat and didn't enjoy it.  Not wanting to push her, we retired and bred her.  After she had her foal (my current show horse) we put her back to work and discovered she made a gorgeous hunter pleasure horse, so back to the show ring we went!  After a few years she retired for good and her son stepped up as my show partner.  In short, I've ridden and shown saddleseat, huntseat, and done driving with Morgans, Saddlebreds, and Hackney ponies for the past 15 years, and dabbled in bits of Dressage and Western.  At some point I would like to learn to jump!  Pictures here of my early saddleseat days (http://i.imgur.com/TQgw8.jpg), my mare as a hunter (http://i.imgur.com/jFVcm.jpg), her son as my current hunter (http://i.imgur.com/TVTI0.jpg) and one of the Hackneys I have shown in harness (http://i.imgur.com/Bl7yc.jpg)  Enjoy!   This week I am showing at the Grand National and World Championship Morgan Horse Show, and you can watch it live online!  This is a great opportunity to see some of the best Morgan horses in the world, and also to see some great saddleseat horses along with incredible hunter pleasure Morgans, and gorgeous western horses.  Comment if you have any questions about what you are watching!    The show goes until this Saturday night and most of the "big" action will be happening in the Coliseum, so choose that feed from the options to the right of the video window.  Happy viewing!      Well I shouted it to the heavens on FB so that my Minneapolis friends will keep an eye out too.  I've been on your side of the music business before, and can't imagine losing everything you've had stolen.   I'll keep my eyes out as I'm around the neighborhood.  That seriously sucks, Ari.  I hope you can recover at least part of it.  Does your MacBook have any identifying marks on it?  Stickers/decals?  It would be easier to tell if someone using a suspicious MacBook.   I live in Minneapolis.  Not sure if you're coming anywhere near me, but if you are, my yard is your yard.   I had a Sudan Plated Lizard.  He lived for a long time, for a Sudan Plated, about 15 years.  He was always getting into trouble, like the time he got into the heating ducts. :)   I still have mine!   I want to hug him SO HARD.   Where are you located?  Are you able to grow all year, or does this merely extend your season.  I'm in MN, and our season is painfully short.  Cold frames only get us so far.   The amount of talent on Reddit (and in the world in general) never ceases to amaze me.   Really an amazing transformation.  You look fantastic!   He is everything I love in a man!      You went from poofy to ladyboner!   I'm looking for one extra ticket to the Sept. 29th Minneapolis Ben Folds Five show. Does anyone have one they can't use? There are some tickets left, but they are way in the back and I am a short, short person. PM me if you can help me out. Been a BFF fan since I was 15, and it would mean a lot to see these guys when they come to town. Many thanks!   I'm looking for one extra ticket to the Sept. 29th Minneapolis Ben Folds Five show.

This is the first I've heard about it!   Now it's perfect.  And so dapper!   PIZZA-CORN!   Now he needs a monocle.   WANT!  Dammit and I was at the MN state fair too and didn't see these.   That will be an interesting look if she gets fat...   Nose Nachos is my personal favorite.  They should get rid of these hilarious names.  Hilarious names MAKE me want to try them.     I love this.  Now every time I use one of these I will imagine it saying "oooooeeeeeeeEEEEEE!!!!!"   Awesome!   Ohhhh...I had to come back to this one.  BAD TIME!  Riiiight...   SCIENCE!!!   It's a sugar rectangle, what's not to love?   You link doesn't work. :(  Just sends me to Google.  	56
 "Now this was the sin of your sister Sodom: She and her daughters were arrogant, overfed and unconcerned; they did not help the poor and needy."  Ezekiel 16:49                                     i'm really concerned about your mom hitting you. Do you have any other family members you can talk to that could help? Also, you should post this on /r/asktransgender, you'll most likely get more replies                        oh we're all pretty skanky   there, you now have 1000   you paged?   Going beyond the findings would be pure conjecture I would posit  that whatever they had previously experience gave them certain expectations of how a situation would unfold. So presented with a situation that would seem "normal" to us, say a trash bag lying beside the road, would be seen in a context that would be "normal" to them based on THEIR experiences, i.e. a concealed IED that would explode as their convoy drove past.  What would be non-threatening to you, a civilian, would be seen thru the lens of a soldier who has had multiple encounters in combat.   no, the study just confirms that the PTSD sufferers' perceptions of reality is different than those of people without the condition.                                           honestly viv, i dont have a clue, which is why i'm asking.      look, you're obviously angry about something, so i'm more than happy to hear you out, which is why i offered to take it to PM   that's what they said about gay marriage....   actually i'm trying to use humor to defuse a situation.                we talk to cedar all the time, and they're the nicest person. and besides, we like to save our mod abuse for when nobody is looking, then we bring out the sacrificial lamb and do the incantations to stay young forever more  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA  i have said too much....   no, you didnt say it, i just find it's harder to stay mad when you say "poopyhead" in any context.        discussions are always open, we just ask you to please refrain from personal attacks. we can have a grown up convo without having to resort to calling each other "poopyheads"      viv, please refrain from personal attacks. if you have any issues, please PM us and we'll have a discussion about your concerns.                                                                                                                                             yeah, all they do for their headlines is to quote verbatim what was said..... and most of the time, it's batshit cray cray      they're actually pretty decent reporters on batshit insane positions that the bigots take                                             almost ALL my queer friends are in love with the show, all my straight friends are kinda "meh" about it.  just an observation.                  please be civil                                                                                    i'm glad i posted it yesterday, if i had read that today from work, i'd be bawling   yeah, i know, all the feely feels      3 you dani!            yeah, i know, i used to be an officer in 7BTS, so i used to do the intake interviews.   lmao, i'm trans and lesbian, and i still went thru NS fine, even became an officer.    i was a crazy person the first 6 months. then i was an emotional wreck for the next 6. i'm amazed that any of my friends stuck around. 2nd puberty is a royal bitch and a half. there were times i was so uncomfortable with my image in the  mirror that i spent days avoiding my reflection. without my therapist, i would have gone stark raving bonkers. it didnt help that i went fulltime 2 months into hrt. hell, i didnt start hrt til two months after i got my script.   seriously, your reaction is pretty much well within the bounds of transition. keep a record for your timeline, you'll see the diff.    HUG   hold on, i know it's rough, but you can do this.     let's take it from the top, shall we?  someone's sexuality is literally none of your goddamn business. if they want to serve their country by joining up, then more power to them. YOU  do not get a say.   end of story. there's no big discussion to be had. sexuality has nothing to do with how well you do your job. the only problem arises when OTHER people go out of their way to make it a problem.  get over it, people are gay. people have been gay since the dawn of time. people will continue to be gay, wanna know why? because they're born that way.  seriously, join the 21st century already, we're moving on, so come along or get out the way. no one is stopping for you.   i know what you're asking, but i would be remiss if i didnt first start out by saying that we always recommend going thru a therapist/endo/GP first. that's because there is no such thing as a "standard dose" when it comes to HRT. everyone's body reacts differently, so it's always advisable to have a medical professional oversee your hormone therapy, especially since it's relatively easy to get to an informed consent clinic.  that being said, a great many people here, for one reason or another, do NOT have access to hrt with a prescription, and so choose to self-med. there are no judgments from any of us.   please be civil, i know it's a touchy subject for some of us.   have to preface this with the usual "I AM NOT A DOCTOR"  First off, your body is adjusting to running off new hormones, it's going to feel uncomfortable for a bit. and because everyone's body is different, we all adjust to it differently.  So here's what my endo told me about the first few doses, that your body will see the influx of estrogen as a sign that the testicles are failing, and it will signal your gonads to kick into overdrive, i.e. to produce MORE testosterone. after a few more shots, your body will interpret that as the new normal, and send a signal to shut down the production of T.  some people also go on an emotional rollercoaster, i had one time where i had to pull over to the side of the road and bawl my eyes out, for no reason.  and as for looks? yeah, that inbetweeny stage is a royal bitch, i aint gonna lie. but you HAVE to ride it out, trust me on this one. it gets WAY better on the other side.  tl;dr: it's normal, it will pass, hold on, it'll get better   yes, but does it bacon at midnight?   no, equality is never a problem. bigotry is. once you stop operating from a position that heterosexuality is the only option, the better off we will all be.   there have been no issues with gay people serving in the US army regarding their sexuality.   i'll go one step further, there are no issues with gay people in general, regarding their sexuality.   the only problems arise when other people go out of their way to be bigots and make other people's sexuality their problem.  who people sleep with behind closed doors is none of your business.   thank you for your time.

 Maybe he was trying to signal Batman?   He might want to watch out for those bandits on the other hill.          I was a little disappointed that you can only see the figure properly from a map, although it was pretty interesting how someone could miss this completely if they were playing without aid from a map.            I would like it if they kept their new scripting language private, so that only they know about it = less scripters   Well they're trying to make loot spawns realistic, and pretty much the only past-time in prison, was to read.   Did you search the rooms at the end of the hall, on the second and third levels of the  prison block. That is quite a good food spawn.   Haven't broken my legs once at the prison. I have had my legs broken numerous times elsewhere.   I don't play Persistence because of the broken loot spawns.   I found a MP5 in that really small room at the end of one of the halls.   Haven't broken my legs even once.   Probably not.   Don't you mean broken?   I thought it was a Train or a Submarine.   You can't exactly *fix* hacking in a game. There will always be hackers because there is always a way for hackers, to hack.   Wait, the V3S *isnt* a submarine?   	20
    What is a deleriant exactly? I see that term thrown around a lot but I've never seen it well defined.   Yeah, that level of effect doesn't seem worth it with the unpredictable potential for nastiness that exists with them. I'm also looking at 4-HO-DMT, do you know anything about that?   Yep, I've read that page carefully. Thanks for the advice, I am considering steering clear of amanitas for the time being.   After reading this board and other sources for about a year I think I'm ready for my first psychedelic experience. I've sort of settled on Amanitas since they're legal, readily available from high-rated sellers, and organic (the white-powder RC's from shady vendors scare me).  However people seem to have very mixed experiences with with these mushrooms, with a large number of dud and bad trips. Is there anyone who's had success with Amanitas that would like to offer some tips on how to make the experience a good one, or am I off on the wrong track choosing them for a first trip?         Thank you, someone with a common-sense answer to this silly debate. There might be areas of reality evolved minds are blind to, but that's not the same thing as saying they're just as likely to produce false beliefs as true beliefs.    Force or not, we need a way to describe gravity on quantum scales, and such a thing has proven elusive so far.  Wouldn't entropic gravity be a description of gravity on the quantum scale? That is, the theory is that there are more random quantum "opportunities" for a particle to move in the direction of the gravitational (pseudo)-force than in the opposite direction, or am I misunderstanding?   Nope, it was in a chapter before the CLT was introduced.   Mostly makes sense -  what's still weird to me is that the math seems to be implying that *averaging* more than 4 strokes over 18 holes is *more likely* than getting more than 4 strokes on any given hole. That seems backwards...   Informative answer, thanks   The problem in question stated "a golfer has a long-term mean of 3.9 strokes per hole. What is the probability that he scores more than a 72 in an 18-hole game?"  The textbook said to solve this using Poisson and P(x4) for a mean of 3.9 - I don't think this is valid since the probability of getting more than four strokes on any given hole cannot be equated to *averaging* more than 4 strokes over the course of 18 holes, because of the Law of Large Numbers.  The problem is, when I solved P(x72) using a mean of 70.2 (3.9 times 18), it evaluated to a *greater* probability than what was in the textbook. I would have thought the Law of Large Numbers would imply a smaller probability.  Here are the relevant calculations. Can anyone tell me the error in my reasoning?  [P(x4| mean = 3.9) = 0.351635](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-+%28sum+%283.9^x%29%28e^%28-3.9%29%29%2F%28x!%29+for+x+from+0+to+4%29)  [P(x72| mean= 70.2) = 0.384819](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1-+[sum+%2870.2^x%29%28e^%28-70.2%29%29%2F%28x!%29+for+x+from+0+to+72])                        Moribito? It's a series not a movie, but it matches the description otherwise.   One guy who was given an intravenous drip of DMT in an experiment in New Mexico recently estimated he was "gone" for 1,000 years.   Very curious. Lucid dreamers also report that it is hard to reach the moon while in a lucid state.      We could ask about it over on /r/yoga, but I took a look around and it doesn't seem like an esoteric sort of crowd over there. There are some instruction manuals and youtube videos floating around - and a debate between people who say "it's all a metaphor" and the tendon-cutters. Ah, religion!   I would hesitate to call someone a fanatic unless they are imposing their beliefs on others. It is a recognized yogic practice in India, it wasn't invented by some nut on the Internet. Those pictures of Indian gods, especially Shiva and Kali, that you see with long tongues sticking out are supposedly references to the practice.   Apparently though, there is a reasoning behind it that goes beyond the merely spiritual: According to what I've heard, in the throat cavity there are two sensitive regions that are very similar to what is found in the genitals. "Celibate" yogis would get their tongue up in there and basically get themselves off. Bizarrely enough, this was basically the plot of that 70's porno "Deep Throat" though a tongue wasn't the instrument used...  I do not know if any of this is true and I'm not about to cut my tongue tendon to find out, though if anyone on here has done such a practice I'd love to hear from them!   The Pranayama crowd is pretty hard-core. Some of them even cut the tendons under their tongue so they can stuff the tongue up into their throat cavity to better conduct the Prana. And they say people who take drugs are nuts! On the other hand, there must be something to the experience if people are willing to physically mutilate themselves to get more of it.         He was part of the same organisation as Einstein, von Ossietzky and Kurt Tucholsky?  Those must have been some interesting fundraisers.   Understood. I see your point. I read his reply as "No, we don't have any evidence for a Crusade involving actual *children*, it was a misunderstanding of a real Crusade that involved *peasants*" which does in a way answer the question.   True, but you can look up the book and see what its sources were. He's not just making unsourced claims.   He did provide a reference.      It's been an open secret for a while that disability has become welfare for white people. I could name several people I know on disability who could certainly work if they really wanted to, but would rather sit around all day pontificating on how Obama is a Socialist giving money and "free health care" to people on welfare - as if they aren't on welfare themselves.   Hmm, it might be a bit of a stretch but could we consider a function with a variable arity, perhaps one that varied according to a probability distribution?   For example, I could imagine a random walk that always changes its x and y coordinates for each step of the walk, but only changes the z coordinate when a uniform random variable on [0,1] that is calculated at each step of the walk has a value above 0.5.  Could such a walk be considered to be moving in 2.5 dimensions? If so, what would the probability be that it returns to its starting point? We know that for two dimensions it will always return, but for 3 it only returns about 34% of the time.   I was thinking this myself yesterday. I heard a documentary on in the background with a female narrator and I just knew it was early 80's without even seeing the video quality or hearing much about the subject matter. Turns out it was 1981.   My completely unscientific theory is there was some leftover "hippie" intonation that sort of merged with the "polite secretary" but was then pushed out by the "valley girl" and the "local news announcer" sometime in the mid-80's. I fondly wish for the return of that old female accent but I'm not too hopeful. In fact the default female public-speaking voice seems to have become even harsher and more aloof-sounding in recent years, especially on radio commercials.   [Fractal dimension.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_dimension)   They're just the galactic hicks who haven't figured out the spin-foam stuff yet.   If there is a quantum component to how the brain works (which is highly speculative), then changing our brain chemistry might give us access to their realm.  PS those Tulpa people are nuts! I thought I had some crazy ideas but they take the cake!   We need one of those really smart people to come along and tell us how gravity works in fractal dimensions between 3 and 4...   Interesting. But what if gravity was 1/r^2 regardless of dimension?   This discussion presupposes that by "volume" it is meant some type of hyper-volume (the type changes with the dimension.) A ball in 4D has a "surface" that is a 3D volume. It still might be nonsense from a physics perspective (unless you're into String Theory) but the math is interesting.    Now what is the expected value for age of coin in this magic room if you pick one coin randomly?  It depends on how long this spawning process has been going on for. However, that doesn't apply to my original post because we are looking at a *ratio* of young to old universes, not the expected age of a randomly chosen universe. In the magic coin room, it's pretty clear that the ratio of "new" (1-year-old or less) coins to "old" coins will always be 1:1, and in the theory the ratio of young to old universes will always be very very large.   True, but chances are (if this theory is correct), that we are at the beginning of this process, not down the road. Even if our Universe will ultimately have many civilizations, chances are we're the first. I don't necessarily believe in this theory (it's pretty out there), but the lack of aliens could be seen as supporting evidence for it in a Bayesian sense.   Not if this particular brand of Inflation Theory is correct. It goes against the intuition though, I agree.         It's part of Eternal Inflation Cosmology (EIC), which states that universes are constantly bubbling into existence as part of an Eternal Big Bang. You may have heard the saying "The Big Bang never ended." That is talking about EIC.  Depending on how you set the parameters for the formulas in this theory, the rate of universe production might appear to be increasing drastically every second.   Imagine a room that, for every person of age "x," has a million people of age "x-1." The vast majority of people in that room will be very young.  What does that have to do with the Fermi Paradox? Well, imagine that room again. Take the number of people in that room who have had time to have children of their own. The vast majority of people with children will have had only one. There are a trillion 18-year olds for every 20-year old, after all. Replace "children" with "spawned an intelligent civilization," and you have the idea.   This one's my favorite:  Cosmologist Alan Guth proposed a multi-verse solution to the Fermi Paradox. In this theory, using the synchronous gauge probability distribution, young universes exceedingly outnumber older ones (by a factor of e1037 for every second of age). Therefore, averaged over all universes, universes with civilizations will almost always have just one, the first to develop.  Always thinking outside the box, that guy.    Your description of the chakras, especially considering you had never studied that subject before, is particularly intriguing  I don't know, dude knows terms like "merkaba" yet he's never looked into chakras before? Could be, but I doubt it. Sounds like he had a real mind-blowing experience but I'd be willing to bet he had some knowledge of the classical depictions of chakras stashed somewhere in his memory banks.   I'm not sure, but it wouldn't surprise me. It seemed the obvious "next step" in his analysis, the fascinating thing might be to investigate why he never got there (ideology? a "scholarly" rather than a "critical" approach to mythology? maybe he was trapped in the myth himself?)  I've read some criticism of Campbell that claimed he was proto-Fascist for reducing all of human culture to the struggle of the Hero, I think that's going too far, but it could be that he was too wedded to his idea of the Monomyth to see the dialectical possibility in the Hero breaking out of it.   Also, both these empires relied on Arab tribes to guard their borders.  The Ghassanids and the Lakhmids, specifically. When these tribes were successfully converted to Islam, all of a sudden the gates were wide open.    On two occasions I did see some weird shit.   Care to elaborate?   Campbell was very erudite but he consistently missed the dialectical turn that always lay just beneath the surface of the Hero's Myth: The final monster for the Hero to slay is the constrictive, neurotic-repetitive form of the Monomyth itself in which he is imprisoned.   I was certain when watching this series for the first time that this was the "twist" waiting at the end, but Campbell either never saw it or didn't think it was suitable for public consumption. He maybe hints at it in his discussion of the Native American "twins" myth cycle (where the twins witness their own story being written by the gods and try to reject it.)      If you're asked to do a probability in the problem, you have to be careful. If all the outcomes in the space are listed first, then one is picked at random, the probability of that outcome is just 1/(30 C 10). *However*, if each *card* is chosen at random one by one, then things become dicier and you get a (generalized) Binomial Distribution. The outcomes with more repeats will be less likely than those with fewer.   No problem. These used to stump me in school too. Some texts avoid them because it is hard to construct probabilities unambiguously on multiset spaces without being very careful in how you state the problem. Their sizes are clear, but it is not always clear if all outcomes in such spaces are equally likely.      You don't need Excel, this is one of the simpler spaces: It is called a multiset (or a multichoose) Sometimes it is called a "stars and bars" problem because of how it is diagrammed. A multiset shows up when you are choosing with replacement (allowing duplicates), but you don't care about the order in which the choices were made (which I assume is happening here since you used the word combination.)  You can turn a multiset into a regular combination by using the formula (n + r - 1) C (r). So, n = 21 and r = 10 for your example, so the size of the sample space would be 30 C 10 = 30,045,015  If you *do* care about order then the size is just n^r, so 21^10 which is around 16.7 trillion.   I often encounter these terms when reading about the Middle Ages, but they never seem to be well-defined. Confusingly, monasteries often tend to be headed by abbots, but abbots are also found in abbeys.   Are these vague terms that were used interchangeably, or did they have specific meanings in Church law, etc.?      The claim is you can't read in your dreams (or if you can the text changes) because the part of your brain that controls reading is "still asleep" during a dream. I don't know of any scientific evidence to back this up and I've found it not to be true for me.  That having been said, many people *do* experience changing or unreadable text, and use it as a good reality check.      I don't think that, you misunderstood my comment. I said that line of reasoning does not make sense.   I never did understand that line of reasoning. If the brain creates or even mediates consciousness, and consciousness causes the wavefunction collapse, giving rise to "classical" reality, then what collapsed the classical systems in the brain that allowed this process in the first place?  These views seem to try to split the difference between science and mysticism and end up making a mess of both.      *Sunyata* is a term in Buddhism that is often translated as "emptiness" or "void." But as with most translations, it leaves something to be desired. *Sunyata* is like the emptiness of a cup, not the emptiness of "nothingness." The air or water inside the cup is not part of the cup itself, yet, without it, the cup would cease to be a cup. That is, the cup's very identity as a cup depends on some part of itself being not-cup.   If we reflect on it, the same is true of ourselves. If you are not willing to change yourself, if you are not open to growth or new experiences, then you might as well be a pre-programmed computer or robot. Anyone who actually attains an eternal, unchanging self (*atta*), immediately ceases to be a self at all, and becomes an object with no more life in them than a rock has.   Therefore our continuation as subjects is dependent on being open and receptive to non-self, to a willingness to incorporate that which is non-self into our identities (using discernment of course.)  Sometimes for these reasons you will see *sunyata* translated as "receptivity" instead of "emptiness." My feeling is it's somewhere in-between these two concepts.    All good points. I've heard of Assagioli in passing but have not read his work.    (yet Reich was out of the mainstream both among Freudians and Marxists)  That's an understatement. Reich would be classified as "New Age" if he were alive today. In fact his works are still popular in New Age circles, whereas both Freudian and Marxist thinkers tend to dismiss them. Reich was sort of a latter-day Jung with even more of a mystical bent, but the US government found him threatening enough that he was actually imprisoned and died in jail.               Maybe you have someone on witness protection living on your block - or a crime boss looking for a "nice, quiet retirement." You never know...   A possible explanation comes to mind - they could be kids doing one of those all-day fasts for charity/hunger awareness and the pizza shop agreed to feed them at Midnight. I would expect getting through that last half hour could be pretty intense and there probably wouldn't be that much socializing going on.   It sounds like you stumbled upon the end of a police surveillance shift.     That's because it's a mix of "traditional" Buddhism, the native Bon religion, and Tantrism. Whether this mix is a higher form, just a different vehicle, or a degeneration of the original teaching is very much in the eye of the beholder.     Chakras aren't discussed in *Therevada* Buddhism. Tibetan Buddhism, they're all over the place.   Done.   If/when I am able, that is the plan. But if someone with more access to the stuff wants to try first, I will supply the number, keep the key primes private, and wait to see what response comes back.   I was inspired by a skeptic who was contacted by a woman who claimed to be in contact with intelligent supercomputers from the future. The skeptic told the woman to ask these supercomputers to factor a large random integer. Of course "they" couldn't do it and she was cured of her delusion.  So my ambition would be to convince someone to go on a DMT trip - or to go on one myself- armed with a large random integer and ask any "intelligences" they meet to factor it.   Any takers?      Universes that appear to be undergoing a singularity state change from the inside (quickly, from rare to saturated intelligence) are being run in order to generate shared concepts, used to communicate with peers.  I think there might be something to this. Of course one would expect technological change to accelerate over time, but the rate of acceleration we've been experiencing lately seems somehow "unnatural" to me. If the rumors going around about reactionless drives and successful LENR (cold fusion) prototypes actually pan out, that will reinforce my suspicions.    [It's in Chapter 2 of his book](http://www.homeschoolnewslink.com/homeschool/columnists/gatto/lesssch.shtml)  Thats an ancient Egyptian idea symbolized by the pyramid with an eye on top thats on the other side of George Washington on our one-dollar bill. Everyone is a stone defined by position on the pyramid. This theory has been presented in many different ways, but at bottom, it signals the world view of minds obsessed by dominance and strategies of intervention to maintain that dominance.     I get the nagging sense when watching the Simpsons that Bart is somehow smarter than Lisa, he's just hiding it, playing a game with life for some reason or another. I can't point to any specific scenes that would "prove" this theory, or if it's anything intentional that the writers put in the show.  I'm wondering if anyone else ever got the same hunch and can flesh out this idea a little bit more...   The giant white pyramid in Tibet I swallowed, but I stopped watching when he claimed the average temperature during the Ice Age was 50 degrees below zero.    The actual doctrine is "anatta" which is usually (mis)-translated as "no-self." The Vedic concept of the "atta" is very different from the modern Western ideas about a "self." The atta was said to be eternal, unchanging, and identical with the Universal Principle (Brahman).  This is the "self" that the Buddha demolished philosophically, not the idea of a changing, growing, interconnected self.  If you think about it, an unchanging self isn't a subject at all, but an object. It is those who believe in an atta who have to ask "for whom is this done?" since there is no way to change the atta. Buddhism can answer - it is done out of compassion for our future selves as well as other beings.   What was the book about? I sometimes get this with music and it doesn't seem to be any song I remembered hearing while awake. It is mostly Classical music and I don't listen to much of that (while awake anyway.)   On the contrary, I think this is great for beginners. Buddhism can seem so gloomy with the "all is suffering" aspect to the teaching that it turns so many people off to the practice.          I just read that cosmic "ray" is a misnomer and they are not photons - my mistake!     nuclear gamma rays we observed at 10^7 eV or astrophysical gamma rays that we observed at 10^13 eV would, to this cosmic ray, have energies of over 10^18 or 10^24 eV, respectively.  It seems like here you are describing things from the point of view of the cosmic ray.   Over on the "what came before the Big Bang?" thread, it was stated that photons don't have a frame of reference and can't be said to "observe" (measure) anything. I take it you disagree with this?            Perhaps he should have phrased the question "Is the spacetime created by the Big Bang part of a larger system."    I got to the part where the theory is that each bubble universe could have radically different physical laws, and my reaction was like this:  Wow that's really cool ......... wait....... why? ...........  Even beyond that, there must be some super-set of laws that governs the eternal inflation itself. And from there one could speculate about an ensemble of super-multiverses where the inflation laws worked differently.   Can photons have a point of view? That is, can they make a measurement in the quantum-mechanical sense?          Good point... I covered it up.    There are a number of theories. One is that it externalizes/structures the fear of the audience (mostly teenagers) of being caught and punished for what many of them are planning to do after the movie. In that case it is not so much trying to promote conservative values as it is simply reflecting them to increase the fear/enjoyment of the audience.   Uh, I doubt that Hollywood has killed every character who ever said "God dammit." On the other hand, that punishing disbelief thing is very real though you're not the first to notice it. Part of it is just the convention of telling a good story - it's hard to make a good ghost story where the ghost turns out to be a hoax*, so of course the disbelievers in a horror movie will end up looking like idiots, but part of it is indeed playing to the desire the audience has for the paranormal/supernatural to indeed be real.  Critics have also long noted that supposedly "liberal" Hollywood movies also tend to punish people who have unconventional, kinky, underage or casual sex, especially in the horror genre. Say "God dammit" and you're probably safe, but be a teen having sex in a horror movie, you're screwed.  *Exception: [Heart of Midnight](/spoiler)      Shows pretty vividly the "neo-Conservative" migration from the left to the right that happened from the 70's through the Bush years.      I know for sure one of the gang days was October 30 of that year, but I'm not sure if they go that day every year.  Well, that explains my odd experience at Six Flags on Halloween. It gradually dawned on us that the "Zombie" blocking the line was a crackhead, not an employee in costume... also my gf at the time bought one of those velcro monkeys and someone stole it from around her neck.   I've come across this guy's blog several times. Either I'm not educated enough to understand what he's talking about or he writes very incoherent blog posts on everything from black holes to psychology. He's obviously trying to say something about the Qualia debate here but beyond that I can't make sense of it.   There are, I just went with the print version.      I don't know much about the history of that area except for the Acadians who were Catholic. You might want to ask a local historian about any weird religious groups or cults that might have existed in your area.   It reminds me of the Byzantine Empire and the riots of the Greens vs. the Blues in the Hippodrome. I think eventually something similar did happen there - the Emperor banned chariot races and turned the Hippodrome into a Monastery.    Is that exactly how the problem was stated to you? Because I can't make much sense out of it. It looks like a Combinatorial problem, those sometimes have special cases for n=1.    Also, it says alcohol prohibits lucid dreaming but i've had plenty of them after a night of heavily drinking, (some of my longest ones also) I think this misconception needs to be addressed.   Same here. Once I was drunk in the dream too and at a bar (that was interesting.) The bartender offered me a drink and I told him no, I'd had enough when I was awake!      Names were things like Guy, and Girl, and no these weren't infants, though many were children or in their early teens, sometimes whole families.  That reminds me of something I once heard or read that there were certain schismatic Anabaptist groups that went out into the backwoods - if you were in one of these groups, you wouldn't get a "Christian" name until you were formally baptized into the church, and even some adults were not given that privilege (perhaps they had misbehaved or offended the church leaders), so they were just called "man" or something like that for their entire lives.   On the other hand, an Anabaptist church probably wouldn't have an organ. Where was this church located?   'speedtrap hill'... At the bottom of the hill was a rather large pond that some of my naughtier friends and I used to smoke weed at pretty regularily.   Ghost deer aside, that might not have been the best place to smoke weed.   Thanks, great reply. Are you a lawyer?   I've gotten used to it at those places too, but for the first time today I got the same question at a convenience store. I wasn't actually buying gum but pretty close.   And Gatto is a crank who believes the Illuminati put secret messages in the dollar bill. The enemy of your enemy is not always your friend - especially if he's crazy.   I'm sure this has something to do with customer tracking, wanting to spam me, etc., but is this really so lucrative that companies tolerate slowing down their lines and pissing off their customers like this?    All true, my skepticism was over whether or not this was a conscious choice (in the US at least) to lower long-term wealth in exchange for present-day power monopolies. It is more likely that the "plutocrats" simply subscribe to a feel-good ideology that believes the measures you mention *promote* long-term growth (even though they don't.)  African dictatorships, whole 'nother story...   I'm skeptical of that - I don't think "they" are that self-aware and have any definite agenda of that magnitude.   But the pie doesn't grow as fast, or at all, so over the long run even they lose out.      I was trying to read The Hobbit...it was around midnight when someone knocked 3 times on the front door.  That would have been Gandalf. You missed out on quite the adventure.   I still think stuff like "Yea we should totaly do that" in my head when I'm thinking of something I should do ALONE.  Sort of embarrassing but I started doing that Freshman year of college when I was having a tough time socially. The "we" was me and one of my friends from HS who had gone to a different college. I don't know why I picked him probably because he was the most laid-back of my HS friends so he was a good imaginary companion. The weird thing is I talked to the real friend online but never told him I made an imaginary version of him to keep me company... I think that might have ended the real friendship pretty quick.  Anyway now years later I still say "we have to go shopping" to myself but I'm not thinking specifically of that friend anymore, it's just a generalized "we" made up of all the different aspects of myself.   Elsewhere on this thread which has unexpectedly turned quite creepy a few people mentioned such things might be imaginary friends who *became real* (aka [tulpas](http://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/) ). That is somehow more creepy than ghosts in my book. That link by the way goes to a sub full of people who actually want to create these things.   Yep. It was within two minutes of 6:30. I think I encountered my inner body clock or something!   Story please??   I was leaving a regular, non-lucid dream when I suddenly became lucid. I was hovering above an "overview" timeline of the next morning and saw a graphical "menu" of three "exit" times when I could wake up: Noon, 8 AM and 6:30 AM. I chose the earliest time, and, sure enough, woke up at 6:30.   Not the most exciting lucid dream ever, but I thought it was interesting enough to share.   It depends who the host is. Since they went to the rotating hosts, some are much more political than others. Basically the political spectrum on that show now spans from "Obama is evil" to "Obama is evil, but so was Bush."  Edit: If you go to Art Bell's Facebook it says "I wish my name was no longer associated with what Coast has become!" As an avid (if skeptical) fan of the show back when I was a kid, I couldn't agree more.         60 is a good number for measuring time because it has a lot of factors: 2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30 - and thus a lot of ways to divide it without remainder.  Same with 24...   No, your math is right. Paradoxes like this one form part of the philosophical argument against Actual Infinities.   After all, a de facto government agency cant serve only one small group of people.   Somewhere a DoD procurement officer is laughing...   There would be a shortage in the consumer markets before the government (especially the military) felt any real shortage. At least in the US the government controls huge energy stockpiles. My guess is these would be used to build the nuclear plants, along with strict consumer rationing. This isn't too different from the situation in WWII.   If they were working trades I would be all for it, but that's not what they're doing. They are going to McDonald's and Wal-Mart.   It's a bad idea because they aren't getting any job experience that would integrate with a high school education. They're doing jobs that someone with a 5th grade education or less could do. The fact that they're getting HS credit for this is ludicrous.   The school let him leave at lunch his jr and sr years so he could work.  Funny, that is now the hot trend in education again. Our Juniors and Seniors get three class credits for "job training" at the local fast food places and Wal-Mart. They can leave school at lunch. Needless to say this program is quite popular. Our district has even won awards for its "progressive" "apprenticeship" program. Of course it is all nonsense. Sometimes these students get fired and the employer forgets to tell the school and the kids just go home at lunch or hang out on the streets.   Things get done in a hurry when people are desperate. Almost overnight (really like five months), a whole Depression's worth of closed factories were turned into massive arms production centers for WWII. Granted, the tech of a nuclear power plant is more complicated than a bomber assembly line, but don't count civilization out just because it (always) needs a crisis to get its ass in gear.      he didnt have any Jesuits found in his basement  Might that have just been good luck on his part though? What do you make of the theory that Shakespeare was a closet Catholic?         Was it available at one point outside the US and then taken away? Or did they just never have it outside the US? Sounds stupid either way! I fail to see why businesses deliberately antagonize their customers like this.   This was seven months ago, the instant queue is still there - I think it's safe to say this idea went nowhere.   Check out info about the Ajna or Third Eye - lots of mysticism to sort through, but perhaps some useful data as well.   Me too, except my mom is more a believer in that stuff than I am!   Any sources on the more obscure items? This reminds me of the "Tales of the Weird" booklets they used to sell at supermarket checkout counters. A lot of the "tales" were misreported or just plain made up.         How do people pay for stuff there? Barter? Or do most people still live off the land?                        eh, not really - very heavy tourist traffic there in the summer. Abbie Hoffman is famous for hiding out in the 1000 islands, but he actually lived in a resort town under a fake name, not on some shack on a deserted island.   However, head north into Canadian lake country from the St. Lawrence, that's a different story. Plenty of Unabomber shack possibilities up there. Just sayin'.         Unless black holes are producing new Universes, then it is reproducing (though in a boringly asexual manner)   So a documentary on, say, the definitive fact that [a large number of sports stars are clearly extraterrestrials](http://nyc.barstoolsports.com/random-thoughts/the-definitive-athletes-who-look-like-aliens-list/) would be popular around here?     how? mini-wormholes?      You might want to try /r/AskHistorians    His great unfinished work was planned for a premiere at the base of the Himalayas. Scriabin believed it would cause an apocalyptic transformation in the nature of the universe and give rise to a race of spiritual hermaphrodites.   He also created a quartet for helicopters and an enormously long allegorical play that was supposed to represent the days of the week. One scene for "Thursday" involved a man dressed as a pencil shoved inside a giant pencil sharpener.  One weird dude. Scriabin was even stranger.   Sounds like an Indian Caligula - what was his name?         An individual doesn't need to recognise something as being an adaptive mechanism for it to indeed be such.  True, but if you *tell* him it's just an adaptive mechanism, he's likely to disagree vehemently. My point was there is a conflict between religion and science *on this level*. Other than that I think we agree.   That is correct - or they thought they were just giving the right to traverse the land or for whites to settle in the area but who would still be subject to the native chiefdom. A lot of treaty wars started with these kinds of misunderstandings.   Of course a lot of the time they were *deliberate* misunderstandings, on both sides. Tribe X would sell land that had been occupied by Tribe Y for years, and Y didn't know anything about it. The white settlers knew Tribe Y lived in the area, but they just wanted a legal fig leaf to conquer the area. All of a sudden white settlers show up and begin kicking the members of Tribe Y out of the territory.   Seriously, their last emperor had an entire city slaughtered because their king would not give him a tree that would not even survive in Tenochtitlan's climate. They took the tree and it died.  Do you have more info about this incident? Seems like the king refused to give a symbolic tribute. It seems hard to believe that the Aztec emperor really cared about a single tree if there wasn't some symbolism attached to it.   Calvinism   Predestination was always a very small minority belief within Christianity. Very few Christians were Calvinists even at its height and it has virtually died out today. Even churches that are still officially Calvinist (like Presbyterians and Dutch Reformed) do not promote the belief (sort of like modern Mormons and the whole Kolob thing...)   otherwise the human race would be full of good looking people by now. Obviously this person doesn't go to walmart very often.  Many of those people *were* reasonably good-looking in High School when they began their reproductive careers though...  All in all, saying that darwinian evolution worldview cannot align with a religious worldview demonstrates a lack of understanding of evolution and a lack of understanding of religion.  Maybe, but religion considers itself true, not just useful. There is a conflict on that level. Very few people follow a religion just because they think it is a socially convenient myth. I've only met one person like this in my entire life, and he was a very creepy and manipulative psychiatrist at a "Christian" hospital.   Social Darwinism used race as a virtual synonym for species, which it clearly is not - human races are 100% inter-fertile.   Similarly, Social Darwinism argued for a political authority that would wield a kind of "artificial selection" that could replace and "hurry up" the process of natural selection, and used dog breeding as an example.   The problem with this was dog breeding took hundreds of years on an animal with a much shorter generational cycle than humans, and actually increased the diversity of dogs - it did not lead to one breed of "Master Dog" the way many Social Darwinists wanted to (re)-create the "Master Race."  So not only was there moral horror from Scientific Darwinists against Social Darwinism, there was scientific outrage as well, since Social Darwinism was the crudest form of pseudoscience used to advance political ends.   You might want to look into the Catholic answer to this question. Catholic dogma today accepts evolution but suggests that during some point in the process of Evolution God gave the developing man and woman a soul, and this was Adam and Eve.  I personally don't believe in this, but it is an example of a belief that attempts to reconcile Darwin and the Bible.   First, the theory of evolution makes soul-body dualism hard to conceive of, which in turn poses significant problems for explaining how the afterlife is supposed to work.   I know this is picky, but orthodox Christians don't believe in soul-body dualism, they believe in a bodily resurrection on Earth, not body-less souls floating around heaven, despite the popular "folk Christian" idea that this what the afterlife is like.     	186
 Do you still need a ticket?!    I am looking for two Saturday tickets! I have Friday tickets, but I am a HUGE conner and would be super bummed to only go one day. I unfortunately lived 3000 miles away when I initially bought my ticket on a hunch I'd be back East by now...  Get me two Saturday tickets and I can throw you some swag I have leftover from my days working at Marvel. Or a carrot cake. Or some nice beer--your choice!      yes please!      he ate 4 sooooooooooooo   you can get them on Amazon, even with free shipping, in the US. My first batch of it accidentally yielded a really delicious ricotta.    I actually followed the instructions by this guy on youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWh2LS9WJIk   it was pretty delicious. It did take about an hour, but it is cost effective. I'm hoping once we've better at it that we can do it in 30 min, in which I think it's be worth the savings :)   Yeah I did! not sure if that's cheating or not but I also made a beef wellington this week and felt like being creative. they're pretty nifty to play around with  	10
    Interesting points of view.  Interesting in deed.   I remember reading Arya's story in the books and thinking, "What the hell is going on with her story?!"

Huh--I always thought it was CGI as well.   I have no problem with that game.  Since I don't know your username, give me a challenge sometime.  My username is: **stephen.nesbit**   You have inoperable cancer.   I was thinking the same thing. This brought back dial-up AOL days. Hahaha!   That's a way of looking at it, but he says DWW's name, and uses pronouns like "you".  I'd say he's talking directly.   Wind In His Hair: "Dances with Wolves! I am Wind In His Hair. Do ***you*** see that I am ***your*** friend? Can ***you*** see that ***you*** will always be my friend?"  He also ends with a question... Although it could be read as rhetorical.    At the end of the movie, Wind In His Hair is yelling to Dances With Wolves about how they are friends, and always will be.  Dances With Wolves never replies or even acknowledges his friend's words.  This always bothers me.  Why?  Was it a Lakota thing?      If my wife did this to me, I think it'd freak me out.    Boobs.   Girl graduates high school.  Girl majors in feminism.  Girl miraculously finds a job she loves.   The fact that she's lazy as hell, forcing me to clean up 90% of our family's mess.  I don't ignore it really, but I never say anything.   I like to use the fruit/vine method.  The fruit (electronic device) has to be back on the vine (charger) before bedtime, or it's taken away the next day or two. The charger is in a very public part of the house (in our case, the living room).   The songs he has are very... convincing. It's bizarre.    There's only the problem of a 3 and 4 year old who DON'T have the ability to take care of themselves.  But thanks for judging.   She'd be going to Broadmoor. I went to Istrouma Middle and Scotlandville High (for a couple years). I survived.   Last time I checked, one couldn't text, watch videos, play games, or do social media on a sheet of paper.    What WE determine what Earthly days are, not a "day" to God. Genesis is very metaphorical when it relates to time.   [Way to go ILM!](http://media0.giphy.com/media/11uArCoB4fkRcQ/giphy.gif)   Wow... bet that tasted nasty.      Yeah--that's a good idea.  Thanks!      Agreed.  I've been working part- or full-time since I was 15yo.  I had to so I could pay for my phone and car insurance.  Then it moved to helping pay for rent/bills when my parents divorced, and my mom didn't have a GREAT job.  I had to grow up quickly.   We tell her all the time to ask us if she needs help.   Which wasn't a problem when homework was done with books/paper.  Now it's on a laptop that we have no way of keeping an eye on unless we're literally sitting over her shoulder.   Wow... wish I didn't know that now...   It is a very nice school; worth the $8k+ if results are made.  We've had meetings with the teachers; she's met with the guidance counselor.  Her grades started declining around 6th grade, and have gotten progressively worse each year.  She says she realizes this.  While I was working late last night, my wife sat down and talked to her about everything for about 1 hours.  My wife said our daughter DOES care, but just doesn't let us know for some odd reason.   PM sent.   The original owner Kyoo sold it to one of the Admins: DarthBrendo.   One would think.   This is a forum that's been around since 1999.  Back then, it was known as Jedi.net.  I've been around since 2000.  We've tried to pick the site back up now that the new movies/shows/etc. are back out.  We could use some fresh blood.  There's discussion on multiple topics, role-playing, fanfic, fanart, etc.  Come on over, and let's chat about Star Wars.  My username there is: [Stephen](http://i.imgur.com/gj4Vw7K.jpg).  Come join me!      A baby doll.   Haha, I've done the "job is school" bit.  Didn't think about the rest.   How would you have afforded $8.5k ?!   We've been dating/married since the step-daughter was 10-months-old.  I've helped raise her.  Nothing major has happened lately.   I cannot STAND the laptop.   She was allowed to keep our church's children's choir as it was her last year to be able to be in it, and she's been in it since 3rd grade.  Really, by activities, it was really just the book club and sporting events.   It's frustration.  This is year #4 with the same problems getting worse and worse... no matter what we do.        We shouldn't have to go through this much crap.  Y'know?!  Get your work done, THEN fart around!  If they spent as much effort doing homework as they do trying to get around firewalls, blocks, etc., they'd be done in 30-60 mins tops.   She's my step-daughter, and her daughter, so my opinion doesn't factor as much.  When it comes to our other two kids, I'd put my foot down (assuming they are selfish and lazy like their sister).   The private school academics ARE better than the public school... if one does the work.  If one doesn't, there's no point.   She keeps finding new apps to chat with as I delete and block others.   That's how I think as well... my wife believes otherwise.   I tried some of those, her school IT said I had to take them off because it was affecting her work while on the school's server/firewall.  They also use YouTube and whatnot for school.    Has she always been a lazy kid - who doesn't see any reason to put in more than minimal effort?  Yes.   Are you (as parents) or her siblings high acheivers? Is there pressure to be an achiever? is she rebelling against pressure or expectations that either she doesn't want or feels she can't meet?  We just expect her to do her work, and show actual effort in her studies.  That is lacking.   Have you had her tested for a learning disability? Do you see times when she is absolutely able to do well if she applies herself?  She was tested for ADD/ADHD, and the test shown borderline minimal results.  Those times are few and far between.   Is her personality counter to school culture - is she a free spirited, creative kid who doesn't like too much structure or being put in a box? Is she more hands on ?  She is very hands-on.   What are her talents, hobbies, interests? When do you see her really engage in something? What does she enjoy? Where does she put effort?  She doesn't really have any REAL hobbies that she gets truly engaged into... unless texting/video-chatting on her friggin' phone is considered a hobby.   Does she see any connection between school and her life? Any ideas what she wants to do after high school? Any older kids who she knows that have gone on to college?  She says she does. Says she wants to go to college. Apparently is now interested in photography (since she shows no signs of taking photos).  She has an older cousin attending LSU right now.   Is she engaged at school outside of academics? Strong circle of friends? gets along with teachers? Involved in clubs, sports, teams or other school related extracurriculars?  She has had her extracurricular activities taken away as punishment for grades.  She has only one REAL friend...   How is she mood wise? Lots of teen angst? Any signs of depression? Does she want to e Goth or emo or non mainstream in her self-expression?  Aside from treating me like a stereotypical step-daughter treats her step-father; no.   Her cell phone is on our company's plan, paid for by us.  Clothes are paid for by us.  Entertainment (which doesn't happen very often) is sometimes her and sometimes us.   The teachers were willing to help a lot in her 6th-8th grade levels.  Now, everything is on her school-provided distraction (i.e., required laptop).  While she's "doing her homework" (i.e., watching YouTube, chatting with friends, etc.), we assume she's doing her homework.  Her teachers view the students as being to be responsible by this age (which they should), and will sort of help with large assignments if asked, but not day-to-day homework.   Gold?  Who do you think I am?  Letterman?      That's not what I meant exactly.  She can be lazy and lie about doing homework and whatnot for free at a public school instead of paying $800+ a month for the same end-effect.   Scenario: 15yo daughter just completed her freshman year at a private, Catholic school costing $8k a year.  Showed little to no initiative in schoolwork, constantly got zeroes on homework, poor grades on tests, let to failing one class and barely getting C's and D's in others.  Tuition is going up to $8.5k next year, and I argue for taking her out of the school since it's practically a waste of money.   My wife argues to keep her in because it's a better education than the public schools in East Baton Rouge (Louisiana) Parish.  I counter-argue that it's not a better education if she's not getting anything from it anyway because she simply doesn't care, and constantly complains about how hard it is.  ___________________ What is the better solution?  HELP! ___________________ *Edit: Thanks for all the comments.  This is an issue we've been struggling with for a few years.  Any time we try to determine why, all we get is either, "I don't know," or, "It's just how I am."*  1. /u/SteveHarveysSuit -- I'm not sure we know exactly what she'd want.  She's all about social, so I'd be willing to bet she'd pick staying just to not have to make friends all over again.  2.  /u/NovelTeach and /u/dmf95742 -- She makes no money to pay for anything.  That would require a job.  We tried the F = -$10; D = -$5; C = $0; B = +$5; and A = +$10 for report cards, but when the negatives outweigh the positives, it became pointless.  3. /u/flakemasterflake -- She doesn't seem to care about peer pressure... at least academically.   It sounds like you rushed into RCIA before you were ready. I was raised Assemblies of God.  I attended Catholic mass for two years before going through RCIA.    I spoke to many Catholics about many things. You need to find a few solid Catholics, and just talk with them a while.  We all go through it.  I too struggled with masturbation. Not so much a problem now that I'm married. Hehe.  That one is tough.  I'd suggest /r/NoFap for support on that one.  Talk to priest or deacon you trust. Get counseling sessions set up.  I'm sure they'd work with you.  Side-Note: I believe that homosexuality itself is not a sin. Acting on the sexual urges, and therefore committing fornication/adultery, is the sin.   Purely coincidental, I think.   Fourty-two.   Holy crap--I can't believe that works!  HAHAHAHA!   Hahaha!  This happened to me with our first-born.  So nasty!   Sounds like Obama...  "Didn't get the vote I want; I'll just executive order it through anyway.  Screw y'all!"   What the hell is this?  This is a martial art?  Walking in a circle while touching and holding hands?      That's a nice... ***stalagshite***.      WTF did I just watch...?  "The nipples, the nipples, the nipples... hee-hee!"  Les Franais sont bizarres.   Oh, my God--my mom had this too!  I spent 45 minutes uninstalling a crap-ton of these damn things.  "I never installed any of those.  I think my laptop is hacked."  I kept thinking, "Why would anyone hack a 58yo woman's damn laptop?  Seriously?  You just blindly install any 2nd/3rd-tier programs on the ones you install, and end up with toolbars and malware galore!"  ____________________ I wish Windows had a mass uninstaller where one could select more than one at a time, and then it would just do it back-to-back instead of one at a time.

Someone making $30k a year might spend $200-$300 month on food.  9% tax on that is only $27.  They might buy a $5k used car.  9% tax on that is $450.  Someone making $100k a year might spend $1200 a month on food.  9% tax on that is $108.  They might buy an $85k new car.  9% tax on that is $7,650!  tl;dr :: Rich people buy more (and more expensive) things than poor people.  It's fair.  ________________ I find it funny how progressives always talk about equality across the board... until it comes to rich people and their money... hehehe...   I don't know why.  You can see the cock-blocker protecting him from the cock.   What a massively useless buildup.  LOL!  I love it!   Excluding Tom Benson, it's not like Louisiana has a ton of rich people to tax.

    I've got to agree with you.  The dude who got shot was aggressively pushing the door open against the officer.  His behavior looks pretty clearly threatening to me.    That's up to the grand jury and eventually regular jury that will presumably hear this case.  He said without a trace of irony.          But he still keeps that 2% carry, amirite?             And the need for CEOs that can make good decisions is very fucking high while the supply of good CEOs that can make good decisions is very very low. It's always simple supply and demand.  [High paid CEOs perform poorly](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/319221-report-high-paid-ceos-performing-poorly ).  Just like this guy did.  A better explanation for these exorbitant pay rates is that [the incentives are misaligned](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/great-men-great-pay-why-ceo-compensation-is-sky-high/2014/06/12/6e49d796-d227-11e3-9e25-188ebe1fa93b_story.html ).  Specifically, the people who set the pay of CEOs are themselves CEOs, very often people who sit on each others' boards.  Even in the case where the mutual benefit isn't this direct, CEOs have a strong incentive to set high pay rates to drive up the market for CEO pay.  There's are strong incentives for back scratching.   Drive down the central valley and you'll see two kinds of signs: for Republican candidates and complaints that the government is not doing enough about the drought.  The irony.   Oblivion was a really solid scifi film, IMO - great script, great acting, and concept - but why didn't it succeed?  I'd put it in a category I'd call 'concept scifi'. Cypher,  Existenz, and Enders Game are good examples I'd put in this category.  Less successful examples (IMO) are Dark City  and Primer.  All of these films (the great and the not so great) have plots which  on a reveal which comes toward the end.  They're reminiscent of  Twilight Zone or Outer Limits or some classic Star Trek episodes.  The viewer is suspended in a state of confusion about what is happening until the conclusion, which if it's done right, can be mind-bending.  One might think a film like Edge of Tomorrow would qualify, but there's not actually a sudden reveal --- the "trick" of the world the protagonist inhabits is obvious from the earliest scenes, and his progress to understanding the solution is a gradual process that involves a clear goal.  The concept-scifi films I mention lead you along a path and suddenly change the terms with the reveal.  I have no idea why EoT didn't do much much better than it did --- it should have, IMO.  Maybe it didn't have enough emotional touch points, which the public seems to crave.  Chalk that up as another reason we can't have nice things.  I suspect that concept scifi has an even worse problem, however --- the world it presents is a false one, and it holds the viewer in that falsehood for a large part of the duration of the film.  The result is a kind of alienation of the viewer from the world thats presented.  The film maker is basically on the hook for presenting an uncomfortable world in which something is "off".  I suspect that for a lot of viewers instead of that being intriguing, they experience dissatisfaction, an unease which isn't resolved by the puzzle pieces coming together at the end of the film.  It's a shame.  I love these kinds of films, and wish there were more of them.     in that it had an austere, alienated quality to it.  I loved it, and wish there would be more like this.  Honestly, I can't for the life of me figure out why EoT didn't do better.  But there it is.        Bernie is terrific on the issues, serious, no bullshit, and could show that uncomplicated left wing politics is the key to winning back the white working class.  Bernie would have to defend socialism, of course, but I think he'd do it expertly, and wingnut heads would explode when they found people (a) didn't care about the label and (b) agreed with his policy positions.  That would go a long way to puncturing the red-baiting right wing bullshit we've had to listen to these past 40 years.   Reagan fooled gullible Americans into cheering for trickle down economics. Truly and honestly, I don't see anything to praise about that.  Con men, after all, are charismatic.  We don't need a con man of the left.  We need someone who speaks truth and fights for what counts.  The right has never given us a leader like that.  They had to invent a fiction around Reagan.  Let's not play into their rhetoric by offering that criminal actor our praise.         I hear what you're saying, but for me it was obvious what Reagan was from day one.  And honestly, he was *hated* as evidenced by his terrible approval ratings.  After his death, the Republican propaganda machine kicked in to rehabilitate his reputation.  Let's not play into that fabricated meme.  Reagan was a lying and hated ideologue of the right who brought us the war on drugs, trickle down economics and had the most scandals of any President, with more officials in his government indicted or convicted than anyone else.  That's the only story that needs to play regarding him.   Let's put it this way: We need an FDR.  Fuck Reagan and the poisonous horde that worships him.      TheWeek.com is a filtered domain?

[Optimal Tip-to-Tip Efficiency](http://www.scribd.com/doc/228831637/Optimal-Tip-to-Tip-Efficiency )  A probabilistic model is introduced for the problem of stimulating a large male audience.  Double jerking is considered, in which two shafts may be stimulated with a single hand. Both tip-to-tip and shaft-to-shaft configurations of audience members are analyzed. We demonstrate that pre-sorting members of the audience according to both shaft girth and leg length allows for more efficient stimulation. Simulations establish steady rates of stimulation even as the variance of certain parameters is allowed to grow, whereas naive unsorted schemes have increasingly flaccid performance.   Definitely a click-baity title, but there's substance towards the end:   [Bitcoin miners] are stuck... in a catch-22: they can't afford to keep mining, but they can't afford to stop mining, either. (This, coincidentally, is the same dilemma that oil drillers who borrowed a lot during the boom face now during the bust). This has already forced one big mining group into default. And it's forced the rest to sell the only assets they haveBitcoinsto pay back their dollar debts. That, of course, only pushes the price of Bitcoin down even further, which makes even more miners sell their Bitcoins to pay back they owe as mining becomes more unprofitable. And so on, and so on.   Bitcoin, in other words, is suffering a deleveraging shock like the one that hit our economy in 2008, but without a Federal Reserve to cushion the blow. That means this doom loop of debt and Bitcoin deflation could take prices down a lot further still. The only solace is that, in the long run, the system should self-correct, as miners drop out and mining gets easier.    Alternatively, [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2015/01/14/bitcoin-is-revealed-a-ponzi-scheme-for-redistributing-wealth-from-one-libertarian-to-another/ ).                        I'm becoming convinced she's not running.  It's too bad.   Also watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f519_LGjhCA   I thought we "need to look forward, not back", or does that only apply to war criminals?   It was a huge disappointment to see both of them take the position that they did.     Look at their histories.  Obama had literally no track record *at all* of fighting for progressive policy.  At Harvard Law, he was known for intermediating between two sides.  At Kerry's nominating convention he gave a famous speech "One America, not two Americas", which advocated centrism and bipartisanship.  During the primaries he praised Reagan, supported  immunity of the telecom companies which participated in domestic spying programs, supported conserva-Dem Joe Lieberman over the excellent progressive Joe Lamont.    Obama even said that supporters were misconstruing him as a progressive.  He made a point of saying that "there are extremes on both sides" that are not helpful.   The man made it as clear as day that he was a centrist.  Voters were not paying attention.    Warren has had a *long* track record of fighting for the middle class.  She first came to public notice when, as a professor at Harvard, she gave a talk called ["The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A ).   It's worth watch in full.  Since then, Warren identified a part of the problem as the lack of accountability of the big banks, which allowed them to privatize their gambling risks and socialize their losses.  She pushed for a new Federal agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which makes regulations preventing financial institutions from cheating consumers.  Republicans prevented her from becoming head of the agency, but she won that major victory.  That agency is estimated to have saved consumers some billions of dollars in excessive charges (too lazy to provide a link, but easily googleable).  She has been extremely sharp-tongued in calling out Republicans.  She has not said "both sides are the problem".  She has even called out Obama and his centrist nominees, recently scuttling Wall Street stooge Antonio Weiss.  She's fought for cheaper loans for students ("If banks get .75%, why can't students get that too?").  Just do a bit of research on her.    The woman is a progressive firebrand that Obama never was and never said he was.            So many fucking racists on Reddit now.  It makes me want to leave.  Fuck these mainstream Americans or whatever the fuck they are.   Jesus, that isn't obvious?  Now we know for near certain that he's a criminal sociopath, and most likely walked from a murder conviction because the victim was black.   Big f'ing difference.  Warren has a track record of actually fighting for economic populist issues.  Obama has a track record of triangulation and bipartisanship.  From his very earliest days he praised Reagan, talked about "One America, not two" bullshit, supported Joe Lieberman over progressive Ned Lamont, supported immunity of telecoms from prosecution, etc.  Obama made it clear pretty early that he saw it as his role to bring left and right together, not fight for progressive goals.    edit: I guess people do, it is dumb though  Why?  It's a pretty standard political phrase for identifying a faction in a political party by their ostensible leader.    E.g., "The Ted Cruz wing of the Republican party". http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2014/12/30/washpost-conservatives-slam-ted-cruz-wing-gop-too-much-clarity  And it's pretty much undisputed that Warren is seen as the leader of the progressives.

Wingnuts tell them that they are disenfranchised because of social programs.  Until we have Democrats who tell the other side of the story, we'll never make big wins.      **Submission Statement**  A more nuanced look at the issues, delving into the backgrounds of the attackers, the role of the Iraq war (the attackers were radicalized by it, but Charlie Hebdo argued against it), and the hypocrisy of double standards:    Under French law, the magazine could run cartoons mocking Islam, but it could not run cartoons mocking the Holocaust. In fact, in 2009, Charlie Hebdo fired Maurice Sinet (known as Sin), one of its most famous cartoonists, because of a column in which he suggested that Nicolas Sarkozys son would go a long way in life after marrying a Jewish heiress. But murdering cartoonists will not put a stop to double standards.        I don't think anyone should be surprised that when it comes to opinions on the middle east, Al Jazeera is not your best source.  Evidence?   How does this article show that Al Jazeera is biased?   Oh great, the main right wing organ in the most far right country on Earth slices and dices the text from the emails for maximum Hasbara, and it gets voted to the top in Reddit.  Please read the actual emails.   Defending freedom of expression in the face of oppression is one thing; insisting on the right to be obnoxious and offensive just because you can is infantile, Khadr wrote. Baiting extremists isnt bravely defiant when your manner of doing so is more significant in offending millions of moderate people as well. And within a climate where violent response  however illegitimate  is a real risk, taking a goading stand on a principle virtually no one contests is worse than pointless: its pointlessly all about you.   And I guess if you encourage people to go on insulting 1.5 billion people about their most sacred icons then you just want more killings because as I said in 1.5 billion **there will remain some fools who dont abide by the laws or know about free speech** [sic].   What Charlie Hebdo did was not free speech it was an abuse of free speech in my opinion, go back to the cartoons and have a look at them! Salem later wrote. It snot [sic] about what the drawing said, it was about how they said it. **I condemn those heinous killings, but IM NOT CHARLIE.**  And lets remember that Al Jazeera has been repeatedly targeted by the US military and the Israeli IDF in attacks which killed their reporters.  Not a peep from the "free speech solidarity" crowd on that.  In fact, just this past year, the same French politicians organizing the Hebdo free speech rally suppressed a pro-Palestinian march during Israel's recent bombing of Gaza.  The hypocrisy is ripe.  Of course Al Jazeera journalists are going to be a bit peeved.   Well that certainly has a familiar ring to it.      That last link - holy shit.  I'd like to hear Sam Harris talk about why Islam is objectively "more evil" in that context.    Greenwald is rarely worth reading and this is not one of those rare occasions.   YSK, leading off with an ad hominem attack against a journalist who broke the biggest story of the past year is not exactly a winning rhetorical strategy.    To imply that publishing the cartoons means automatically embracing their content is nonsense. They are integral to the story, just like at the time of the Danish cartoon incident, as a reader I wanted to see the pictures to understand what angered people so much about them.  He said nothing of the kind.  He's talking about people who are advocating publishing the offensive cartoons *in solidarity*.  And, yes, that is a thing, in case you haven't noticed.  http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/07/media/charlie-hebdo-attack-journalists-solidarity/  https://www.change.org/p/editors-and-journalists-around-the-world-publish-charlie-hebdo-s-mohammed-cartoons-in-solidarity-with-the-victims-of-censorship-and-violence   Greenwald is attacking a strawman here, sure a few people said we have to celebrate the cartoons,  Simply incorrect, CNN and many other outlets have noted (above).    And even it were true, the people that Greenwald specifically mentions are not some fringe voices.  They are major figures of American political discourse.  By your standard we should mock anyone who responds to an idea presented in a NYTimes OpEd because it's "just a few voices".     How about not portraying one extreme as the public consensus and and entirely ignoring the rest of the spectrum?   I don't understand what you're getting at.  Could you clarify?    Claiming you support freedom of expression and show solidarity and at the same time deciding not to publish the full story because it might offend part of your audience sounds empty at best.   You've either completely missed Greenwald's point or are purposefully mischaracterizing what he said.  He's talking about people publishing the offensive work *in solidarity*.   And his larger point is how utterly biased is this free speech solidarity.  Please let me know why there no outpouring of solidarity to republish Palestinian journalists when Israel killed 17 journalists just last year, an IDF officer even defending the attacks in the NYTimes saying:   Such terrorists, who hold cameras and notebooks in their hands, are no different from their colleagues who fire rockets aimed at Israeli cities and cannot enjoy the rights and protection afforded to legitimate journalists.  Or when the US purposefully bombed Al Jazeera buildings, killing reporters.  Not a peep from the guardians of vaunted Western Values on that one.   And let's not get into that marginalized minority bullshit,  See above.    Implying this feeds into France's alleged foreign policy goals and attacking Harris - which is Greenwald's way of masturbating - who wrote an entire book against Christianity, didn't support the Iraq war  Sam Harris has stated that Islam is intrinsically worse than all other religions.  Ignoring history - two decades ago, ex-Hindu atheists committed the most terrorist attacks of anyone, and during the Islamic golden age, it was Islam that preserved the legacy of rational thought while western Europe was wallowing in its Inquisition.  Yeh, Sam Harris deserves zero respect at this point.  On the other point.  Try a bit of [research](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=+france+iraq).  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/france-iraq/     Honestly, I think Sam Harris had it coming.  His argument is myopic and ahistoric in the extreme. Hitchens had a much better and more nuanced criticism of modern Islam and its problem with free speech, which I tend to agree with.   Huh?  Are you saying Greenwald is  advocating *banning* something?  That is completely backwards --- he's a passionate free speech advocate.  And I'm certainly not advocating that either.  The question was whether *ignoring* is the "adult" thing to do --- see the comment I'm responding to.     He does not use the word 'racist' or 'racism' a single time in that article.      Speaking as an atheist who tilts toward anti-theism, I'd say that there's more to the issue than that.    It's worth reading Greenwald's commentary of the week's events  in full [here] (https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2015/01/09/solidarity-charlie-hebdo-cartoons/ ).   This weeks defense of free speech rights was so spirited that it gave rise to a brand new principle: to defend free speech, one not only defends the right to disseminate the speech, but embraces the content of the speech itself. Numerous writers thus demanded: to show solidarity with the murdered cartoonists, one should not merely condemn the attacks and defend the right of the cartoonists to publish, but should publish and even celebrate those cartoons. The best response to Charlie Hebdo attack, announced Slates editor Jacob Weisberg, is to escalate blasphemous satire.   Some of the cartoons published by Charlie Hebdo were not just offensive but bigoted, such as the one mocking the African sex slaves of Boko Haram as welfare queens. Others went far beyond maligning violence by extremists acting in the name of Islam, or even merely depicting Mohammed with degrading imagery, and instead contained a stream of mockery toward Muslims generally, who in France are not remotely powerful but are largely a marginalized and targeted immigrant population.  Is it right to simply ignore hate speech directed at marginalized minority populations?  I'm not so sure that just ignoring it is the adult thing to do.     it is simply not the case that Charlie Hebdo were equal opportunity offenders. Like Bill Maher, Sam Harris and other anti-Islam obsessives, mocking Judaism, Jews and/or Israel is something they will rarely (if ever) do. ... The vast bulk of their attacks are reserved for Islam and Muslims, not Judaism and Jews. Parody, free speech and secular atheism are the pretexts; anti-Muslim messaging is the primary goal and the outcome. And this messaging  this special affection for offensive anti-Islam speech  just so happens to coincide with, to feed, the militaristic foreign policy agenda of their governments and culture.        Did you read the article or any of the actual statements made in the Al Jazeera emails?     And I guess if you encourage people to go on insulting 1.5 billion people about their most sacred icons then you just want more killings because as I said in 1.5 billion there will remain some fools who dont abide by the laws or know about free speech, he wrote.   I condemn those heinous killing, but IM NOT CHARLIE, he wrote.  How is that a dissent based on irrational beliefs?  It's also worth noting that we've seen no such outpourings of support when Israel defended its killings of 17 Palestinian journalists this past year. An Op-Ed to the NYTimes from an IDF officer read:   Such terrorists, who hold cameras and notebooks in their hands, are no different from their colleagues who fire rockets aimed at Israeli cities and cannot enjoy the rights and protection afforded to legitimate journalists.  Is this culture worthy of respect?  Or is the United States worthy of respect it deliberately targeted and killed Al Jazeera journalists?  Where was the outpouring of support for the vaunted Western values of free speech back then?  I think it's pretty reasonable for Al Jazeera journalists to be a bit disgusted by Western hypocrisy on this issue.   TIL Muslim is the new Communist.   That's up to Democrats.   I can't disagree with the spirit of this -- which is to say we need strong progressive leader*s* (not just one leader), but if you mean to defend Obama as "powerless", I have to disagree.  He has the power of appointment and serves as the de facto leader of the Democrats, and his choices have been abysmal.        The lesson of Obama was that we need leaders who have strong track records of fighting for progressive goals.  If the left in the US hasn't learn that lesson, they'll guarantee their irrelevancy ... and deserve it.                  Thanks, I'll check those out.  The book I had trouble with was actually Gravity's Rainbow, not CL49.   I apologize.  It's been many years -- I realize now that it was Gravity's Rainbow, not Crying of Lot 49.  It wasn't boredom so much as confusion.  I literally had trouble understanding what was going on or why I should pay attention to it.   I'd go through a few paragraphs and feel like "what did I just read"?       Thank you so much for that.  It's funny that this reminds me of how I describe Bergman's work to people who find it abstruse or pretentious.  In these situations the viewer/reader is trying too hard to read meaning into what is happening instead of experiencing the art on a moment-by-moment basis, similar to how we appreciate music.    That is very helpful.  I'm going to try again.  Edit: Here's a link to some of my thoughts on Bergman from a long-ago reddit thread. http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueFilm/comments/1fau0u/what_do_you_think_of_ingmar_bergman/ca8po7n      Slightly off-topic: I never got into Pynchon.  I tried like 5 times to get into ~~Crying of Lot 49~~ Gravity's Rainbow, but could never get past page 50.  Any suggestions?   [Vladimir Putin, Conservative Icon](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/vladimir-putin-conservative-icon/282572/ )   So many unsupported assertions.  What is the point.   A classic political move - get someone who protects your flank and articulates your position to the other side.    That is an incredibly grim and depressing outlook... which is of course the right attitude when analyzing American politics.  On the other hand, she's incredibly smart, and probably quite well informed on the basic issues.  All of the top candidates prep for these debates, and she'll have the best advisors to bring her up to speed on details. It's also possible that she'll have an economic analysis of what's happening at the global level -- who wants what and why.   In any case, I doubt this is going to be an issue in the primaries.  In the general election, she'll inoculate herself by choosing an appropriate running mate who fills out the resume.  E.g., Wesley Clark, or ... here's a crazy, not-so-crazy idea - Colin Powell.  And on the other other hand, this TNR piece argues that the fact that she's said so little is a strong indication that she's not running: http://www.newrepublic.com/article/119965/elizabeth-warrens-foreign-policy-positions-are-mystery.   George W. Bush had foreign policy experience?  Or Obama?  Or Bill Clinton?         But, by using the present tense (even when prompted), she's explicitly leaving the door open.  I hope she runs.        We have all the transcripts, evidence, instructions, and testimony.  And they point to a pattern of a prosecutor who biased the proceedings in favor of the officer.  This prosecutor also made the *highly* unusual move of calling a press conference in which he essentially argued for the defense.  Numerous commentators have discussed the questionable behavior of the prosecutor in this case.  As Jeffery Toobin (who holds rather right wing views on civil liberties issues) noted, ["reserving this kind of special treatment for white police officers charged with killing black suspects cannot be an appropriate resolution."](http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/use-grand-jury ).   More importantly, this would give everyone else in any other grand jury freedom to voice whatever they want. Names, places, documents, etc. Who cares? Why are they being forced to secrecy in a grand jury when others aren't?  No - the unusual circumstances of this case, not least of which involve the strange behavior of the prosecutor suggest that the public interest is served in this case, and this exception is in fact provided for by  law.  This is made all the more urgent by the fact that [this prosecutor has a history of misleading grand juries](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marjorie-cohn/prosecutor-manipulates-grand-jury-to-shield-officer_b_6240578.html ).   I googled your percentages and can't find support for them.  99.99% of the time, grand juries indict: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/24/the-single-chart-that-shows-that-grand-juries-indict-99-99-percent-of-the-time/  Police are indicted between 1% and 3% of the time, according to this Politifact estimate:  http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/25/benjamin-crump/lawyer-ferguson-case-99-time-police-not-charged-de/  Actually, it's a known Wilson supporter who is suspected of lying, and McCulloch put her on the stand knowing she was likely lying: http://www.aol.com/article/2014/12/16/new-information-reveals-witness-40-may-have-lied-during-her-gr/21117109/    Its because no matter the circumstances, prosecutors will take a cop through the grand jury for every shooting.  I am not aware of that.  Do you have evidence of this?   And since you lack a valid argument, you decided to just wave your waves and call the person that was politely discussing with you "anti-American".  1. As detailed above, I think my argument is quite valid.    2. You weren't just "politely" discussing the issue, having accused the people on the other side of having a "bullshit political agenda".  3. I think you need to go back and re-read what I wrote.  I qualified my statement with an *if*.  You could easily answer "I do think this should be investigated, but lifting grand jury secrecy isn't the right way to do it".   The history is written.  It was a war crime.   The great majority of Iraqis who died in the war were not innocents and were fighting on the wrong side.  LOL.    And George Bush made a secret pact with Hitler and Aliens before he invaded.  No proof needed by these debate standards, amirite?   Are you sure it's not the prosecutor who has a bullshit political agenda?  I think we need some light on why grand jury cases decide to indict 99% of the time except when the defendant is a cop, in which case the percentage drops to 1.3%.  The other thing that changes is the way prosecutors present evidence.    If you think it's bullshit that we shine some light on this process, you are fundamentally anti-America.   First, I see you didn't answer the question:  What did Iraqis do that justified a US invasion of their sovereign territory?  Second, that 100K+ body count refers to Iraqi *civilians*.    Why are *schools* involved in the first place...    (i.e., Virginia is breaking from common practice.)   Interesting, I did not know that.  Nonetheless, the politics are deeply conservative, whether it's Ds or Rs, wouldn't you agree?   Not quite.  [This](http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-underfunded-pension-plans-states ) Bloomberg dataset claims the worst funded states are:  1. Illinois (D) 2. Kentucky (R) 3.

We send Americans over to risk their lives killing people who kill innocent people  I think you've got it backwards.   100,000 Iraqis did what to us?            He didn't make it "open" - in fact, [one of the jurors is suing the prosecutor](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/grand-juror-sues-ferguson-prosecutor-over-darren-wilson-moratorium-20150105 ) to be allowed to reveal what actually did happen.    "Grand Juror Doe" is asking that they be allowed to speak about the grand jury case since McCulloch has presented a "not entirely accurate" portrait of the proceedings to the media, Mediate reports.      Nice argument: "She likes the police, must be a fascist"  Interesting that you resort to lying.    You didn't say you "like police".  You said  that it's "immoral to criticize" them (your exact words), even when their behavior is violent and unconstitutional.   That is the *essence* of fascism.      I can say the same thing about you and how you support anarchism  No you can't.  The anarchist position is that there should be no authority.  No one here is arguing that.  They're arguing for the police to behave in accord with the fucking Constitution.           Let me put it simply.  Zed makes a career of being an asshole.  He may have a point about how K RC needs updating, but he purposefully does it in the most obnoxious way possible, then *whines* when people call him out for it.  Fuck this guy.   Oh.  Well, that doesn't make you anti-gay, but I'd throw a whole lot of findings from biology at you to show you it's natural.   I'm sorry, I still don't understand what is meant by "don't think homosexuality is a right".  The plain interpretation is that you think we should outlaw gay behavior.   If you're trying to draw an equivalence between people who want to ban private consensual behavior and people who protest police brutality, you don't have an argument, I'm afraid.  The former *is* a form of bigotry.  People don't have a choice about being gay, as many scientific studies have demonstrated.  On the other hand, cops not only have a choice not to be brutal, they are also required to follow the constitution.  You're comparing apples and oranges.  Anti-gay is bigotry.      ... if I don't think homosexuality is a right  Huh?  So people shouldn't be allowed to be homosexual?  That sounds pretty homophobic to me. Just a wee bit different from complaining about systemic police brutality.  People aren't protesting the existence of cops, after all, just their unconsitutional and racist behavior.      Yes I do believe it's immoral to criticize the police.   An idea that is at odds with a free society, but [consistent with fascism](http://www.rense.com/general37/char.htm ):   12) Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.       Blacks are much more likely to be stopped and searched for drugs, [but are over 30% less likely to have drugs than whites](http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/stop-and-frisk-not-just-american-problem ).  That's racism.   Some studies say [camelcase  snakecase](http://www.cs.loyola.edu/~binkley/papers/icpc09-clouds.pdf ), others say [snakecase  camelcase](http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf ).  Hmmmmm.   Fuck Zed Shaw and his crybaby antics.  I stopped paying attention to him after [the nonsense he wrote about Rails](http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/ruby/rails/is-a-ghetto ).    Unfortunately, I didn't realize this was from ZS so I ended up reading it.  The guy basically flames K RC for writing a book back meant to explain how C works, back in the 70s, that doesn't take into account what was learned since the 70s.  Then he starts crying about people attacking him.  What a fucking asshole.   Yep, and to boot, property rights don't exist without that particular kind of socialism.  Take that for a spin next time you're debating with wingnuts.       Bold claim.  Source?  Police overwhelmingly target minorities in stop and frisk searches.  Well established fact.  Google it.   You are wrong - these programs  have been shown to reduce crime in low income neighborhoods.  http://www.afterschoolalliance.org/issue_briefs/issue_CrimeIB_27.pdf       hug and lollipops?  How about programs that have been shown to be wildly effective?  After school sports, summer jobs internships, etc.   So let me get this straight, you're arguing it's immoral to criticize the police?  You really missed your calling... as a spokesperson for the Stasi.                 Regarding bipartisanship, many were sick of the divisiveness of the Bush presidency and wishing for a more unilaterally amenable figurehead who could serve as a unifying figure.  I'm arguing that this thinking *is* the problem.  Until the Left develops an appetite for fighting, it is doomed to fail.    Does the President really have the power anymore to direct the country toward progressivism, or to fight against the establishment for the concerns of his base? I'm skeptical...  This kind of defeatism is simply maddening.  Modern Democrats seem to have become expert at excuse making for why nothing can be done, an attitude which guarantees the prophecy.  By this logic, FDR could never have existed - or perhaps should never exist in the future.  If this is the case, why bother at all?  This kind of reasoning is tantamount to saying -- "let the masters choose".  But obviously, no one actually believes this.  The argument of the [weak, helpless, impotent  Presidency](http://www.salon.com/2010/06/21/obama_137/ ) is one that is constantly trotted out by centrists to move debate to the right. Somehow, though, that never seems to apply to Republicans.  The reason billions are spent on Presidential elections is that there is real power there: the power to appoint, the power to raise funds, and the power of setting a message.  On all of these things, Obama has largely used his power to serve elites.  Sorry, but to make excuses for this is to be part of the problem.    I'd vote for a thousand Obamas before I'd give up and go for Nixon.  So you are saying, in effect, that you'd vote a thousand times for [someone whose policies are to the right of Nixon](http://www.alternet.org/newsandviews/article/641730/if_nixon_were_alive_today,_he_would_be_far_too_liberal_to_get_even_the_democratic_nomination ).  What is sad about today's left in the US is that they lack the historical context to understand how far they've allowed our politics to drift to the right.  For example, look at Nixon's record:  * He implemented the first significant federal affirmative action program.  * He dramatically increased spending on federal employee salaries.  * He oversaw the first large-scale integration of public schools in the South (something the crackers where I grew up were none too happy about).  * He proposed a guaranteed annual wage (aka a negative income tax).  * He advocated comprehensive national health insurance (single payer) for all Americans.  * He imposed wage and price controls in times of economic crisis. This wasnt a terribly good idea, but it was the furthest thing from a conservative idea. Truth is, it was positively socialist.  * He indexed Social Security for inflation and created Supplemental Security Income.  * He created the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the Office of Minority Business Enterprise.  * He promoted the Legacy of Parks program.  * He appointed four Supreme Court Justices. Three of them voted with the majority in Roe v. Wade.  He didn't shield criminal bankers and torturers from prosecution, like Obama did.  He didn't push austerity policies, as Obama did.  He promoted universal care, instead of scuttling it secretly as Obama did.  He expanded Social Security, while Obama put together his famous [cat food commission](http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2010/08/obamas-cat-food-committee-alan-greenspan-and-dancing-grannies-medicare ).  Progressives really need to wake up and stop reflexively defending establishment figureheads.  Kneejerk partisanship hurts us.   I think you're wrong about what the country was ready for.  Time magazine ran a cover portraying him as [the second coming of FDR](http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/2008/1101081124_400.jpg ).  A generation of new voters believed the message of Hope and Change and wanted to see a vigorous articulation of liberal policies.  Instead, we got Obama whose conservatism has dragged the Overton window far to the right on issues of torture and elite accountability.  His genius as a right wing leader is to have gotten much of the "Left", if one can call it that here in the US, to defend policies of bailing out financial institutions and giant corporations, failing to prosecute torturers and corporate criminals, vastly increased domestic surveillance combined with executive secrecy, a war on whistleblowers, and an absurd commitment to austerity economics at precisely the time all mainstream economists said we should do the opposite.    Arguably, Obama has done more to unify our political discourse over far-right wing values than Reagan, his hero.  The result, predictably, has been an opportunity squandered --- a generation disgusted with both parties, and Democratic partisans who are now espousing policies far to the right of Nixon.  But to discuss that as a squandering of opportunity is fundamentally misconstrue what happened - rather, we should say he seized it, because he is, and should be regarded as, a right wing hero, who followed in the footsteps of Reagan.  All that said, I very much agree with much of the rest of your comment. Let's run someone who has a long track record of actually fighting for regular people.      Elizabeth Warren is right of Obama.   Pure Hogwash.   She's a Israeli loving a former Republican.  Paid for politician like them all. Only Sanders has been consistent for 30 years+.  You must have missed [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/in-the-loop/wp/2014/08/20/answering-question-on-israel-bernie-sanders-tells-townhall-hecklers-to-shut-up/ ).   Quite right - the reliable partisan voter makes one thing clear: he can be ignored without any consequences.   E.g., Israel.   Until progressives learn to nominate fighters they are doomed to lose.   You are right to ask me for that source, but I cannot provide it.  I distinctly remember posting it here on Reddit back in the primaries, and discussing it extensively. I have tried, in vain, to find it.   Agree that there's a difference, but Obama is not by any stretch *moderate*.  He is a right wing conservative.  He's [to the right of Nixon](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/obama-is-a-republican/ ) on any number of issues, and [it's arguable that he's to the right of Reagan](http://my.firedoglake.com/cenkuygur/tag/ronald-reagan/ ).     Mmm... nothing makes conspiracy theories better than spelling mistakes.   I am convinced!   Share your frustration with Ds, but you should read this: [Differences between the Democratic Party and the Republican Party](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/2pwhvt/the_differences_between_the_democratic_party_and/ )   I hope she does too, but Sanders is excellent.   I am talking about the primaries.   That is really great.  I have a lot of faith in Sanders.  He has a long career of being an unabashed fighter for regular people.  I've sent money several times.  I'm still waiting to see whether Warren will throw her hat in, simply for the reason that her messaging is sharper.  But either of them at the top of the ticket would be a great thing for the country.   I don't know what to tell you --- politicians are adept at telling people what they want to hear.   But his speech at Kerry's nominating was the first clue for me.  It argued, in essence, for bipartisanship, precisely the wrong idea in the face of growing radicalism on the right -- yet so many on the left foolishly ate that message up.    I don't blame Obama.  Opportunists like him will always exist.  There is a reason that the neoliberals in the DLC got behind him.  They needed a friendly face on their agenda, and found someone who could reliably deliver it.  There will be another and another, because there is a market for it.    IMO, the blame lies with the base --- they lack the desire to fight and to elect fighters.    Obama was an absolute cipher.  And to me,  an obvious fake from the moment he arrived on the political stage.   I can only look forward to a bleak 2016 cycle when clueless Dems will nominate Hillary, after she vomits an adequate number of lefty bon mots in the primaries.  If she wins, Democrats will dwindle into further irrelevancy, and the base will get what it deserves.     I have no idea whether the left will ever learn the lesson of fighting for what it believes in instead of negotiating against itself before the battle even starts.  If Hillary is the next nominee, I'm officially done with the party.   It is the result of of years of dehumanizing rhetoric directed against Palestinians -   not unlike the techniques used by the Nazis.   Only people who weren't paying attention thought he was a progressive.    He praised Reagan, he supported telecom immunity, he supported Joe Lieberman over the progressive Joe Lamont, he even said people were misconstruing him as a progressive.  People fooled themselves because they wanted to believe flowery words about bipartisanship instead of looking for a fighter.  They got what they deserved.         A fascinating article that argues Hitler had a mental breakdown after being exposed to nerve gas.  Historians, is this consistent with other sources?  How well accepted is this theory?               Natural functioning of our beloved market economy: create scarcity, profit.   I agree with the spirit of this, but I think it's easily knocked down by conservatives.  "It's not the government's money, it's *my* money.  The government *steals* it from me through confiscation."  We've all heard that before.  A much more effective argument is to point out that money and property rights owe their very existence to government.  That's right --- modern property rights are, paradoxically, a form of socialism.  We take social resources from everyone and give them to the police and judiciary, who in turn provide a free service for people who are said to "hold property".  They get free guard service and they get free enforcement of their contracts.    So, when a billionaire is said to "earn" their wealth, it should be pointed out that the only way they can so unfairly divide profits between themselves and their workers is through the magic of contracts, and state protection for contracts is a free  socialist service, which specifically benefits the wealthy.  Another way of talking about that is to ask "Why should we pay to protect WalMart confiscatory contracts with its workers?"

As Americans increasingly serve a smaller number of masters, I'm sure more than a few fantasize about getting away from it all.  This dude took that idea all the way, and apparently quite happy.  In his words,    I love this peace more than anything.  I may not have belongings, or enough food or water, but I'd take this peacefulness over them any day.         Please tell me that's a screen protector and not the original plastic cover.   Seven upvotes.   Tango down.   The behavior of the police toward the mayor pretty much exemplifies their mindset: they are never wrong and anyone who doesn't kiss up to them like they are some kind of authoritarian demigod deserves punishment.  It doesn't matter that Eric Garner's killing was on tape.  It doesn't matter that  99.99% of people get indicted by grand juries, but copes never do, it doesn't matter that they effectively report to the mayor.    They think they should never be questioned - on the street or in public debate.  That is a seriously fucked up mentality.         Cf. the [Big Lie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_lie#Usage_in_Hitler.27s_psychological_profile ).    It's funny that *both* wings fell off at once.

Properly managed, it could provide the jobs Americans need.   **Submission Statement**  It is a frequent trope of conservative debaters to claim that Republicans, "the party of Lincoln", have the proudest list of achievements as champions of civil and worker's rights.  This is a review of a book by historian Heather Cox Richardson who describes the switch from that big-government and progressive Republican party to the one we know today.            Agree, Communism also wasn't implemented properly.   Douchebag said what?      Ok, which one of you is this.  http://i.imgur.com/s4p9Ow5.png    "But Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), in her jihad against Wall Street,  seems determined to devalue this accomplishment  and to make financial expertise a mark of shame for Democrats, rather than a source of pride."  Hard to take the author seriously after that opening.     In what way has MoveOn been peculiar?  You seem to be suspicious of everything, but you're not providing any evidence.  MoveOn has been raising $1M to convince Elizabeth Warren to run.  Or is she now part of the secret libertarian plot to take over progressive politics too?  Full disclosure - I'm friends with one of the founders of MoveOn, and I can assure you that no such thing is happening.

After a first violation of a safety-related rule, a player must go 32 straight games without another such violation to have a clean slate. Includes reg. season, postseason and 2 preseason games.   Suh's last such violation was in Week 1 of 2013, when he was fined for a low block. So he went the rest of last season, 2 preseason games, and 15 reg. season games.  That's 32 straight. So by letter of the law, he had a clean slate.   Merton Hanks thought stepping on Rodgers was bad enough that even as a first offense should be suspension.

 7 Heismans, 6 winners. Archie Griffin won 2.   OSU only has 6 winners, though.    [Jizz Everywhere](http://imgur.com/krQK4Av)   ND has plenty of attractive women. They're in the college of business.   I'd put Purdue up there. I see way more from my Purdue friends about IU losing than I ever do about Purdue winning. I'm half convinced that being a Purdue fan really only means rooting against IU at all times.   I'm holding out hope he plays for us. We're collecting famous people's children.   Yeah that was 93. 89 we would have won if the best loss logic they used in 93 were used.    We should have won in either 89 or 93.   I've never seen as many dirty blocks by one team as I have by the Niumatalolo led Navy teams. And I understand how the academies have to play, I don't have anything against that. It makes me prefer we didn't play them, but I don't hold it against them. My issue is that it seems like every year there's at least 1-2 plays like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcTaRThg2mQ).   Am I allowed to hate their coach?   Gary Gray was great his junior year. He was the only one on that team that could tackle. That one admittedly horrendous game against Michigan killed him.   Ah yes, the many different business trades. Who wants to actually make money though, that's for tools.   Can confirm this one.   We have a similar issue....   What kind of 5 year old's favorite movie was Gremlins? That shit would have terrified me as a 5 year old.   I was, I graduated with him in May, he was a pretty good friend of mine. He's off in Denver working now, still trying to make music, though, so hopefully that comes through for him. Great guy.   All the time he lived next door to me.   Love D. Montayne.   Don't forget all the meth.   What are the chances of winning the lottery and dying the next day?   But Beiber clearly never would have been famous in 1993. That was when people had taste.

"It's really catchy, but I don't understand how it got so big."   Thank god for a real reply. The reason this song got big was the video though. A quirky video like that can go a long way towards making a song big. Same reasoning that helped Here It Goes Again.   When I first started playing on Xbox Live, all I could think was wow I didn't realize so many girls were playing Left 4 Dead. After about 10 minutes I realized they were all little kids.   With current technology, who's still worried about missing a show? 10 years ago I'd understand, but we have dvr and Hulu. No reason to skip out unless it's something live (sports being the only reason I have cable really).   This is definitely great for us, I just wouldn't have picked GAIII as someone who would be declaring. On the other hand, like Darius Walker, he's clearly not going to improve his stock by staying.   Basically it's better to have something that even might be slightly embarrassing than look like you're hiding something worse.   Caps Lock and Shift like a normal sentence.   Same with mine, but I was in a really liberal college town. By senior year more people didn't say it than did.   I think to actually beat out Stop Girl she'd need 3. Stop Girl has at least 2 subs.   He's a business, man.   They also need to stop asking questions like "Did you resolve to catch 'em all?" when clearly everyone will respond with "I can't, put out bank"   Fucking same siders.   For home games we get the visiting teams' refs. Away games we have our conference for non football sports' refs.   I still don't understand how that escalated. People seemed to be getting upset out of the blue.   Pauly D and Vinny were awesome and both seemed really chill.   For that matter, he has 47 million followers on twitter.   No one in the media should be calling out college kids. Just not classy. Professional athletes are paid and it comes with the gig, college athletes aren't.

We're on our way to getting a Pope.   How is that any different from your schedule only being as good as Auburn, LSU, TAMU, UT?   In fairness, last year was also just a weird year for QBs in the draft. There were a lot of QBs that were all relatively close in talent, meaning no one had to prioritize getting one early. Some years being the 4th QB taken keeps you at least late 1st early 2nd.   I've always wanted to start off all my sentences with "I'm not racist, but" and then just say whatever I'm going to say.   [Baseball actually has much more parity than the NFL, in spite of the salary cap.](http://espn.go.com/mlb/blog/_/name/stark_jayson/id/8908029/mlb-more-parity-nfl) I won't try to make a direct comparison in terms of teams making the playoffs with the NBA, because it's too hard to compare a league where over half the teams make the playoffs, but 12 of the last 15 championships have been won by the Spurs, Lakers and Heat, with the 3 that weren't still having one of those 3 teams making the finals. The Heat also beat the Spurs in the finals last year, so it had 2 of those teams. The 15 years prior to that only had 5 different champions, which brings us to the beginning of the NBA's salary cap era. We've actually only had 7 champions in the 30 years of a salary cap. In comparison, MLB has had 19 in that same time span.   In fairness, tuition also has a lot more it has to pay for as well. In 1938, you had to pay for basically teachers, chalkboards, a few administrators, and people to take care of grounds and buildings. Now, you have to pay for all the technology, which also means you have to pay all the people take care of the technology. Not to mention all the other amenities that most colleges have now like gyms, more extensive health centers, higher quality food and housing, etc that costs more. Yes tuition is rising at an extremely high rate. But so is the cost of what is being provided for students.   Only in the northern half of the state, unfortunately. I miss Meijer. Something I'm excited to have back when I move to Ohio in a few weeks.   He can just keep replacing Championship winning coaches.   If he wants to coach in 2015, too, that'd be ok.   Unfortunately I don't have access to the data on that, it's just something people in admissions have told me. And I know not all athletes are football players, I was just trying to say they don't let anyone in, even athletes, that they don't think can handle the school academically.   I was a business major at ND, so I had classes with a good amount of football players as well as other athletes. Some athletes may not have necessarily been as smart as other people in the class, but I never felt like they weren't smart enough to be in the class. Yes, many athletes get some help with admissions, but they aren't going to admit anyone who can't handle classes. Also, just as an aside, legacies at ND do worse academically than athletes do.   He was already redshirted, so he'll be a RS Junior. We don't actually call people RS anything at ND, but given that he also missed a semester of school, I'm not 100% sure what they'll call him.   I've never seen a better description.   I wouldn't put us as a top 3 job. The tradition is great, and depending on the recruit and/or their parents, the quality of education can be a huge boon. On the other hand, for a school with as much success as we've had, there's a lot of recruits we can't even attempt to go after, because they won't be able to get in. Not only that, we don't have any "athlete majors" where athletes can slack off and do nothing. Combine that with needing to recruit much more nationally, I still think it's a great job, probably top 10 or so, but not top 3 by any stretch.   I was hoping he'd at least go coach somewhere he wouldn't have to keep playing Navy.   Saban to head up the Longhorn Network?   I had someone once ask me where our CDs were. I told them we'd stopped carrying them a few years earlier. I was told I was wrong and should look in back, apparently for our entire CD display.   Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo?   We beat USC, too!   My favorite part of that was "Your'e still scared of terrorists on planes".   Tommy Rees, the man who kept Michigan State out of the MNC.   I prefer thunderstruck.   Funerals that are celebrations of the person's life are the best kind.   Hufflepuffs are particularly good finders.   He also bases his opinions on some form of reality as opposed to Skip.   This. You can't start a negotiation by starting asking for what you actually want. You have to give the other person room to get you to come down so they feel good about it, too.   He still puts out great music.   I could have sworn Usher did it, but looking now I guess he only had 4.   We just need to show coaching candidates the finer parts of South Bend. Fever and Backer trips are a must. If 23 were still open that'd be the deal closer.   Brian Kelly wouldn't know how to exploit a weakness in a defense if he found one, though. Unless that weakness happens to be their pass defense.   This is how I felt about Charlie Weis 4 years ago.   Who decides what's officially a song? Is there some committee I wasn't aware of who listens to things and decides what is and isn't a song?   They're already coming up with [ways to fix that](http://myfit.co/).   We actually compete in robot football. http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d82a5defa/article/notre-dame-wins-inaugural-robot-football-game   Girls still wear dresses and knee socks. Someone's clearly never seen Halloween.   What the hell kind of high school only lets gym classes play sports 1-2 days a week? I thought that's what you did in gym.   On the other hand we have freshmen rushing the field after a god damn 3OT win over Pitt that we needed a miracle to pull off.   I was bored and did something similar once. Finding West Virginia Wesleyan's schedule from 100 years ago is a bitch.   Tennessee might finally get to sing Rocky Top all night long after beating Florida! Lane didn't lie when he said he'd make  sure it would happen.   They spent more fucking time talking about her than the game. It was awful.   It's how I've purchased all my games so far. And it fit my purchase history perfectly. Right all the way.   Red Gatorade and Jack, however, do not work well together, despite being sugar, sour and liquor. My freshman roommate learned this the hard way.   For a second I though it was McDonald's orders over $30, and was horrified.   And honestly, if you're Bryce Petty, do you really want to go there when Tyler Bray is going to be the same year as you?   Aside from all of our suspects being 6' tall white males with brown hair wearing grey hoodies, like everyone on campus, we had some great crimes (should be noted we have single sex dorms).  Guy was going through a girl's closet at 4 in the morning wearing nothing but a blue shirt.  A guy was exposing himself while on a bicycle, the logistics of which both confuse and impress me to this day.  Two girls woke up in the middle of the night to see a man in their dorm room. Upon them waking up, he left out the window. This was further explained to me by someone in their dorm, who told me they lived on the 2nd or 3rd floor. Apparently it went about 12 hours before it was reported, because they both assumed it was a dream.   I'm always the person that when I ask someone how they're doing gets the non small talk answer. Inevitably the person who I've met twice will tell me it's not going well and then tell me exactly why.   But it was mostly attended by Irish Catholics.   I feel like targeting is going to encourage offensive players to lower their head so they can take a hit there and get someone ejected before too long.   He gives me PTSD. One of far too many QBs that Willingham or Weis made look like a damn Heisman candidate.  	100
 Someone should stop horsing around.   Well, in the movie The Exorcism of Emily Rose, the time 3PM is knows as the "devil's hour". To mock the Holy Trinity by being the inverse of 3PM with is known as the "hour of miracles". Dark stuff is supposed to happen at 3AM That's the time Emily Rose got possed with demons.  I don't know know if this may have some connection to OP's case.   My dad's not a phone! Man!   Can anyone explain to me what's happening here?   Blue commenter has no chill at all    Flap those pussy wings   	6
       Nice Steins;Gate reference username.    A gun rack would look better   Hey I got a hat like that lol   Alright boys this is a trial run of our first Instasynch night.  Instasynch is a neat little site where there's a chatroom, and a video player. Everybody contributes to the video queue and votes on which videos to skip or to pass.   Instasynch night will begin 7:00 PM CT (UTC-06:00) and end when everyone's bored. It'll be hosted in this room, http://instasync.com/r/A_irsoft.  Only rules are,   1. Enough dank memes   2. No spam (I guess?)  The playlist will remain locked until 7:00 PM CT   I'd say it takes a good balance of gear (armor, pouches, etc.) like any loadout.    I'd say hot and it can either look good or horrible, like hookers.    srry vorpie sempie   Nothing with pandas data analysis, didn't do any of those assignments in the class lol   Ayy the only coding I know kind of   Do the sites you listed ship to the US?   1. Where is it available.   2. Will it be released to US retailers like Evike and Airsoft GI   Those are my main two questions. Otherwise it's nice to see more unique and awesome guns coming to the GBBR world, and it's nice to see you guys at WE stepping it up.   Ew KWA   I don't get why it's racist. I guess I'm just an oppressive shitlord.   *Uhhh. Nuh uh.*    K bb   Alrighty   Fun is an understatement lol   I approved you so your comments don't get deleted, no worries you probably aren't a terrorist rapist   Aight   Automod. Gotta post something or get more comment karma   Should I make him approved so he doesn't get his comments deleted..?   Oh yeah baby   You are welcome in the den of freaks      I got the original Oblivion game still in its packaging for like three bucks at a little card and game shop near my house   Vorpie'd be pissed lol   Who cares   [You activated muh trap card] (http://i.imgur.com/Gp2VYP5.jpg)   Ohh at school. This happened while I was at work lol   Uh, what?    **HK HK HK HK HK HK-**   *Hnnnnnng*   b-bakayy lmao      *It's about the love of D A N K  M E M E S*   I don't think he really counts though. His comment in this thread is the first he's made here, and he isn't a regular   S-senpai   INVALIDERIDNLAINVADLIDINV   ayy lmao      Oh it not as bad as other shows lol   Upotte was so weird man   SIEG HEIL   Uh-but-uh-and-so... **HK MASTER RACE**   Actually HK51's are my new favorite raifu.    Google   G36k trumps FNC-chan   *^^^^Too ^^^^bad ^^^^HK ^^^^trumps ^^^^FNC-chan.*   Yeah the short FNC looks amazing to me. Too bad HK trumps FNC-chan.   Well the short one and the long one are for sale on ehobbyasia,   [Short one] (http://shop.ehobbyasia.com/gandg-gf76-aeg-short.html#.VYeWQPlViko)   [Long one] (http://shop.ehobbyasia.com/gandg-gf76-aeg-long.html)  I think it was Reascr or one of you shits who like that gun fan service animu show lol  [Also found thissun'] (http://shop.ehobbyasia.com/gandg-gf85-gl-ak5-aeg-green.html#.VYeXN_lViko)   Sure.   "An" and "In" in this instance does sound a lot alike.    I Googled it because I thought that I was wrong and thought I heard it wrong the whole movie lol   It's Indominus lol   Why'd I get downvoted lol   So the trick is not asking them to play OSU?   Nah he landed a date. The trick was no OSU.    Oh jeez, sorry lol   Are you selling the VFC 417 and the TM 417?   The description says that there's a TM 417, but the album says it's a VFC 417.    You mean the "almost honey badger".   Being a connoisseur of the HK variety, I do respect that you have two G36's at least.    I love how real it seemed, because they didn't use music in the whole movie. Only the opening scene and the credits.    Weezer   Weab shit   Parker (decent Korean rapper guy)   KC4K   Modigs   Madeon   Alex Skrindo  Some of my favorite stuff off the top of my head.   THANKS XYSTED THANKS   [HK IS LOVE. HK IS LIFE] (http://i.imgur.com/Pmq1ccR.jpg)   Uh, which one?   So, a UK retailer or a retailer that ships to the UK?    He seems like a really down to earth and genuine dude   Oh yeaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh. ^^^^What?   Oh yeah same here. His interesting play style, efficiency with GBBR's, and good editing are a great combo.    I'm happy I saw a StoopsMan video here. He makes really good content, I just wish he made more.    Uh-whe-what?   Okay so 7:00 PM central time. I don't know universal time lol   THANKS XYSTED THANKS   I was wondering about the threads on the [Lonex M4 receiver] (http://www.evike.com/products/51385/) and I was wondering if it's automatically compatible with [Noveske NSR rail system.] (http://www.evike.com/products/43521/)  I was digging around online but I couldn't find any information. I saw [this] (http://www.evike.com/products/48636/) and was wondering if I had to buy that, or if I could just screw the rail system on the gun. Any help would be awesome.   I feel like the put that power in the series, and the harem power to kind of make fun of regular mainstream shows.   Probably, or somehow Bell is going to use his magical plot armor power.   Yep, let's say Thursday at... 7:00 PM or 8:00 PM whatever time zone I'm in or yours since it's the same? What is it, central time?   I mean, *probably*      I wish we spent more time in British Colombia, but cruises are always a pain in the ass because of how you have to get back to the ship and shit. I'd love to go back though some time   Sounds pretty cool mang   I mean not to sound like a weab, but the Japanese-y part with the stepping stones and creek and azalea trees was probably my favorite part.    Sounds cool. I went to Butchart Gardens which was really cool.    I loved British Columbia when I went.    Good starting point.   Take one more loadout picture with the operator beard. Then, you can put it in a frame and set it on your nightstand, singing longingly to it every night.   Ayy that'll work   There's like, 2 lol   Thursday nights would be perfect. Disregard gay smiley face   I'm not sure, I work Saturday and Sunday   Didn't see this post sorry lol  Should I just keep it open all the time?   *I'm gonna need a long gun-erm I mean a CQB gun with a bipod*   *I need a long gun*   *It's time to blow this scene...*   *Right?*   I like the bipod that doesn't really have a practical use on a CQB oriented assault rifle.    TAR-21's aren't long. I mean, if you say "Oh it's bullpup so the barrel is long" then that kind of makes sense, but overall length of the gun isn't long.   I'm digging everything and I really dig compact ghillies like that. The only thing that kind of bugs me is how it's hunter camo.   Those scopes are sex. I saw one on the limited edition G28 that Umarex is selling. Looks slick, and it'd probably look sick on your 417.   I'm 17 and I'm only 5'5". I feel like I should be the one in your position.   Description please.   Aww yeah them /r/A_irsoft patches.    *Whoa*   Oh that's really interesting, thanks for clearing it up lol   ***Okay 3, 2, 1- Let's jam.***   Ah   *I think it's time we blow this scene...*   Like keyboard cleaning spray?   Haven't you seen his turtle burger video?   On Evike and I think ASGI you can find RATech (I recommend RATech) and other manufacturers of NPAS systems which can be used to lower FPS.     Just looks like inconsistent colors, laziness with parts or carelessness, and an average long suppressor for the "DAE DMR?" look.   It's a nice gun but by no means is it unique.    Good point. This is the first AR I've seen in awhile   Seems pretty average, rather than eccentric.   Prolly   By the end of my lifetime I hope that there's a VR first person shooter like in SAO   Oh yeah definitely. I'm curious to see what they'll implement to make the new game stand out of the crowd. It's gonna be hard.    I agree with the first sentiment, but I feel like it still sort of applies to the second game too. Far less so than the first, but it's still a big factor to the game's success at the time.    BUT DAE PC GUISE HALF LIFE 3 HALF LIFE 3 IS THE BEST GAMEME EVERR AND PC GUAIEIS KHLWEwU BvFdXCXwshJL    CRYEE LMAO   Oh I gotcha   I have a caramel custard flavored juice from White Label Juice. I know it has Diacetyl in it because they say there is. I'm seeing a lot of people saying they love diacetyl. Can you shed some light on what the diacetyl taste is when I vape it? I don't understand.   I feel like I've seen a scene from a show about vampires with a similar name and I swear there was nudity. Weird.   I feel like I know what show you're talking about.   Is that the one with unnecessary nude loli tits?   Why thank you, it's my oldest and trustiest.   I've played milsim with full Condor gear and it held its own.    Condor gear lasts a long time, it's affordable, and it works very well for airsoft use. Before my Condor MOPC I used a Condor Recon Chest Rig for two or three years. Condor Gear lasts a long time and anyone who calls it lower quality is kind of elitist.   It's not the highest quality, but it certainly isn't lower quality by any means.    Barrel?   Looks like it'd make a good sidearm to my [SPACE AUG.] (http://i.imgur.com/IUYQUFy.jpg)   It's not even a matter of tone, you just don't say stuff like that and keep it to yourself. People with Aspergers do stuff like that     That's really rude to just say stuff like that out loud when someone goes out of their way to invite you to do something.     I have, this comment is just over the top   Even when I first invited you said just said stuff along the lines of,   "Oh I guess I'll see it even though it looks like a pile of shit" or "Looks cool even though they'll mess it up"  That's really rude to just say stuff like that out loud when someone goes out of their way to invite you to do something.   Nah idk about that. He's just gotta be more positive and do more   Because you would've given it shit the whole time   Fuck it. /u/derpmurderpunch.  You gotta live a rose colored life mang. You houtarou-esque sonuvabich.    Yeah I won't say his username because he browses here, but he said something about the books and how the movie is gonna be shit for some reason. I feel like he's got depressive realism really bad because lately he's just turned into a cunt looking only at the bad things in everything.   I wanted to see it with a friend this Friday, but he would've made fun of it the whole time so I'm just going to wait until a decent torrent comes up.   Oh for fucks sake, I remember now  	138
 No    indeed    Absofreakinlutely    WHOA    Oh yeah I remember that scene.    We Missed you!!!!!!!!    good episode god I missed this show!!!!!!!!!!    hes in the top 10.    Indeed    Youve got a playdate with destiny!!!!!    id probably put him in the top 20.    YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH    Funny How????    Oh god hes such an ass!!!!!!    Yeah i remember him.    Yeah I remember him.    what are some of films best Movie jerks ever?????    OMG LOL    WTF    All of them.    thats not the storyline at all LOL.    This show hates Black guys LOL.    The Revenant 2009     Cool which film????    LOL cool.    Your mom    Star wars I am actually most pumped for that one.    whoa youve seen him work???    I dont think I have ever read of him actually finishing a movie on time and with no issues.    Didnt he threaten one of his actors with a gun or something???    I think he said he has no interest in being a big star and he is content with just doing the projects that interest him.    Jim Carrey    My peers    Every time I watch a movie I look up the trivia on IMDB regardless if I have read it before or not.    reading the trivia for those ones is like reading a long essay too LOL    They are called Stringers I think and yeah its legal just everyone doesnt like you LOL. Its a good movie I watched it last night good performance by Jake and it got me curious about it.    Who is Alex trebek???    Yes but not for the shaw brothers.    We will find out in a few days LOL.    Ill check them out they sound interesting    This was already common knowledge    3 of those things??? WOW I thought there was only 2 sequels.    Maybe    Ive only seen one polanski film the ninth gate, I was thinking about watching some of his other movies but its hard to knowing that he should be in jail.    Most of his later movies are shit anyways plus he is a racist ahole.    Thats kind of a bad reason LOL    I was thinking of seeing maps to the stars but I didnt know he was in it oh well I guess I will watch my second movie of him.    Thats pretty much me too.    Robert Patinson because I never liked him and I have only ever seen one movie with him harry Potter.    I remember seeing the previews and stuff when it was first released and thinking it was a ghost film or something instead its about deacon frost wanting his old house back.    Yes LOL    The Invisible 2007, its almost like a completely different movie than the trailer shows.    Fuck You    theyve teamed up before cool!!!!!!       Cool    I was hoping he would keep doing them and keep doing them.    Im sure they will all be remembered.    The last 20 minutes of that have always made me sad as hell.    It would have been a completely different movie and yes The Joker would return though not as the main villain again. God I wish he hadnt passed away it would have been so epic to see him come back as The Joker.    Awesome!!!! I thought Disney gave up on this project but no LOL   I saw it on Netflix and was thinking of watching it soon wow thats weird LOL.    Ite been rumored for awhile now that he will die in it.    Interesting    I have seen my all time favorite film exactly 8 times. I tend to watch it once a year only because I dont want it to get stale.   I had a black one it was awesome!!!!    Sounds about right they seem to act a lot like themselves and stuff plus the music thing LOL.    WOW how did I not get this already.    Saw it earlier it was pretty good like an R Rated South African Short Circut movie. I will probably see it again but man was Die Antword annoying.    Ive watched a few if them from those times the ones I have watched never dissapoint.    5 or 6 per week and at least 2 a week in the cinema I also keep track of every movie I watch there I have for the last 5 years.  I like ALL types of movies but my favorites are action and comedy. I like current movies like made in the last 10 years but occasionally I will watch something from the 80s or 90s.  Last 5 were Submarine, Zero Dark Thirty, Selena, Iron man, and The Last Five years.     HAHA She thought she was gonna live ahhhh how cute.    Sutherland would be cool and Mr T, as well as Ron Perlman, and Michael Chiklis.    LOL    Saw it yesterday and I LOVED IT!!!!! A really good musical im glad I got the chance to see it in Theaters Anna is so great too I love when she sings.    man I cant freakin wait!!!! I have been waiting for season 6 for so long!!!! I will watch it on yahoo screen as soon as it is available.    Looks awesome!!!!! cant wait for two more weeks!!!!!!    I literally came here to suggest this wow you beat me to it.    Yes indeed.    Well he is the president he is so bust nowadays.    Yeah true.    The once a week is better IMO I mean I like House of cards and all of the episodes at once. It just spreads it out more I guess.    HMMM Alright I will do that I tend to like movies no matter what. And again I do love anna kendrick.    Interesting    To those of you who have seen this would you recomend it?? Its playing at an arthouse theater near me and I was thinking about going and watching it on my day off. I do love Musicals and Anna Kendrick.    Yeah he was important behind the scenes and most of his appearances were just cameos except for like two of them. RIP Leonard.    WHOA I thought he was on more wow was I wrong.    AHHH Man I that brings back memories of 1st grade for me.    He was playing a certain type one specifically for that film. I hope he at least becomes moderately successful in the business he just needs to do some more stuff.    I LOVED IT!!!! When I first saw the previews and stuff i wasnt really interested but when it got all of the oscar noms I saw it and wow was i blown away just like you!!!!!    I liked it it was a gimmick yes but one that payed off.    He had no cameo it was a major role.    I hope so at least a mention theres still time to shoot something real quick.    So far i have only read for 40 minutes at the most one of these days though I am gonna read for 3 or more hours at least. It usually takes me a few weeks or more to finish a book.    fuck you       ROFL    No Country for Old Men    Cool wish the other guys would return though.    Yes such a waste.    No that year was the last where they did 5.    Not even nominating The dark Knight for Best Picture.    Sorry to hear that, my bike was stolen in november I was so pissed. I just recently got a new one and this time i have two locks.    Probably dead.    Boyhood    Every year I think of this god I wish i could time travel.    Joy will likely get 20 nominations just like russels movies have in the past.    I wish they would change thijngs up at least one year they are always so frekin predictable. Other than that tho I liked them they were funny and neil was great.    Yes I try to watch most of the acting categories at least I never really get around to watching all of the best picture nominees though.    Riggan Thomson    Sad news I wish they would just make it already!!!!   	111
                                                                                                                                     **"borrowed"**                                                                                                                          	85

Also holy shit the eyes have gazed into the abyss, the abyss gazed back and it got freaked out    It's culture and the sounds! If I could do a book report on the early rave movement I would be so happy. It just fascinates me how these people acted, dressed and danced, plus I could introduce my classmates to hardcore ;). As for the sounds, HARD KICKS! Doesn't matter what kind Hardcore, Subground, Early Rave, Hardstyle, Frenchcore, Hard House, Hard Trance, Terrorcore or Speedcore I'm down for it all! Another thing I love is how excepting everyone is, I'm friends with 4 of the 200 Ableton certified trainers out their in the world and while their all techno heads their always open to what I have to play   One of 16bit's EP's like dinosaurs or skull crack  Toms Dinner EP by Alex kidd and kidd kaos  Endless fantasy by Anamanaguchi  Worlds by Porter Robinson  Derb by Derb  Confusion by new order  MoodyGood by MoodyGood   A color map of the sun by pretty lights            Jesus ow...

He just pops up with a sign and then he just pops back down   matts rocking that beard!      Don't know if this is a forgotten track but Technoboy's remix of beat diz by the Hardstyle masterz is awesome (Italian Hardstyle FTW!)   I really want to see Pat on it, it would be cool to see him and TB talk PC (also seeing one of his babby freak outs would be hilarious)   Man..... Fuck activision    I would be down for this   * Bible black  * Full LP   * 10 hours for main story 30 hours for everything (you get your moneys worth I guess....)  * Bible black teaches kids about religion, the joy of family bonding and most importantly staying away from drugs   * Dan motherfucking yugi green is in it  Ok I kid I kid here's my serious one:  * Dying Light  * Full LP  * 28 hours for both extra and main content   * dead island: the good version   * I would love to see their reaction to the grappling hook and for those who don't know [Spoiler](#s "it's basically the just cause 2 grappling hook!" )          Put Pats lazy boy out of its misery by hurling of his balcony   Put bags of rock salt around Woolie's place  Make Liam's body pillows come to life   Rearrange Matts action figures when he isn't looking   EDIT: I scrolled down and saw the stand thing, I would be a rotating stand! Every week I would change to a different user and I would have diffrent abilities!   Pat: Help him control his anger and help him reach high places  Matt: Make it so he never drops things and give him the strength of the punisher  Woolie: Give him a salt cannon and make him not hate breakfast   Liam: Help him overcome his fear of the booty and make his hair even more beautiful        :D   Can we please get the thunderdome wizard as a flair? Thunderdome is a part of rave history and I think we should keep the memory alive with flairs! :)   [but don't you remember all the fun he had alone?](https://youtu.be/N3SNlRIak34?t=47s)   Oh man, I guess all that rage is aging Pat faster then we thought      More then you'd expect but less then you would hope!   Did you see his computer monitor?!? Holy shit it's beautiful!   Thank you kindly    Huh so it's like hearthstone card packs, one guarantied cool thing followed by 4 lame normal "cards"    Ok, I have a question!   How is lootcrate? It's getting blasted in the comments but I've never heard of it before   also can I get a a time stamp on the buscemi pic please? I can't see it ;_;   I agree with this! Ophidian I love you   OR OR OR! How about every 2 months they do a special 30 minute podcast with just Pat and Woolie as Chewie and Fuckface   Yes we are! Also can I haz links to the podcast where this all started?   What program did you use for this? If you say FL Studio I will hug you so hard....   Now you know how PC players feel about bloodborne.....   Here's a link to the [article](http://www.polygon.com/2015/4/28/8507891/D4-Swery-Xbox-One-PC-Steam-Windows-Access-Games)   In an interview SWERY said that they were working very hard and to "please get exited" so I think that D4 pt.2 is coming but if you want to help him out some more, Bandcamp is a great way to do it!   Stand down shadow da edgehog! Your in danger of being able to cut through the earth and not care about doing so!   No one believed the mayor but at the same time no one doubted him. With sighs resonating through out the crowd the sounds of lighters followed by coughing were heard as the townsfolk walked towards Quint's home    Thanks for pointing that out, I'll be sure to put their actual name in from now on :)   A new decree from York! said Zach, York is the voice is the mayor's head whispered  Bill to Tommy the confused new arrival in town. Every Tuesday we will all smoke cigarettes outside of Quints house from 1:00 - 10:00 said Zach      Oh... That makes sense      This has been posted before but I just wanted to remind people. All the money goes to AGR, how it gets split is up to them, are these expensive? Yes, will you be supporting SWERY if you buy these? Yes :D      Dudeeeee I need bloodborne really bad on PC! I've been playing dark souls to try and shrink my raging blood boner but it's not going down   Pat - "Had to eat breakfast, it was delicious" Woolie - "it was pretty good" wait what!?    Goreshit is my hero, check out his GNB album   Yes!!! Can we please bug SWERY for an AMA on here? I need to tell him about how great this show called twin peaks is!!      but we still need copy's of atlas shrugged and sweater vests to make it official       I'm reading through the comments and I'm wondering why I haven't bought any games from GOG yet...... Move over steam my computer is about to become a lot more DRM free in the near future        Zatox   Mad Dog - Voilent       Welcome to the club friend! Pull up a chair, have fun, read the wiki and most importantly ask questions! We will answer :) also don't try to post any new episodes... Mike will beat you to it     In my dreams I see that town, a town I can never go to now........ Because it burned down *Angry tears intensify*   Shouldn't it be DB?   If D actually dose turn out to be Dio I will fly to Japan, find SWERY, high five him so hard that he flys back to my house, make him clam chowder and then take him on a tour of Wisconsin including places like Milwaukee, Door county, the dells and some of our natural parks where we will stay in cabins and ware plaid pajamas while a painting of a moose hangs above the fireplace. After our adventure his team will come over to do research and will make a SWERY 65 game set in Wisconsin        Ow.... That intro was baaaad, guys please play this and then play hunie pop      Many thanks brother   Oh.... Well forget what I said then, but the question remains "how do I have skully?" I don't remember buying any DLC packs for the game. I still am exited to see the firebug back in action at some point   6 months!? Holy shit that's fast! Although I am a little salty that DJ skully is a paid skin :/ but hey atleast we don't have to pay for things that matter! Can't wait to see what they've done with the firebug!   I remember after I bought rise of the triad on steam I saw the price on GOG. I was not happy   Yes...   DYK that Feed me = Spor?   We all saw the distance video and how hype they got over the music. So let's share!

 Yay :D   No damn patch notes yet.   I guess they found another way to proper WaLMaRT :p      Huh what?   Yeah, that's pretty stupid and just kills the scene. By scene drama I meant the RELOADED-SKiDROW girl fights :p Edit: maybe you meant [this](http://scenenotice.org/details.php?id=672)?   Scene drama 3   You're absolutely right. I mean, Razor and FLT are almost 30 years old, I don't think anyone would expect the old guys to still be active. Even "back in the day" there were members joining and leaving all the time, judging from old NFOs I found on [defacto2](http://www.defacto2.net/). Nonetheless, dispite its ups and downs the scene kept being about competition and quality, which is lacking these days, for the reason you said. Great post!      OK. Maybe it's a bit pointless to create a whole new sub just for Warez Scene discussions, but it's a subject that some people like me find very interesting.  I've even made a [small wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/warezscene/wiki/index) with a "what's the scene" FAQ in there. Nice read, if you'd like to know what it is.  Anyway, sorry for promoting this sub here, I hope the mods don't take it the wrong way. If so, sorry :/  Keep in mind that while you can discuss cracks and whatnot, posting them isn't allowed.   You can easily find it pre-activated in several public trackers.   Maybe check your internet connection. I guess Windows needs a working one to retrieve the new passwords you set.   thx?   Using a technical preview OS as main OS. What could possibly go wrong?   You can download an ISO from most torrent trackers. Usually you can find an activator there too. Some actually claim to be pre-activated. What's the Windows you want?   OK. Maybe it's a bit pointless to create a whole new sub just for Warez Scene discussions, but it's a subject that some people like me find very interesting.

Anyway, sorry for promoting this sub here, I hope the mods don't take it the wrong way. If so, sorry :/         Exactly. Or... well... actually... **FIFA.13.INTERNAL-RELOADED** Note: This release is meant for our sites, its ops and users, and those who request it.   The fact scene veterans could but don't is the main reason I made the thread.   I heard about it, and tried it once, I think, but it looks sketchy. It's cool, yes, but just think about it. A "cracked steam" allows you to download games with several dozens of GB, increasing some server's load a lot,  **for free**? Maybe it's legit, but I wouldn't take the risk. If you want my advice, avoid it.   All the very popular games still get cracked but with no demand for the smaller ones, scene groups don't bother  Actually, I see many meaningless Steam being released by the scene, while titles with lots of demand (FIFA 15 and Dragon Age Inquisition, for example) aren't released, not even [internally](https://scenelingo.wordpress.com/2008/07/16/what-does-internal-mean/).  I think the increasing toughness of DRM is the reason.     There have been reports of that, but I think such cases are rare.  **Prototype.2.Proper-SKIDROW**  So now we have decided to proper Fairlight's Prototype 2 release, because our crack is fully reversed and CEG free. Which gives the end user a more stable crack, with less crashes, startup problems gone, fast loading, better framerates etc. are some of the problems that our fully reversed crack prevents.  Worth mentioning that in some cases, properly removing DRM might actually improve the performance.  **Prototype 2 STATEMENT READNFO-FLT**  Here we have Securom as protection, what is known to slow down a game's performance in general, with more protection features activated, the more of a performance hit you might see in theory.   As someone said it, if the game is not updated (it's done manually, so there are many pirates who probably don't bother doing it), you might be playing an unoptimized version of the game. Fortunately, both the Scene and the P2P usually release updates.    Not sure I get your point. Steam, Origin, uPlay, whatever, which you use to preload the game (and are necessary to play it) are DRM. That's the topic here.   Whether the P2Pers can fulfill my wish to play pirated games, it's sad (in a way) to see the current state of the Scene, compared to what it used to be.   Done   Demo division is still active (a couple of their members will be in Revision 2015 Easterparty). Not much is known about their warez division, though, but it might have something to do with their member dycus dying. **Rayman_Origins__RiP_DYCUS-Razor1911**:  He was the one behind many Trainers     and without him even our few releases wouldn't have seen the light of day as     he was the best game tester you could think of.   This is also very interesting: **Response.To.Our.Recent.Nukes .SCENENOTiCE-WaLMaRT** This is where we introduce **Cracker B**. The guy was very well spoken and appeared to be very skilled. He was able to patch CEG games for us in a fast and efficient manor. He claimed to be an ex member of Two other groups, which he backed up by sharing their tools with us. - SteamStub Unpacker Enigine 0.4 Win 8 Version - Origin Unpacking Dumping Engine 0.2 These tools included an icon with a **Razor logo**, so we can only assume they came from there. None of these tools were used in any of our release, we were making our own. Cracker B was purely showing off the fact that he was in possession of these tools. After some time we received another nuke, this time concerning suspicions that the release was stolen from a P2P source. Tensions were high in the group after the nuke and the member was soon banned. **He has since moved on to another group with Cracker B**  Now, I have no idea if it's common for groups to share tools, but I guess it's not, since it takes a lot of effort to develop them. So is this "**Cracker B**" a former Razor1911 member? If so, I wonder what's that group he moved to...       Steam games are the most popular, but they seem like the worst titles to crack if they want their e-penis to grow. I mean, everyone cracks Steam. Well, by everyone I don't mean just about anyone who can open a disassembler, but you can actually find some documentation about reversing Steam in the open web, and many, many P2Pers do it just fine. I actually recall SKIDROW mocking FLT for only cracking "lame Sims expansions" which only had some disc-check protection. Remember when Razor1911 released The_Settlers_7-Razor1911? They said they didn't care about cracking Assassin's Creed 2 for technical details, that The Settlers had the true real Ubisoft DRM, and thus they just waited. Now, if more games == bigger dick, they would have just released ACII... right? I think the tougher the protection the more bragging rights. But then why doesn't FLT start cracking harder stuff? I'm confused... :/   Scene releases usually follow [some rules](http://www.sbytes.info/NFOwb.php?id=Rules.For.The.Game.Scene.Charts) that can actually mean better cracks. Most times you might not even feel the difference, though, since it's mostly technical stuff. Also, sceners can proper each other until there's a working release, and their reputation is important to them, so we're less likely to see poor quality stuff (SKIDROW doesn't apply to this, of course :P )   Not necessarily, but that seems to be happening.   I don't wish we had less Steam releases. In fact, it's quite the opposite, since there's much more scene competition with Steam. My point is that protections are getting tougher to crack, specially if you follow the old scene rules, and it's easy to see that groups are avoiding such DRMs and sticking with simpler ones like Steam, which one day may be in danger as well, since DRMs tend to get tighter over time, not worse.    I don't think most downloaders realize what's happening in the PC-ISO scene. I haven't payed attention to it for as long as some you might have (let's say, since the early 2000s), but the future seems dark. I feel that there until 3-4 years ago there was a lot more competition. I mean, what's happening these days? FLT cracks nothing but a few Steam releases, RELOADED cracks UbiDRM, most Steam Releases and some Origin releases. Oh yeah, let's talk about the Origin stuff. Not looking good.   FIFA.13.INTERNAL-RELOADED    Crysis.3.INTERNAL-RELOADED   Crysis.3.Crackfix.INTERNAL-RELOADED   Crysis.3.Crackfix.2.INTERNAL-RELOADED   Crysis.3.Update.v1.2.INTERNAL-RELOADED  Not to mention The.Sims.4-RELOADED that was released like a month after the P2P release, and FIFA 15 that wasn't released by any scene group at all.  SKIDROW used to be annoying with their rushed P2Pish cracks, but at least they tried hard. Now they pretty much only release Steam stuff and get into little girl fights with RELOADED (check out Assassins.Creed.Unity.v1.5.Update.STATEMENT-SKIDROW).  CODEX looks promising, but I guess we'll have to wait and see.  And where's the old Razor1911 in all of this? Cracking Linux and OSX stuff from time to time...  Sid_Meiers_Civilization_V_Complete_Edition_Linux-Razor1911   Wasteland_2_MacOSX-Razor1911  Wasteland_2_Linux-Razor1911   XCOM_Enemy_Unknown_The_Complete_Edition_Linux-Razor1911  What do you guys think?   It was a freaking lame-ass server emulator with random values.   "3 extra lines of assembler" - LOL. Shut up instead of saying that kind of shit. You probably think today's DRMs are crackmes from youtube tutorials. Those "cracker kids" are people who spend years learning Assembly and improving their Reverse Engineering skills.   Are you in Europe or the US?   Hello, I'll be visiting London for the first time next month. Is it okay to address men as "sir" and women as "ma'am" in the UK? While I don't think "sir" would be much of a problem, I think I read somewhere that some women don't like being addressed as "ma'am" as it's usually used with old ladies.  Thanks in advance :)   	37
 No problem.   They've not yet become self aware, no.   It's been kinda progressive for me but it hit full blown(ish) suddenly a few days ago. And it pretty much feels like I'm an empty shell, like nothing really matters anymore.   That's what I mean by that it's kinda weird. Plus, it's an RC they can range in quality and stuff. I've heard of stories of people not feeling anything from a large doses but their friends black out. Have you tried any other benzo or benzo-like drug? Maybe try a different one.   Anyone else who comes on this post, I have a question; Should I see my psychiatrist? Even though every time I tell her about negative symptoms she pretty much ignores me and moves on to a different subject.   I'm starting to think that it's the illness and the meds just make it 10x worse, because I've not been on medications for around 2months and my apathy has just started to actually come back... Weird.     I can also completely relate to the 0 sex drive. My sex drive went from pretty normal to pretty much -100 out of 100. I still don't know for sure if it's medications that causes it, because I mean, I've been off meds for around the same time as you (by myself, docs never, ever take me off meds). Schizophrenia can cause you to have apathy I guess but I'm really hesitant to go back on meds because they make that part worse. Also, having suicidal thoughts because of lack of a sex drive isn't good, you should see a psychologist (they can help better with that on a psychological level than a psychiatrist can, a psychiatrist are just licensed drug dealers imo)... When I don't have a sex drive I just think of it like, well, at least I don't have that burden anymore, even though it's a bad thing, if you understand? I'm pretty sure lack of a sex drive is because when your emotions are extreme lowered (apathy) you can't really connect with anyone else, could also be due to anhedonia which accompanies apathy nearly all the time.   I hope you eventually start to get better.    I'm pretty sure etizolam is good for anxiety (although it is an RC "benzo", it's not exactly a benzo but it's extremely, extremely close).  Anyway, OP, I'm not all that knowledgable about etizolam but I heard that it's pretty good for anxiety, but I've also heard that it's kinda weird and can be heavily sedating and cause black outs with small doses to it's kinda hard to dose with it for anxiety... I think everyone's different with this particular drug (kinda like every other drug, I know, but this one seems to react differently with everyone).  Sedation - In terms of energy level alterations, Etizolam is extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state - Got this from [here.](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam). So yeah as enigmaticdoge said, either stick with it until you build a tolerance or try a different benzo.  Edit: deleted because I accidentaly replied to enigmaticdoge.   No, I don't think I had a very big interest on the government trying to wipe out everything on Earth. But the lead up to the big "delusion" I had obsessions about it, I guess.   Can I meet you there? I don't have any friends in hell, I'll be new there.   I made a post not too long ago about how I was dealing with a shit ton of emotions but I just couldn't really express them even though I wanted to, so now I'm back and well, I don't feel anything. I should probably see my psych but I think she's still away sick. It's kinda like some part in my brain where emotions are kept was just swept clean, like there's nothing really there anymore. I mean, I still have feelings but they're extremely died down, for example; on a scale from 1 - 100 my emotions right now are about 6-12 (at the highest) and half of those at the lowest (3-6). I haven't been on medication for about 2 months now I think, dunno if it's that but if it is then, whatever, meds make this 10x worse.  It feels like I might be posting here like a diary, maybe no one noticed because my post are far and few between but whatever, have a nice day everyone.    4 grams CAN be lethal, yeah, sure (I still go with 127-130 per kg though). I was just saying that he didn't take anywhere near 4 grams, that's all.   Edit: wrong numbers, sorry.   I fucking love Amsterdam.   Doing drugs as a hobby is the worst thing you could do, seriously, take it from me... For me for example, if I don't get any morphine I will seriously just go out and try and do random shit that would get me into a lot of trouble just because I was insanely bored (even if I was in WD's). If I couldn't get some morphine for even just one day, I would go out with friends and not come home for days and when I was out of that bender my friends would be magically gone, they went home days ago. Basically what I'm trying to say is that having drugs as a HOBBY is seriously self destructive because once you don't have that drug you will do anything to alleviate the boredom eventually. Not only that but doing drugs like MDMA that much will damage your brain, and don't even get me started on heroin, that's just not a road you want to take.  Being clean is a good thing you know... Yeah, yeah, I know being sober is really fucking boring but eventually you will have a hobby and build a routine out of that hobby and you'll eventually start to like life again. It takes time, maybe try a program like 12 steps (just keep in mind that it doesn't work for everyone), and/or maybe therapy. But yeah, even if sobriety is boring as shit, it's better than being self destructive and building your fun around drugs, because they don't last forever.   I wasn't saying anything about him fainting. The guy above me said that 4g is deadly, because he probably thought 400mg was 4g for some bizarre reason, so I corrected him.   The daily mail are just a bunch of mentally challenged people pretending to be smart.   I find the euphoria from methylphenidate to be like a 7.5 for 1 hour then it's all downhill from there.   He didn't take anywhere near 4 grams of caffeine though, or am I missing something?   Do they use Desoxyn in Europe (including the UK) because I've never heard of that outside of the US. It's mainly Amphetamine and Ritalin for ADHD and severe obesity.   Opiates won't exactly "kill your appetite" unless you use it chronically. The only reason it reduces appetite is because it slows down gastro-motility (and cause gastroparesis in some cases) and they also reduce physical hunger in the same way that they reduce pain. But I can say from experience that opiates won't kill your appetite like stimulants do, they might reduce it a bit but you will still feel hungry but just a little less frequently, and using drugs like this to lose weight is not only unhealthy but unsustainable.    That's great that you've been clean for 3 months, may I ask what drug(s) you were trying to stay clean from? Anyway, like the others have said, find a hobby, do something that's packed with adrenaline.   That's probably why I have severe trust issues and have to see a psychologist.   Thanks, mate, and yes the books are good. They have a great Scottish vocab (which is where I'm from).   [Yes, super saiyans are real.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xA0ZHEwU2Q)   Adderall is pretty hard but normal street amphetamine is pretty easy to get ahold of, and I like methylphenidate better anyways for some reason.   Don't ruin the dream, the dream will live on. Also I'm pretty sure all the Methylphenidate based drugs are on a 12 month ban. That apparently includes, Ethylphenidate, isopropylphenidate, propylphenidate, 3,4-CTMP, HDMP-28.   And it's not sustainable, they'll find out eventually (even if they're not overly suspicious).   Damn, your post didn't come up when I was typing that. Thanks, I'll read it.   Just get some Ritalin and drink alcohol. Ritalin is super easy to get in the UK.   I like to set people on fire too, don't you?    That little kid must've been like, "IS ANYTHING REAL ANYMORE?".   They don't for me. I have heard about that though, I've also heard that stimulants like meth also do that, they don't for me though. I still like chips and stuff over sweets. I've heard (on the internet) that opiates can almost put you in a hypoglycemic state, and that opiates make people have a reduce acute insulin response, so maybe that's why (but that's just speculation I think, feel free to do more research on that). I don't think it's anything to worry about though.   I'll suck yo dick man.   I have a pretty chronic, annoying and sometimes painful gastrointestinal disease (or just stomach, we don't know yet) that's not been fully diagnosed yet. It leaves me with low appetite, constantly shitting, (chronic) nausea, and feeling bloated after small amounts of food for hours. I feel tired, miserable and helpless but then you get these people that think they know how to cure it, even though doctors don't even know what the fuck it is (yet), or they tell me WHY I have it and somehow I end up with all the blame like I wanted this or something. Yes, because I totally wanted to become chronically ill. It's also super, super immoral to tell someone that they caused their disease, or that they can cure it with just 29.99 A MONTH, just fuck off you morons... If I could cure my disease on some stupid diet then I would do it but I have more sense than to hand over my fucking money to some low lifes that just want to make a few bucks on someone elses misfortune.   (FUCK YOUUUUUUU ALL)   They actually don't usually lose intelligence, we might just find it harder to speak and get caught up on words and stuff but we do not lose intelligence.    They're all good.    Some of the stuff I'm seeing in the comments really disgust me. Kurt and Layne were both great, I personally loved Kurt more because I felt a connection to his lyrics, but can everyone stop acting like such immature little babies? Both were great, RIP to both.    OMG MY MOMMY SAW THAT...   I can't even imagine what life would be like without a washing machine. I'd have to hand wash my clothes, you're right, washing machines are pretty important.    It's Topiramate.    I think so, it's at least similar.    Yeah, at such a low activity that it probably wont have any interactions.    Actually, I'm starting to lose a bunch of weight which I'm hoping will make me feel better.   This should get upvotes because it's fucking hilarious.    Yes, he "shot himself".   And even if he was, diamorphine is definitely not OTC.    So, I don't think I've actually made a dedicated post on here, I usually just leave comments but I've been thinking about something lately and thats self-esteem, confidence etc. whatever you want to call it.   To start off, I'm an opiate addict (morphine and a few others) and I started off like most opiate addicts, pain. Anyway, other than opiates I do take stimulants when I'm out with people to basically give me a sense of self confidence and obviously self-esteem, although it's chemically induced, opiates also give me this alien feeling of "confidence" that I've sadly never had in my life. I've tried therapy and gave up because it never did anything for me, I mean, talking about stuff obviously helps but I can do that to anyone without having to set up an appointment or pay money but the actual therapy itself does nothing. Drugs on the other hand, although it's considered "false", does help, they do give me self-esteem and confidence. I don't just have a low self-esteem, I have what you considered a shattered self esteem, when I'm sober I don't feel worthy of anyone elses care... I would rather do therapy if it worked, but sadly it doesn't, the only thing that works are opiates and stimulants.  So to my question, is it possible for someone to never have self confidence sober? As in, is it possible for therapy to never work and for people to have to have a chemically induced confidence and esteem?  If this sounds like rambling, I'm sorry.     ...  That's all I can say to this.   What the fuck? Yeah, and while you're at it eat some tea.   I never understood why. I always prefer opiates.    I just clicked the context button on reddit, am I doing it right?   So you should've said... "Test it AND buy rocks", not or.   Bu... But drugs are bad.   I'd rather E.   [This is what happened to thecheezed when he went out in the snowstorm.](http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/commercials/2006/12/IRN-BRU-Snowman-Flight.jpg)   Heroin looks like a daily vitamin compared to inhalants like this.   Renton is a reference to the main character in trainspotting, haha. I've been asked if it was a reference to Renton, WA... At least Washington is my favourite state.   Tramadol is strange. For some people it's their DOC and then there's others exactly like you. Probably because of the SNRI activity. I've tried poppy seed tea, but I can never find any that's not really washed.    How can someone say "the good cancer", since when is ANY cancer good?   I find it extremely hard to express emotions to other people, lately I've been talking to an ex (and we both still have feelings for each other) and I find it difficult to say what I'm feeling to her unless I get drunk. I don't think this has anything to do with schizophrenia (or maybe it does, I don't know) but I post here anyway because its one of the only subreddits to do with mental illness that isn't overrun by attention seekers. Anyway, I don't know why I can't express any emotion to anyone, all I do is huff and puff so that they know something is wrong, and then when they ask me, I don't know how to put it into words. Does anyone else get this problem?   I think you actually can in Canada, no harm in trying I suppose.    What don't you like about it?   Okayy? That doesn't mean he won't have a copy of the enzyme, I'm guessing you're talking about CYP2D6.    I always feel proud that Gordon Ramsay used to live like 5 mins away from me.   I'm pretty sure the 'thebaine' is pretty stimulating, hence why oxycodone is more stimulating than the morphine derived drugs, like heroin. So if vaping it reduces the morphine then you will feel more of the 'thebaine', I'm guessing.    "He was searching for whatever made him feel like he wasn't alone"... Speaks to me more than anything, especially right now.   God damn it, wangofjenus.   The main alkaloid in opium that produces effects is the morphine, of course it has codeine, thebaine etc. but it's pretty much the morphine.    I mean, at least we would have a real diet pill for once if we legalized adderall.   There's never anyway to be 100% sure.    Weed, Cocaine... Same difference.  /s - for everyone that doesn't get sarcasm over the internet.   Mixing depressants, especially alcohol and opiates is a VERY bad idea, trust me.   I bet the last thing on his mind is going crazy again.    The reason I don't want to go back on meds is because they make me feel even lower, I have a history of depression as well and I think I'm having some sort of episode of it, which in return might be producing psychotic effects. I don't wanna go back on meds when I'm depressed, mainly because I don't think it'll help the way I'm feeling. I don't even have any antidepressants and my psychiatrist is off sick. This may seem sad and stupid but this "depression" may have been triggered by a girl I still love(?), I broke up with her a few months ago and we've recently started to kinda see each other on the side again (and she's said she still "loves" me), the thing is, I don't want to see her just on the side. I can't express what I feel, so I just bottle it all up, when I try to say how I feel I just come out with a bunch of words that don't make sense and stutter and stumble all over the place. I don't know why I'm telling this to someone over the internet, but I don't really have anyone else.  The trigger for my "depression" (which in return has triggered some symptoms of schizophrenia) may seem stupid, but I feel like killing myself but I don't know how to tell anyone.  Sorry for a late reply.   Welcome to reddit buddy.   Same difference.    Can you see through the chairs?   God dammit, evanallmighty.   I always knew pharmacists were druggies.    At least he didn't go from nothing to like, fent.   So, I've been off my medication for a month or so now and some shit happened that really got to me, needless to say I can feel pretty depressed (even though I can't feel anything, I just know I feel like complete shit), I can't think, like all my thoughts are fuzzy, I don't know. I just can't think. I feel like I might be relapsing, and even going back into a depressive state but I don't know how to tell anyone at all, I feel stuck, like my thoughts are screaming for help but I can't do anything.   Thank you, just needed to get that out there (even if it seemed like nothing and even if it made no sense).    Any nirvana song.    The only dealer is a pharmacist.    Sir, are you high right now?    Medication can even make negative symptoms a lot worse. Including the flat affect and avolition.    And this kids, is why you never do meth.    I've had dreams where I take crack (never done crack but I think I wanted to at that point), and morphine because well, I'm addicted to opiates. I also found MDMA in a dream at one point too, but I never done it in the dream.   I don't really want to do crack anymore though, lost that interest a while ago.    Lol, then why comment?   Maybe, just maybe, you just THINK you're making the right choices when drunk?   No, it will just give you severe autism.    Depends. I've been just given antipsychotics, and lorazepam (when I was inpatient).    They're pretty much just injecting morphine mainly, so it shouldn't be that bad.    Harming pets is usually a psychopathy thing, right?   She sounds spoiled as fuck. Why does a 12 year old have a phone anyway? What does a 12 year old exactly need a phone for? If this was me I would've flipped my shit and she probably wouldn't be here right now, so good job for keeping calm.    Two and a half men was good until they got rid of Charlie Sheen.    Opiates aren't unsafe to take if you're schizophrenic. They actually have antipsychotic-like effects.   People mainly want to go on a suicide mission to mars because they don't think that Earth has anything for them, they may even think they failed on Earth so much that they would rather die on mars. It's actually quite sad, but I don't think they're all idiots.    Your name is extremely accurate.    Eh, whatever. I still think we COULD make it to mars in the next 30 years though.    So I guess an off brand tylenol will get me suspended for a year because it might look like a prescribed opiate?   You're missing out bro, you're missing out. Pill binder is strong shit.   And it should be on every official (police, paramedics, firefighters even etc).    It's hard losing someone but it's even harder losing someone to heroin or any drug for that matter. I'm sorry for your loss, and I know it's cliche but it isn't your fault. I bet he was a good dude. Remember, try and celebrate his life and not his death.  	103

             It's a convenient argument for them -- no new national parks, less land restriction for the oil industry.

Will look it up later.   tie the ends of my tzitzis  -  The Shulchan Aruch (11:14) records such a practice, and the Rama (11:3) advises that this be done. The Mishna Berura (11:18), however, cites opinions forbidding tying knots at the end of the Tzitzit strings, and rules that one should refrain from doing so if the strings are properly woven such that unraveling is unlikely to occur.   http://www.mishnaberura.com/Default.asp?ChelekID=1 SeifID=92         But.. but... THE ULTRA-ORTHODOX JEWS!!            Correct. Of all other religions, Islam is viewed the most favorably.    does say in the torah that is say you must hate them?  No. The Torah predates Islam.  This is what [Maimonides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides) -    (1135c.-1204) wrote about Islam   Muslims are not idol worshipers at all, it has ceased to exist in their mouths and hearts, and they attribute the proper oneness to God with no blemish.   Because they lie about us, and falsely accuse us of saying God has a son (did Maimonides mean Uzayr - Ezra http://quran.com/9/30 ?), it does not mean we can lie about them and say they are idol worshipers   And if someone should say that they worship in an idolatrous shrine [the Kaaba], and an idol is hidden inside which their ancestors worshiped  this does not matter.   The hearts of those who bow down toward it today are directed to Heaven [towards God]   Regarding the Muslims today, all of them including women and children have ceased to believe in idolatry.   http://www.intellectualencounters.org/KotarApp/Viewer.aspx?nBookID=94249197#444.0.6.fitwidth  http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=1731 st= pgnum=449    monkeys  in reference to Jews  http://quran.com/7/166  http://quran.com/5/60    http://quran.com/2/65      So this Hadith is talking about Jews who did not take God or the religion of Judaism seriously.

This storeroom was open to fresh water pump room, A-109, which presumably was the battle station assigned to these men. The emergency rations at this station had been consumed and a manhole to the fresh water tanks below the pumps had been removed. A calendar which was found in this compartment had an **"X" marked on each date from December 7, 1941 to December 23, 1941 inclusive**.  http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/u/uss-west-virgina-report-of-salvage.html  http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Wallin/Wallin-E.html     It was a very difficult  salvage job and took time.   * a.

Isolate steering engine room area by watertight doors.  * d. Pump out the vessel, using about ten large pumps (10") to gain control over the inflow of water.  * e. After gaining control, stop off leaks into the hull and improve tightness of patches, watertight doors, watertight covers, etc.  * f. Apply Air pressure to tanks and voids on the port side to empty or partially empty those that were ruptured.   * g. Pump out all intact tanks and voids on the port side and empty starboard tanks and voids correspondingly.  * h. Apply air pressure to flooded areas aft in order to reduce the amount of water in those areas.  * i. Remove all weight possible, such as water, oil, stores, provisions, meat, ammunition, personal belongings,  furniture, trash, wreckage, etc.  -  The above is in general the story of the salvage of the West Virginia, **which may well be designated as a most difficult successfully completed**.

It doesn't have to be weaponized to be considered illegal.  "The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the implementing body of the Chemical Weapons Convention, classifies sarin under Schedule 1, a class reserved for lethal chemicals with few, if any, legitimate, applications."  -  The sarin Tokyo subway attacks killed only a dozen people despite it being released in a confined location with high purity  They were amateurs and were rushed and you are wrong on your assumption that it was high purity.  -  "Fortunately, the low purity of the sarin solution used in the March 20, 1995 attack and the crude delivery method reduced the number of casulties, and the presence of the pungent solvent acetonitrile allowed many commuters to detect the presence of the otherwise odorless nerve agent and flee the scene before absorbing a lethal dose. The use of plasctic bags containing the sarin mixture rather than the far more efficient method of aerosol dispersal also reduced the number of casualties... The death toll could have been far worse if the cult had had the time to prepare the attack."  -  Sadam used sarin against Iranian soldiers causing tens of thousands of casualties. Also some 3,200 to 5,000 Kurds were killed.    Well thank god the iraqis didnt weaponize fishing boats and have them shot out of cannons..  -  You wrote   even unexploded bombs from ww1. The difference is these couldnt be used for anythign   suggesting Sadam's WMDs were less lethal then WWI munitions.   I brought proof that mustard gass from WWI was still active in 2010, that it has a long shelf life. Sarcasm will not diminish the truth  You do realize that any attempt to shoot a rusting shell would cause said shell to explode in the barrel of the artillery piece, right?  Like I wrote before, the possession of the chemical agent is illegal whether it's weaponized or not.   Had you read the report you'd know that some shells were still in good condition   Also it is easy to refill a new shell or convert it to a crude bomb    Without Iraq, a large geographic barrier is present to U.S. military maneuvers.  The US military presence is well represented in the region even without Iraq.  Your assumption is absurd and not factual.

Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Malaki practically begged Obama for several thousand military personnel to remain, to train Iraqi forces and to help track down insurgents. But he stated that the Status of Forces Agreement that gave US soldiers immunity from prosecution under Iraqi law was unpopular in Iraq (especially in light of the reveal of abuses by US military contractors etc. of Iraqi citizens rights) . Obama wouldn't agree and decided pull all troops from Iraq.   It's not up to the US who runs Iraq  That's not the reason why Obama pulled the troops from Iraq.

There are many tales in Iraqi and Muslim culture of the Tigris River turning red with blood.  Here's some  In 1258 Mongols under the command of Hulagu Khan sacked Baghdad, destroying the House of Wisdom, the leading library in the leading intellectual center of the Arab world.  The House of Wisdom, founded in the eighth century, contained countless precious documents accumulated over five hundred years. Survivors said so many books were thrown into the river that the waters of the **Tigris** ran black with ink; others said the **waters were red from blood**.  -  Khalid ibn al-Walid at the [Battle of Mu'tah](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_ibn_al-Walid)  ....Then Khalid raised his hands in supplication and prayed to Allah:  "O Lord! If You give us victory, I shall see that no enemy warrior is left alive **until their river runs with their blood!**" 2  The Muslims renewed their assaults with greater fury; and Allah gave them victory. Early in the afternoon the imperial army was shattered and its soldiers fled from the battlefield. Thousands lay dead, especially in, and on the bank of, the river whose sandy bed was red with their blood.  As the Persian army fled from the battlefield, Khalid launched his cavalry after it. "Do not kill them", he ordered the cavalry. "Bring them back alive." 3 The bed of the river was soaked with blood ... but the river was not "running with blood" as Khalid had pledged!    1. Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 561. 2. Tabari: Vol. 2, p. 561. 3. Ibid.....  -  ....Furthermore, to call what happened a "killing of prisoners" is an oversimplification. Normally they would have been killed in the pursuit, as had happened before and would happen again, with no questions asked. In this battle Khalid had pledged to make the river run with blood, so those thousands of men, instead of being killed in the pursuit, were brought to the river and killed. And that is all that there is to the episode of the River of Blood....  -  Read more: http://www.grandestrategy.com/2007/12/sword-of-allah-chapter-22-river-of.html#ixzz3UsvfkB80   Not to long ago ISIS beheaded 1,500 at the Tigris river while trying to perform the [Dabiq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dabiq)    "[/u/yummyluckycharms](https://nu.reddit.com/user/yummyluckycharms)  **munitions isnt wmd - its ammo**"  -  Not when it's filled.

 The Houston player hit the shit out of the kid in the stands    God bless    This was happening before ios8 but thanks for the tip I'll try it      I am not trying to be rude but don't care how the game ends just try your best and think about doing well during the game, its high school soccer not the end of the world so take it easy.   I play soccer I gotta be bigger other wise I've enjoyed the time.   I eat a lot tho and do I go againts feeling full!    I'm too skinny    Instead of what I say nigga whut    Minecraft is on ps4 now   Exactly what I wanted it works for me thanks    Yes and yes you can jailbreak this tablet   Yep that's it and I know but there isn't a sub for it       That was the funniest video    I thought this was cute don't know why you're downvoted    Your school uses whiteboards? All of ours have been replaced with touch screen smart boards    Why is everyone starting with some say?

 Amazing. TIL that a dolphin that is 1 second old could out swim Michael Phelps.    Why are there so many mistakes in the subtitles?  "en Franais" translated to "all poulet"   That you can't use regular dish soap in the dishwasher...the floor needed a good mopping anyways.   You can take this a step further and program a shortcut as well. I use ctrl, shift, S. It's much faster than opening the search bar.    Does anyone know if this will help or hinder their stock in the short term?  I expect it will help long term.    We did this in Montreal recently for NHL game 7 vs. Boston.  Tickets were $11 instead of hundreds and all the proceeds from the ticket sales went to charity (concession sales weren't donated).  It offered the feel and crowd of a real NHL game to a lot of people that can't afford to go otherwise.  Tickets sold out in just a couple of hours.   Not in this case because he never puts his hand over the puck, but just pushes it out of the net.  If he placed his hand over the puck during the save then it would have been a penalty shot.   Imagine how awesome this would be if all of the research into graphene pans out. The panels would be infinitely cheaper, more efficient, stronger and basically transparent.    I keep waiting for his videos to feel tired, but he always has great new material and makes it feel fresh.  Each one seems better than the last.   Don't forget to vote tomorrow!  	10
 *some* of them care about those things , plenty of others just want to provide helpful answers. I've answered lots of stack exchange questions and don't care about all that "is it relevant enough, did enough people reply/view this, is it interesting enough, is it truly a question blah blah -- all those are subjective; to the person asking the question and others searching for the same question later, it *is* relevant/important. The site didn't used to be so "snobby" and "elitist" and was therefore more helpful to the average person. I stopped contributing for that reason.   This ^   They flag too many questions/answers that are helpful and of interest to "non expert" programmers, making the site less useful and certainly less friendly.    Russians are definite contenders. I'm not sure Iran or SA have the capability    Definitely which is a common saying. "Long live China"    I wasn't aware of the direct correlation between rank and price. Is that common for books?    Most likely "killing in a way that some westerners would not consider humane" became "torture".  As for media lies, look up Fox News reports on "no go zones" in Paris :)   cidian. zidian would be  (dictionary of characters rather than words)    The question should be whether he did a good job or not. If he did, his former education or lack of it, is irrelevant. Plenty of incompetent people have degrees and vice versa.    Not so. You should see some of the environmental friendly houses built in Scandinavia    What? So the team that knocked off OBL just happened to die in a crash?    Don't confuse "trading partners" with "friends".    True. But since the china gov also has motive,  manpower and skill to pull this off, this makes them more likely to be the source   Good. Alternatives to Reddit will only help Reddit get better and/or provide users with more options. I generally like Voat so far, though the communities are still quite small for many subverses.    I've lived in China for 4 years and I have to agree that American police are much scarier than Chinese police -- that is, until you're arrested (I haven't experienced that) as there is less respect for procedures and anything can happen.    So Japan and Western Europe are full of criminals roaming around free?    On that we agree. I would never have paid full price - or let my daughter take out a loan for it - for the college she will attend    There is plenty of data that says otherwise.   	18
 You guys can start by playing together, why not exchange RSC IDs? I play most of the time with a friend I made online and I have crazy fun. We're on the same crew and we are all from around here, it's awesome, and it started with 2 people.   tres*   This. Most of advertisement isn't about making your brand famous as much as making it establish a "personality" in what's called branding.    Of course there's a subreddit for that   ^^^^^^http://i.imgur.com/iPHKHy3.png   I'm sure we aren't one of those species.   /u/trollabot test_subject8498   Cat.

But yeah, this could be possible.   And we got to find out he's packing.    *"Guess again"*   Amazing light, I love it.   Holy shit, that gives perspective...   Kryptonian, male. Also an adopted orphan. Please, insult me.   I don't know if I would call him a fucking scumbag, he regularly played with his viewers when he was on LoL and gave them a few tips. He wasn't great but he wasn't bad either, and never played too seriously, that doesn't make him a bad person, just someone who saw the opportunity at that audience and took it. It isn't always about super tryharding games and learning when watching, there are also a bunch of streams out there that like PL's have more of a comic tone and that's also alright. If people didn't like him they should've closed the stream, not sending the fucking SWAT team to his house.   Ah, I get it now. Thanks :)   How's this? Sorry, I don't get the joke. Could you explain it to me, please?   The best meme is the no meme.   *Slowly, cell by cell, one bot at a time,  Reddit was becoming sentient.

Auspici esta pelea laboratorios Merck   Congrats! And I hope the random gods favor me!    Random question, if I buy a weaponised insurgent, the one with the machinegun, do I have to call it in contact missions (such as a Buzzard) or does it spawn like a regular car?   I dont understand why they didn't make a bunch of voice packs and make  you choose one when you create the character. Well, of course I understand it's way cheaper to don't do so, but it really sucks having mute chars.   Technically you are saying that the quote you made is incorrect. But I also read to always skip sentences that begin with "technically", so...

Imagine going into the kitchen and that slut is making a fucking mermelade, stearing and shit, putting on some godly lemon juice in it, and that amazing ass is bursting out some fucking yoga pants and you don't go to school because your fucking tummy ached so she gives you a mermelade covered blowjob and there's fucking cum all over everywhere, the gardener just watches in silence and cries for your fucking lost innocence a bit but that's alright because he kind of likes it a little bit and lets you play with his tools    Fuck man I'd love to have her as my mom      God damn psychologists.   Just the post I needed   I want dibs on the corpse, where do I lick it?   After reading your comment I went back to check the link. Those are some sick artworks, man. I bet you could find a way to post them in other subreddits and gain attention. As a professional photographer I also reccomend you invest into Facebook advertising, it really works and for little money. Sorry I'm writing all of this here, I'm on mobile and can't figure out how to send a PM from here.

Honestly it doesn't seem that bad to me (it's a bit weird place to put that ad) but well, it explains the dislikes.   For what it's worth, I actually believe you did a great job with the voiceover. It's nice to see more voice variety in these.   Literally balls of steel   There are only 10 types of people in the world:those who understand binary, and those who don't.   You better use the /s   No hay problema!   Exactamente.   Es muy posible. No s si harn autopsia (calculo que s), ah seguramente saldr bien qu fue. Ten en cuenta que la causa de muerte puede haber sido originada en cualquier lado, no exclusivamente en el corazn. Por ejemplo, puede haber sido un ACV, un tromboembolismo pulmonar, un cogulo arrojado por un tumor en cualquier rgano, una falla cardaca, etc etc, la lista es largusima. Para detectar cualquiera de estas cosas se necesitaran exmenes bastante especficos, lo ms leve siendo el ejemplo de un tumor que puse que en cualquier TC salen las masas, pero dudo que les hagan tomografas a todos los jugadores como parte de un examen fsico rutinal.   Lo que s no existe es la "muerte sbita" en el sentido que est todo ok con tu cuerpo y de repente sin motivo te mors. Cuando se habla de muerte sbita se refiere a que sin razn aparente la persona fallece, pero el motivo siempre existe, el tema es encontrarlo. A veces se puede, otras veces no. Las enfermedades que comparten esta caracterstica de origen desconocido se denominan "idiopticas", la muerte sbita se podra bien llamar "muerte idioptica". En una autopsia es mucho ms fcil encontrar la causa porque no tens la limitacin de mantener a la persona viva o saludable, pods tocar lo que quieras sin preocuparte mucho y encontrs bien todo. Esperemos que lo hagan.   Me cans de aclarar esto ya. TODAS las ambulancias tienen desfibrilador, no lo utilizaron porque al desfibrilador no sirve para reanimar corazones detenidos como muestran en las pelculas, sirve para volver el corazn a ritmo en una fibrilacin ventricular, cosa que el pibes no tuvo.  Y aunque haya tenido vfib, te mata en segundos, la nica chance de usar un desfibrilador es tenerlo muy a mano y con un diagnstico seguro de que el sntoma es fibrilacin ventricular (no auricular). Desfibrilar a alguien con un paro cardiaco tiene el mismo efecto que meterle el dedo meique en la oreja.   I would not like to meat that fate.

The one of the kid who believes is the best at absolutely everything, happened here on Reddit a couple of years ago.

[Obligatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkTHtWX7CCY)   WOW   my god fuck    I'm atheist and even I thought that was beautiful to read and really comforting. It's obviously very well meant and that's the only thing that I need to feel better.       /u/ibleeedorange, I *think* he stopped with the massive posts but he was kind of big too   That's literally what he said...   Yeah, I'm officially done replying to you. I hope you find a way to talk less arrogantly about your opinions and open your mind to advice a little bit, it's so pointless to talk this way that I'm done wasting my time.  Adis!   I just saw this, thanks so much for sharing it here!   I wasn't trying to lecture you, Jeez... I just disagreed with how you felt that your struggles were more complainable and your ex-BF didn't have the right to complain about what happened to him.   EDIT: To expand a bit, you said "I have a hard time relating to people who had it easy. And I hate to say it, but I often find it hard to have sympathy for them when they tell me about their struggles". This is wrong, because to other people YOU are complaining about non important things (think of the example of the kid who couldn't go to school, and you're complaining about going to twelve of them). So, in a way, you also had it "easy". I'm not saying your struggles aren't worth of complain, quite the contrary, I'm saying everyone's elses also are.   I seems that I've offended you. I'm sorry, that wasn't my intention at all, I believe you've misinterpreted my post. It wasn't either an agression, nor a comment about your lack of empathy (which I never said was the case).   Please try to give it another read.   I'm sure am :) With the power of therapy and a lot of help and love from my close family, I like to think I managed to transform the whole shit package to something nicer. It's cool to get good things about bad situations. It's hard as fuck, I won't lie to you on that one, but it's good.    I also believe this will be a edging (is that the word I'm looking for) matter on my life for a long time, maybe for ever. I will continue to try getting good things out of it, and remember the bad memories as something far away from my current reality.    Thanks for your kind wishes.   Well, I get your point, but as I somewhat stated above, I think it's all about personal experiences and points of view. I'm sure to your ex-BF changing to 3 schools was really hard, because in his personal experience that was (maybe) one of the worst things or the hardest things he has lived. For you and me, that's not as hard, because we changed schools a lot more, and we view that as "a piece of cake". For us changing 12 schools (I'm on 9 here) was a lot of struggle, but if a uneducated child from a poorer situation hears us, he says "well, what are you complaining about? at least you got to go to school".     Everyone experiences only one life, one point of view, and their standars for best and worst are as valid as yours or mine. At the same time, a lot of people hears my story or others here and goes "wow, that's super awful", which it is, but honestly it sounds worse if you compare it to their situation, to me it was horrible, but it also felt like what "normal" was. Later on on life I found out that this wasn't the regular thing, let alone the acceptable thing to happen to a kid.    What I'm trying to say is that empathy is a powerful feeling. Maybe on of the most. There is always going to be someone who has it worse, and someone who has it best. Another quick example before I bore you with all this; you know when you see someone with lots of money and say "wow, if only I can have that... I could be so much happier!". Well, rest assured that someone else has thought the same thing about your situation sometime. Maybe a homeless guy, maybe someone who wishes has your looks, maybe someone who wishes education, I don't know. I believe that gives me some perspective about thinking in other people's shoes.   No problem, I did on another comment though so I'll paste it here.  I had lot of trouble eating because he was yelling drunk all the time and hitting things, so sometimes (most of the times actually) I didn't eat much, he would force me to, I would puke because, you know, I was a fucking kid, and he would made me eat that too.   Argentina. Incredible shitty laws and justice system in general. You won't believe what people can do unpunished here.   Of course, I'm from Argentina.   Ha, thanks a lot! I wrote wrong a few words but I'm glad I could get the general message across.   Probably. I honestly don't care, his personality doesn't affect me any longer. I just see him a couple of hours once every other month.   Argentina!   The law enforcement here is a mafia, I'll give you that, but there's 0 protection towards citizens. We all feel uncomfortable when we have cops around, they all treat us like shit and are corrupt as hell.   Thanks, it sure sucked, but then my mother grew strength from what seemed thin air and kicked him out when I was 9. He was a religious fanatic, and he prohibited my mom to work because he said psychologists practice arts from the devil, and that she was possessed by demons. That led to my mom and I having no money when he left (and of course I didn't hear from him for 4 years) buy we were happier than ever.    My mom then met this amazing guy who she's married to now, and he has been my father in a lot more aspects than the biologic one, so I appreciate that a lot as well and I'm grateful for it :)   I had lot of trouble eating because he was yelling drunk all the time and hitting things, so sometimes (most of the times actually) I didn't eat much, he would force me to, I would puke because, you know, I was a fucking kid, and he would made me eat that too.   The law force in my country is absolutely non existent, as the justice system. For example, just yesterday a judge lightened the sentence of a rapist who had abused a 6 year old kid saying that "the kid is gay so there isn't much damage to be done". Seriously. You can look it up, happened yesterday in Argentina.      Besides, my mother feared the shit out of my father.   Yes, I totally worded that wrong, haha, sorry.   It's rough, and it sucks, but being in a similar position I can tell you that most of us who get shitty parents find a way to grow stronger and develop more resilience with it. Of course this isn't all cases, sadly. It sounds super harsh and rough because you are seeing it from a perspective of a more happier family, but at least in my case it helped to build a stronger self and more generally responsible of my life. It's amazing the things we can endure when we have to.    My dad put a loaded gun on my mom's mouth and said to her that if she didn't get an abortion, he would kill her. That was before I was born (I'm 23 now), and that's on top of years of hiting both of us, making me eat puke, fucking my aunt, and tons of other monstruous things. Luckily they divorced when I was 10 or so, and I got an amazing step father not so much later on.    I didn't see it happen, but I know it did because he admitted to it after I confronted him with the truth. He's much different now, and I *kind of* get along, but I will never forgive what he did to my mother on that ocasion.    Sorry if I have bad grammar, English isn't my first language.    Edit: for those of you saying she should've reported him to the police, I don't live in a very much civilized country. The law system and enforcement here absolutely sucks. The only thing that happens when a woman reports her husband here is that then police show up if you're lucky, takes a few notes and then leaves, and I'm not even exaggerating, it's how it works. She didn't do it because she feared getting murdered and I totally understand her for it. She was married to a very insane man in a very shitty country, she got lucky to even got a divorce and be alive.   That was a difficult link to read   What you get when you leave a spider and a truck alone in a room for enough time   Excellent video and amazing editing, congratulations!   Los horarios son una garcha mal, si no lo hara :(   If I "see" (more like their event horizons) two black holes about to merge from earth with a nice good hypothetical telescope, I would actually never see it happen because of time dilation, right?   Is it posible that time could have more dimentions than the one we can perceive and it could be transited through it like we transit space?   Shit, they even formed back to positions after the match was suspended. That was some disrespectul behaviour if I've seen one.    Have you seen the sequels of Matrix? That's right, you haven't, because they don't exist.   It's like when you're driving buy paying more attention to the minimap... doesn't go well very often   We'll fix that in 1.0.2.  	105

 You might want to avoid using YouTube's stabilization feature/effect. When I attempted to watch your video I couldn't look at it for more than ten seconds without feeling sick.    Atr is, basically, a mall that is directly attached to the Akihabara train station so the doors to it is a prime advertising opportunity.    The typesetting is wrong. =Isla   = a (Sounds like "ah" in English)   = i (Sounds like "e" in English)   = ra (The sound for "r" in Japanese is the same as how it is in Spanish)  I'm not sure where the s came from, but that is Isla's name in katakana which is how it was written on the board.  ---  Edit: Just for fun, the other two names are right but I'll also give the katakana spelling of it.   (Zakku) - The , when it is small like that, is used for the repetition of the consonant after the character and it is expressed in as a pause which results in an emphasis.   (Tsukasa) - It is interesting that his name is also listed in katakana rather than the hiragana/kanji for it as katakana is normally reserved for foreign words/names that are listed for japanese pronunciation.    Yep, if you go back to the first fight between Archer and Saber it shows Archer saying "Trace On" without being able to hear it.   k   That is closer to a TLC (Translation Checker) than a proofreader. Typically a proofreader is someone who checks just the English for grammatical errors and such.   Apparently the manga has a nutritionalist/chef on board in order to make the dishes sound, look and actually be possible to make while tasting good.   k   [Done.](https://strawpoll.me/4250793)   As for the flair, even I'm not sure.

Just giving you a heads up, there is a lot of drama in the series and some people feel as though it is forced.   Have you tried holding R while clicking on the save? It would boot you into recovery to which you can then install the CFW.   /u/trollabot test_subject8528   [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUamHEvVQy0) is my favorite instrumental cover of *Cruel Angel's Thesis*.   Huh, maybe Steins;Gate isn't that far off.   Yeah, if I remember correctly that was the main reason the US Mint stopped doing that.   It is basically an updated version of the old US Mint airline millage method people used a number of years back. People buy money for a 1:1 transaction right from the US Mint using their credit card and then use the cash to pay off their credit card, keeping the points.   How in the world can you get from the US to Japan for $300? I could see how $3000 would work, but not $300!   As for a Japanese comparison, the *Kyoukai Senjou no Horizon* series could compare in scope as the first volume alone is thicker than some full dictionaries.    Do it! The HD659's are available from Adorama Camera for ~$275 right now and their MSRP is $500.   For those of you in Japan, it is actually a really cool museum that focuses on science and technology.   I was able to go to Miraikan last year and it was one of my favorite museums out of the ones my class trip went to. (It is also pretty close to the 1:1 Gundam as well)   Some examples I have found:   * The avatar for "god" in NouCome being that of the failed restoration painting.  * A character's avatar in *Asobi ni Ikuyo* is named "[Ender](https://i.imgur.com/3opJA94.jpg)" from the titular book *Ender's Game*. [A W Fast Food Restaurant](https://i.imgur.com/a3QzHTl.jpg) in the same episode. The teacher's computer is called [HAL.](https://i.imgur.com/paTy6ZJ.jpg)  * The book "Hyperion" showing up in The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya.   I've noticed that every so often, I'll find a reference to a piece of western media in the anime that I watch.   What are some examples of this and what is referencing? More importantly, why was it referenced in the context of the plot?    /u/automoderator  picks up a lot of the slack when it comes to smaller subreddits, especially with a set of well defined rules and actions.   Probably for the DVD and Blurays   I never knew that the guys behind CotN, made Incredibots! I loved that flash game as a kid and I remember making a number of rube goldberg contraptions in it.   You might want to give some more direction than just light novels, as it gives those who respond a better sense of what you like or would hold your interest.  In any case, you might want to check out /u/ugotmal's really good ["Introduction to Light Novels" post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Animesuggest/comments/2z7yio/looking_to_get_into_light_novels_but_dont_know/) as it lists a number of good series that people have liked.   Rather than a light novel, I'd like to suggest an OEL web novel series, ["Until Death?"](http://www.royalroadl.com/fiction/629) that is hosted over on Royal Road. (I do not normally read fan fiction, but this one was suggested over on /r/lightnovels and I really enjoyed it.) There is a prequel, but I would suggest reading UD first.   I wish he had used Hinagiku's old design rather the the "new" one.   This is more common in shoujo manga adaptations than from other demographics. So, yes, this is "allowed" in anime but shoujo adaptations are fairly rare nowadays.   I'm surprised that no one caught how, in the beginning of the episode, there was a single blue bird and a single fish but after the confession there was a couple for both the fish and bird.  The only issue is that one of the birds should have been a paler color rather than both being vibrant. (Normally the vibrant birds are males and the duller ones are female.)  EDIT: Same with the dogs and their handlers/owners.   It is possible, follow the guides but put the INSTALL.ZIP in the TNV folder rather than the game save.  You'll transfer the tnv save rather than the ape escape save.   You have to add it to the TNV folder not the game save. I had the same issue when transferring over some backed up PSP games that I own.   They have also done a few mobile games and such as well.    Not so much "Getting really huge", but there is always [White Album 2](http://myanimelist.net/anime/18245/White_Album_2). **Do NOT watch White Album** as other than sharing a song, it is not related. They are even from different source material as WA as a management sim like idolm@ster and WA2 was an visual novel.   Lets try and figure out if it is possible.  This napkin math, so it is only in the ball park:  ----  Hours of anime per season (aniHour): (35 shows * 12 episodes * 23.5 minutes)/60 minutes = 164.5  Hours of anime per year (aniYear): aniHour * 4 = 658  Hours per year, including leap day: 8766  Approximate years that anime has been solidly running: 40  Total hours of anime so far (airedHours): aniYear * 40 = 26320 hours  Days to finish all anime (without catching up with currently airing) (curAirTime): airedHours / 24 = ~1098 (3.006 years or ~ 3 years and 2 days)  Hours of anime aired during completion (compCatch): 3.006 * aniYear = ~3952 hours  Completing that set: (compCatch / 24) = ~165 days  \# of Seasons while completing set #1: 165/(365.25/4) = 1.80698  Time to complete set #2: 1.80698*658 = ~1200 hours (50 days)  Catching up again: 50/(365.25/4) = 0.5475 seasons * aniHour = 360 hours (~15 days)  Catching up #4: ((15/(365.25/4)) * aniHour) = 108.09 hours (~4.5 days)  ---  TL;DM: **3 years and 221.5 days (31596 hours)** of non-stop anime watching to catch up to what has and will be aired. This does NOT account for movies or other forms of anime.  Also, long running and dual/split season shows are part of the 35 shows a season.   Another tip for when you are shopping for stuff in Akihabara or Nakano Broadway, find what you want and make a mental note about it and how much it was but then go around the look for it again.   Case in point, I was able to find [this](http://myfigurecollection.net/item/111864) Saber figure for ~$12 in one store and $29 in another and both of them were in Nakano Broadway.    /u/Internets might have only seen Amagi Brilliant Park, where Moffle was the main park mascot. (The author of FMP and Amagi are the same and they got the license to reuse the same character designs in Amagi.)   [PONY PONY PONY](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_KXf3kwjKQ0)   Fell free to recommend visual novels unlike what some users might state. There are ~27.5k subscribers on here so more people will see it than other places.   I like these posts as often time the episode comes out while I am in class or away from my computer and it allows me to get a feel for how the episode will go when I watch it.   I've seen the horrors that are "Sanrio Puroland", I am still scarred by it.   Imagine "It's A Small World" from any of the Disney parks, crank it up to 11 and then coupled with "Hello Kitty" stuff and put in all in Japanese and you have Sanrio Puroland.   Thing is, HMA is not a VPN but a proxy.   It looks pretty fun, sort of like a cross of Mirror's Edge and Distance/Nitronic Rush.  The key to this would be how the controls are as it could make or break this.   Yeah, I thought I got the F/Z soundtrack as well but I ended up getting the OST for the radio drama rather than the anime. Oops. Heck, it is still sealed at home. I guess that is why it was ~$3.   This is a little bit different of a request as it isn't, directly, of an anime.  What are some really good anime soundtracks that can stand on their own for listening to?  So far, I own the soundtracks to:  * Clannad * Little Busters * Angel Beats * Girls und Panzer  I'm looking to get, sometime in the near future:  * Cowboy Bebop (All three soundtracks) * Sora no Woto * Suzumiya Haruhi no Gensou (This is the live orchestral performance of the OST and some insert songs)  Amazon.co.jp charges ~$12 per shipment overseas and $2-3 per item so I'm trying to save on shipping.   I wasn't finding fault! It is just that there are only three human moderators with /u/chiefnoah helping with the CSS and we can't catch everything.  (Thankfully AutoModerator is a lot of help)   When you see something like this, please report it! I only caught it since I was looking through /new/.   I never said that you said it was empty. My reply was based off of your "You need to put stuff there for him [the player] to find." to which I pointed out some examples that I know of off the top of my head.   The developers did put things out there for people to find even when the player has no need to head over there such as the chair and wine overlooking the sea to the cheese wheel shield on top of the hill in Crestwood.   You don't have to grind at all. The developers made it clear to the player that they are to keep on moving and explore the world. If you want to stay in the Hinterlands, good and it would be a massive grind but you'd have so much "power" that the rest of the game that they designed the player to see would be trivial and glossed over.   Source: Went to a keynote last week by the creative developer of the Dragon Age and Mass Effect series at ECGC.   What is cool about this is that you can actually find and run, in time with the song the level on your own. There are about three fail points and they are all early on. (Less than 90 seconds in) I remember showing this to people in high school on an emulator.   Here is a black and white'd then inverted version of this episode's end card if people want to see the line work. Link: https://i.imgur.com/uVb8NJ3.png  (This is great if you want to sketch or trace the art for practice.)   I think they are wondering how Archer and the other guy can create numerous blades out of thin air and throw them over a long distance in a ranges attack.    If you are out there shooting, things will happen for you. If youre not out there, youll only hear about it.  Jay Maisel  EDIT: For some context, Jay Maisel is one of the more famous natural light photographers. You may not know it, but you have most likely seen his work.   Plus Asakura hummed *Hare Hare Yukai* while cooking in the last episode. They know what the fans want to see and hear when it comes to the Haruhi series. (Man, I hope this sells well enough to encourage a third season that goes past Disappearance)   If you like them, look into getting turkey breasts or thighs instead of legs. The legs have a lot of tendons and extra bits that makes it harder to eat.   Psst, if you ever want to know why you tagged a certain person click on the tag (like you would to edit it) and copy the link in the "link" section. That gives you the post where you tagged that user.   The manga is really good but sadly isn't available officially in English. It switches between regular manga and 4-koma as the need arises which is nice as you get the benefits of both. The art is really good as well.   Source: I own the first volume in Japanese.   No, but he can scroll through the comments on his account and see how many times he has been asked that question.    That being said, I did think that something might be up when the show displayed the Yamaha logo without switching it to something else (Yamada, Yawaha, etc).  Well, Shigatsu no Uso had the Steinway logo and pianos in the show but I don't think Steinway helped fund the anime. Odds are they bought the licensing rights to the visuals and sounds of the various instruments from Yamaha.      Crazy thing is, they have the original voice cast so _____ is voiced by the same person.   The answer is yes, but _____ has a slightly different personality. (If you watch the first episode it is evident who I am referring to.)   When in doubt, go to one of the FORD topics:  **F**amily  **O**ccupation  **R**ecreation  **D**irection (Goals)   The only bad part about it is that there are only 4 routes, but there are enough developed characters to have 7 or more. (I think the fandisk has these routes, but they are not in the base game.)   I'm not the person you responded to, but I have heard good things about Private Internet Access. ($40 a year) According to Lifehacker and TorrentFreak, PIA doesn't keep logs of your traffic.   Second season started today!   Oops, I haven't seen the episode yet. (I've been away from my computer all day)   That is 3143.333 days of continuous operation. (~9 years and 4 months)   Pretty much wait for the thread by /u/shadoxfix to come out since he has a bot running on his account that will instantly post a related episode discussion thread.   951   Better yet, while the osu!coin thing was an april fools joke, they added a bindable key in the "inputs" section to allow a faster retry than CTRL+R. Default is ~ (to the left of the 1 on a QWERTY keyboard) but I changed mine to Left CTRL.   I know a guy who is in his mid-thirties and he is still doing stuff like that. It is really sad to see as a college student that some people can't step back and see what they are doing to themselves and others.   There are more ways to obtain logins than breaching the servers such as people using the same password everywhere and their account login for another site was compromised. They could have brute-forced the passwords off of a known password dictionary as well.   It is slice of life and sports anime wrapped in a light-hearted fantasy shell with characters who look somewhat like animals.   Okay, who is going to make a new CMDR with a sequence of six numbers starting with the number six?   I'm fairly new to the game and I took a break for about ten months as I was busy or I was playing other games. I've only ever played against the AI and I was wondering how I could do better or improve my CS.  Lately I've been playing Ahri as mid, but I've felt squishy at times. What are some basic tips for someone who is new and plays Ahri?   I'm not the dev, but I have played against him multiple times and he was really receptive of the feedback. Heck, I noticed something fishy on the Arcade leaderboards, sent a PM on reddit and he responded and took care of it.   Not sure if you are being sarcastic. They are just doing that with the adaptation of *The Disappearance of Nagato Yuki* which is starting either next week or the following.   I'd like to win, it would help a lot with paying my tuition.   When I'm by myself, and sometimes when I think no one else is around, I'll talk myself through my schedule for the day or the next few hours. I've found that it has improved my time management, but I don't leave enough time to relax and if I miss or mess up throughout the day it makes me feel worse.  An example of what I say to myself: "Get up, get dressed, go to class, lunch, back to room, work on ______, go to class, back to my room, dinner, room." (Where tim in my room means that i am working on stuff unless I am done or it is too late to be coherent)   Through looking at the traffic on a recent post of mine, I found that a website is rehosting any and all content that reaches the front page of a certain subreddit.   Is this allowed? If not, what can I do to report it?   If you want a story where the actual Roman Empire and a modern military fought, there is [this comment series](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/k067x/could_i_destroy_the_entire_roman_empire_during/) from /u/Prufrock451 where he writes a story with this exact scenario.  Warner Brothers bought the rights to the story to make it into a movie, but nothing has come to fruition yet. There is a subreddit for it: /r/RomeSweetRome.   I have fixed your flair. You had it as "Suggestion" but the correct one was "request" since you are *request*ing show(s) to watch.  Please remember to select the correct flair next time.   Thankfully once you are through the mailslot, you don't have to worry about oxygen.   I wasn't buying rares, but hawking commodities 9ly each way for 1.5k a ton one way and 300 the other.   I never knew about rares...   I am not the person you responded to, but I guess I did it wrong. I started out by doing commodity trading in a sidewinder then an adder and then a cobra. I recently decided to try fighting in RES and it is a lot more fun, especially since I don't have to toil away at making 25k credits every ten or so minutes.   I've found that following its recommendations for what squares to pick to be the best ones. (There is some liberty when it has multiple ones and they are in no particular order when that happens)   It determined, based on your entries, that the diagonal from the Upper Left to the Bottom Right was the best option to choose. Expected MGP is the average of the possible results based upon the possible unknown numbers. It just so happened that you got the 3600 MGP result, which is the second highest result in the mini cactpot.   Anything that pays over 100 MGP is considered a profit. Not every card has a 1 2 3 sequence in it. This program helps the user determine what is the highest paying row/column/diagonal to choose based upon the known numbers.   Considering the attribution along the top, probably none. I, originally, had this done and ready for people to use back on February 27th which was before these sites implemented his code. I didn't release it because I was unsure of what license he wanted the code to be released under. I released it now because it has been two and a half weeks since the last post from him and I am unsure if, or when, I will even hear back.  If that site is working for you, then great!   The only reason people would want to use this code/program is if they wanted something that they could easily open rather than remembering to go to those types of sites.   The CS program here uses linux, fedora to be exact, and it is more so on the algorithmic side of things rather than the functional code that an end user would use.   It is what it is, what I should do is learn how to do GUIs in my spare time since it would be useful.   If you just want to download the file, skip to the "Downloads" section, otherwise read on.  **Nitty, gritty details:**  ---  **Who am I:** I am a senior in college going for a BS in Computer Science and a BA in Communications - Interactive Media and Game Design. I have been using C and C++ for the past four years and have done a number of projects using the language.  A while back, I saw /u/Aureolux's [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/2x7m81/i_made_another_cactpot_solver_web_app/coygzrs?context=3) where he posted a perfect cactpot solver with the hopes that it would be useful for someone. Well, I took the program and fiddled around with it and made it as such that the user no longer has to define their squares by setting the values within the program itself nor do they have the compile it multiple times in a effort to solve one mini-cactpot.  The algorithm is not ideal, but it can brute-force all of the possibilities within a second or so with a single square defined and after that it gets faster.  I've tried to make it easy to use. For example, if you had the number 4 in the bottom right, in the program you would put "br 4" (Without the quotes of course). **It does not have a GUI interface**, but prompts from a command-line box since I do not know how to do GUI stuff on Windows.  I contacted /u/Aureolux about two and a half weeks ago asking him what license he would like for this program to be released under but I have yet to hear anything. Considering that he just uploaded it online to mediafire and provided a link, I have put it under the MIT License.  **Downloads** --- --- **Here is the link to the github**: https://github.com/test_subject8528/FFXIV_Perfect_Cactpot  If you just want the exe file, it is within the /bin/ folder.   The [VirusTotal for the binary came up with 3 detections](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/39a6d4f639d17448e8e95e394a8b30d102da7ecd3f237eca046f7199a6b83c2b/analysis/1426565888/) from "Cyren", "F-Prot" and "Rising" antivirus.   **The .cpp file is clean**, according to [VirusTotal.](https://www.virustotal.com/en/file/5141b7e0d4d9c78cdf5503404246797129c4a618039f60e0c5afe3e765f59d41/analysis/1426566707/) Odds are, the three programs view the GCC compiler as weak or used to create malware enough that it just outright blocks it.  All I did was compile the .cpp file using [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) with the included GCC compiler. **If you do not trust the file, feel free to download and compile it yourself!**   Heck, doing "000[K|k]" (without the quotes) has blocked 99% of the gil spam that I used to get.  It has, definitely, made playing the game more fun since I am not getting a message every two to three minutes.

It is useless because I was part of a choir that did it a year ago. While I can still sing it, I do not have any opportunities to do it right now... :(   It is a fun piece to do as well.   You don't, necessarily, need an amp for the 650s. My old iPod classic can drive them pretty well.   Jeez, it seems as though every month or so someone has beaten the previous LoZ:OoT speedrun.   I wonder when the first sub 18 run will come out.   The other issue with the piano is whether or not Steinway would allow the figure maker to produce a scale model of their pianos. Granted, grand pianos are pretty similar in design, but the fans who would be buying said figures would demand quality rather than a substitution.    How does the DAC in the iPod Classic (5th) gen stack up compared to Fiio's or other DAPs?  I've been running my classic with rockbox for the past few months now and I like it but I was wondering if there was something better that has larger storage capabilities through micro SDs and what not that I should be looking at.     At this point, other than some of the backer rewards you aren't missing too much. I think Sekai will have the physical version available for people to buy when the game comes out and it will also be on Steam which means that you can get it on day one when it releases.  If you wanted the OST, it is available on the US iTunes along with Key's other CDs. (The only thing you'd be missing here is the booklet which has the lyrics, vocal sheet music, comments and the nice three cd case.) -- That is based off the Japanese physical release of the OST and may not reflect that of the Kickstarter release.   You can go in wherever, but the common courtesy that players have started to do is go in/out on the side with green lights to help minimize collisions.   Unless you only reddit from a mobile device.   It could also be stuck in the LA Harbor blockade/strike. A lot of imports from Japan are getting held up by that. That is why, in part, stuff like the WiiU Gamecube Adapter are hard to find.   It is, it is a what if _________ hadn't done _________ and it became _______.    It just happened to me and I am wonder how it turned out for others.   Not so much fan fiction but it is an official side story that tells a what-if when it comes to a certain event.   I guess it makes sense. I found it weird that the Federation had big red skulls outside their outposts.  It was just jarring to open the map and get confronted with a lot of red dots.   I just installed 1.2 and I went into the Galaxy map and every color is opposite of what it was in 1.1.  What I mean by flipped is that Federation - Empire and Alliance - Independent have swapped colors.  Federation used to be blue and now it is red. Alliance used to be yellow and now it is green.  I am using the standard HUD colors so this couldn't be the cause of the issue.   How can I fix this or is this something that FD purposefully did?   My thought is that if they found a massive issue while applying the update to the servers that people would still have the 1.1 client and they could revert the servers and allow people to continue to play.   It might be the surprise hit, but there is a lot of contention this coming season for AOTS: (Note that I am listing the big name ones, not what I feel as though could be AOTS)  * Disappearance of Nagato Yuki - (aka More Haruhi and it has the original voice cast)  * Fate/Stay Night - Unlimited Blade Works S2  * Gintama  * High School DxD BorN - (While it is an ecchi series, it has been hyped up quite a bit)  * Hibike! Euphonium - (KyoAni doing a music show)  * Hello! Kiniro Mosaic  * Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Vivid - (While it isn't popular on here, the series is well received and has a lot of fans)  * Nisekoi S2  * Knights of Sinonia S2  * Shokugeki no Souma - (Well received manga)  * Yahari Ore no Seishun Love Comedy wa Machigatteiru Zoku - (aka Yahari S2)  * Yamada-lun to Nananin no Majo - (Manga is well received and people like the characters)   That isn't too bad, about 20 more minutes.   /u/orniver is poking fun at this series compared to Bake*monogatari*, Nise*monogatari*, *Monogatari* Second Season, etc which are all parts of a larger story/series.  While *monogatari* may invoke that notion, the word "monogatari" means "story".     New repair sequence feature; if one of your modules is destroyed, you can cannibalize parts from another module to repair it.  This would have helped yesterday as I had my thrusters shot out by an NPC. (That is what I get for trying to run rather than fighting.)  	123
 No, he was never an employee of the school staff where Sam attended. From what pieces I could put together, he was a complete stranger who befriended my son at school. The school he attended had woods surrounding it, thus, from the only conclusion I could come too, Jon lured my son into the woods when they chatted. As I stated, I wish I asked more questions as to what happened at school and also as to who Jon was. I'm very sorry for any confusion I may have caused. Thank for reading.   I really enjoyed reading this and found it to be really well written. Overall, good job my friend! :]   I heard three knocks. Just three loud, head aching knocks and that was it. I got up and walked to the door. I looked through the peep hole and saw just an open hand in the field of view given. All four fingers and thumb sticking out widely, hand placed deliberately for me to witness. This individual was anticipating for me to look through the peep hole. Why? I didn't know, so I opened the door to see who would be standing before me. I saw no one, nothing, not even a trace of evidence that anyone had been standing there a minute ago. I was creeped out. A tingle down my spine and a bad feeling in my gut were all that accompanied me that night.  The next day I had to take my son to school, so I prepared breakfast which consisted of microwave waffles with butter and syrup as usual. The sunlight creeping up on me through the kitchen window was refreshing and welcomed. My son ate breakfast and when we were all packed up and ready to go I dropped him off at school. I drove back home thinking of work and the papers I had forgotten to hand in yesterday. My mind was completely void of everything else with the papers and more piggy-backing my brain.   When I arrived home I got to work on my computer. I felt lifeless as I fiddle with files and write up reports. My routine, as you noticed through my little story here, was never interrupted for anything since nothing would stand in the way of it, but something did right then as I heard three loud, head aching knocks.  *Knock* *Knock* *Knock*  I got up and walked to the door. I already knew who it was, but to make sure I looked through the peep hole. Once again the hand was there, but this time the pinky finger was folded down. I opened the door quickly hoping to catch this sad excuse for a prankster. With the door wide open I once again saw nothing. This agitated me and left myself with an unsettled feeling at the same time. Who the hell was that and what the hell is going on?  The next day I dropped my son off at school again and ventured back home in my car. On the way to my house I didn't think about work, I thought about who was behind the door yesterday. I sat there at my computer with files open and blank reports in need of being written up. I didn't touch a thing on the computer, Just sat there staring at the work I needed to do. I just couldn't muster up the concentration, I could only think of the prankster who had kept knocking at my door.  *Knock* *Knock* *Knock*  This wasn't funny anymore, nor was it ever, but this joke became a lot more annoying the instant I heard those three loud distinct knocks again. Looking through the peep hole I saw the same hand that presented itself the last two times, ring finger now folded beside the pinky. But right then it hit me like a brick, it was a countdown. I opened the door as fast as I could only to find no one there. Now I was more than unsettled, I was mad. This mystery prankster was going to get one thing for sure, and that was an ass whooping.  I picked up my son from school that same day and continued on with the routine like nothing happened. My son would tell me of the things he learned and the adventures he had at recess. Today, he told me about his good mark on the spelling test he had in class and how this girl, Rachel, tricked him into rolling down the hill straight into dog crap. It always brightened the rest of my evening to hear his tales in school. He was about to tell me about the new monkey bar set they were going to install in the playground and how he made new friends, but it was getting close to bed time so I told him we would save those stories for tomorrow. I washed the dishes before getting myself ready to read a story to my little buddy before he went to sleep. Afterwards I headed to bed myself.   Laying in bed I started to wonder who it was who knocked on the door everyday. When I thought about it, it started to creep me out more and more. You see, I'm a little bit of a paranoid kind of person. Things tend to easily spook me, thus, I tend to take things a little to far. Because of that the whole thing turned into a tremor in my head. It looked to be deliberately targeted at me, and that thought while laying in the darkness became a whole lot more scarier, but that's not the thing that really got me. What really scared me was the fact that this was real and that within a few days something was going to happen. Though, this was my paranoid self taking control. Yet, even when I tried to rationalize it, it turned into a lot more than a joke to me. I closed my eyes and did the best I could to prepare myself mentally for the day to come. After that restless night, tomorrow rolled in through the window and gently awoke me with sunlight. I was almost about to drift off back into sleep, but right then,   *Knock* *Knock* *Knock*  My eyes shot out from my eyelids. Silence.   *Knock* *Knock* *Knock*  I slowly raised my whole body out of bed anxiously. I didn't utter a word, nor even a thought in my head. All that accompanied myself was an uncomfortable feeling.  *Knock* *Knock* *Knock*  Well, what else could I do now but answer to the call. I walked from my room to the door, not checking the peephole, and answered. I was met with a little girl selling goods for a fundraiser. She just looked at me with a concerned gaze, so I guess I must have had one seriously petrified look in my eyes. I regained myself and asked what she wanted. She explained she was selling cookies door to door. "This early?" I spoke out in a droopy tired voice. "Early? It's eleven o'clock, Sir." Great, Sam is going to be late today due to me being a wimp and not getting any sleep. She left and I proceeded to wake my son up. "Sam, you alright bud?" His adorable bright eyes greeted me along with a yawn. "Ya, why?" "It's eleven in the morning, you never sleep in." "Eleven?!" "Yup, sorry about that. It seems your old man was a lazy bird this morning." "I gotta get to school! My friends will be super mad now!" "Wow, someone is full of energy today." My son proceeded to get ready and I did too.  While in the car it struck me as odd that he didn't ask for a sick day like usual when we were going to be late, so I asked, "Hey, don't you want a sick day today?" "If I did I wouldn't get to play with my friends!" "New friends?" "Ya!" "Okay then." Were the only words I could pull out of my mouth before I parked. "I talked to Ms. Renby on the phone so don't worry about having to explain why your late. Now, get a move on, bud. You don't want to be any later than you are already do you?" "I'm moving, I'm moving. Love you dad!" He smiled and waved at me before walking through the doors into his school. "I love you too, bud!"  Once I got home I went to work on the computer. A call came from my boss about a costumer complaining about a corrupted file. As I start trying to find the original file I hear,  *Knock* *Knock* *Knock*  I asked my boss for a moment as someone had knocked on the door. He understood and told me to call him back. So, simply, like the last time, I walked to the door. This time though, once in front of the entrance, I recalled the knocking. I looked into the peephole and sure enough, like life had smacked me in the face, there was the hand. Another finger, the middle one, had been tucked away into the palm. I didn't open the door at that moment, I just put my forehead against it and took a deep breath. Opening the door as slowly as I could I peered out from behind it.   No one. I knew it. I knew that I wouldn't see the bastard who had been knocking on my door. That would be too good to be true. I sighed, depressed about that very detail. I couldn't just go back to doing my work, there was no way in hell with this obsessive knocking on my mind. So that's how I ended up watching supernatural until it came time to pick my son up from school.  When I picked Sam up from school I noticed he didn't make as much as a peep halfway through the drive. "Sam, is there something wrong?" He looked up at me and gave a smile. "No, I'm good dad." But when he returned his focus to the road that same smile quickly faded. "Do you wanna see a movie? Get some McDonalds?" He didn't even try to seem happy when he replied with a simple and quiet "No." I was concerned. "Are you sure?" With the same tone he dragged his next sentence. "I think I would just like to go home." I waited until we got home to ask him what was wrong.   I sat my son down at the table and proceeded to ask him what the matter is. "Sam, you know you can talk to me about anything that's on your mind. I won't get mad, I just want to help." "Well, me and Jon got into a fight." "Well, what happened?" "He wanted to come over to my house on the weekend, but I told him that you and I had our guys night out on Saturday." I was about to ask why he didn't just invite him over on Saturday after our guys night out, or even on Friday night instead, but I had a better question to ask in place of that one. "Is Jon a good friend?" "He is really nice to me most of the time." I went on to ask about his other friends and, from what I could tell, all of his friends sounded like good people. I figured that the fight he had with his friend at school was a small one that they would get over and make up afterwards. After our talk Sam headed to bed and I would be getting ready to read him a story. When I was approaching my sons room I thought I heard my son saying something, but when I went inside his room he was staring in my direction awaiting story time. I shrugged it off and continued to read to him. Later, I myself hit the hay and called it a night.  As I'm getting ready to have a good sleep I turn off the lights. I hear something right then. What it sounded like were footsteps walking through the bushes outside, but these footsteps were as loud as loud can be. You could hear the rustle of the grass and the snap of a twig each step. And as they seemed to get louder than normal footsteps should, they just suddenly stopped. Turning away from the wall to face the window I saw a silhouette of a head peering inside my room. I instantly froze. they quickly ducked out of view. I ran over to the window and looked out of it to see who was there, but I saw no one. I didn't get a wink of sleep that night.  When morning came I didn't say a word to my son. I just made him breakfast and got him ready to go. Sam didn't say a thing to me either. Once I got back home I waited for it. I waited for the knock. I didn't touch my computer or take any calls coming from work. Those precious few hours were devoted to simply sitting there waiting for the sound to break through the silence.  *Knock* *Knock* *Knock*  Sure enough the silence had now shattered. I debated what to do. I could say I chose to not look through the peephole, but truth be told I just couldn't. I sat there, scared, thinking about the one who looked through my window and how the last day was tomorrow. What thought bugged me the most though was what would happen once tomorrow came. I never looked into the peephole once, nor did I open the door.  Picking my son up from school, I noticed he was oddly quiet. I thought it was simply the reaction he had given to the tone I gave off on the drive home. Thus, the day went on, but not before one last reminder of tomorrow that I had no need for.   I made Sam dinner and sent him off to bed. I skipped story time since I had absolutely no drive to do so and went straight to bed. Once I turned off the lights it took me a minute to turn around, scared I would meet another silhouette. When I did turn around, I saw just that. I could feel my heart rattle while I tried to process what I saw in front of me. Though, as my eyes slowly adjusted to the dark, I could tell it wasn't a head. As it turned out, what I saw was a note taped to my window. I slowly made my way over to the window. I took the note down and began to read it. "I'm so excited for tomorrow!" This drove me up the wall in ways I could not comprehend. I threw the paper to the floor and jumped in bed writhing under the sheets with fear and a wicked headache. I just couldn't believe that whoever this was had taken the pleasure to assure me something bad is going to happen tomorrow. It took me what seemed like forever to get any sleep.  But I should've stayed up. At twelve in the morning I hear the most frightening sound imaginable to any person who would have to have gone through my ordeal.  *Knock* *Knock* *Knock*  I awoke. Fear pulsating through my veins at speeds unnatural to a human being. Shaking uncontrollably. Breathing sluggish. My eyes puffy. Vision slowly coming to me. Pure terror. This is what I had been waiting for, but It came when I least expected it. There was no trance. I knew exactly what I was doing. I got out of bed and made my way to the door.   *Crunch*  Faster the fear pushed through my entire being. I look down. It's the paper. Before I can regain my composer I see a figure in my window. Right then, they were aware I saw them, and like clockwork, let out the most inhuman laugh I had ever heard. This laugh was one that took its time and crushed any courage that I may have had. I could never in my whole life put it into words, but I will never forget it. They ceased Their laughter and darted away from the window. Once they were no where to be seen outside, the knocking came even louder than before.  *KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*  I ran for my bedroom door to get to the front entrance. The only goal in my head at the time was to not let this person find their way in. Then this frightening realization clouded around my head. The paper note. It wasn't taped outside of the window, it was taped inside my room. They had already found their way in. I ran for Sams room first in a full sprint, but when I got there he was nowhere to be seen.  *KNOCK* *KNOCK* *KNOCK*  I ran for the entrance. I tried to open the door but no matter how hard I tried it wouldn't open. I then looked into the peephole and saw something that to this day I have never forgotten. It was my son. He had a knife to his throat. I shuddered. The look on his face wasn't the look of someone scared, sad, or even angry. I couldn't figure it out. Why that face, a face that looked lifeless, a face that had looked destroyed, yet a face that conveyed something I couldn't pinpoint at the time. How could I? I was so scared. I snapped out of my frozen state and started to try and pull the door open while still trying to see through the peephole. I screamed and yelled, but my voice sounded so weak and shrill as it crackled pleads to let my son go. The stranger held up his index finger and slowly started to curl it into his palm. I started to scream "No!" over and over again in my same defeated tone. I was crying. I could feel my heart rattling in my rib cage as if it was about to burst right out from me. My blood circulated through my body at intense speeds. I didn't take a single breath. I trembled as I stood there unable to do anything. I was so close, right there, yet I couldn't do anything. I was scared, purely, and nothing else.    His index finger finally clasped into his palm, and he did it. He grabbed my son's head and slit his throat. The man then let go of Sam letting him fall to the floor. Then the man walked out of view from the peephole, and as soon as he did so, the door opened. I ran over to Sam and plopped on to my knees while picking him up to put him on my lap. He was trying to say something, but he couldn't due to choking on his own blood. All I could hear coming from him were whispered gurgles as he gasped for his last breaths. How I felt could never be explained by anyone, ever. He looked at me in the eyes, and I could see him, second by second, fade away. All my memories with Sam playing in my head while I watched him die. And then, he was gone.  The police never found who it was, and they knew for fact it wasn't me. Why, you ask. When they searched through my sons room, they found something. It was a drawing Sam had made, and on it was the most horrid thing. It was a picture of his new friends. Two boys were drawn with names above them reading "Keith" and "Mark." But to the far right was a full grown man wearing a hoodie  with a name above him reading "Jon."  Right then I knew that face, the face my son had moments before being murdered. It was the face of betrayal. I'll never forget it. All I wish now is that I listened to my child more than I did. Maybe this wouldn't have happened, maybe I could have prevented this. If I asked him more about what went on at school, always listened to the end of his stories, found out about Jon earlier, maybe I could have saved him. But It happened, and I wasn't able to prevent it. I never asked those questions and I never listened to the end of his stories. I never found out about Jon until it was too late.   My little buddy was seven. Seven. That is not a full life that has been lived. I think of him everyday and remember him as the beautiful child I loved and raised. So, from one parent to the other, listen to your children.        Cool or not, must be a bitch to get off of.   Do you like chills? I like chills. Let's chill.

This subreddit has been up for awhile now. You see the thing is that right after I made this I found out about the subreddit uplifting news. Now I'm sitting here feeling dumb for making this. You see that rules bar to your right? Ya, about that, no rules. Bye rules, I loved you. You can show your humanity by doing what ever the fuck you damn well please here or anywhere else on Reddit and face the consequences. The thing about here is there are no real consequences I guess. Just don't go way mother fucking over board. God, It's like when I was in grade 11 science and tech class and everyone in that class drove my teacher insane... Literally. So, fuck around all you like on here. Enjoy!   That twist...    In all seriousness, I really do hope there is such a place like heaven that exists for those poor children. I agree good sir, may they rest in peace. ;_[  	8
 Kind of relevant, I worked in a place that served waffles for brunch, which we ran out of one day. Chef from head office happened to be there that day and what does he decide? 86 the waffles? Nope, he tells us to the store and buy fucking eggo waffles. We served 2 eggo waffles with blueberries and whipped cream for 12$. It really pissed me off.

King of the Monsters 10/10.    ...fair enough.   I have the three-in-ones and the standalone 13 and 14. I hope there may one day be an "End of Evangelion" arc-based compilation with 12, 13, 14. It's probable, however, that that isn't going to happen. If you want to hold out for something like that, more power to you.    That was like a ahittier version of Lucy.       this meme  dank  go back to 9gag, normie.    /r/gangstaswithwaifus      Yeah, he has a sword.    The question was about Second Impact, which was merely the result of a contact experiment between a human and Adam. Every single Impact was a result of the combination of Lilith and Adam. First Impact was when Lilith landed on Earth, terraforming it for Lilin and requiring Adam to be impaled on his Lance. 2I was the contact experiment- no Lilith soul involved. 3I was souls and bodies, in as well as the combination of Unit-01 and Zeruel's S2 engine, AND the combination of Ascended Unit-01 and the Adam-based MP-Evas. That's why 3I was able to start instrumentality.    Well, as we saw in EoE, she is. Her involvement in 3I started when Shinji started screaming, not when she was crucified by the rest of the Eva series.    Homura did nothing wrong   From what I can tell, the only ingredients for an Impact is the combination of Lilith and Adam, not their souls specifically. During Second Impact, the combination was the body of Adam with the flesh of the Lilith-based humans. Lilith herself still had her soul, back under the city eventually known as Tokyo-3.    Liam Neeson was on Sesame Street? When was this?   How about Varan or Frankenstein conquers the world?   Dank ass meme/420   Atragon? War of the Gargantuas? Rebirth of Mothra?   I'm pretty sure, considering the fact that Nukem is an amalgam of 80's action movie characters, that the similarities aren't coincidental.

Despite forcing the children to sign a contract, keep in mind that the contract was signed by minors, and therefore null and void. His factory is also several square miles, violating his property and moving into the private property of the surrounding city. He can't have let any health inspectors into his factory, and I refuse to believe his been paying taxes. He's housing potentially thousands of illegal immigrants. The glass elevator is *incredibly* dangerous, which could be considered a weapon.    Simon the Digger vs Shinji Ikari, I guess. I want to say Unit-01 could actually win, simply because I like NGE more than Gurren Lagann, but if Simon had transformations beyond Arc-Gurren Lagann then Eva gets rekt. If not, then it ends up being a classic battle of unmovable object vs unstoppable force. Bizzaro-Lagann could take it, since as he gets more and more scared of losing, he's going to get stronger and stronger, which will eventually result in him being stronger than Simon with all the Spiral Power in the universe. The question is if Simon kills Shinjimon before he can accumulate the power required to kill GL with pure bitchliness. I give it to simon 6/10, but if it were anyone other than Simon i would actually give it to Bizarro GL.    Say that to my face fucker not online see what happens.    You clever son of a bitch.    Most of my favorite fictional women I actually like for their character, not out of lust. I could stand Mothra trying to seduce me or 24 hours (though that would be funny as hell). Bayonetta would be harder, but since she's built like Slenderman with some well-placed fruit in his outfit, I think I could last if a million dollars were on the line. One day simply isn't enough to be worth a million. Now if I got to spend the rest of my life with her in exchange for a million dollars, that would be different.    Fun fact: Giratina's cry in this movie is actually the cry of Mothra. Since Toho is the distributor (I think) for the Pokemon movies, this happens several times throughout the series, though Giratina's is the only one I can think of.    For both Project M/Melee Roy and Roy the Koopa Kid, "Coy Boy Named Roy"   I think I posted about this a while back.

Because last time I checked, "the" isn't technically a full-fledged word.    It puts Sam Elliott's mustache to shame.    Does this mean that Mankanshoku Mothra's "Hallelujah" speeched are replaced with Mothra Song speeches?   Both the MUTOs and Rodan (the first ones) just wanted some of that radioactive kaiju ass.    It looks like something out of Yugioh.    I really wanna get my hands on those for my room. They look so fuckin cool.    To be a bit more specific, I need an app that lets me watch my subscriptions, preferably in the highest quality possible, without much else.

That combined with the lack of regular N3DS leads me to the conclusion that Nintendo hates me in particular.    Which Sinnoh Myths would be a Honedge? I don't remember any talking about anything other than the Creation Trio.    i kinda find it weird that Unit-02 has Divine Unit-01 inside her. I understand why it is, I just think it would've worked better with one of the Angels, like Sahaquiel or Zeruel 2.0.    Try God's Not Dead. It's the same bullshit insanity from the other side of the horseshoe. And the only movie to physically assault me as I watched it.    So that's why he had to get his head removed.    I have the omnibus version. It's much cheaper, and when you have all four together they look pretty nice.   EDIT: There are a few cons, come to think of it. Volumes 13 and 14 are still only available in the seperate volumes, giving you four monoliths of Eva mangas and two tiny little books at the end. hopefully they'll do an Omnibus release to have those two included as well, preferably alongside Volume 12 so it can be a full End of Evangelion package.    I really like the redesign of the returning Angels, mainly Rami-chan and Unit 03. But I kinda hate just about everything else. Especially Mari.    Gohan's first born (Pan) has long hair too. Can we expect his next kid to like like the father or like Goku, keeping with the tradition?   Yeah the guy at the end of Sinnoh (I think) had a Latios and a Darkrai. And that's why Ash ended up losing the Sinnoh league.    They're just peanut butter and jealous.    Spiderbro finally gets some.    Kill Bill was meant to be one movie, they made it two movies simply because the studio said it was too damn long. So it was meant to be one sitting when it was originally cut. There's actually a full edition called "The Whole Bloody Affair" coming out at some point. Hopefully.    Next you'll be telling me you didn't know someone made a rock musical based on Evil Dead.    Where can I buy one of these? I've wanted one for *so goddamn long*.    That and Return to the Forbidden Planet, the jukebox musical sequel by the guy who did Rocky Horror.    Yeah, this is absolutely parody.    Foundation books  Odd way to spell Forbidden Planet   People don't like Ghostbusters 2?

There's no situation I've ever come across that I wouldn't want the help of a Rotom in. I would never have to spend money on gas, my lawn would mow itself, my oven would never burn anything, my devices would always hold a charge, it's the most useful Pokemon in day-to-day life.

For games I was thinking along the lines of Mario Kart, Smash, and (obviously) Pokemon.    My favorite Pokemon is Braviary.   Braviary isn't the most *supernaturally* powerful of all the Pokemon, but its strength will fit right in in the Capital Wasteland. Not to mention the fact that its pure patriotism is rivaled only by... Liberty Prime, actually. The Enclave wouldn't beef with someone patriotic enough to pal around with a red, white, and blue eagle, especially when that eagle can wreck an entire platoon of power armored soldiers with one Return. If we take the place of any random NPC, we'll be fine. We probably have enough strength to take a settlement like the supermarket, then defend it while still being on the good side of one of the major factions. If we take the place of the Lone Wanderer, then things get a little tougher since I can't have Dogmeat. Plus, being hunted down by anyone might end up with them sniping my bird.

OURS IS THE DRILL THAT'S GONNA PIERCE THE HEAVENS!   I once had a game where I was fighting a Mario. He started hitting me with hit jab combo and the moment he did, the game slowed to ~10fps. I said fuck it and committed suicide to get out of such a laggy game. The *moment* I got past the point where I couldn't recover, the game shot back to 60. It happened again the exact same way on the next stock.       It seems like it would have been burned off and/or removed when they put the suit on him.    Wasn't that in 2.22, thus making the Key of Nebuchadnezzar (holy shit I spelled that right) a razor and not Adam?   is just hallucinate from malnourish   Decent joke, bad execution.    "Alright, just push a little harder, I can see a head! Speaking of hard..."   This is the weirdest promotional crossover ever. I love it.    Falco's shine should reflect the can, and then either side+b or jumping over it should get you over the cartel. Your blaster should also be able to take out the cartel if you hit them.    The clones in Smash 4 are just ascended alt skins. The team decided that Doc and Mario, Lucina and Marth, and Dark Pit and Real Pit should be slightly separate, so very little time went into them. It's not like they stole anyone else's spot in the game.    Lucas isn't so much a clone as he is a "cousin" to Ness, considering his entire moveset is different, like Falco. Also, those "like 10 clones" didn't take anyone else's spots. They were originally just skins but the Devs decided they should be a bit more unique.    but he *is* always relevant, so he's got that going for him.    I want to say with 100% certainty that it is, but honestly this is the internet. I've seen a lot worse.    The year is 1942. Worrying that they were overpowered by the Axis, the Allies import a team of biological weapons from their newest member- Unova. Six fully trained Braviaries, which the Allies use as a replacement for their armies. Can they restore freedom and Democracy to the world?    The entire cast screams and calls 911!   \best angel  \not Leliel   I don't even care why, just tell me how. I've been needing a dank Lucky Charms controller.    I got that test no less than three times throughout elementary and middle school.       The best Godzilla from 2014  ^^^^^\s   The whole world sucks, but America sure sucks less.    If this post gets 10,000 upvotes, /u/nekotaniol will kill hermself   Assuming it appears at the front door, I can go into a room without windows, barricade the door, and catch up on anime until the battery runs out.   The social network that Cass posts her selfie to is called Friendship. Does that count?   Contrary to popular belief, Gojira may well be the worst film to start out on. It's gritty, it's dark, and it's almost completely different from every other film in the franchise. The best one to start out on is probably new, American Godzilla. It doesn't have the problem of the special effects that most people find hard to overlook until they're already fans of the series. After that, I would say Godzilla vs Mothra (1964) as that is probably the best monster mash in the franchise.    Gurren Lagann: I came for the boobs, I stayed for the drill that's gonna pierce the heavens!   i came for the *plot*, then *came* for the *plot*   I know it's cliche, but Sword Art Online. It had *so much* potential in its initial premise, but the characters are so boring and the plot so poorly written that I couldn't even make it to the end of the first half that everyone says is good.    Sun shines, birds fly, grass grows, and brother, I hurt people. I'm a force of the Patriarchy.    The "gay/teams panic" defense. It's the defense that you killed a gay/teams person because you saw them and just went berserk due to a mental disorder. It's only been outlawed in California because no one else is enough of a dumbass to think it would work. Because it never has worked, because you'd have to be a complete dumbass to think it would.    In other news, the bear shitting in the woods index is up.    [apparently](http://www.kdramastars.com/articles/60639/20141212/kill-la-kill-season-2-confirmed.htm)   Season one is *sort of* in two parts. You could say that post-Episode 8 Kill la Kill is pretty different from the first 7, since they form a more linked and emotional plot. You could also say that when the second OP shows up (after the "recap episode") is sort of a second part.    Gurren Lagann. I need more of that shit, there's more that can probably be done with it. Maybe the chronicles of Lordgenome in the original battle against the Antispiral? I don't know, but whatever it could be would probably ruin the ending of the original.    Season two isn't out yet, it's only been announced.   	165
 I'll do that, thanks.  I've heard that John has a reputation for not playing well with others.  Wish him luck in South Cacalaca!       The Oasis has a spectacular view way above Lake Travis with multi-level patio dining tucked into the hillside.  Usually I'd be wary of any Q place with La as part of its name lol but I'll check it out.    When I think of Britain and beans somehow this comes to mind... https://youtu.be/ChGxwRq3YcI    OP, before we go and pay that much for a can of beans in tomato sauce please let us know if they are any different that what we get here.      The Greistmill in Gruene and The Oasis in Austin have great food and the most beautiful outdoor dining views!  Franklin's is great for BBQ but THE WAIT!   I expected at least some spinach. As a sailor, I nonetheless approve!   Oh yes!  Very nice!   See comment above.  As far the best here?  That's hard to pin down.  90% of the 4,000 or so members of the Texas Restaurant Association serve CFS.  In Fort Worth I like Lucille's,  Babe's Chicken House or Vickery Cafe.     It's no big secret how to make your own.  Take cubed steak and pound the shit out of it till it looks like it wrestled with a waffle iron and lost.    Season 2 cups of flour with the seasoning of your choice.  I like "Slap Yo Momma".  In a second container mix 1 1/2 cups buttermilk, 2 Tsp baking powder, 1 Tsp baking soda and 1 egg, garlic and hot sauce.  Coat in flour,  then dredge in the buttermilk mixture and place back into the flour.    Very Important...when you coat it the second time make sure you thoroughly pat the flour into the steak until it feels dry.  Place your steaks on a sheet pan lined with parchment paper and dusted with flour.  Refrigerate up to an hour until you're ready to fry em up.  This step is not necessary but I feel it makes a crispier crust and gives you time to clean.  Fry at 325F in 1/2 inch oil about for 6 to 8 minutes on each side.  Use 2 Tbsp of the leftover oil and pan drippings to make a cream gravy.    You've done it all right if you don't need a knife to cut it or teeth to chew it for that matter!        LOL, ya got me there!   Funny because it was made by a Texan at my house in Texas?    IDC Burgers.  Shell station in Aledo, TX outside of Fort Worth.   IDC Burgers @ a Shell station in Aledo, TX      I would love that!  Over a plate of CFS of course.    Thank you.  It's unfortunate that what the order did and does is true.  I would truly hope that the Catholic Church cared about the most vulnerable of the people in your country but they unwaveringly care only about money and power.  Nameste.   LOL! Burleson as in Brig. Gen. Edward Burleson, who led a regiment at San Jacinto, was the Vice President under the Republic of Texas and my forth great grand-father.    No matter,  I'm in far SW Fort Worth.  Drop me a line and I'll tell you all my secrets.      True, every once in awhile!   In Texas.  At my house.   If I like you!      Did something similar with a cheesecake.  http://imgur.com/mlCq1zG      Yes,  It's an emulsified butter sauce and Escoffier named it as a mother sauce,  at 5 parts butter to egg yolk hollandaise sauce should be called heart attack sauce.       Lower your heat, season your flour, use a deeper pan with oil at least 1/2 in. deep.  Try, try again and good luck!   She had a fetish for dying people; sort of a belief that pain and suffering were gifts from God.  Almost none of the millions of dollars she received went to help the dying people her and her order professed to help.  Her order would reuse old needles and withhold basic pain relief.  Also she associated with some questionable people.  Not only did they not treat or comfort the "dying" in her care but many people died who would have lived if they received basic care.  Of course, when she became ill she received the best care available.   Mother Teresa   Actually it's being very honest.  If I described guacamole then I'd be dishonest.  Your feedback is nonetheless ignored as being irrelevant.    These are delicious and so easy to make.  Just rub wings with a packet of taco seasoning and bake and then toss them in your favorite taco sauce!      Nice job!  I see The Shed is bottling their sauce.  Great little place.  Glad they rebuilt after burning down.    Absolutely!  First thing I noticed.   Your chef is wrong.  That's the last thing you should do!   True.  I wear my calluses and certain scars with pride.  If you apply for a position the first thing I'll check is you hands!     When I was 8 my mother said it looked like brains from a car wreck served on a plate.  Didn't phase me a bit. She didn't like pizza either.   Hope that list doesn't include a hot dog cause...  http://youtu.be/ZpZ_fakwSwc    Ketchup over eggs has been debated in my family for ever.        To add to that chicken fried steak is sometimes served at breakfast along with eggs and potatoes.   Of course!  because what you call chips are fries and what you call crisps are chips lol!   Corn and tomatoes.  You're welcome.   I saw a guy do the same thing.  He was a drilling reservist and came in all hungover.  While making eggs on the flat-top he just placed his hand palm down on it to steady himself. He did even realize it until a cook knocked his hand off!      I was boiling pasta in a tilting 80 gallon steam jacket kettle during a busy drill weekend.  While I was holding a large colander another cook tilted the kettle forward to drain.  He cranked that sucker too fast and boiling water poured all over my left hand.  I put a latex glove on my hand, filled it with ice water and tied it off with a rubber band and kept cooking only stopping occasionally to drain and refill when the water warmed up.  My skin stayed red for a couple of days but never blistered.     Or, conversely, you make real hollandaise and they say it doesn't taste right because the only hollandaise they've had came from a packet.    There was/is a popular restaurant in New Orleans that served THE BEST burgers until they were shut down and it wasn't because of Katrina.  They filled a 2' pickle barrel with frozen beef patties and set it on the floor next to the grill uncovered, taking them out as the orders came in.  They'd refill it at night without cleaning it out and store it in the refer till the next day.  No telling how long this went on but FIFO definitely wasn't a term they ever heard because when they were shut down the bottom of the pickle barrel was alive with maggots.         Well this Navy cook never saw anything like this: shore or ship.  For slow mornings we'd crack maybe 4 lugs of eggs (120) but for drill weekends or at sea we used 15 lbs tubs of pasteurized frozen eggs.      That sounds like my grandmother-in-law.  She wasn't exactly a hoarder as she kept her house clean but she would wash and reuse the Styrofoam trays that was used for meat from the grocery store.     In the Navy we were supposed to thaw meat in a refrigerator but that was almost always impossible so we followed the "emergency shipboard thawing procedures".  This meant you could place cases of various meats in their original packaging, place on sheet pans and leave out at room temperature for a determinate time.           All fats will go rancid even vegetable oils given enough time.  However, my great aunt would keep leftover bacon/sausage grease in a coffee can (covered of course) on the kitchen counter and would use it to saute and flavor vegetables etc.    A caddilac is a term used for a "fancy" mop bucket that has an attachment where the mop can be wrung out.   It's funny that cracked pepper was not listed in the description for this dish.   No, do not let the root ball dry out.  Water a ficus or Fiddle Leaf regularly but don't let it sit in its waste water.  If the root ball has completely dried out and the plant is small enough, submerge it in plain water until saturated then let drain completely     Your Dracaena Marginata is not happy! Marginata's need water but not a lot and do not let them dry out.   Good news!  It's perfectly normal for a DM to loose its lower leaves as it grows.  If it's a matter of too little watering you will see brown dead leaves scattered all over.  The brown tips you see are usually caused by salt damage.  This can happen a number of ways but it can be prevented by watering the DM enough so that water drains out  the bottom and flushes the salts out.  If you let this plant sit in its own water runoff especially its own "waste" then it will uptake the salt and will burn the ends.  Letting it sit in water for any length of time will also lead to stem and fungal rot.   Make sure all the soil is saturated when water when you do water.  Sometimes a rootball will dry up to the point that water doesn't penetrate and just leaks around it so use your best judgement.  Marginatas need water and don't like to ever dry out but they also cannot stand to be left in standing water.   So it looks like this guy need to be repotted because I'm seeing some roots and the pot is too small for the plant.  Choose a pot that is no more than 2 inches bigger than the original and had drainage.  Don't fertilize.  After transplanting use a weak solution of root starter.  Again, don't freak out if it loses for leaves.  At this point you want to grow roots, not leaves.  BTW,  just cut off the ends of the leaves at an angle.  Good luck!   In a pinch for just a few portions it's not that bad but if you fry a lot it can add to much fat to the fryer and all that salt will cause the oil to go bad quickly.    My friend worked at a popular cheesesteak place outside of Philly that delivered to the local military base.  Was told to make tuna salad in the caddilac because nothing else was available.  Quit and walked out.   Classic.  Did you go ahead and make it from scratch?   From what I've heard from industry people, your delicious breadsticks are recycled from each and every table that didn't eat all the bread.  Yum, especially if they happened to sneeze all over them!    Considering salmonella is/may be present on the outside of the egg shell I find this disgusting and as an 18 year veteran I've never heard of this.  Most military and government installations including ships buy 20 lbs tubs of pasteurized eggs for scrambled and omelets.  Please stop this!        A clarification.  I mean more a process like heating up veggies in the water on a steam table or mixing tuna salad in a mop bucket.    While on shore duty I had a cook add pancake syrup to cooked carrots instead of following the recipe... butter, ginger and honey.  He said that's what they did on the ship.  That didn't sail on my watch!     That's a square meal!    What do you do with your steaks?    My godfather designed the Mexican Hat ride.  That fact never got me any free tickets!   Jim Bowie and his brother John were slave smugglers/traders/owners.   The Cherokee, with whom he lived with for a short while, called him "The Big Drunk".   Yes!   Sounds like you're doing somethings right;  simmering water that slowly releases bubbles if at all, more like a bloop, bloop (not boiling, added vinegar, cooking 3 1/2 to 4 minutes.  Are you using a very deep pot?  12 inches or more?  Break each egg into individual cups and add one at a time as close to the waterline as possible while gently stirring in a circler motion around the egg.  Keep swirling around slowly.  JS!   And this has anything to do with poached eggs?   Good on you!   Get a dish job at a place that's busy but notorious for cooks not showing up and you'll rise to stardom.   Although I understand your frustration it's wrong for you to label your fry guy as incompetent if he's actually a dishwasher.  The one who is incompetent is your manager.  Take it up with him if you have a pair.   Manning a fryer may seem easy to you but depending on the product it can be daunting.  At least he's trying and you should recognize that and possibly help or encourage him instead of calling him a moron.    Think about that on your next smoke break!   LOL, I'd write out this and similar sentiments when I'd season the grill when I was a cook in the Navy!  Had to waste about 2 dozen eggs anyway.  I'd also write EAT ME or worse on the sheet cakes as a baker.  No harm and no knew but me and the FSA's.   "Royal" Engineers LOL!  Perhaps your "royal" rats in the UK are so full of crap that it makes sense not to eat them.  Considering your sewage system I would agree that you shouldn't eat UK gutter rats and mice.   You're from PA?   Smother those eggs in ketsup till it looks like a train wreck! Yum!   Your friends are right but you aren't.  You weren't even ever in a any military position.  So Piss Off Pussy!    Rats and mice are most certainly considered food sources. You're so full of shit! You obviously aren't military much less gone through survival training.  Step off!    Thank you OP!  I have diverticulosis which means I can't have seeds, corn or nuts and the one thing I miss is a Snicker's bar.  It was my favorite and now I can make my own nutless version.   Nothing is straightforward when it comes to the predictability of the menstrual cycle.  You can ovulate while on your period and get pregnant.  Your teacher is obviously ignorant and misinformed and should not be teaching sexual education to minors!   During a sex ed class in Navy Bootcamp a recruit asked if he could get AIDS from breastmilk. This was in 1993 BTW.  He also stated that it would be impossible for him to stop having sex once he started even if she told him to stop and that it would not be considered rape.   I would not say that you're more likely to get pregnant during your period but it IS possible.  The second statement may depend on what type of birth control you use.  The bottom line is that menstruation does not make it impossible to conceive and it certainly doesn't prevent you from getting an STD.          Cream of 'insert here' soup was a Capitalistic plot by Campbell's Soup Company to promote their product plus really bad recipe books following WWII which, because of convenience for the average housewife, led to a decrease in cooking skills.     This lead to the eventual low standards of the American palate that grew up to believe that condensed tomato soup from a can was normal and Hmm, Hmm good!     Eventually no one knew how to make a sauce, roux or soup  without Campbell's condensed soup.  Except for people in New Orleans and surrounding areas.   They seemed to have been influenced by Communists to resist the Capitalists influence of convenience foods and instead what they had growing in their backyard or local market.  This is well documented by the Warren Report that outlined the Communist presence and their influence on Lee Harvey Oswald but I digress.   An entire generation was born and raised not knowing how to cook and their only crutch continued to be Campbell's soup and even crappier cookbooks in the 60's complete with jello molds (but that's another story).  Things would change in the 70's though!   As early as 1931 the first edition of "The Joy of Cooking" was published but was mostly ignored by home cooks.  After it's 6th edition in 1975 its popularity suddenly exploded and sales sky-rocketed.  This seemed to beat all logic but a book published a little earlier explains why.    In 1972, A book titled "The Joy of Sex" was published that proved enormously popular even though it had illustrations of hairy hippies.  I have to say at this point that that those illustrations were my first visualizations of sex.  I really couldn't actually describe what I thought sex was at that age but the JOS made it perfectly plain and more important that it sex was not scary, but I digress again.  Sorry.    It's my theory that the "Joy of Cooking" became popular after the "Joy of Sex" was published because if the JOS worked for you then the FOC would too.  Makes perfect sense.  Sex then food!  Please don't get me started about how Spam ruined Hawaiian cuisine!     How witty.  Not to good at taking some criticism are ya?   Exactly.  Still makes a brick.  Maybe something like this.     http://www.mcleanbeef.com/images/deli%20roast.jpg   Diet coke,  Dr Pepper and Ginger Ale=Texas   Hotdish, a type of casserole usually brought to a church potluck or family reunion.  Not to be confused with Funeral Potatoes which are starch based and brought to the deceased's home.      That's not a ham hock.  Hocks come from the ankles of a pig.  That looks like what was left over from a bone-in spiral ham.  I'm sure it tasted good regardless.    I myself like to add pickled pork for the texture difference along with andouille plus a touch of thyme.  Unfortunately I can't find picked pork here in Texas.    "Laissez les bons temps rouler!"   Stacking ham slices that thick is disgusting aesthetically and to the palette.   Might as well bite into a brick of ham.  This could be made so much better using very thin or shaved ham and folded rather than stacked.       I may have some buyers for your sausage here in Fort Worth.  If you're interested contact me at tulips_1795@yahoo.com.    JoJo fries are the best!     That grinder is awesome!  You must do this often.  Live anywhere in or near Texas?    The photo is out of focus,   Don't waste your money on this gimmick.  The knockoff recipe using Bisquick is as good if not better and cheaper.   They were for the mash later on.  My Mom always made a relish tray to nibble on while the rest of the dinner was being prepared.   Yes, yes you can!   This reminds me of my bowels in a good day!   Make some TexMex wontons.  Even better, use it in enchiladas along with mild cheddar or use it in chicken quesidillas.        There's no n00b on the inside.   Well I don't know about Sydney but here in the US the homeless usually eat either discarded food in dumpsters or nothing at all unless they suffer the indignities of "homeless shelters" that by their very rules prevent anyone who's homeless from getting and keeping a job.    What's your point in posting this?  I've had worse serving in the military.  What's your angle?   I guess you've never encountered Lady Parts!   If you're a gal then that's kinda sad.  If you're a guy, I'm so sorry for you. LOL!    I'd eat it!         Don't hold your breath waiting for a coherent answer from a Christian LOL!    You conveniently forgot to explain the rest of the compound word.  "Potent" or powerful.  Omnivore has a much different meaning than omnipotent or even omniscient.    Your comparison is false.  The paradox still stands.   I wish our politics were somehow based on cuisine because, I mean, I love you man!  	111
 Very cringeworthy and I'm a Christian. I hope that I sense his heart behind his words saying...never mind. I tried to see some validity in this but just couldn't. I don't know the solution to all that is going on over there with ISIS, but I do know there is a better solution than convert or kill.   Labor Day tomorrow!  * Plan to take it easy and game a good portion of the day. * Gym + Cardio * Read at least two chapters of *The Giver*. * Write *at least* one word in my book. * Devotions and prayer. * Eat healthy.   Step two: THE   You just made my day. BunnyProof.com. That is hilarious.  I am looking at Logitech speakers as I've been really impressed with them in the past. Is there one you would suggest? One that might be comparable to the Z-4 of the past?   ...and I'm heartbroken. I've had this speaker system for years and it was *INCREDIBLE* for the money I spent on it.   I need some suggestions for a new speaker system that is just as good quality (preferably with a subwoofer) for a reasonable price. Looking to spend under $100.   My wife and I own the domain www.theyseemerollintheyhatin.com   Love this. Can you do more like this?    I feel like you live in this subreddit just to say stupid things.   This sounds logical. Do you have a source confirming Ubisoft Sofia's control of the project?   Do you really think they will not release it for PC? What would be the reasoning behind this?    I've only been working for Abstergo Industries for three and a half months, but I'll try my best to answer your question according to what seems to be the "norm"  around here (if there is such a thing).    Just like any healthy business, there are a number of employment levels. We have administrative assistant and interns that are still in college working on various bachelor's degrees. Most deskers, as we like to call them, have a master's degree or some equivalent. Our typical technical professionals all have undergrad degrees with a few years of experience in other organizations.   Higher ups, those well above my pay grade, vary in scholastic pedigree. A few have doctorates, but most are just well connected through relationships or blood. I can't really tell what it is that gives them the clearance to know the stuff they know. They seem to have a lot of secrets the higher up the ladder they go. Screens are turned off, folders closed, and conversations paused often when I enter rooms. I'm not sure how to take it.   Anyways, hope that helps out. Would love to see you apply. Abstergo is a great employer! Feel free to PM me your info and I'll see if I can pass your name on to my boss. Later.

Very nice work. Love the lines.    Please excuse me, ma'am.   The guy losing his mind is in no sense of the word a "success". He is so full of malevolence it is past scary; it's just sad. Really sad.   You are really really good. I want to meet you. Hi.   Love this. You have talent, sir.   [This](http://i.imgur.com/KIdrSLO.jpg?1) is the only picture of me in the world.   "Do you know a Grace? A Gabby? Gabriella, maybe? Gloria? Gina? Girl. Girl. Do you know a girl? Any girl maybe? Do you know of any girl?"    Honestly, there's no way I'm this retarded, but as I'm sitting here writing this I feel about 60% sure that I wrapped them in tinfoil. I really can't remember though.  I enjoyed being able to read his own cringe as he wrote down what he remembered to be true. That's some Inception level stuff right there.   I haven't purchased any sandals yet because the new craze is Roman/gladiator sandals and I can't bring myself to do it.  I like how simple your are.   What are your sandals?   Well stated.   I would like to see an ancient Egyptian assassin that uses ancient assassination techniques. I'm talking the use of snakes, scorpions, rope (strangulation), poisoned feathers, and the like.    There's a book covering his time as an Assassin.   People are going to disagree with me, but here we go:  1. **Altar** - Although he broke the creed early on, his whole story is one of redeeming himself and rebuilding his confidence of the creed.  1. **Edward** - This is where most will think I'm crazy. "But, test_subject861, Edward wasn't even an Assassin!1!!1! lolz". Listen, I know. But if anyone believe that nothing is true and everything is permitted, it was a pirate who had little standards and/or boundaries. Additionally, Edward was oft hidden and once joining, never compromised the Brotherhood.  1. **Ezio** - It took a while for our friend to grow into the brotherhood and understand what it means to be an Assassin. He committed his first murders out in the open for all to see. There was even a mission where he was wrong and took the life of an innocent. But, he learned from it and became better.  1. **Connor** - Connor was never hidden (tenet #2). He was always out in the open. Plus, I'm not entirely sure that Connor even knew or was taught the creed. To my knowledge, he never spoke it as the other Assassins did.   I'm pretty sure that is a polo, friend.    Waxahachie for college. Midlothian for family.     These guys are self-aware. They know what they're doing. Does no one else see that?    Exactly. And I'd probably still get it wrong.   Ew. Bad host. Anyone can get their mind tied up in knots on live television, on a game show, with a timer. Give the contestant a break, man!   It could have been cringe-worthy but Wahlberg decided he would be kind, down to earth, and give the security guard a "good" interview.  Great on you Mr. Wahlberg. Great on you.

This is pretty good advice. I would suggest one more thing:  **Send me the shoes you get rid of. I will continue to take care of them in your stead and send you bi-annual pictures so you can see how your precious babies are being treated.**      I would love to see a video walkthrough of this. Is it out there? Someone find me a link, I'm lazy.   You are right. Completely right. Forgive me for the overstatement.    This is going to be completely buried.  Randomly found your site yesterday as I was looking for good gaming podcasts. My wife and I watched your most recent podcast all the way through and I just wanted to stop by and tell you that it is hands down the best gaming podcast we have heard. Very informative, differing opinions, on topic. Love it all.  Also, love that you are in/from Austin. It's a great city to live in!   True on that. I'm just kinda fed up with all the talk I'm hearing about it all. It has blown up into a game that has no females in it whatsoever. It has become a game from a corporation that hates women (not true). Oh yeah, don't forget that Ubisoft is a racist corporation also because every assassin has been white (also not true). They did bring some of it on themselves by their first lousy response. I just think it could have been immediately remedied by a better, more thought out response.   I know you're tired of hearing about it. I am too. But, if I were a Ubisoft representative, this is what I would have said when asked about playable female characters in AC: Unity:   No, Unity will not feature playable females in our new co-op gaming mode. If you desire to play as a female assassin, we have another game that will meet that request. However, in Unity, everyone will be playing as Arno, a male assassin, and will always see their character as such. This is why all co-op characters will be male, because in all actuality, they are Arno with a different face.    This, however, does NOT mean there are no female characters in Unity. In fact, there are MANY female characters in Unity. Furthermore, there are even female assassins in Unity! We love women. We love women as playable characters. There will be many more opportunities in the future of the AC universe to play as females. Unity is not that game.   I agree. They sounded great, were really organized, and had obviously put a lot of practice into it.   BUT...they should have stopped at two or three songs. They went too long (cringe) and then the mall cop (cringe) had to step in.   Could have all been avoided with brevity.    I don't have much to submit outside of the following:   Creation defies basic logical principles. Miracles defy basic logical principles. Fully God and fully man defies basic logical principles. Resurrection from the dead does as well.  In the Christian faith I wouldn't be too scared from deviating from basic logical principles.   	44

Why is 'Odd one out' in the Reclaimer side?    I'm not much of a conspirator but this guy makes a great point. Why would we have an inflatable roof on something meant to protect during a hurricane/Tornado, there is two Domes in La Feria, i have yet to see anymore in the valley. Plus why La Feria it's small as hell, and why two so close to each other?    We can still have a bright future.    You're immaturity shows in this, grow up, don't spit at them woth words.

You can stake a claim on lands that the BLM have allowed for mineral harvesting. But you would need to check with the  LR2000 to make sure it's not already claimed and that is a whole process in itself! Talk to your county's mineralogist  and possibly visit the BLM offices, they will help you as much as they can..at least they did for us here in CA...   You can also buy claims from people who are selling then but they tend to be a little more expensive but at least that way you are paying for the paperwork being done and just a transfer in title is all that is needed at that point and then putting up the proper signs on your claim..  	66

They doing it all the time. Heres a basic example of Hollywood Accounting: A studio makes a movie. The studio distributes the movie itself, and although the distributor is technically a separate company, they both belong to the same parent company. Also, the distribution arm sets whatever fees it wants. If they want to charge themselves eleventy quintillion dollars for distribution, they totally can. Then, even if the film earns billions of dollars in box office receipts, theyre still technically in debt (to themselves) and thus havent turned a profit.

 I caught this when I watched the first episode the 2nd time. It felt to me like this was a goof instead of a hidden clue by the writers for something.             This can mean two things :   1. Either Mr Robot is real and the show is just fucking with us.  2. Or the Men In Black guys are also not real, which would explain why Darlene doesn't notice them when she and Elliot jump inside the train.  Whatever might be the truth, I fucking love this show.   This happened in episode one, when Elliot was following that Michael Hansen dude who was dating his therapist.  [I made a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MrRobot/comments/3c0nlv/i_think_this_scene_makes_it_super_clear_whos_real/) noting how when Mr Robot is talking to the fsociety team, it's clearly Elliot they are talking to.  And even in the bartender scene, you can clearly see how the dude doesn't even look at Mr. Robot.  This is the only scene till now where Mr Robot had a clear interaction with someone which did not involve Elliot.                      	12
 it's interesting that I stumbled across this sub and post today, as I just wrote something, [this actually,] (https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/32b6v3/wp_a_prolific_serial_killer_active_for_many_years/cq9yfny) in which I did not name the character at all, in order to avoid losing any of my readers to a poor (in their opinion) choice of character name.  In the one novel I have written (although it isn't published yet), I used some interesting names (Joster, anyone?), so I can definitely identify with the struggle...   thanks so much; I'm glad you did!  I was actually most concerned about the ending, afraid I may have ruined it with my impulsive twist.  Glad that was not the case :)  edit (clarification): I mean only the last detail of the reveal was on impulse   took me a minute to get that one   ooh!  I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought to go the government mind-control route.  You could develop this with more back story.  edit: figured I'd add a link in case anyone wants to see mine, as it's probably buried. https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/32b6v3/wp_a_prolific_serial_killer_active_for_many_years/cq9yfny   I don't think the epilogue was superfluous.  Some of that information was necessary/ helpful (the motivation behind the program), but I agree that it could have been conveyed a different way, within the main text.  Otherwise, good story.   nice short response.  I wrote about a chip too, but in an entirely different way.    if enough people upvote my post.  really?  That almost as crass as "Upvote if..."   your protectors?   Seeing a shadow figure is interesting.  I usually don't *see* things, so I think that's more of a special gift (though it can probably be a practiced skill if one dedicates oneself); though I can see how it would be both a gift and a curse.    There are some similar experiences to yours here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/324naz/me_strange_occurrences_throughout_my_life/   wait.  Deja vu.  I read this last week.  I'm serious; I swear.  I'm not sure if I commented on it but I upvoted it and comments for sure.    Just realized....so this must be a cross post from /r/paranormal then...   [meta] I'm sorry I had to make it three comments.  I thought I read somewhere that the limit was 10,000 but you can edit in more up to 40,000.  That didn't work.  It really technically only had to be two, as, according to Word, it was 20K char, but I broke it where it seemed logical.  Anyway, I hope you guys like it!    "ARGHHHHH!!!!!!"  He woke up screaming from the skull-splitting pain.  What was going on?  Who was doing this to him?  Someone was doing this to him.  He did not, and never had believed in the supernatural.  Someone was giving him these names.  Someone wanted these people dead and knew he needed to kill.  Someone was showing him these people.  The same someone planted Pickett's suicide note and caused the media blackout on the case.  The same someone had probably made sure that he never got caught this whole time.  In the 15 years since his first kill, he had never seen any reason why the media and authorities had never picked up on anything.  He didn't know how he had come to accept the dream names as routine.  Now, as the memories were flooding back to him in spite of the pain, he realized he had been better off not knowing.    In spite of every blast of pain, he remembered the trauma of his arrest.  They had made him for the murder in the woods.  He remembered the suits talking behind closed doors while he was left to stew in a dark room.  He remembered his mother agreeing to sign over his medical power of attorney and parental rights to the state, in exchange for his freedom.  He'd had to sign a paper too, and freedom was all he'd needed to hear.  He remembered talk of an experimental treatment to cure his need to kill.  The promises they made to her to rehabilitate him into a productive member of society.  He had never seen his mother again.  He'd thought he remembered having a falling out with her after he switched careers, but no.  She just dropped off the map.   He remembered the bright lights and antiseptic from the hospital room.  These headaches were not from a tumor.  The government had done something to his brain.  They had been feeding him these names.  They hadn't cured him of anything.  They had turned him into their unwilling assassin.  And they had done everything possible to keep him from finding out about the notes.  How many notes had there been?    The pain wasn't causing brain damage; it was just an electrical signal.  Still, it got to be so much that he finally passed out on the bedroom rug.  *Or perhaps they could send electrical signals to make him pass out.*  He awoke what seemed like immediately, in a hospital bed.  He had the same characteristic headache in the back of his head.  He reached his hand up there and felt....bandages.  A man in a suit stepped into the room.  "You may not remember much," the agent began, "but you had one of our implants.  It was no longer of use to us in you, so we have removed it."  He blinked several times.  Digesting what the agent had said.  "This terminates the contract you signed.  You will serve the rest of your life sentence for the murder of Nathan Grier in a federal sanitorium, as you are not mentally competent to go to prison.  You suffer from severe delusions, and will be medicated as such so that you may peacefully co-exist with the other patients.  Take solace that you will likely remember nothing."  The suit turned to leave.  "Wait." He managed to croak out through his drugged-up stupor.  The suit stopped and turned towards the hospital bed.  "What happened to my mother?"  "She was a test of the programming, and the implant's ability to short-circuit memory." the agent replied.  "She was your first target."  -------------  TL/DR / Theme Synopsis: The government has basically been inceptioning him to take out targets for them.  He has been an unwilling/unknowing political/convenient assassin.  They took advantage of his mental states and psychopathic needs.  That's why the killings have been hushed and why nothing has happened to him.  He slowly discovers that he's been manipulated this whole time.   He awoke to the sound of sirens.  He sat bolt right up in bed, only to find that it was just coming from the TV.  It was 3am.  He'd never kept the TV on so late, or if he had, it certainly wasn't on this alarming channel.   The images on the screen seemed to send him into a trance.  He was sucked into to a horrible flashback.  He could see, first person, a tall female officer leading him by the crook of the elbow, his hands cuffed behind his back.  Images rushed through his mind of interrogation or meeting rooms, board offices, and dark corridors.  Then, in a flash, he could see a bright round light over his head, beaming straight into his face, and smelled the suffocating fumes of antiseptic, then, merely darkness.   He awoke/snapped out of it with a start.  He fumbled for the remote and shut the TV off.  He rolled over and attempted to get some sleep, although he could not shake those images out of his mind.  Had he been arrested?  Had he ever been treated for a mental disorder?  He vaguely remembered taking pills for something as a teen, but these memories, if that's indeed what they were, seemed more recent than that.    *ARGH!*  He was suddenly accosted by a blasting headache as the sunlight streamed onto his face.  He had not had enough sleep the night before to dream of a victim, or even just a chase.  It was not a restorative sleep at all.  Two kills in one weekend though was more than enough though; he'd just hoped to let off some steam and anxiety.  His memories of the night before were rather vague, which is normal when one wakes for many short periods throughout the night.    As he poured some cereal and sat down in front of his eggs and spam, he pulled up a search on his laptop.  He wanted to re-watch the news report from the night before, to see if it offered any clues as to who wanted Pickett dead.  No results.  *That's odd* he thought.  He tried rephrasing his search several ways, but still turned up nothing.  The only thing he saw was a quick mention of Pickett's name on the school website.  The blog was gone as well.  This looked like a thorough and hasty cover-up.  It was downright disturbing.    A paranoid sweat began to build.  He wondered if the cover-up was all for him.  *That's ridiculous.* He thought.  *It's just the nagging paranoia that my day may be coming.*  He could not shake the feeling, however, that someone was watching him.  He decided to settle this by going to the public library, an looking it up there on a different computer.    He brought only his keys, wallet, and phone into the old musty building; the juxtaposition of 2000's technology with 70's carpeting was a pleasantly jarring atmosphere.  He settled down into a computer and logged on as a guest.    He surfed the web randomly for a bit, and then conducted the same searches he had done on his laptop.  No Results.  He began to feel light-headed.  Had he dreamed the whole news report?  Was there no letter?  Maybe he should ask someone.  It was risky, yes, but, working as a telemarketer has its advantages, and he felt confident in his ability to pass it off as a casual concerned interest.    He approached the circulation desk with what he hoped was a look of concerned confusion.    "Excuse me?"  he attracted the attention of the middle-aged brunette on a computer behind the counter.  "May I help you?"  She asked curtly, but not impolitely.  "Yes, well, I hope so." He began.  "My sister up in Bedford e-mailed me about a teacher who disappeared yesterday.  She said she heard it on the news.  I was trying to look up the news report, but I couldn't find anything."  "Oh, yes.  That poor man.  I saw it on the news last night."  She lowered her voice such that her whisper was now barely audible.  "They say he may have killed himself."  He felt the color drain from his face.  "I saw the report last night, online."  She continued.  "They took it down this morning though, probably at the family's request."    He swallowed hard.  "Oh, well, thank you for your time."  "You best find something nicer to think about." She offered.  But he was already back at the computer screen collecting his things and his thoughts.  *So I didn't dream it.  It is a cover-up.*  Then, it dawned on him.  *Perhaps his sister planted the note.  Maybe she wanted him dead.*  But that didn't make any sense either.  She had cried on the news report, and her shock and horror had truly seemed genuine.  He knew fake tears.  Those were the real deal.  She had also said that their parents would roll over in their grave if they knew what he'd done.  So there was no other family to retract the story.  *What is going on?* he wondered.  Then, the headache returned, but so much worse.    He had suffered from these headaches since his early 30's.  Since around the time he'd left manual labor for various positions in legal con-artistry.    There was someone on a sofa chair to his left, reading a newspaper.  He walked around the magazine rack towards the bathroom, and happened to glance back.  The pages inside the newspaper were blank.  He ducked into the bathroom in a cold sweat.  Was he being followed?  It didn't make sense.  Had he left behind some sort of clue which led the police to a media blackout so he wouldn't know there were on his tail?  *No, you're just being paranoid.*  He told himself.  *This is like the Tell-Tale Heart.  or The Imp of the Perverse.  You are not going to give yourself away!*  And with that, he stormed out of the bathroom, too energized with adrenaline to pee.  He marched right past the magazine rack and made a beeline for the door.  He paused with his hand on the door frame.  Newspaper man was gone.  As he stepped out into the afternoon sun, he heard a helicopter overhead.  This time, it was low enough as it passed over the library for him to make out the labeling on it, or rather, the fact that it had none.  Not a single mark.  Just a solid, jet-black finish.  This was not your standard army chopper.  *I'm being watched.*  He thought.  *I'm being followed.*  He frantically looked left and right as he walked to his car.  *They wanted to make sure I didn't find out the truth.  They're onto me.*   *My phone.*  he thought.  He dropped it deliberately behind his tires, and rushed into the car and locked the door.  He breathed a sigh.  *Good thing I couldn't afford the model with GPS*  He started it up and wandered around a few blocks before heading home.  *That was silly.* he realized.  *If the police are following me, then they know where I live.*  He turned the key and was dead-bolted inside before a second had passed.  He was nervous the rest of the day, but even so, having not slept the night before, he was out the minute his head hit the pillow.  His sleep was disturbed by the images he'd forgotten from the previous night.  The police station, the cuffs, the dark rooms, the bright light.  But this time, they were followed by bandages, and paperwork.  His mother was there.  Thanks to the medications he'd been on in the past, she'd always had his healthcare power of attorney.  But what were the suits doing there, in his hospital room?  What was he doing in a hospital?  This all felt like a vivid memory clouded in the depths of his mind. If only he could make sense of it all.    Suddenly, everything was on fire.  He woke due to the searing pain in his skull.  It was strongest on the same spot in the back of his head from which the headaches always originated.  He could swear he had a tumor.  He'd been to the doctors to try and get help for it, but they always drew the same conclusion: that it was nothing and it would go away on its own.  *It's been almost 15 years.* he thought through the anguish.  *It's not going away.*  As he finally drifted back to sleep from exhaustion, and a jungle began to materialize around him, he heard a voice *His name is Richard Leery.*  As he seeped into the dream world, his pain grew silent, replaced instead by images of a man, his next victim.  As he stalked him through the wild, he felt a sense of relief.  But it was short-lived.  As his lucidity increased, he began to draw a damning conclusion.  He slowed his run to a jog.  *What if I don't chase him?*   ***again, last part is another reply because character limit***   He saw a rustle in the woods behind his home, as he was finishing the body disposal process in his shed out back behind his quaint, rural residence.  There was a quick crunching of leaves as if someone had darted away.  *Why did I keep the shed door open?*  He thought.  It was because it was hot and he was all alone, or so he'd thought.  He quickly ran outside, only to find absolutely nothing there.  He stood there confused and unnerved for a minute.  He did a quick search of the area, finding no trace that anyone had been there.  *It must have been an animal* he thought.    Just then, he heard helicopter blades overhead.  He ducked back inside the shed just in time to see the chopper pass over his property and into the starry dusk.  Helicopters passed over rural areas all the time.  Especially since there was a military base only a couple hours away.  This was nothing unusual.  As he made the final disposal of the aspiring senator's now indistinguishable remains, (*the filthy liar*), and made his way towards the back door, he began to wonder why he had never been caught.  Sure, he knew he was good, and careful, but even the best get caught eventually.  Someone sees something; they get too comfortable and slip up; people start to notice a pattern.  What is stranger is, other than the odd mention of a victim's sudden disappearance, there has been no media coverage speculating that any of these people had been murdered.  Not even a story covering why the crows and other scavengers in this country are extremely fat.  He chuckled to himself at that last one, as he sharpened his Bowie knife in the rustic kitchen.    His first kill, at the age of 27, had been somewhat sloppy, and he'd really thought he'd be caught as a result.  But now, as a 42 year old veteran of the trade, he had the confidence and experience to pull it off seamlessly every time.  Life had trained him well.  So had his dreams.  In his dreams, he is like hunter; a predator stalking its' prey.  He even felt lucid in these dreams, using them as a training ground to perfect his techniques.    At first, he had picked his victims based on opportunity, but he gradually began to seek out victims resembling those he had unconsciously stalked in the night.  As any trace evidence of his crimes went down the shower drain, he considered the strangeness of it all.  Starting back with his first kill.  Well, his first human kill.  He had chopped the body into pieces, and buried each one in separate areas in the woods on the other side of town, far back from the road, perpendicular to the river.    That weekend, a family went camping by the river, and their dog had found the one closest to the riverbank.  Police had sent canine units to scour the area, and were able to uncover 5 more pieces of the body.  They had identified the victim as a missing person.  He only found this out through word of mouth though, as the police had taken caution to keep this story from going national.  The town was suffering as it was, and the last thing they needed was for commuters passing through to find another route or cease stopping there for gas and supplies, or for people to stop camping there.  So the story of 12 year-old Nathan Grier was kept under-wraps, relegated to hearsay and local legend.     He assumed they never found the rest of the body because animals had beat them to it.  Scavengers.  He had done it with the same Bowie knife he just sharpened.  It had been a gift from his father, a veteran of the Vietnam War.  His old man had committed suicide after decades of suffering with intense PTSD flashbacks; he'd used that same Bowie knife, which the loyal son had carelessly left on a stump out back after skinning a rat.  He was 14 at the time.  By the time the body was found in the morning, the old man had no eyes.  He had seen the crows take off with pieces of his father in the rising sun, leaving behind an empty husk with a soulless stare.    He set his Bowie knife on his bedside table and turned off the lamp, settling into the covers for his nightly adventure.  ----------------------  *His name is Jeremy Pickett.*   *So it's one of those nights...* he thought.  Sometimes, his dreams were more lucid than usual.  He had long been pursuing victims resembling the prey in his dreams, but occasionally, the prey had names, names which were stated like a voice-over in his mind.  He would usually wake from these dreams to get on his computer and find that these people were real, and really looked as they did in his dream.    He did not believe in the supernatural.  He knew there had to be a logical explanation for this; he just didn't know what.  He sat up on the edge of his bed and put his slippers on, the sun making stripes through the blinds.    He laid the knife on the kitchen counter as he set about making his breakfast.  It was a Saturday morning, and he was gearing up for a short road trip.  Jeremy Pickett was a public school teacher two hours north.  What he had done didn't matter.  He grabbed his keys.  Pickett was real, he was in the dream, and he was going to die.    As the trees wooshed past behind him, he thought about these specified victims.  Perhaps he was simply an agent of divine justice.  He had ruminated over this many times, and throughout his prolific career, he had yet to come up with a better answer.    It was high noon; he pulled off into a gas station to refuel himself and the Explorer.    He expertly handled the mountain roads with a BLT in hand.  Before long, he arrived at the address.  The school directory had listed Pickett's home telephone, a quick look-up of which had provided his home address.    Fully-covered from leaving evidence, despite the heat, he parked in the woods out back, and slinked his way towards the back door of the house.  It was unlocked.  *Simple mountain folk.*  -------------- It was dusk once again by the time he turned off the meat grinder and exited his shed.  Pickett had been a skinny fellow, but the woodland creatures swarmed excitedly for a free meal nonetheless.   He was inside in time to watch the evening news with his dinner.  He had a terrible feeling in the pit of his stomach.  It was not the venison he was having trouble digesting.  There was a news report about the teacher's disappearance, as, although he wouldn't have been missed at the school until Monday, his sister was coming to visit him and had arrived that evening to find an empty house. She had found a note on the nightstand, that Pickett had written, which came across as lost and suicidal.    "Police are searching the forest surrounding the tiny mountain community, in the hopes, that secluded though his home may be, they may find Jeremy Pickett still alive.  Back to you, Tom."  He switched off the TV.  This had never happened before.  Of two things he was certain:  Pickett had not been suicidal, and *he* did not plant that note.  *So who did...*  He was filled with questions, and fear.  Someone knew he had been there and killed Jeremy Pickett, and they were trying to cover it up.  *Why?*  Maybe it was someone who had wanted Pickett dead, was coming to kill him, and finding him already gone, was paranoid they would be charged with the murder.  That was the logical explanation.  *But who?*   He couldn't just accept that without any evidence to back it up.  He opened his laptop and began to reasearch.  Pickett had been on the news, so it would not cause any suspicion to look him up now.    Pickett had taught History; most notably, Ancient Civilizations, and Security in Modern Government since the Cold War.  There was a blog.  He scrolled through the posts, when something posted two days ago caught his eye.  Pickett had, linking to past posts and various news articles, claimed that he had pieced together evidence of a secret organization behind several assassinations and world events.  Most insanely, he claimed the organization was secretly an arm of the government.  *This guy was a nutcase...* He thought, closing the laptop.    *You're one to talk.*  He sat up straight and shook his head, attempting to shake off the delusions of the half-sleep into which he must have fallen on that couch.    *I've overstepped my boundaries.*   He thought.  *What am I talking about?*  He wondered.  What boundaries?  *I must be really tired.  random neural firings.  I'm ready to dream.*  As he crawled into bed, he picked up the remote and turned on the TV.  Tonight, he felt like having some background noise, which was entirely unusual for him, but he really just wanted to drown out the confusing thoughts nagging at his mind.    ***the rest is in a comment below because of character limit***   I'm not a scientist, but I will explain to you my understanding/beliefs about these types of events in the most scientific and simple/agreeable way possible.  Thoughts are electrical impulses.  You know how people reference being on the same wavelength?  Well, just like radio waves and sound waves (like from when you speak), your thought energy/waves are not necessarily confined within your skull. When people finish each other's sentences or get what you mean without having to say anything, it can be partially knowing someone well, and partially picking up on their general ideas of thoughts, the wavelengths which have made their way out from the mind.  You know how sometimes you can sense when someone is angry or upset, or you can feel excited energy radiating from people?  When someone just exudes happiness or fear?  These excessive emotions radiate off them as waves of energy, and although we cannot see them, we can pick up on it and feel it.  People who have closer connections to people tend to "read" them better because they are more receptive to these signals.  Also, some people who realize this actively feel for it and are more open to these signals.     Think of it this way:  the waves and signals are all around us to pick up, some people just have stronger antennae than others.   Still with me?   So, all of that is just natural part of being human, and although I don't know the extent of scientific study of these concepts, it is a simple fact that we are run by electrical impulses, and it is clear to anyone who has felt that emotion radiating from a person, or who has just known something was up with grandma and had the urge to call her, we can pick up on the electrical signals of other people.     Side note: Once you speak, or once a TV broadcast is made, for instance, those sound/radio waves travel forever (which is how we pick up on ideas others have already done and whatnot).    About predicting stuff, I think this happens either one of two ways (either way, you're picking up on signals, the difference is how the signals get to you).    1. Most likely: you (subconsicouly) pick up on things which will lead to the event, and your mind draws the conclusions from there.   2. Less likely, but still a possibility: These thought waves and similar energies involved in the question at hand, however may not travel unidirectionally through time.  Like ripples in a pond, they may travel round, or they may travel outward from the point of origin in both directions of time, like a number line.  Meaning, the event, even though it happens in the future (I'm still operating under the assumption that time is linear), may produce waves of energy or a ripple effect, which the perceptive can pick up on.   Either way, I am 100% certain (until/unless something happens to prove this wrong) that: precognition, in the form of sudden thoughts or through dreams, is the result of picking up on waves/signals passing through the universe around us.   I have precognitive dreams frequently enough to know it's not a coincidence.  And, unlike some of the other commenters, I don't just remember after the real event has taken place.  I make note of my dreams when I awake.  Most of the time, dreams are metaphorical, so that can be subjective to interpretation.  Sometimes, however, it is more direct.  The most recent one I had was in January.  In the middle of a perfectly wacky hodgepodge of randomness which is a dream, I suddenly had to go to the store with my mom to return a pack of socks.  And when I got up in the morning, guess what my mom said we had to go do?  Except, the socks in the dream were white, like what I wear, and the ones in real life were black, and had been for my brother.  That is just a result of how the information is filtered through my perceptual set; my brain's interpretation of the signals based upon my expectation/perspective of what a sock is.  I think that case in particular shows support for option 1 of how these signals reach us.  While I was sleeping, my mom was probably already thinking about the need to return the socks, and I simply picked up on those thought waves.    It is a logical explanation.  Judge for yourself how scientific it is.  But, I believe you were using scientific/logical interchangeably insofar as finding a reasonable explanation.    So I hope this is helpful to you.  I apologize for writing you a book, but I wanted to provide as much background and examples as I could, since this is starting from square one for you.  I wanted to leave nothing to assumption.   "willing or wishing things to happen" you mean like /r/energy_work ?  Knowing you're dreaming and taking control of it (to whatever degree you can manage) occurs all within your own mind.  Exerting influence over your surroundings in waking life is a different process/concept entirely, as the energy and intentions do not stay just within your mind.  I certainly don't think that consciousness is just another form of dreaming.    Dreaming, however, is another state of consciousness.  So I guess that's really a matter of our frame of reference.    If we were dreaming more than we were awake, we would probably refer to being awake as a clearer dream-like state.  Still, the mechanics of real life do not match up with the mechanics of dreaming.  You can use your energy to try and make a headache go away, or to make/encourage people [to] leave your office, but you can't will yourself to fly like you can in a dream.  So, no, we are not all dreaming.     so the killer's ghost may be in the kitchen.... But who is Rachel?   /r/shortscarystories   so you consented to be possessed by some unknown spirit with unknown intentions, and didn't make it go away?  He could still be possessing you, you know.  Just being quiet, watchful, waiting.   He likes to prank he said.  sounds like a trickster.  He may be pranking *you*, my friend.  He will rear his ugly head again when you go to see your friend.  Sorry to spoil that for you, if you were waiting to be surprised.  Sooner you know, the better though, because the "pranks" will only get uglier, and more dangerous.   making glitches; that is interesting. The only thing I can point you to is /r/energy_work , but that is not really a glitch; it's about directing your energy and intentions (which are electrical impulses) to a purpose.  The same way you can move your arm with your mind, you can try to exert influence on other things around you.   Instigating a glitch, like for example, making objects disappear from one place and reappear in another, is a whole other animal.  Now, people have certainly tried to do this with themselves and others.  I don't know if anyone other than Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka has succeeded in that.   maybe you are connecting with spirits when you are half asleep, in an altered state of consciousness.  The only reason I really think that is the girl.  It could also explain the other incidents.    I want to call the last one sleep paralysis, really, I do.  But did you really open your eyes twice?  Could you have dreamed that you did?  I also have no idea what to make of the rocking, except your grandpa theory is plausible.  but I don't see why he would continue to rock you into adulthood.    More questions than answers.   yeah; I wasn't expecting anything like that, so I made the mistake of reading this at 3 am right before intending to go to bed.   my thoughts exactly   nice to see mention of a tulpa.  I mentioned tulpas in [a post] (https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/31rzm7/darting_shadow/) on /r/paranormal and they'd never heard of it.    hmm, well I certainly wasn't talking about "other emotions", but rather physical healing processes.  Such as illnesses and bleeding for instance.  like, when my nose is bleeding (I keep bringing this up in comments, but it's the most common healing occurrence for me and thus an easy example), to stop it, I picture blocking the blood flow to the injured area, sealing it off, and then the wound closing into solid skin again.  Of course, I am, while picturing this, breathing out slowly and feeding the energy to it.  Although, with things like this, unlike pain, the visualization for me is focused on the healing itself more than the energy.  I don't really see my energy in that; just my visualization of the injured area.  For more internal issues, it is much more vague and involves more picturing of the energy itself.    That may just be a reflection of my level of biological knowledge though.  With a nosebleed, it stops immediately once I've done that.  Other things, not as effective.  So maybe it is more effective if you specifically know what to direct it to do.  who knows?  Either way, regardless of the specificness of your visualizations, ultimately, you are feeding energy in as a catalyst to the healing process.  So it certainly doesn't have to be so specific, as the body already knows what to do with it.  Just thought I'd clarify in case it's of any help or interest to you.   it could also just be part of the urge to write it off as a coincidence or trick of the mind.  If you think its silly to share or you might be making a fool of yourself or something out of nothing, you're likely not to say anything.   yes, please; other events.  and you did an amazing job holding down the fort.  That was incredibly brave.   yet to be exposed to this; now I will definitely check it out, but not tonight....  edit: nevermind; I googled it and yes I have read it.  I really liked it actually.  I didn't think the creatures themselves were that impressive though.  Maybe watching it is creepier.  But from what I just saw, the movie was described as "so bad its good", so...   perhaps weird neural-firings such as this were the inspiration for the slenderman story, because tall, humanoid, black, and spidery makes me think of that.   I've put things in my wallet or another very specific place, and have it disappear with no explanation.  At least you found the check.   I also thought of VAT when I read this (since I am currently in the UK), but I didn't know there was more of a connection than it being a three letter acronym.  Good to know   If that made it too the cover I can only just imagine how bad its' inside on the inside  I'm sorry.  I had to.  you're are picture is just asking for it.  Your probably getting fired up reading this, so why not take the energy and learn to are cook some Pizza?    what's with the use of levels?   Is that a d d reference?  Anyway, good job!  I also visualize removing the pain or problem, though I tend to see it more as red than black.  And my energy I always see as blue, regardless of what I'm doing with it.   But those are personal differences and irrelevant to the process.  You did well; the only thing is, as someone else mentioned, to be careful to toss it aside and not take it in.  Also, with different types of things you're trying to heal, you may find different visualizations more effective.  Pain is quite straightforward, but for other things, you may find you need to visualize more of the process inside (not on an advanced, technical level, but on a basic functional one).  I do; some others I've spoken to do not though, they just contribute the positive energy to the healing process.    Just try things and see what works for you.  Good luck!   don't know much about seeing auras first hand.  I have a friend from HS who could (she said mine was big and blue at the time).  I can feel them though.  Aura color and size is a reflection of emotion (and, at a resting position, personality) from my understanding (correct me anyone if I'm wrong).    What I can feel is the emotions and energies radiating off of people.  When someone is angry or nervous very much so, it radiates off of them and I can feel it deep inside.  This is an enlarging of the aura.  When someone closes themselves up like a wall, I can feel the wall.    I can't visibly see them though.    I would say seeing and feeling them are entirely different things.  To hone any ability though, you exercise it and push yourself a little more each time; but the key is to not try too hard; don't over-think anything.  Just relax and do.  Trying too hard and over-thinking causes things to tense up and not work.  That seems to be universal for all abilities.  So, just bear that in mind.    Good luck!   this reminds me of [Her Name Was Emma](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/29z7j8/her_name_was_emma/)  Really freaky.  There are people on facebook who I have a ton of mutuals with and went to the same school with but legitimately never met.  It wasn't a big school by any means, but big enough that, with the variety of classes and tracks one can be in, you pretty much end up meeting just over half of your grade from your various classes.  I could maybe have had gym with them at some point (since that involves congregating a lot of people from different academic backgrounds and grades) but otherwise, I didn't really meet them.  That is not unusual.  What is unusual is how close your close friends said they were to this person while you were close to them.  It's bizarre.  As long as you don't find a picture of you and J, then you're ok.   Not terribly obscure, but I've yet to meet another person irl who's heard of it.  The Young Wizards Series by Diane Duane.  It is YA SciFi Fantasy Coming of Age story which will empower and inspire you to live up to your full potential.  It is my favorite book series of all time.  The books go as follows:  So You Want To Be a Wizard Deep Wizardry  High Wizardry A Wizard Abroad The Wizard's Dilemma A Wizard Alone Wizard's Holiday Wizards at War A Wizard of Mars  10 is currently in the works  My favorite individual book of all time is not obscure at all.  It's : The Count of Monte Cristo .  Fundamentally though, I recommend that everyone read The Barcode Rebellion by Suzanne Wyrn (sorry if I mispelled the name).  It is a warning about what can happen in the world with technology and discrimination...   one of my favorite quotes is by Solzhenitsyn, and I think it *might* be from this book, but it's been years since I last read it.  The quote is (as I remember):  "There is a fine line between good and evil.  That line is drawn not between principalities and powers, but through every human heart.  ....[something about discerning the evil within one's self and doing good. (I dont remember the rest of the wording)]."   oh, ha ha.  I mean that was dangerous for the theif, not for you   um, even if his intention was to distance you so you dont get too attached and no one gets heartbroken, kissing another girl in front of you to nip it in the bud is the wrong way to do it.  That just makes the heartbreak happen now rather than later.  He could have just started spending a little less time with you and made it clear that you guys maybe shouldn't be too too close if you're FWB.  It sucks that he did that to you and threw away the friendship.  That was entirely unnecessary.  And being good close friends and FWB do not have to be mutually exclusive.  See this vids I shared to see an example of that: http://kineticpassion.tumblr.com/post/114937322020/full-benefits  Good luck salvaging the friendship if you really still think he's worth it after what he did.   3 goes out to you, man.  watch these that I've linked here http://kineticpassion.tumblr.com/post/114937322020/full-benefits  idk if it helps any, but that shows us inexperienced people that this kind of thing can be healthy, caring relationship.

You're the kind of person who makes me proud to be a Canadian. Keep fighting the good fight.   I agree. There's not much sense in topping a burger with lobster, because lobster has such a delicate flavour that it is easily overwhelmed by anything stronger. For that reason lobster is best eaten right out of the shell.    I stopped watching this show in 1998, so I really don't care what they do at this point.   Probably the latter.

 I see debate all the time on here about buying a cheap car. Heck, I give that advice to people on here.  I'm actually sharing a car with my girlfriend right right now, but in the next year or so I'll have to get one of my own.  I care almost nothing about style. If it is safe and affordable then it's for me.  So what is the most cost effective used car taking into account MPG, potential repairs, how long it lasts, and of course purchase price?  Also, I'm assuming stay away from dealers? Or can they beat Craigslist sellers, on average?   Is that really true?  Couldn't someone just "sell" their home to a family member who would "sell" it right back to them?  Edit: [found a source](http://www.boe.ca.gov/proptaxes/pdf/lta12060.pdf) That's crazy!   Huh, I hadn't seen that. Doesn't mean you can't try!   Bitch my line breaks are just fine!   Ok, so an emergency fund is generally thought of as "if I lose my job tomorrow, I want 3-6 months of income." With that said, right now, I doubt your food expenses are $0. Do you work 7 days a week and eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there? If not, then it's not $0.  Here's your monthly budget: Car: $325 Rent: $550 Bills: $165 Gas: $100 Car insurance: ??? - assuming $100 for now Health insurance: ??? - assuming you don't have it for now Food (if you lost your job): $300 Minimum payment on CC: $60 Total: $1600  This means for a bare minimum emergency fund, you need $4800 (3 months of expenses). This is goal #1.  As an income estimate, I'm getting $2565 per month after taxes for you. Your current expenses (assuming $100/month for food and $100/month for car insurance) are $1400. This leaves you $1165 to save per month. Since you already have $3000 in you emergency fund, you only need to make the minimum payment on your CC for a month and a half to save to the full $4800 for emergency fund.  Goal #2 is knock out that debt. Currently at $1500, you just need 5 weeks after your emergency fund to knock out that debt. This means you put the full $1165 you have extra each month at that CC.  Goal #3(a) is build a savings. I saw you said your employer does not offer a 401K. This means you fund an IRA. Currently the limits are $5500/year. Since you save $1165 per month you should have this fully funded within 5 months. After that, you move on to an individual brokerage account where you can save money, but that doesn't give you any special tax breaks. I use Scottrade personally and like them, but you should look into your own. I also recommend using the 3 fund portfolio (http://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) for your investing. They should also be able to set you up the IRA.  Goal #3(b) is an alternative to Goal #3(a). This is you going back to college. I saw in your other comment you went for 3 years for Biology then stopped b/c you ran out of money. You should definitely consider going back. The advantage to going through life with a college degree is so massive that you would be an idiot not to if you had the opportunity. How many credits short of your degree are you and what is the cost of a year? I would almost recommend you take out any loans necessary to complete your degree.    P.S. Also, never buy a car that expensive again. It doesn't do anything. If you make over $100K a year, sure buy something nice. But until then, remember all a car needs to do is get you safely from point A to B. Think $5000 car instead, the next time you need a car.   You sound like you have a very good head on your shoulders. I wish you the best of luck. If your situation gets abusive for you or your siblings, do not hesitate to call 911 immediately. Don't let him scare you into not reporting. Also, you should be able to advocate to the court on your own behalf and they will likely take it into consideration.   They did say it was pretty smart. So it could follow you into the bank vault and just wait in the doorway. It could just wait for you there until you tried to come out or fell asleep. Not like it had anywhere better to be.   I can see it now: he gives the mom the money and gets a lien on the home. Now the mom can't make the payments to him so he initiates... foreclosure, getting back to the original problem.   Jesus Christ you need to stop loaning ANYONE money. After your brother pays you back you need to get out of that game. Your parents should not expect it. If anyone asks just say you're sorry but don't have the budget for it.  Also, you need to sit down and have a serious discussion with your gf. I saw in another reply you said you plan on marrying her a bit down the road. If so, you need to discuss together if you two will be subsidizing her mother, because if she continues this now, I guarantee the mother will only expect it more in the future. If I were you, I would point out things the mom has done to shoot herself in the foot, such as quit her job when she could not afford it, take in dogs when she couldn't afford it, take in a nephew when she couldn't afford it, and take in an alcoholic boyfriend when she couldn't afford it. Show your girlfriend how irresponsible her mom is and that your gf is only enabling this lifestyle and making it worse by giving her money.   Pepper spray can actually be pretty dangerous. At 15, you're probably old enough to be able to handle it, but a 9 year old? You might consider taking it away from the 9 and 11 year olds. Then you and the 13 year old can step up for them if they are in an abusive situation in any way.  Also, you should probably have your mom show you how use it properly and actually practice. It's harder than it looks.   Yes, they take anonymous reports.   You are entitled to access to your cards. He cannot just shut off your money supply. You need to talk to a lawyer about this and divorce immediately.   This is definitely what I'm reading as well. To clarify for OP: this is something that they theoretically could take foreclose on your home for, but practically will likely not.  OP should probably contact the city tax assessor (wherever you pay your property taxes to) and pay the lien. It will likely be a similar amount (if not slightly more for interest and maybe fees to file the lien) to the amount he sent the check for originally.   Wait, you owe $1500 in CC debt or your minimum payment is $1500? If it's what you owe, what is your minimum payment? This will change how much you need for an emergency fund.  Also, how do you eat for free? Parents?  Last, trade down in your car if possible. How much is it worth?   I get it. I accept that there will be reposts. But wasn't this just reposted last week?   That's.... a unique take on things...   Right. And I think universal healthcare is the way to go. It's cheaper per person.  I'm just saying with the way the US is set up, we can't have open enrollment year round.   Unfortunately it's necessary. Since they are not allowed to discriminate based on preexisting condition, everyone could just not pay for health insurance until they get a major illness and then all the insurance companies would go bankrupt and nobody could get health insurance.   Yea, sounds like he's just horrible at flirting. You say he's been celibate for 5 years? He's probably REALLY out of practice at flirting.  Next time you're with him in a private place. Sit down next to him, look him in the eyes, and tell him you have a crush on him and want to explore it. Explicitly ask for a response. If he gives you a positive indicator, maybe try for a kiss if it feels right.   Funny how it defines Ephobophilia as attraction to 15-19 year olds. I'm sure nearly every guy in the world would admit attraction to an 18 year old, and yet according that that, it's the same as attraction to a 15 year old. The imaginary boundaries we set make the world a strange place.   Let me give you a scenario: You are walking down the street with your friend when someone runs up and stabs your friend to death with a knife then tosses it at you. Instinctually, you catch it. The stabber escapes in a car but you didn't see the color, type, or license plate because you were focused on your friend. The police show up shortly after and you are arrested. Now last week, you and your friend were in a big argument in front of lots of people and you threatened him in front of everyone, but you two cooled down and were friends again.  If you tell the police this, and they offer you a deal of five years in prison, your "idiot" public defender would be the worst attorney in the world if they DIDN'T encourage you to take the deal. She would say it doesn't matter if you're guilty or not because the evidence would point to you being found guilty, and she would be correct. If you threatened suicide if found guilty that would not help in the least.  This is the world we live in. It only matters what the evidence shows. I'm assuming the evidence in your case points to you being guilty, even if you are completely innocent. How would you like the justice system to change to accommodate innocent defendants who look guilty? Take their word on it?   It makes me wonder if "It" would risk giving itself away by killing someone in front of that many people. Wouldn't all the passengers see her get ripped to shreds and be like ...?   I saw it as they never tested how smart it was, and so thought maybe it would get in and they'd electrocute it.  Afterwards, Jay knew she'd never escape it and so she just settled for Paul because she knew she'd at least have a partner to get through life. She wasn't completely happy, but it also wasn't the worst thing in life.   Can you give an approximate rank of your pre-transfer school?   Well if OP's wife does not own a vibrator that a condom would conceivably be used for then this is still an effective method. Or, if she does, he can ask her quickly where she bought the condom and check if she used her card there recently.   This movie killed it. I love my coming of age films and have watched every one I can, but this film easily tops them all.  I would say a distant second is Moonrise Kingdom.   Same. Me and the gf share a medium popcorn and large icee at ever movie. Hell sometimes we'll throw in a chicken strip combo. I know I'm overpaying and I'm ok with it.   Wow. This is genius. Because lets be honest, we're all telling him to confront her. But if she's at all a decent liar, she will convince him any number of ways it ended up there and just hide evidence better. With this method, if she hides it, she's almost certainly guilty. But if she tells OP, it's likely to be some sort of misunderstanding.   Interesting you bring that up. It's certainly something I've considered. I just need to sit down and run the numbers. Thanks for the article!   Police are mandatory reporters. They will just pass it off to CPS. Again, you are introducing anecdotal evidence.   I simplified down my situation. I also have a gf who will be graduating at the same time and bringing in a similar income. I've calculated what our after tax income will be and budgeted appropriately.   So if it were me, I would sell the car to a private party and have them go to your bank to pay it off, then immediately sign over title. That way you just need to focus on saving as much as you can towards the difference between car value and amount owed.   Dear god the interest rate on that vehicle!  I'm unfamiliar with how the process works when selling a car worth less than what you owe, but do you have to pay off the entire difference at once? If so, then do everything you can to get rid of it. Only pay the minimum on your CC debts and apply it to a fund to pay off the difference, because every month you keep the car, it is depreciating faster than you can pay down the loan.  So sell the car as soon as possible, buy a $5K car, and get a loan for that car if you have to. Or better yet, is public transportation an option for a while?  After that, assuming your car payment will be substntially lower, you should be able to pay off about $1800 in debt each month. Apply that to the card with the highest interest rate, making only minimum payments on the others.  You could be debt free in 7 months after you get rid of the car. Use that as motivation and stick to your budget after you're debt free.   Having a plan. If I made $50K a year and owed $75K, I'd live on $20K and throw $30K at the debt to pay it off in approximately 3 years. Done, no worries.  My situation is I am projected to earn $80K and owe about $105K when I graduate law school. My plan is to live on $50K (more than reasonable) and throw the rest at my debt until it's gone. Not only do I not worry day to day, but I sometimes splurge a bit because I'm comfortable with that debt. I'm aware that for every dollar I spend, I will owe about $1.30 for, and yet I still went to Disneyland a couple weekends ago because I thought it was worth it.   By arguing that they should not be considered "safe" to call, you are arguing they are likely to do more harm than good.  I vehemently disagree with that notion, as do many others. I think anyone who suspects child abuse of any sort has a moral obligation to contact them. Let me ask, how would you handle a situation in which you suspect a child is being abused?   LOL. The panic in someone's eyes when they need medical attention and the EMT asks their religion. They reply Christian thinking they are close to being saved. And the EMT just starts packing up, looking over his shoulder, "I only serve atheists."   I went to UTSA and graduated UT last year. The GPA did not transfer.   As someone who did a year at UTSA, I can say that the classes were beyond easy. They were easier than my community college classes. Now, a big reason for this is because I pretty much decided I would have no life. I went to the gym a bit, but other than that I had no life other than studying. I easily got a 4.0 in all 10 classes.  I'm assuming the quality of classes is similar at UTSA and Arlington. If so, and you are willing to sacrifice 9 months of your life to obtain your goal, then I would encourage you to go to Arlington. Baylor will likely be harder with a smaller chance of successful transfer.  The important part is to be totally committed. No (or very few) parties. And little time spent on socialization. I saw it as, friends don't really matter because I'm only gonna be here for 9 months. Just suck it up for 9 months and focus completely on academics and you will easily be able to get a 4.0. Best of luck. Let me know if you have any other questions.   While there are surely bad CPS agents, that is not cause to get rid of CPS. Just like we should not abolish the prison system because sometimes innocent people go to prison, we should not abolish CPS just because some agents lie or exaggerate to get children removed from homes.  Does the system need reform? Likely so, but that does not mean they do more harm than good.   Your experience is anecdotal evidence. The article specifically says "One data point I couldn't find, in the report or elsewhere: the number of children taken from parents, even temporarily, only to be returned with no finding of unlawful behavior."     Man if you could somehow trick it to board a shuttle before takeoff, and get them to just push it out while on Mars... That'd be the end goal.   And I'm arguing you that you abolish all of those programs and replace with universal healthcare. It's cheaper per capita than what we pay collectively.  As for the supplemental insurance, the point is that some people will never be happy so you give them the opportunity to pay for faster healthcare.  And for being glad to hand money over, it's something that's the right thing to do. I know because right now I'm poor and know what it's like to need resources and will be happy to support those in need. I've given substantial money to homeless who were in need when I was earning money because I could see they needed it. That's what being human is about.   I understand that, but kids are not the best judges, nor are they always privy to all the facts. Contrary to popular belief, CPS does not just remove children at whim. They do thorough investigations and only remove when there is overwhelming evidence. If anything they usually remove later than they should.   I think that if the counselor felt it necessary to push boundaries, she should have the discretion to. Many kids are not forthcoming about their abuse. If 9 kids have to be needlessly interrogated to save 1 from an actual abusive household, I believe it is worth it. Yes, it's a hassle for those kids, but there will always be innocents in any sort of system.  The bar for defamation would have to be that she knowingly made a false statement. I don't know why you're assuming the counselor said anything other than "I suspect the following abuse..." She is obviously doing her job and should be given the benefit of the doubt. Of course if I am wrong, OP is gladly free to correct me on this point.   Do it!  If there's one thing you should have no regrets about, it's love. Since there are strong mutual feelings, you should not let this opportunity escape. Date him and if it's worth it, have one of you move to the other. Best of luck! Update us!   The possibility of sexual abuse was a different incident from the bruising. It was mandatory that she report it if she suspected.  Seriously, what motivation do you think this woman has, other than doing her job, that would be furthered by harassing OP?  Edit: it's not defamation or slander because there is at least a somewhat reasonable basis for her thinking that OP is abusive. He would have no case for that.   I did know they had supplemental insurance in the UK and think it would be a fine idea to introduce in the US after we have socialized healthcare.  As for the "free" part of your argument, I grew up in an upper middle class family. My proposal would increase taxes on my parents. You are correct in that I have little income currently, but being in law school, I can safely project that my gf and I will collectively bring home at least $160K annually in a few years and I will be GLAD to pay my fair share of taxes and subsidize healthcare for those who cannot afford it. This is because I have empathy and a pro-society viewpoint that supports the lives of people that need help.   Oh I totally thing it's a step in the right direction but does not go far enough. When Cruz says "repeal and replace" what do you think he means? And what would you like him to mean?  Because when I say replace. I mean that we should have a system much like the UK, where all medical services are free and paid for with a higher tax rate. That is shown to be vastly cheaper per capita than the current system we have in place. But I know that is exactly what Cruz constituents are against and believe he means replace with something in the opposite direction, which will lead to needless death. That is why I think Cruz is evil.   No, Ted is a horrible person. I agree with the other poster that he's obviously brilliant, and just chooses his positions for political ends.  Just for example, denying that global warming exists, which would result in defunding and initiatives to combat it, if Ted had his way, would cost untold lives in the future. Further, repealing the ACA would also result in untold death by more people not visiting their doctor or getting a certain treatment just because they couldn't afford it. If you knowingly attempt to cause mass deaths, that makes you a horrible person. Thus, since Ted is smart enough to understand these consequences, he is a horrible person.   Seriously. I feel like I'm crazy here. Why would the counselor not report the abuse? She's required to by law!   Dude not the same at all. The counselor saw the child withdrawn and reported it. The counselor saw bruising and reported it. The counselor heard about possible sexual abuse and reported it. The counselor is a MANDATORY reporter. If she suspects child abuse at all, she must report it. She's letting CPS investigate. She's only doing her job.   Yea not related at all. There's substantial reason for the counselor to believe the child is being mistreated. It happens to be wrong here, but that doesn't mean counselor a should stop investigating child abuse claims when a parent complains.   Thank you for some support. I feel like I'm going nuts. If I were a counselor and suspected abuse from 3 separate incidents, I would also report each incident. No way should the counselor be forced to stop just because a parent is mad about the investigation. Then wouldn't every parent whose mistreating their kids just complain to the administration that they're being "harassed?"   Show me stats that support that this happens on even a semi-regular business. Or are you saying that we should abolish CPS because there are some innocents taken away?   Honestly, I realize this sucks and is inconvenient to you, but hats off to that counselor. She is doing her job, and seems like she genuinely believes you are beating her and so continually reports all suspected abuse. Maybe you could turn it around and praise her for this. Telling your daughter not to talk to her is possible but will only make the counselor more suspicious of you.  If whenever you are confronted, you tell them you appreciate she is doing her job, and that she is a good person for reporting all suspected abuse, she may let up on you.   That would be a hilarious result of this new policy.   Oh, that makes sense.  So doesn't everyone basically get one "free year?" Like if I start PAYE right after I finish school and my income during the school year was zero, then I would basically not have to pay for the first year?   Bad is an opinion. In my opinion some of it was bad. Yes, I like the 80's feel when the monster was near and the tension was building and when it got really loud, but the high pitched tings did not feel like they fit the moment, and there were lots of them.   That's exactly what /u/xtrexjpsouz described. Your degree was phased out. You chose the degree. They phased it out after letting you finish. The school does not believe there are job opportunities for your degree in the future.  Their deciding this does not allow you to completely discharge your student loans. And why should it? You chose this degree, and even admit if they hadn't offered it then you would have looked elsewhere for the same degree. You believe the school is wrong and that there ARE job opportunities for this degree. So go find those jobs and pay your loans.   Basically, I'll be graduating from law school in 2 years and am considering going solo. Maybe not immediately, but eventually.  How would PAYE work if I have no idea of my income? What if I project I will earn $50K that year and end up with $30k? Do I just pay the differences at the end? What if I project $50K and end up at $80K? Will there be penalties?   That would be hilarious. Like board a plane like you're going to Europe, then just get off after it gets on, and right before the doors close. Then it has to go to Europe.  I would think it would just fly to Europe but then fly right back and resume its plan.   I'm pretty sure it could cross an ocean. From the pool scene we know it can swim. It would just swim slowly and it obviously doesn't run out of energy. But what I want to know is if it can board a plane and get to you if you're really far away.   You can hire a lawyer to write a demand letter for you to the broker. This will likely scare it out of them, but will cost you a few hundred dollars.   Generally the breakeven point for buying a house is about 5 years. Further, you are unlikely to qualify for a house purchase with little credit and low income. Sorry to be a downer.   It's crazy that Aldo is about to tie Anderson Silva's record for title defenses and he's not given the respect as one of the GOATs.   I mean we saw in the pool scene that it can swim. It would probably just swim at you very slowly.   I don't know the nuances of the law there, but maybe you had to verbally assert that you were invoking your rights to mutual combat.   They did say it was smart and it avoided getting into the pool. I don't think it would get into the container but it's worth a try.   So you need a mobile job. Also, can it ride public transportation? Like would it take the bus to get to you?   That would be a great idea! Another idea I thought of would be to shoot it with a tracker dart, so you could always keep track of where it is. But with the whole "it's slow but it's also smart" thing, I'd be wary about it tricking me by putting the dart in another animal and giving me a false sense of security. No doubt it would be worth a try though.   Just wondering what everyone's strategy would be if they caught it.  If it were me, I'd fly to Australia and sleep with a prostitue then fly that person to Europe where I pay them to sleep with someone, then fly that person to Africa and pay them to sleep with someone and then maybe to China and at that point is feel safe.   See I loved the ending. Just curious, what kind of ending were you looking for? Jay to die in the pool?   Just finished It Follows. I've been waiting for the last 3 weeks to see it and... Just wow. It did not let me down.  Yea some of the music was pretty bad but that was about my only complaint. A lot of the shots were very well done. I particularly liked the ending where it's following them both as they casually stroll.  You just get so deep into the psyche when you see Jay getting desperate to bang those dudes on the boat, and the pure panic in her eyes when the window first broke. I loved the concept and am really glad this movie made its big break to 1000 theaters.  Coming from someone who absolutely hates scary movies and only saw this because it was advertised as a scary concept and not jump-scare heavy, I just want to say this movie thoroughly delivered on that promise.  I hope to see more from that writer in the future. P.S. What year was it supposed to be? That little shell reading thing made me think current, but the house phone and other things made me think otherwise.   Thank you. Anecdotal evidence bugs me. Also, nice username.   Have you tried contacting all local jails, hospitals and morgues? Have you filed a missing persons report with the police? Do you know where the car was when it was towed?   Look up Phoenix Jones mutual combat video on YouTube. That's an example. He offers to settle via mutual combat and the cops watch as the guys fight.   According to the way OP posted it, it says he only has to pay it back if HE chooses to leave.  If I were him, this would be acceptable provided the comply gives an exemption if he leaves for medical reasons as nobody could predict that. Although in that case it would arguably not be his CHOICE anyways.  Edit: saw he clarified below, my bad   Edit: misread question    Ah my bad. I took "current dollars" to mean if dollar amounts were current and I missed the second column because I'm on mobile.   1-2%?!? Not true at all.   That $2700 per year is for private colleges and inflation adjusted. It was $655 per year, ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION! Now I'm sad.   Did it seem to give you a boost in your internships?   Just wondering how well you were compensated. The TA's at my school make $1500 per semester, which hardly seems worth it.  Also does it look good on your resume? I got an A+ my first semester in property, which is the area of law I'm looking to get into, so I feel like it would be very on point.   My girlfriend got an accommodation just for 1L exams. Was not for ADD though. Basically she just asked the school what needs to be included in the letter and they told her. It was stuff like: what condition and what accommodations are you requesting. I would recommend you ask the bar what they want in the letter.   So what?   As someone with 187 tickets, plz...   Just to note, you can almost certainly sue the man who beat you up to recover medical cost and other damages. Were you wrong to call her a cunt? Most likely. Was the other guy wrong to beat you up enough to put you in the hospital? Almost surely. Also note, some states have an exclusion on liability for "fighting words."   Former realtor here. Can confirm, Zillow highly inaccurate.   Honestly, if it were me, I ask to meet up with her, and when you show up at the door, ask to just spend some brother-sister time with her. Go to a decently quiet place and just lay it all out there. She sounds like she's pretty smart, just a little overtaken at the moment. Tell her you think it's in her best interest to leave. Plead, beg. Tell her she can leave with you that night and you will help her get on her feet (then be prepared to actually do that).  If she takes you up on it, have her leave with you immediately and make sure she blocks all contact with this guy. After 6 months or so in the "real world" she'll see how crazy he is. Then just hope for the best.   Purely guessing, I'd think that the hospital the professor worked at said "you get free healthcare at any of our facilities" and so when they price out an aspirin at $5 and a bandage at $20, that's what they're projecting in the professor's coverage. This is in contrast to the mother of 3 who works at IBM, where IBM negotiates all the costs with the exact same hospital, where they only get charged $1.50 an aspirin and $3 a bandage.   As a law student, I'm loving how accurate this is. Never thought I'd see "shepardize" used on TV.   Jesus I didn't realize what a murderer's row he was facing until seeing it typed out. I'm not sure anyone outside the top 10 would do better than 0-5.   Do you mind sharing how?   Frustrated =/= angry  I think Poirier was frustrated. Aldo's just pissed at him.   I don't think angry = getting in someone's head. But that doesn't make it true. You're entitled to your opinion though.   That's a nice thought, but almost surely there was a contract provision that required him to return the money. And if he fought it in court, he would almost surely lose and just cost himself the money plus legal fees.  I'm doubting he gave back hundreds of thousands of dollars to a billionaire out of the goodness of his heart.   That just means you're average. I see that you go to a high T2 school. With average grades there, you are may get a semi-decent job. However, if you're positive you do not want to be a lawyer, it's probably wise to get out before you get anymore debt.   Agreed. If OP was a 3L, people here might encourage him to just stick it out for the marginal advantage it might possibly give somewhere down the line. But as a 1L, bail now.   I said nervous or scared.  If some little punk came up to you talking shit but he was like 5'2" and weighed 110 pounds, you wouldn't be scared or nervous, but you'd probably be angry enough to knock him silly. Which is what I expect Aldo to do to Connor.   Why do you think this is getting into Aldo's head? I haven't seen him look nervous or scared at any time.   If they had time, of course, but I was attempting to give a hypothetical in which it would be impractical to change out the candidate's name from the ballots.   Well do it.  You may have to take this to court if the police will not help.   I like to laugh at them. Not out loud, but in my head. Unless you're a 1L and they're being dicks to weed out the class, then they're only doing it because they have fun making other people uncomfortable. In that case, realize how sad their lives are that they have to resort to basically bullying people under them. It is then that you laugh at how pathetic that is.   /r/lawschooloutlines  	104

          I often shower twice a day, which is obviously too much but I like it too much to stop.    I'm not in this video, I'm just a fan of the director.    From this not very creepy article: http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-deranged-authors-who-wrote-same-book-over-over_p3/         You looked more like her than she did?    "I'm not proud. Well, I'm a little proud."   This was clearly meant to piss MRA types off so they'd share it and hate it.    Have you ever found out you sold stolen goods?    How necromantic.    As a former Eagle Scout, I hated camping so much for eleven years that going out into the forest in general is torture.    A year ago when my Dad died and word of it got around at work.          I wrote a quick story for NoSleep about a child predator, and people were suggesting a sequel where the guy gets punished because in the end of my story he's still in control of the situation.   My take on horror is that doing so would weaken the story. That kind of moralism feels cheap and too clean. Like, in reality, I get both the feeling a lot of perpetrators get away with it, so having a punishment in this situation feels off, even though it's a supernatural situation. It also feels like it goes against the point of the story to make people feel uncomfortable.   Of course people will claim that's an excuse to make exploitation, but I mean solely in regards to how fictional characters are treated.    Yay! Free balloons and rifle covers!   To be fair, for a lot of them, like me, it is kind of a choice. We choose to not risk humiliation, we choose to not do a lot of the things that might make us more attractive, and we choose to not settle for desperate equally unattractive people.    If he was too nervous to even be in the same room as a stranger,  I assume he didn't used to be too socially active.       That's not very stoic of you.

So I ended up having three dinners.   I'm killing myself at the gym but I'm not about to cut back on food either.     Yes. You're supposed to feel like sharing it.       They shouldn't be women's shelters. They should be domestic abuse shelters. I worked at one of them and they took in battered men too. Many victims of physical domestic are men. Yes, women clearly have it worse, but that's statistically relevant.  http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/sep/05/men-victims-domestic-violence   In another exciting, stupid chapter in "/u/test_subject9069 Goes to the Gym," I tend to go late at night and stay for awhile because I have a lot of calories to burn and a lot of other people have friends or whatever so I feel lonelier being around a bunch of other people. Because the lights are motion activated, apparently I can use an elliptical in the corner and the lights will go out. Last night at like two a.m. another guy showed up who looked like he was in his forties and heavily balding. He seemed surprised to see me there cause the lights were off and I guess he had the same social anxiety I do only much worse, because he went and hid in the bathroom, periodically coming out briefly in his gym clothes before seeing I was still there and going back inside.   Guess I should start coming in earlier.    Yeah? Wait til it's also like that at work and most social events like concerts.

Yeah, I know this option wasn't available to me, but still, being a bit poorer would have been less embarrassing that all the scars I got on my hands and arms.    Last night I couldn't sleep so I went to the gym. I kind of lost track of time and was still there when the bars closed and people began coming back to the dorms, the gym being near campus. I was on an elliptical, my favorite exercise machine in the world, which faced out one of those windows.   Now several times, people have come up in front of me and either mocked me by making exaggerated elliptical-machine-use- gestures, mostly I assume because they're drunk or maybe I look weird using the machine at 2 in the morning.   Last night someone came up to the window again and started doing those little handwaves people do to look cute. I didn't really look but I'd gotten sick of people doing the arm pumping thing at me so I flipped her off. Then I looked over and saw it was by far the most attractive person who'd interacted with me in years looking kind of hurt that I'd done that, and then she turned and walked away.   Obviously she was probably condescending to me for being the weirdo in the gym at that hour and even if I'd smiled waved back it wouldn't have meant anything, but still, *shit*!   So, what are some of the ones you've experienced?    No, lots of people who have it way the hell worse than me cope with it by laughing at the situation. A person with a shitty life has nothing to lose by life ending and ultimately meaning nothing. Now someone with a sweet life and a potential to leave behind a legacy is someone who wants life to have a point and for humanity to keep going if only to preserve memories of them.    Of course it's better to be in a large city. To quote an overweight openly homosexual filmmaker that Kevin Smith had on his podcast, "If you are a gay man in an urban area, you are never more than ten minutes from a free blow job."    Hit on them, embarrass the fuck out of yourself. Then you'll want to avoid the hell out of them instead of be around them.    I think it's the amount of effort you exert. I probably could make myself attractive enough to stop being FA, but I can't get motivated.    28 this year and I haven't had a conversation with a woman who was a stranger or under fifty in months.   Come and eat chicken with me, Beautiful. It's so dark!    You probably aren't an artsy type, but my thing was I found a guy who had an art project he had trouble with finding anyone else willing to help him. He was as insecure/creepy as I imagine people find me, but I just concentrated on getting our stuff done so it wasn't a bother.  Boom! I had an instant wingman and even though I didn't get laid, I know it makes you much less off-putting to women to show up to place with a companion.   Then after graduation he moved away and since then I kind of lost interest in socializing and projects since about last year.    Horror show?! The pointlessness makes it easier to see it all as a comedy, not scarier.     It happens. A guy who called me a faggot a couple times and tried to pants me in gym went to prom with someone I had a crush on. I imagine that didn't work out very well for her since she seemed pretty feminist.       Inflation.       That German photographer. Just kind of an annoying stereotype.    Here it is hilariously featured on QI:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdDq3uo-33I   No, not really. But living with an abusive housemate sure as hell did!   Thanks for putting words and sentiments in our mouths about wanting Megan Fox to make your cliche spouting more timely.    And the studio is probably pleased by the controversy this stirs up.    Last as in "latest" or "final?"   Succeeds: The Neverending Story IMO because it incorporates the 4th wall bending into the story, sort of.   Fails: Rocky and Bullwinkle   This came up in the comments for a recent review of Jupiter Ascending, how it sounded like a good movie to see high. I was wondering if people bother to do that much anymore or if home theaters killed that off.    My point was that neither is badass.    Oh god no, that's the last thing I want to do when I'm FA unless it's cold as fuck outside. But that's why I'm planning to move to Texas this year.    Yay, I'm now "That Scoop who doesn't like it when Donnelly says 'cunt.'"   You asked for it: http://youtu.be/dbHhVEiPiMU?t=6m   So much dumber: Cartoon characters literally inflating.          Seriously, anyone that upvoted this here: Why?    We're probably going to want to move somewhere farther away for if it finally happens.    Do the compounds break down? I assume it's not because something like bacteria builds up in the bottles or something.    No, that was just the cover story.    That bit I'm referring to is the bit at the gas station where Walt goes up to the car of that guy on the phone, puts the squeegee against his battery and blows up his engine.   I don't get why this is supposed to be cool. At best it seems petty, at worst it seems really stupid. The guy didn't do anything to deserve that and Walt served no purpose except venting his anger in a barely understandable direction with little fear of reprisal. It seemed to me like saying it would be badass if Walt kicked an annoying chihuahua or something. I just don't get it.      Eh, I didn't need BCS to be great. We've already gotten a great series from this environment, a good one in addition to it is fine with me.    I am Jack's nodding head.    Christ, I hope my fetish remains unattainable. It would be horrifying to see in real life. Luckily there's a lot of porn of it.    Well, the source was cited on the Derpibooru page.       Mine is kind of gross and obviously the sort of thing a teenager would come up with, but here it goes:  I had a scene where a sort of newly met couple were sleeping together. The girlfriend wakes up, can't get back to sleep, then realizes she's going to fart. So she gets up, goes to the bathroom, pulls her pants down and does it, and then wipes before going back to bed.   Now, I thought that this was a character thing that would reveal how fastidious and insecure she was in an interesting way, but it kind of came out of nowhere in regards to the rest of the story and struck my "beta readers" for it as so weird and stupid that they actually got mad at me about it.   Yours?    Bigfoot's probably juicing.       It's Spectre's sinister plan that's so secret Bond doesn't even know about it.    That's just stolen from Rebel Without a Cause.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftQLgODoLFE      I've contacted... six people on OKCupid in the past year or so. And now I'm going to the gym.   That's really not much.    I love a bunch of these, but it feels like a shame how quickly they'll become completely dated.    I like how only Pinkie and Rainbow Dash are at all into it.       It not only breaks the deal, it breaks me.       I had a thing in middle school where I absolutely shamelessly would stare holes in shirts until one day when a bunch of people at once called me on it. That might have made a little bit of an impression. But looking back on it, I totally deserved it.    "If you're staying at the pyramid hotel, gonna make you fuck sore!"    No, because no one's preventing me from interacting with them. I'm just insecure and they don't want my attention, I assume.          One day in September of 1983 we decided to go on a patrol camping trip so that wed get some prizes at the end of the year. Our scout troop owned a campsite up on top of a big, rocky hill. It was just our rotten luck that when we agreed to meet to start the campout, there had been a steady rain going on all day that didnt look like it was going to stop for hours. But our parents were all either going away for the weekend or thought rain was no reason to cancel a camping trip. Anyway, it was just barely going to be warm enough for this to be our last chance to have a patrol campout that year.  There were four of us trudging up one of the thin paths on the hill with our limited gear under dismal green ponchos: Me, Eric, Tony, and Sam in that order. We were miserable and irritable except for Tony.  We had reached a point where we enjoyed hurting Tony. Tony was one of those kids that get put into Boy Scouts of America only because they have a parent that wants free babysitting. I imagine most of the time his mom mostly talked to him by yelling at him, and the only way he knew to relate to the rest of us was to annoy us. He was also the youngest guy in my patrol and the shortest so it was fairly easy for us to bully him, especially when we thought he was doing his best to bring it on himself. I think Tony was delighted that the rest of the patrol was already on edge so it would be easier for him to get a rise out of us. At that moment he had decided to focus on Eric.  Eric was a real goody-goody most of the time. He was a pretty good athlete and an A student. Im pretty sure that at fifteen hed never had sex, a puff of anything, or any booze. But he loved beating on Tony as much as the rest of us did. That seemed to be his only vice, and frankly, it kept the guy from creeping me out by being too perfect. Hed certainly looked ready to give someone a beating when I glanced back at him during that little hike.  "Hey, Eric! Tony said. I glanced back over my shoulder. Tony had run up next to Eric like a puppy dog cause he knew otherwise Eric would ignore him. There was barely room on the path for him to do that if he turned himself sideways.  What? Eric said.  I can read your mind! Sometimes Tony would be weird or still like a little kid when he pestered us.  Okay. Eric said. I looked forward again.  Think of a number! I can guess it! Tony was pitching his voice up.  Okay. Eric said.  Its thirty! Tony told him.  No.  Youre just saying that. Really I was right. Wasnt I? Huh, wasnt I? From the sound of ponchos rustling, I assume that Tony began to push against Eric. He would do that for minutes on end if youd let him. Sometimes he might even start humping your leg if you were another scout.  Get away from me! Eric said. I didnt see it, but it was obvious even before I turned round what had happened. Eric thoughtlessly pushed Tony away, just wanting the little creep off him. As narrow and slippery as the trail was, he had pushed Tony off it. Tony screamed as he went down the very steep portion of hill, almost catching several trees before having his legs tripped out from under him by a stump. The stump was unfortunately only a little uphill from a large sandstone rock. Tony went into it headfirst with a sound of a loud crack! I stared at him for half a minute or so then, and he didnt so much as twitch from what I could see.  On my god. Sam said after a long silence, which seemed to snap the rest of us out of it.  Lets go help him.  Yeah. I said. Back then, this meant running down there to carry him to the nearest house out of the park since cell phones for kids were still decades off. I tried to start down the trail but Eric was still standing in the way. He turned to me.  Weve gotta tell people what happened right, Sam stopped and looked over at us. Eric looked down at him. We need to tell everyone that he slipped and fell, got it?  Weve got to help Tony! Sam shouted.  And we will! Eric said. But first, we need to be clear that were going to tell everyone that he fell, right? You got me, thats what we tell everyone?  I dont know, I said, I didnt see it happen. Eric looked and me, and nodded. That seemed good enough for him. Then he looked back at Sam.  You pushed him. We have to help him,  Sam said in bewilderment. Sam had never been the cleverest guy in the patrol, but I would have thought hed have the sense to play along under the circumstances.  We will! Eric responded. But first, I need you to say that youll tell everyone that he slipped and he fell! I nodded desperately at Sam, gesturing for him to tell Eric what he needed to hear so that we could get down there to try to help Tony.  No, Sam said. Eric stared at him.  Alright, Eric said. Lets go. We walked quickly, not about to run for fear of slipping and falling like Tony just had.  It wouldnt have done you much good anyway. Sam said after a little while, apparently trying to help Eric feel better. Tony still would have told everyone you tried to kill him no matter what.  Yeah, but thats Tony. Whod have cared if the rest of us had our story straight? Eric answered, his voice flat. He seemed to speed up from behind Sam.  Which way do you think would be the fastest to- HEY! Eric grabbed Sam. Sam yelled as Eric dragged him to the edge of the path.  Say it! Eric shrieked. Say that youll tell everyone that he slipped! Eric sounded more scared than he did intimidating as he held Sam at the edge of the path, seemingly ready to let him fall.  Fuck you! Sam yelled and he began to flail. He hurt Eric more than I would have expected, judging by how Eric grunted. Maybe it was pure adrenaline, but Sam got free somehow and began pushing him to the other side of the trail, right into a cliff.  Jesus Christ, stop fighting! I yelled at them. I might as well have been speaking Chinese. I took a few steps closer and saw there was murder in both their eyes, so I stepped back. Sam got his hand on Erics chin and pushed his head into the rocks behind him as hard as he could. Eric was really trembling then, like an old man with Parkinsons. It was as if he was experiencing a panic attack in the middle of a fight. Even so he wasnt going to just take Sams beating. He grabbed Sam again and kind of picked him up like Sam was a tackling dummy and then charged forward blindly, Sams poncho over his face. He misjudged the distance to the edge of the path and both Sam and he went rolling down the hill. They struck trees with sickening noises as they fell to a level area.  They were much more fortunate than Tony. I could see their movements and hear them screaming when they stopped falling down the hill. But neither of them even tried to get up.  I walked as quickly as I safely could down the trail and then looped back round to where Sam and Eric were. Both were yelling for my help at first, but as I proceeded down the trail, Eric abruptly went quiet.  My legs broken! Sam told me as soon as he saw me arrive where theyd fallen. The bones sticking out! It was true. His poncho had folded up and I saw the bulge in his lower left pant leg beneath the knee. Blood had soaked through his pants with the rainwater.  Hey, Eric said flatly. His lack of emotion made me look over at him as Sam screamed at both of us. I think I hurt my spine. I cant move my legs. I cant feel them. From what I could see of how his body was twisted, that might well have been possible. I didnt know then how Eric could be so emotionless about it, but in hindsight of course he was in shock if not in psychological denial.  Alright, guys, Ill go do what I can for Tony, and then Ill get help for everyone. I said. Sam screamed at me that that was the wrong thing to do, that I should leave the park to get help immediately. For all my first aid training, I didnt know if either of us were right. I thought maybe there was something I could do with the first aid kit for Tony, whose injury had seemed the most severe. Maybe Tony had vomited and I had to clear his breathing passage. I had to check on him. I tried to reassure them before leaving. Sam swore at my back as I ran over to Tony while Eric remained quiet.  I ran to where Id seen Tonys head hit the rock. I had walked by it on hikes and camping trips numerous times and knew the rocks and trees. Id seen the rock that Tony had hit his head on numerous times and knew when Id reached it. When I did, I froze for what felt like minutes.  Tony was gone.  There was no sign hed been there except for some blood had pooled by the rock where hed struck his head. It was still wet and red on the sandstone. I looked around and called for him. I ran a short distance each way around the rock. I didnt see a sign of him. Not a footprint in mud, a drop of blood. Anything. I something else as I searched. Sounds seemed to be fading away. I could hardly hear the rain around me. I couldnt even hear my footsteps in the shallow puddles on the ground. I couldnt even hear Sam although I had been seconds before. My own voice seemed muffled to my ears. I had been afraid before, but Id never known the sound to fade away like that.  I began to feel something. Not the feeling you get when youre being watched, but the one you get when someone you fear is standing right over you. I turned, and there was no one there, of course. The feeling didnt let up. It seemed to grow stronger and stronger. There was nothing to hear, not even my own breathing or the beat of my heart.  I ran back to where Id left the other two scouts, as fast as Ive ever run towards anything. Slowly I could hear again that Sam was still screaming in pain and cursing out Eric. Eric barely moved his head to look at me when I arrived. Sam went quiet after I told them of Tonys disappearance.  How? was all Sam could think to say. I felt that sensation again of a presence all around me again. It was faint but noticeable.  I dont know. Sam, how are your arms? Can I carry you out of here pack strap style? I had two years and eighteen inches of height on Sam, so I knew I could carry him out. Sam said I would. Whatever presence I was feeling, he seemed aware of it too through his pain and he didnt need to be sold on being taken out of the park, painful though it would surely be. I got out my first aid kit quickly, left my pack on the ground, and hastily made him a splint. He screamed as I lifted him up on my back.  Wait! What about me?! Eric asked, some emotion back in his voice. I glanced over at him. His eyes were wide, and his skin was becoming pale.  I can only carry one person. Well get you help as fast as we can.  But, what if whatever made Tony disappear Looking back on Eric, I find it hard to fault him now. He was just a kid. Hed made a mistake, meaning only a little if any harm. The a smaller amount of harm that wed all inflicted on Tony time and again. Then hed seen all his life, all his accomplishments, his future, all about to be tarnished because of what hed accidentally done to someone we all mostly thought of as dirt. He overreacted like probably many of us would back when we had little life experience and perspective of a guy in his lower teens. But at the time, I just glared at him for a second as he lay twisted and helpless on the ground, reaching up to me.  Maybe you deserve it, I told him. I turned my back on him and began carrying Sam out of the park.  Hey! Im sorry! I didnt mean to hurt Tony! I wasnt going to drop Sam! I was bluffing! Im sorry! Ill do anything you want if you get me out of here! Ill give you everything! Please! Dont leave me alone! What was that!? Theres, theres something out here! Come back! Please! I swear that Ill do anything! Please! Pleeeaase! Come back! His voice faded quickly, and the sound of rain and Sams pain resumed. As I walked, the feeling of that presence faded as well.  I had almost a mile to go in the rain before there would be a house with a phone, and Sam was moaning and wincing practically with every step. I made slow, frustrating progress for a few hundred yards before I slipped and landed heavily on my left knee. Sam screeched in my ear after his upper chest his my shoulder.  I think I broke a rib back there! You cant carry me like this! I didnt know how he could have broken a rib and only started to feel it now but I wasnt about to argue. As carefully as I could in my anxiety, I placed him on the ground in a sitting position and switched the carrying style to firefighter carrying style so that he was mostly over my shoulder.  Is that better? I asked him when Id hoisted him back up. He had winced again as I held him up.  It still hurts, but its better. We rounded a curve on the trail and were approaching a fairly gentle slope where the parking lot was situated. I thought of it then as the end of the park. Sam had begun to feel easier to carry, so I felt then Id be able to make it out of this forest.  I remember that since Id been in the park many times before, and even with another scout on my back being carried like this who was constantly voicing his pain, things were coming back to normal. Whatever feeling Id experienced over where I had thought Tony disappeared was going away. Things began to feel so normal that the idea Tony had just gotten up and walked away and emergency services would soon find him was believable. I guess what I felt then was that all I had to do was carry Sam and then it would be up to the adults to take care of all this.  Oh Jesus, Sam suddenly said quietly. Run. Run! Run! Fucking Run! Before I could ask or turn to see what I was to run from, he struck me as hard as he could on the side. He did this again and again, even after I started running. It was difficult to run even a few steps with such a heavy, awkward weight. It became easier when I noticed something that was already too familiar: Sams voice became quieter even as he thrashed and screeched more shrilly on my back. He might have said what it was or described anything about it, but within seconds he was as muted as my silent steps in the puddles on the pathway.  I reached the bottom of the incline. Sam was convulsing then, which I felt was a sign that whatever I was trying to flee was getting closer. He was still hitting me in the side, but it was weaker and more erratically.  The path up the hill was full of loose rocks and gravel. In weather like this it was impossible to keep a solid foothold, but by some miracle I was able to run up it and maintain a hold on him even as he practically seemed to be trying to break free and I was trembling. I remember thinking that I faintly heard something then, something like a splash. That had to be a good sign.  Halfway up the hill I felt a horrible sensation in my feet. They were going numb. I remember not understanding why, and even with all the momentum I had built up, my feet landed awkwardly, like Id slipped on ice but still landed on my feet. I barely had time to feel pain in my ankles because they went numb as well. I was barely able to stumble forward before the numbness climbed up to my knees. My legs were useless then. I fell forward practically face first.  Sam got free even with his fractures, flipped over, and crawled up the hill. I tried myself. I could feel the numbness had reached my ribcage by then, but dragged myself across the rocks. I remember perfectly the sight of Sam dragging himself too while twitching and trembling as he crawled.  A force hit the back of my head that felt like a construction beam dropped from a crane. My face went into the ground, rocks stabbing into my cheeks hard enough to break the skin and I seemed to lose all fight and flight instinct. I just lay there like a breathing corpse. Even if I hadnt been numb I didnt have any energy, any hope, any understanding of what was happening to me. I didnt even have the courage to lift my hood up and see what was happening around me.  I dont know how long I lay there. The numbness left me, but I still didnt lift my hood. So little light was coming in under my hood that night might have fallen and I wouldnt have been able to tell. A long time later, the rain stopped. A longer time after that, I began to hear again. I heard birds tweeting, cars driving by from what sounded like miles away. I didnt move.  After a long time of only hearing the sounds of nature, I heard footsteps approaching me. They stopped suddenly, and then clearly changed to those of someone running up to me.  Are you alright? An old man whose name I dont remember said as he leaned over and pulled my hood back. I looked up at him, rocks still stabbed into my face. He winced as he saw it. Christ, kid. What happened to you?  I dont know, I said.  I still dont know. I dont want to. I know that Eric, Tony, and Sam were never found, nor was any trace of anything that might have made them disappear. I learned even that reluctantly. Look for answers? Hell, I dont even go near forests any longer. Staying away from forests isnt enough. I have developed a need for sound. Always. After a minute without the hearing something, I feel anxious. Sleeping without it is impossible. If whatever got my fellow scouts comes for me, I want as much warning as I can get.  That brings me to the reason Im sharing this: Lately, even with music at full volume and me screaming my lungs out, Ive been experiencing minutes of silence. At home, at work, out driving, when Ive gone on visits, Ive been experiencing it.  Its been many years since the the end of my last camping trip, but it seems like Im about to feel that presence again. When it wants, I believe it will make me experience a silence that will never end.  [Dramatic reading for the visually impared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zc94R7wgDM)   I remember the one for Scott Pilgrim being pretty dull.    We need to wear scarlet letters.    So last night I went to it for the first time in like six months. There were some extremely attractive women there and it's not a big place but since they looked about 19 and I'm 28 (and out of shape) I knew they'd really rather not be leered at by me, and "leering" when you're the creepy old guy means "looking at at all." So for an hour and a half I had to look away from these people in a fairly enclosed space.   I don't mean to whine "boo hoo, I didn't objectify/gawk at a bunch of strangers!" or that I deserve "nice guy" points. It just becomes really awkward when you get conscious of how there are some people you really want to look at people but know the decent thing would be to not.   I should go later when the place is cleared out.    Thoughtcatalog: The site that's maybe 1% better than Buzzfeed, tops.    Oh, it's just a rock farm? I somehow got the impression there was a joke that it was an organic rock farm.    Of course I'm biased, but I honestly think I would have preferred all the final designs to most of Faust's original ones, even if I'd been introduced to hers first.       Since jewelry=being able to become invisible or invincible, that sounds about right.   Besides, Game of Thrones is about fighting for headpieces and furniture.    I think it was funnier when for Hot Fuzz he imitated Michael Caine. It was a bit more natural.    Crap, I got a lunch-being-by-ants cutie mark.    Well, thank you, but it seems odd to have someone believe in me when I'm just going to a safe place to do repetitive tasks and then sitting in a hot tub.    I recently learned of the graphically updated Resident Evil game. I know that since then zombies and stuff have become a bit passe and its odd, static third person camera angles clash a bit with modern standards, but to me it still worked really well. Plus I'm sure many of you know about this but I thought the little tweaks to change player expectations on when and how certain actions would happen worked.  So what other games is this being done with? Is Alone in the Dark   supposed to be rumored to be getting anything like this or that sort of thing?    Constantly. I have a very small scar on my wrist from when I started cutting myself once. I was cutting "morgue" style too.       Yeah, I'm literally going to go get a gym membership in about half an hour. It's going to feel terrible and great at the same time.    I am so fucking sold on this.    Well, cold anyway.    I've heard some pretty horrible domestic abuse. Consensual sex noises  are sweet music compared to that.           It means "very softcore porn." Like women in their underwear, bikinis, etc.    That's it alright. Thank you.    Sounds to me like more trouble than it's worth.   And here comes hundreds of thousands of cookies and other treats easily eatable by chopsticks to ruin Mattingly's diet.       Using the alias Frank Oz.    Done and done.    I'm pretty sure the q-tips up his nose book was The Tommyknockers.    It's a very unfunny movie in my opinion.   It's just Night of the Living Dead with the audio swapped out with people talking about shitting, how they're gay, how Ben talks like a stereotypical black man, etc. Even if that's your poison, there's lots of short anti-comedy clips put in and it certainly stops being funny well before the movie ends.    Wisconsin, moving to Texas soon. I believe neither of those is marijuana friendly.    I was watching some documentary about Incels awhile ago (I have completely forgotten the title and it's too late to look it up now) and at one point someone says Incels have never seen a vagina so they only look at cheesecake porn. Then there's a montage of incel guys being disgusted by porn.   They're just hamming it up, right? Even as a preteen, I saw a vagina in a magazine once and I found it mildly unpleasant but I certainly didn't retch and turn away the way a bunch of the guys in the movie did.    And then someone dialed the number while getting out their gun.   I have never smoked or been in close proximity to someone who was smoking marijuana that I'm aware of. I have heard numerous times that certain movies are better on weed. I've heard this said about all sorts of comedies, nature documentaries, art films, etc. How does it improve the experience?   I frankly don't know how to acquire weed and even if I did I'd be too nervous to get it, so it's not really on the table for me to find out first hand.      Is that a common thing that gets heavily moderated? Are there 4chan raids? I know I've seen a handful of people daring people to convince them not to kill themselves, but I don't recall off the top of my head anyone being told to do that.    I never enjoyed parties in the slightest. I ranted before about how drinking and being drunk did fuck all to help me feel better and other than that it was just people standing or sitting around chatting. If there was live entertainment than it was people standing or sitting around yelling. I don't think they begin to live up to the hype.    Okay, fine, I don't like those movies.   Leave the money on my nightstand.    Because they know you're likely to not feel secure enough to treat them badly back?                   Was this under "Medical?"   Back when he was just starting to look creepy.    I haven't since I no longer had any overdue payments.       So did RedLetterMedia shit this meme into the world or were they just riding a bandwagon?          I know a couple guys who'd I'd collaborated on a few projects with online  and they just had children. I know they should be the ones worrying about me as the alone fetishist aged virgin, but I know at least one of them is struggling with his choice profession and Jesus are kids ever  expensive, time-consuming, and very often a hardship that could very easily lead to a tragic end.   Of course part of this worrying might be a contributor to my FA status.    You have no fucking rights. We made em up. Like the Boogey Man.  -Carlin   Going around accidentally dropping furniture on dragons.    These terrible franchises are crossbreeding? Okay.    What are there for nominees?    You're pissed that even with all your alt accounts being used to upvote it this thread isn't doing too well on /r/movies, aren't you?    These cartoons always seemed to me like a weird combination of trying too hard and being half-assed.   "Watch out, Twily! She's Irish!"    All these moments will be lost in time. Like sisters in the rain.       I have really tried. I've had beer, wine, liquor, schnapps, even moonshine and it all tasted fucking horrible. Just painful to drink. And I didn't experience any euphoria, I just felt queasy and had a headache when I forced down enough that I should have been drunk. I sure as fuck didn't feel any more confident or like I could pick up a prostitute on the stuff let alone like someone with the least bit of game.   Maybe it's psychological since I had a violent drunk dad, but whatever. It has nothing to do with thinking I'm a "special snowflake" as I'm sure someone would have accused me of for hating alcohol.   I'm also not offering this up as an excuse for why I'm an aged virgin, but I'm sure also it doesn't help.    I'm renewing my gym membership on Monday because they're running a special! It's happening, it's happening!   My mother doesn't seem to mind. Ever since dad died a year and a half ago and I moved in with her, she's made no attempt to date or anything, so my being around prevents her from being pretty much FA too.    Maybe I should hire a prostitute there just to say I did it, but I'm sure if anyone knew they'd tell me that doesn't count.    I only read the comic instead of watching the movie so someone please tell me: Is he invincible and perfect in the movie too? Because that eventually made the book feel lazy, boring, and pretentious to me.       Bit of a downer though, and who needs those on this subreddit?    Because Cracked doesn't care about reader feedback as long as they gets clicks.   The fact seemingly anyone could write the ATB articles which get views because they rely solely on mentioning celebrities seems to be irrelevant.    Do you do coloring, texture work, tweening, or what?   Also, are those separate departments?    Please tell me to get over my phobias so that I can get over all my phobias.    The year of this story? 2016!!!!!!!!!!   Blue Ruin. I know a lot of people find it boring, but there was something about what an awkward revenge movie it was that was captivating.       "Can you expand on this"  Nice subtle pun.   Anyway, for me, it's cartoons being literally hooked up to pumps, air tanks, whatever, and floating or bouncing around. As ridiculous as it might sound, characters being drawn becoming fat does nothing for me.   Obviously this is impossible in the real world and when people photoshop it happening to real humans, I personally find it unpleasant but I don't really begrudge them for it.         4.

 Judges generally don't earn that much. And the $2.2m was undoubtedly spread among many judges. I think it's a combination of fear, greed and disbelief that they would ever be caught. If you receive a cash payment and there is no paper trail, only a verbal agreement, it's easy to imagine that there is very little risk of associated with the bribe. And to be fair, this probably happens all the time, all over the world, especially among elected and lower court judged who couldn't necessarily jump to private practice and expect to paid a king's ransom.   Chapman was frequently late for rehearsing or recording, leading to the other Pythons calling him "the late Graham Chapman".                                                                               Pretty sure Reynolds personally endorsed that image when he found it.   It's official. Donald Trump for President is a PR move. He's such a wingnut that the GOP marketing probably thought he'd make the other Republican candidates seem moderate. It's funny how they underestimate Americans' ability to detect bullshit in the digital age.   The 47-year-old left with 15 gigabytes worth of data and information regarding human experimentation, which he felt may have crossed ethical boundaries Yeah, I'm pretty sure they crossed a few boundaries.      Peer-reviewed paper published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B.    Yeah, it always amazes me how so many people who fall over themselves to criticize people like Thomas Jefferson, Mother Theresa, Henry Ford and so on for their faults often seem to regard Steve Jobs as a saint. He was one of the highest profile dicks of the 20th century. He just happened to make good phones. At least, if you like screens the size of postage stamps.                                                            	52
 AFTER FURTHER REVIEW OF GORDON'S WIN LAST WEEK NASCAR HAS MANDATED THAT HE GIVE HIS PIT CREW OVER TO THE 48 TEAM TO FINISH THE YEAR.      Hot dog on bread with peanut butter!  Learned it from my dad when I was younger.      No worries.  I know you're just doing what you can on here.   Does anyone else read insanity wolf memes in a deep, loud yelling voice?   Looks like Team Hendrick has some competition in the give away department.   Doc Brown's facial expresion fits perfectly for this!   There one guy that jogs on the same trail as me some times and gives high fives all the time.  Always helps out the run for some reason.   HE'S GOT NOTHING ON [VICKERS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuegYl4DhRg)   DANICA HAS A WAYS TO GO TO GET UP TO 143 RACES WITHOUT A WIN.  BUT JR SHOWED US IT'S POSSIBLE.   THAT'S A LOT OF ROOM TO CHEAT!   I was there for the spring race and parked directly north of the track on the north side of Clover road and it was free.  Drive time in was about 45 minutes for the last 2 miles coming from the north.  As for leaving we tailgated a bit and left about 2 hours after the race and there was pretty much no traffic.   I BET TONY STEWART USES THE SAME BROKEN LEG EXCUSE AGAIN THIS WEEK TO GET OUT OF RACING.  WE ALL KNOW IT'S A COVER UP FOR HIS LACK OF RACING TALENT.   CHEATER KNAUS WILL HAVE SOMETHING NEW UP HIS SLEEVE!   Well, at least she's *happy* doing what she does now.   You're welcome!  And thanks for all you do on this site!      Never owned a Naomad myself, but I did get to try one when I used to work at a game store and someone traded one in.  Definitely enjoyed messing around with it.   It's still surprising that neither of these systems took off better than they did.  I thought they were both better than the Nintendo handhelds that were out during their respective times.   Can't say I have a bet where we pay up each week like yours, but that would be fun.  But I have probably 8 different NASCAR bets with friends that run throughout the course of the year.  Overall it's looking like I should get around $120 and about 2 cases of beer from the winnings.   As tsr6 stated, the money now goes to the NASCAR foundation.  Before 2008 the money was redistributed amongst the teams with the season end winnings.  I'm not sure how they decided on redistribution amounts, but I know each team didn't just receive what they paid in during the season.  Otherwise there is no reason to charge them to begin with.   I would agree if it's something like a fight that earned the fine, then the individual would most likely have to pay it on their own.   I agree that there definitely isn't a catch all answer for something like this.  But thought depending on what the situation was for the fine maybe there is a precedant that teams usually use for if they would compensate the driver'crew chief back.  Of course, as you mentioned, there are different variables that could play into this too.   I second the weekly give away!  Considering I forgot about my cake day over the weekend :(   I understand that when a team is caught cheating that either the driver or crew chief are usually fined and responsible for paying the fine themselves.  But do the team owners end up essentially "reimbursing" them for the fines after it's paid?   If at a social event when you finish your beer/beverage just say you have to go get another one.  Usually works pretty good.   So during the race today my brother thought of something in regards to NASCAR's new rule that drivers give 100% effort all the time.  With the restrictor plate race some drivers say that their plan is to stay in the back until the end of the race.  By doing this aren't they actually giving less than 100% effort to try to win the race?  So shouldn't that driver get a penalty for doing this?  Just curious what your thoughts are about this.   So should the site now be called Goldit?   On tv you don't really see how much they hit off of each other while driving that fast.  You can definitely see it in this video before the wreck.   For example, if there's a street with a speed limit of 35 mph, but normal traffic flow is 40+ mph, does it catch your eye when someone is actually driving the speed limit?  And to add to this, would the time of day make a difference, such as mid afternoon compared to 1 am?   I'd definitely give one a try.  Just like the funnel baconator at Charlotte Motor Speedway.  That thing was amazing!   I agree.  In past seasons when he did hang out in the back it seemed like it almost never worked out for Jimmie.  This year he's actually been running in the front of the pack and it shows with the results since you're less likely to be caught up in a big one if you're in the front.      I think Allmendinger is scheduled for one of the remaining races with JTG, but the rest should have Labonte.   I'm at work right now too....in Columbus, Ohio.   If only they still made multiplayer games with split screen.   He HAD backward legs?  So they're corrected now?   Hi Chad, you're doing a great job with the team!  I'm looking forward to you winning that 6th championship this year!  In regards to the 48 team haters referring to you as a cheater.  Do you despise them calling you that, or does it make you stronger inside and want to win more just to show them who's boss?   Yeah, I'd imagine that would be a bitch to try and crack the cubes once frozen.  When I was growing up we had the single ones, and I recall having to run some water across it sometimes to loosen it up in order to open.   So you want one of [these](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en site=imghp tbm=isch source=hp biw=1440 bih=738 q=old+metal+ice+cube+trays oq=old+metal+ice+cub gs_l=img.3.0.0.1981.4976.0.6126.17.10.0.7.7.0.117.936.3j6.9.0....0...1ac.1.27.img..1.16.991.HsBHFRghg4U) old school ice cube trays?   How about tacos....that shit ice cream?   Was this town festival in northwest ohio by any chance?   I'm a JJ fan and I have a brother who's a Hamlin fan and another who cheers for both Biffle and Keselowski.  So needless to say, there's plenty fo smack talk between us.  Especially when we go to a race together.   I was a Rusty Wallace fan previously, but became a Jimmie fan back in 2003.  Basically I knew Rusty wouldn't be racing too much longer and Jimmie just caught my eye.  So I had 2 drivers for a while there.  As for giving up on Hamlin, I don't see why someone that's actually a fan of his would give up so easily.  He'll be back and contending for the Chase/Championship next year.   I was expecting to at least see the Big Lebowski on the list.   I don't like the elimination idea because if someone has problems out of their control, like and engine failure, in the first race they are screwed from the beginning.  They can go on to win 6 of the remaining Chase races and it won't matter because they were already elimited from something out of their control.  Besides, with the points structure there's already an elimination factor with the Chase.  It just takes several races to get into it.   So how many coats of paint are on the side of that building by now?      Articles I've read estimate this year's attendance at just 75,000 though.  That's fairly low for almost any track on the circuit.   Yeah, that could make sense.  They definitely don't go into much detail about how it got there.  But throughout the movie you realize that Tim Robbins has a good amount of connections he uses for help.   So I just watched Arlington Road for the first time last night.  Overall I enjoyed the movie and think I understand pretty much everything that happened.  I just have 1 question though.  At the end of the movie, how does the bomb get into the trunk of Jeff Bridges rental car?  Did Tim Robbins know which car he was going to get and had it planted in the trunk beforehand?  Because I believe the only scene where Jeff Bridges isn't in the car is when he's fighting Tim Robbins in the warehouse building.  But I doubt that would have been when they planted it in the car.   The standard small talk question "How's it going?"  You really can't say anything aside from "good" unless you want to have a conversation about something being wrong.  Even if there is nothing wrong at the moment.   but I can recite the landline numbers of my best childhood friends *parents*   Regarding the cooler, do a google search for pocono raceway cooler sizes to get the exact measurements.  Most tracks are around 14 inch cube or so, and a lot only allow soft sided coolers.  A few still allow hard sided ones though.  Along with carrying in a cooler, most allow a clear plastic bag to bring other items in with you.   Yup.  On Jayski they posted that only 7 races will be on NBC and the other 13 will be on NBCSN.      Labamba's is where it's at for a good burrito!   Don't forget to hold the Y button the whole time too while going through the level.  We all know it helps too.   While I see your point, there's also a reson for buying a vowel in the case of the word "the".  If there are a lot of other letters missing on the board and you're not really sure of what to guess, then buying an "E" is a way to keep your turn along with seeing if there are other "E's" on the board to help on your next spin.   Wow, thanks!  That will definitely make it easier to navigate through and compile!   Yeah, that's pretty much the information I was looking for.  Probably be pretty tough to find a site that has penalties bad further than 2001.  Thanks for the help though!   I am essentially looking for a website that tracks the penalties that different drivers/teams receive over their career.  More along the lines of points penalites handed out for inspection failure, and not in race penalties where they might have to do a drive through pit lane.  If it does happen to have both stats, then that's even better.  Searching online so far hasn't been much help.   Yup, here's the [article](http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2013/06/28/james-finch-to-sell-sprint-cup-nationwide-team.html) I'm talking about it.  So we'll find out who the buyer is in a few weeks.   That's true, but isn't there someone buying the team from James Finch?  So it may just be switching hands essentially.   And I thought I was bad for taking the codes out of used games at a store.  But I never take from the new games.  That'd just be wrong.   You have 6th graders who have students of their own?  	67

 I just hope for this blasphemy all his apps will be downgraded to Froyo !       This is "normal", and that is also a reason why I own a Samsung Gear Live - because it uses USB which is way faster.  I would suggest: get USB Android Wear watch, or use emulator for most of test and only for finish touches push to moto 360.      Exactly as Jush said. Greenrobot's works but then you will have two not connected ones, one on Wear and second one on mobile - no way to send events between. With that modification your events are propagated as well on other devices - so you have methods post(), postRemote(), postLocal().      Units.      Just yesterday - a small app to rate drivers base on their license plate. It uses existing portal for data. Sorry it is in Polish because it is used only locally.  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=pl.tajchert.tablicarejestracyjna  https://github.com/tajchert/RegistrationPlate   Why don't you connect PayPal with your existing bank card (debit or credit one)?

Samsung - it is (unfortunately) biggest Android manufacture and if something will broke... it will be on Samsung (many bloatware apps, tweaks of original Android etc.).   Yeah, shop looks decent, if you are not sure what kind of stuff they are going to buy just make sure to order a "KARTA MAXI" card as using that they can choose from any store listed on their site. So they can use it in bookstore or any other kind of store.  I don't know where do you live but 200PLN is a decent amount for present and for sure they will be happy with it. Just to put amount of money in perspective in McDonald's cheeseburger is 5PLN if I'm correct, average lunch in Warsaw (capital, so it can be lower in other cities) is ~20-25PLN. However electronics etc. are in the same prices as in any Western Europe country (just add 15-20% to USA prices as we got way bigger tax).   Yes, we can order from Amazon.co.uk but for some products there is no shipping to Poland. However most products are ok.  Also you can search for "karty podarunkowe" which is "gift cards" and look for some other store as well - depending on interests. I would suggest looking for merlin.pl (mainly bookstore), empik.com (similar, probably bigger=more items), or agito.pl (as Amazon, however everything is sold by one company).  And keep in mind that if you buy for example Google Play card (awesome because we got access to movies and ebooks lately) they are sold for particular country so you have to look for "polish" one.      Moto E (confirmed, but arrival date is yet not known).   I already commented that post, and pasted link to this reddit so author can respond by himself but he doesn't look interested in. If anything I can translate (but I don't think it would be necessary).   Translation: "*The result exceeded expectations, and it is better on Kitkat than on the Lollipop"*.   So friend of mine re-shared post of somebody who succeed at replacing default battery in Nexus 5 for LG G2 one - 700mAh (30%) more. https://plus.google.com/u/0/102008505105093990793/posts/cdMJc6R8UST  From his post - he needed to cut one border that holds battery to fit it, and no more Qi charging.

Ne znam sada kako je po zakonu   Pa valjda neces izdati stan bez ugovora :) Da li je to uopste legalno onda? Kolik je porez ako znas?   Ovde u nemackoj ako izdajem stan, se razlikuje u "toplo" ili "hladno"...  ako recimo izdajem stan za 900 mesecno "toplo" u toj ceni se i nalazi grejanje i voda... znaci ja kao gazda koji izdaje stan od tih 900 moram to da platim... recimo 80 + moram da platim "wohngeld" ( to je za smece, za renoviranje zgrade itd.) sta je oko 280 od prilike. Znaci od 900 kirije se odbija 280+80 ostade mi na ruku 540... A na to jos dodje porez i ako se nesto pokvari u stanu ja moram da platim... A ako dobijem samo 140-180 u Srbiji kiriju, koliko mi zaista ostaje na ruke?   Kako moze NBAgifs da propada? To ti je kao nsfwgifs, nema sanse da propada... Ocigledno si nesposoban za mod   Novi Sad je odlican... Ako neko moze da mi kaze koliko bi kirija bila za stan blizu bulevara? Oko 50m2... I koliko od toga bi meni ostalo kad bih izdao   Pa cak i ja imam 500+ karma... Imam subreddit... Ocigledno hoces da se ja prijavim. Koji ti je mracni plan?

 Please explain. What did he imply? That the illegals are mostly bad people? I think your right. He said the wrong thing, but people are taking this far. It's Donald Trump and he said something stupid. I don't think he hates Mexicans though. Just possibly overreacting and exaggerating about the border problems.  	1
 Fuck it   That sucks, but its also brilliant you learned that on the last day. Thats what high schools for right? Not just learning about history, maths ect but learning about yourself and who you want to be. Your lucky your teacher understood how teens express themselves, or rather don't, and you got to take what you learned about yourself that day into the adult world.    http://loish.deviantart.com/   Just google searched NK subs and it all makes sense now!  	4
  I'm afraid I'll turn into a hambeast.  Also my biggest fear.  But no one is telling you to eat 3,000 calories for the rest of your life. No one is telling you your calories have to come from unhealthy foods. You can own your recovery, get to a healthy weight, and restore your metabolism the best on 2,500+.  I believe you'd still gain on 2,000, but I think PinkPanther4 (if you're reading this nice job on recovery!) had some trouble gaining on around that once her metabolism started speeding up.  	1
 Nothing new for a President to do. Your hyperbole is just that.   Sorry for the delay, but here's a good place to start:  http://www.law.asu.edu/library/RossBlakleyLawLibrary/ResearchNow/ResearchGuides/TreatiesandInternationalAgreements.aspx   No, stop with _your_ nonsense. Executive Agreements have the force of law, and are treaties on the international level.  Treaties ratified pursuant to the Treaty Clause are not the only legal treaties in the U.S.  Edit: [Source](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t source=web rct=j ei=IlMCVbWoBc32gwTy6IPwBw url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL32528.pdf ved=0CDAQFjAG usg=AFQjCNE_0ryx2ClehZ7q_isyd4Gx6BWBxA sig2=sgtAFQ3TkUwDbnEX478lCw) [PDF download]   Hey! I was there, too! We're "almost died" brothers...  Bullets hit about 10 feet from my head.   That was a memory slap.   I have a Rome trip planned for Dec. 2018. Way too soon to hope for a cheaper vacation, isn't it?      Holy crap, beer?!   And thus begins the legal cascade that can royally fuck someone's life if they don't comply perfectly. All because of a bullshit charge.   Only treaties made pursuant to the Treaty Clause. Senators alone have no say in executive agreements.   The top moves to the side at the end. Pulling out?   Start with Edgar's Grille. It is a restaurant owned by Goodwill. They are LGBT friendly (have hosted a few events for Augusta Pride).  If they have nothing, I think they will be able to help. It's somewhat of a unique business since it is owned by Goodwill.   I'll make your list when you got to law school.  The President is the executive pursuant to the Constitution, and therefore has authority over foreign policy. Exceptions to this such as Senatorial consent are just that: exceptions.  Asserting that the President is a figurehead in foreign policy is the height of constitutional ignorance.   It is debatable actually. The Treaty Clause is not the _exclusive_ means by which the U.S. can enter into treaties.   The President is a figurehead when it comes to foreign policy? Are you joking?   Understanding the Constitution requires more than merely reading it. There are centuries of practice and case law.  For example, there are 3 types of treaties, not just 1.  The President can enter into an executive agreement and on the international stage, it is just as much a treaty as one ratified by 2/3s of the Senate.  Also, it's undeniable that the President is in charge of negotiating foreign policy. I agree what they did wasn't treason, but it was highly inappropriate and they should be publicly shamed. Senators get to weigh in on foreign affairs in various ways. This is not one of them.   Free speech (as commonly understood in the U.S.) is a concept between a citizen and a government. If there is no government involvement, there is no violation of free speech.    just read the comments made by the attorneys involved and it sounds like they are genuinely afraid of science or intelligence  The attorney isn't scientifically ignorant. He is just attacking the prosecution's case in whatever ways he can.   A video of this using a nuclear bomb _would_ be pretty fucking cool.   Surely everyone has seen a picture of the ocean though. And according to O'Reilly's Law, that is equivalent.   Haha, no. I would never email a racist joke at work. Quit trying to act like that is normal behavior.  And I think the statement is pretty clear. He emailed a racist joke at work.  Does that make him a racist? Not necessarily - the other option I gave is that he's a moron. But I would tend to think the former over the latter.   Um, the Moto 360 has been out for almost a year. No one knows mine is a smartwatch.   Sharing a racist joke via email to your work colleagues is not the same thing as finding an offensive joke funny.  If you do such a thing, you're either (a) a fucking moron or (b) a pretty hardcore racist.   Is this even possible?   Well... in 2,000 years their names will be just as historic.   This particular one is a case of top-down marching orders. It was surreal to see...  There had been no opinion on the issue _at all_ and then all the sudden: OBAMACARE FOR THE INTERNET.  The editorial staff doesn't understand the issue but willingly regurgitates the anti-net neutrality talking points.   One of these is my local paper, and the editorial staff is _insanely_ right wing (as is the cartoonist).  I have little doubt these are political.   Can you articulate specifics? As it stands, your comment is too vague to be anything but meaningless.   Source? No other gay group did any work to repeal DADT?   We are too rare to be so god damn stupid.   Misleading title.  The legislation passed the _Senate_, meaning it still must pass the House and be signed by the Governor.  If you don't want it to be legal to discriminate in GA, call your GA House Representative ASAP. The companion bill is still in committee.  They don't hear from many people so your opinion _will_ have a meaningful impact.   Then let your GA House Representative know that the legislation shouldn't move forward. It's in committee and can most easily be stopped there.  Don't let these folks do actual damage to people for naked political gain.   Article about the former Attorney General in the NYTimes:  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/us/gay-rights-groups-find-unlikely-ally-in-georgia-fight.html?_r=0   According to the former Attorney General, yes (op-ed in today's AJC).    Sen. McKoon from Columbus is the primary supporter. He may have something out there.   This isn't /r/news. But there's a legal memo by the former GA Attorney General if you'd like to read it. The memo explains how the bill will cause problems.  His name is Michael Bowers. I can find it for you but it's easily found online.  Edit: Here it is: http://documents.buzzfeed.com/BowersMemo.pdf  Edit2: NYTimes article about Michael Bowers: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/05/us/gay-rights-groups-find-unlikely-ally-in-georgia-fight.html?_r=0   Short version: if the government tries to prevent discrimination, religion can be used as a defense.  As long as the religious belief is sincerely held, it can be used to circumvent civil rights protections (such as serving gays).  Edit: Here's a memo from a former GA Attorney General explaining why the bill is a bad idea: http://documents.buzzfeed.com/BowersMemo.pdf   I am having a hard time accepting the claim that the flurry of new "religious freedom" bills has nothing to do with the pending gay marriage ruling.   Practical limitations aside, is this actually theoretically possible?         It passed.   Terraserver?   Or at least a percentage. Then schools might start doing what all other lenders do: evaluate risk.   Possibly, but an across-the-board time limit may be sufficient.   Nope. The nondischargeability transfers in such situations.   We could put a time element into the discharge for student loans.  10 years from the date of disbursement sounds reasonable to me.   fine  Tax and spend   The chosen one.   Only if it's patentable (or in some other way prevents copy cats).   I was in El Salvador and I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head.  Can you explain to me why this sentence has only one reasonable interpretation (and that interpretation is not "I saw nuns get shot in the back of the head")?   That guy that jumps the fence I think just pulled a James Bond end-of-chase scene move.   Georgie isn't wrong. A lie is an intentional misrepresentation.   Ultradox   Is "Should I get circumsized?" a common issue for guys who aren't at birth?  Genuinely curious. U.S. male here.  Edit: z or c? c looks weird but Google says c.   Clark and Washington?  A few grand for custom "BestCase" is an incredible deal. Do they have any plans to license it?   Who would do it, though?  Good government policy assumes each power will pull to its greatest extent. And that doesn't necessarily mean any particular branch is wrong.  Our executive is too weak. Having a mayor who will fight for a stronger balance of power is a good thing in my opinion.      Source?   I'm not saying "war zone" can't be used figuratively. I'm saying that Bill O'Reilly doesn't seem to have used it figuratively when talking about his past reporting.  And when there is an actual war going on (unlike in Ferguson), it's much more important to be clear about what you mean by "war zone".    Bill claimed to be filming in a war zone, but he wasn't stating that it was a literal war zone.  This seems very generous to Bill O'Reilly. He repeatedly used his experience in a "war zone" to bolster his credibility on war reporting.  Every quote I've read has no hint of anything other than a literal interpretation of "war zone".  Edit: This is a good example of what I'm talking about (from the [_Mother Jones_ article](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/02/bill-oreilly-brian-williams-falklands-war)):  In a 2004 column about US soldiers fighting in Iraq, O'Reilly noted, "Having survived a combat situation in Argentina during the Falklands war, I know that life-and-death decisions are made in a flash."      Now I need to know what would happen if the Death Star fired upon a star...   Option 4 doesn't require any interaction with the grandparents though. I see the merits of Option 1 but I would personally choose Option 4: prove them wrong and racist, and still cut them out. If my spouse has a problem with that, our relationship might not work.  And I don't see what makes cutting contact but keeping the spouse easier with Option 1.   It's not the same argument because families aren't for-profit businesses.   I support this. Our mayor is too weak - the office may as well not even exist (and governing purely by committee is not efficient).   Why is Option 1 better than Option 4?   Because "Apple".    10-20 years minimum  Probably more like 5-10 years minimum. Technology does not advance linearly (but that is how we tend to view it).   I'm having flashbacks to last year...   Icestorm =/= snowstorm   custom software  Designed specifically for your firm?   I think he's talking about whether the U.S. has an "Ironman" suit.   I have no background in graphic design. I like the blue one.   Legally, Georgia had some bad precedent on the federal level that delayed the filing of a lawsuit.   I really don't see the stretch marks. I think I can see them... but can't be sure.   The secretary's response was that I'll need to talk to Principal myself to tell him i'm unavailable.  My response would be: "That's unnecessary and really a waste of his and my time. Please let him know that I'm unavailable to help with the cake. Thanks!"   I'm not discussing whether the classes struggle against each other. My interest is in /u/Vayate's claim that because you don't believe in something (e.g., class warfare), you therefore don't engage in it.     47% (at the time, might be more or less now) of the US population pays nothing in federal income tax.  Romney's problem with that comment was going from "doesn't pay federal income taxes" to "dependent upon government, ... believe[s] that they are victims, ... believe[s] the government has a responsibility to care for them, ... believe[s] that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing", and then after all that claiming that "[he'll] never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives."  Telling anyone who received a federal tax refund that they do not take personal responsibility and care for their lives is an extremely idiotic thing to do.    Republicans don't believe there is conflict between the classes.  Ok. But not believing in something doesn't mean it doesn't exist. It's not enough to say that Republicans don't engage in class warfare because they don't believe it exists.    Republicans generally don't engage in class warfare because they reject the Marxist notion that class struggle is central to politics and history.  Are you saying they don't engage in class warfare or don't knowingly engage in class warfare?   God he's hot...   While acknowledging the harm this is causing same-sex couples in Alabama, I admit to anxiously watching how far this will go.  I don't want this to happen, but if state officials won't back down, I'll enjoy seeing the fallout.   ...   And by 2016, a large segment of the U.S. will believe that the fees and taxes that have always been there are new and Obama's fault (just like rising healthcare premiums).   A local state representative penned a letter to the editor a few weeks ago claiming that advocating for a proposed "religious exemption" bill is a continuation of Dr. King's fight.  It's absurd what they are trying to do.   The red mist would descend.  Is this a euphemism for violent rage?   For the "first shot", could the torpedoes be loaded in water that reduces wear and tear (e.g., fresh water)?   Neither question is relevant to your original assertion. Did the President enact the ACA by himself, yes or no?   Pointing out that the ACA was enacted pursuant to the Constitution (approval by both houses and the President) *is* a convincing counter-argument to "Obama is a tyrant because of Obamacare".  If your definition of "tyrant" includes the process by which the ACA was enacted, does that make the U.S. Constitution tyrannical?   Obama didn't create the ACA by himself. It was enacted into law pursuant to the Constitution.   There is a huge (and significant) difference, but there is also at least one similarity: helping others.  Unless he would send every dollar the government taxes him to help others to charity, his position is weak.    I would like to live in a place that has some personality and is not completely indistinguishable from every other suburban cookie cutter neighborhood in the country.  I don't disagree with this but it's a package deal most of the time. We've all seen the pictures of the Great Pyramids from Pizza Hut, and there is a McDonalds seemingly every few miles in Paris.  Simply put, where there is economic activity, chains are going to exist. A restaurant like Chipotle isn't necessarily a good thing to me personally, but I do recognize that it represents a growing local economy.  And that *is* a good thing to me personally.   Cuba is really only "untapped" to the U.S.   I don't understand what you're expecting. What metro area doesn't have a lot of fast food restaurants? Are you hoping to live in a city with no such restaurants?  Are there any examples of this occurring anywhere?   They are not automatically shared with anyone. That requires an extra step from the user.   It's an example of how expensive it is to be poor. Another example is Costco. If you can afford to buy in bulk, food is much cheaper.   Did he mean _because_ they are black or _because_ they are athletes?    Are you seriously advocating for a Cultural Revolution in the US?  Not taking the bait, troll.   And a waste of resources (which SCOTUS isn't a big fan of). If they reject marriage equality, the federal judiciary will have thousands of gay marriages to adjudicate the validity of.   For you to imply that I cannot use similar language against the enemies of the republic is ignorant at best and hypocritical at worst.  What _precisely_ do you mean by this? Why is it potentially ignorant for /u/Delwin to imply that you cannot use similar language? Why is it potentially hypocritical?   Unfortunately, I responded to /u/goodboy before scrolling down to see him tip his hand as a far-right ideologue.  There's a good chance he sides with Alabama and desperately wants to believe the federal government will back down.   Just look into what happened when Alabama resisted integration. If push comes to shove, the federal government has a lot more guys with guns than Alabama does.   Is it turtles all the way down?   U3 *is* pretty at low of 5.6% though (as are U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6). It's only misleading if you start switching between different "U"s.  The measurements all track each other fairly well so referencing any one of them can be a good measure of the *relative* strength of the job market. ([Here's](http://i.imgur.com/tWpxVFu.jpg) what looks to be an accurate chart that shows this.)   It's only misleading if you don't read the definition. No one is trying to hide anything from anyone. All the data (U1-U6) is readily available.  And if we shouldn't use U3, that just means that we've had much higher unemployment for decades.   U3 has been the official standard worldwide for a long time. Also, all six categories track each other quite well with changes only on the x-axis.  Using U3 is really only misleading if you previously used, say, U6.   Climate change and evolution denial are characteristics of the American right. Libruls aren't making them deny science.   The behavior of leading GOP figures over the last few days has been baffling. Until this week, anti-vaxxers were thought to be left-wing (holistic, hippie-types).  To see them willfully take the issue and make it their own has been so strange.   Holy fuck. The joke about Obama curing cancer and Hannity therefore opposing it might not be that far off...   There's really no justification for tyrannical behavior from the bench. Judges are paid to be there and help resolve disputes. They deserve respect but must show it as well.   Is the country itself a semicolon?   Libel is rarely, if ever, criminal in the U.S. It's a civil matter.   Oop, I definitely made that assumption and I apologize. I have zero idea how Croatian bankruptcy will work.   This is not correct.  Bankruptcy allows for exemptions which are essentially a dollar figure below which you can keep assets. Most people who file Chapter 7 (liquidation) are well below the exemptions so will not lose any property.   I add "@HHMM" when relevant, too (24 hour).   Thanks for the source. That will definitely complicate things for her, in my opinion.  Wouldn't there be only one of two possibilities here? (1) He was being detained or (2) he was not being detained (he clearly wasn't under arrest).  If he was being detained, there needs to be reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. What is the reasonable suspicion here? If the police officer does not have reasonable suspicion, he can just walk away. Likewise, if he was not being detained, he can just walk away. And that is even more so the case if the officer is simply taking his picture as a member of the public. Forcing him to stay would be false imprisonment in that situation (and there would be no investigation for her to interfere with).  As for an ongoing criminal investigation, wouldn't he be entitled to access to counsel if that was the case? It's not like this was immediately post-arrest (e.g. mugshot). This was outside of a courtroom after a hearing.   Mine arrived today!    The right-leaning bias is pretty strong in this comment.   Wouldn't they have already taken pictures following the initial arrest? The headline says this was "outside court", which means the arrest was likely many days prior.   Whether the cops have a right to take a pic of a suspect when they have reasonable suspicion that thr suspect committed a crime.  If he has a public defender, he was already arrested and already had his picture taken. Are you suggesting that they thought he committed an additional crime during or right after the hearing?  	121

 sounds pretty easy, thanks! I'll pick up some tablets tomorrow :)   Shit. Well, to be honest I wasn't paying attention to protein at ALL today, only carbs and nothing else. But I'm going to re-calculate because according to MPF, the tacos with lettuce shells I had for dinner came in at 136g of protein. Thanks for the info, I'll be sure to be more careful going forward.   Thank you for the info and the support! Today I did pretty good on water, I'm looking into how to more adequately supplement electrolytes. I definitely do not want to feel that flu at work!   yes? Unless I put something into MFP very, very wrong. Numbers are: Goal: 70 Total: 205 Left: -135   Awesome, thanks for the response! But I didn't pay any mind to protein at all today. I'm over by 135, is that bad?   I'm almost 600 calories over for the day, yet I have 7g of carbs left to consume. Is it a problem if I'm under? How important is it to meet my carbs for the day? Do I need to consume something else to match my daily allotment?  EDIT: I figured out my protein problem!! I did some meal prepping and ate some of that for dinner. I accidentally included *all* of the ground beef I used instead of just what I ate tonight. Thank you all for your input and advice. Without you guys, I wouldn't have given it a second thought otherwise because I'm pretty clueless about nutrition.  EDIT 2: I fixed the info in MFP and while I'm still over for the day because of my lunch (steak and seared shrimp), I'm *so much closer!*   4 simultaneous tooth abscesses for about 10 months. I went to the dentist for the first time in my life about a year ago at 26 years old. I got 3 root canals and all 4 wisdom teeth removed, but one of the root canals failed causing another abscess and I got 3 dry sockets from my wisdom teeth at the same time. The pain was unreal, and no amount narcotics helped. Couldn't eat, drink, sleep, or talk. I never want to feel that again.      Thank you so much, you are incredible! I'll let you know how it works   I'm using Open Office rather than Excel, could that cause formatting problems? I'm getting Error Code 508 under the"Row" column, and the shopping list doesn't auto-populate, it's all grayed out.   No just any tea, try Yerba Mate. It's got 85mg of caffeine per fluid ounce, so it's sure to give you the fix you're looking for!   I am so, so sorry you're feeling this way. I did a similar thing the last couple of days. My husband keeps me in check, but he's gone for work and since he's left I've gotten totally out of control. I curse myself while taking another bite of pizza or cookie. I strongly recommend you check out /r/EOOD/, it's a sub just for people who are in the process of getting physically healthy while fighting mental issues, mainly depression. It's by far my favorite sub, just for the support and understanding.   I see it as gold and white, my brain only processes it and black and blue when I don't look directly at the dress but rather at the lower left corner of the photo.   Yeah ive gotten that email before.  "Hi friend, I hope this email finds you well.   I'm in Nigeria and am in desperate need of money. If you could help me out I will reward you handsomely."   You have just made so much sense out of many years of pain, remorse, confusion, guilt and fear. I went through a very similar situation as the man above, but in at two personal cases the men were between 4 and 6 years older than me and both close relatives. Still, you unknowingly helped so many people like myself. I can't express how much your words have helped me, and if you were infront of me right now I would hug you and cry. Thank you a million times.    Considering you're experiencing high anxiety before the gym it's more likely it's tied to that, but if the two events are unrelated it could be exercise - induced asthma.  	16
 Huffman should just put out an address to a public park and host the AMA there. Then we get to see who is actually asking these stupid questions.    War has come to AMA.

I'm sad these don't get more exposure. But there are some new recommendations in between the stuff we know already.   Guess Reddit is in the midst of cutting their brotarian ties with Steve and Alexis.   It's not a fallacy, it's a documented reality. We like to think we're immune to tyrannies, but the truth is it takes vigilance, and sometimes over-reaction, in order to prevent them. It's a tug of war, and just because we're winning doesn't mean we can stop tugging - the other side sure won't.  Best of Outrage Culture worthy in that Advice Animals Thread.  The conspiracy Yishan PR machine is apparently waking up in that Technology thread:   Yishan is bitter Pao was thrown under the bus by Alexis and the board. He recommended her for the post, and I will bet half my karma that they have a personal relationship as well. Now he sees the perfect opportunity to get back at Alexis and the board, with some grade A shit posting. Check out some of his previous comments in the past few days, you'll get the gist. No complaints from me though, makes for some excellent popcorn.  Holy hell, this is some prime cookery:  How is that a 'PR spin machine'? That all seems terrible for reddit the company. This isn't PR spin machine, it's someone who is mad and getting revenge by airing the dirty laundry Its PR for Yishan's cause. I hope he at least gets some of that pussy from all this white knighting.  Now the Reddit celebrities are chiming in. A famous Lizard of War has appeared:  I'm a bit confused, perhaps you can clarify what you mean:  Reddit caused Ellen's departure (you did it reddit!) but Ellen says it didn't and the board confirms.   - Ellen was all about free speech and fatpeoplehate was only banned for inciting off-site but dozens of parody subreddits were banned after that did nothing off-site and hundreds of people were shadowbanned for criticizing her? Did she know this was happening?  - With Ellen at the helm, Reddit was immune to being criticized for intentionally creating a racist / sexist environment but Reddit is the users, not the corporate structure. How could Reddit, Inc. be criticized for promoting free speech?   - This entire time you had vital information that could have saved your friend embarrassment and mental anguish but you didn't say anything because of "Executive Privilege?"  I dunno man, this doesn't make sense to me.  The only way this all works in my head is if Ellen was a figurehead with no actual power, had nothing to do with the contradictory decisions made, and you were under some sort of gag-order.  Maybe this was all a giant cluster-fuck of epic proportions and the lack of communication was the result of internal squabbling, but honestly, I love Reddit and I expect better.

I think the Kotaku in Action/MRA/Coontown network are going to be in denial about what sub reddits are on the chopping block until it comes true.    We've seen what "ignoring the subs" cause. It creates Fat People Hate to grow to its bulbous size and when the admins finally decide they've had enough of them, they boot them from the site causing a tidal wave of thousands of seemingly 20 something adults throwing internet temper tantrums.   Clearly, ignoring and going about your Redditing experience doesn't work. It just allows large concerted efforts to grow a shitty user base to go unabated and then it seeps into other Sub Reddits. If you want to see the affect of ignoring a problem just look at the /r/videos threads where a woman talks about [domestic abuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cjgit/26_year_old_woman_from_ireland_posts_video_about/) or [isolated incidents at Wal-Mart.](https://np.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/3cdhte/walmart_has_the_worst_customers/csuoqq7)      I'm not sure one can take a petition seriously that allows Mr. Pop Corntastesgood to sign it.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PRVV5SLbVGg   To rustle some jimmies.

There are other holes in your essay too. Op-eds are peoples opinions. They are inherently bias. You linked two of them. That's not a sign of media bias. Also, you'd have to prove that there's an end to what the media bias is supposed to achieve here other than "redditors are kinda shitty people."  Secondly, media bias isn't in most of the articles you linked considering most of your linked articles all correctly reported Sam Altman's statements about "sickening" behavior.   For some reason you brought in this weird men vs women stance while arguing that gender and identity politics don't matter in this case when according to the end statement of your essay, they do?  Finally, Redditors aren't a privileged class of citizen. This is a social media site, we don't get any sort of civil rights here. Most of the decisions alleged to Pao have been refuted by admins and other sources from Reddit. And she did receive an undue amount of shitty behavior from Reddit's user base.

The well goes deep. "Sandra Bullock and Halle Berry; Doing Great as Single Moms:"  It is considered a feat to make a marriage work in Hollywood. Celebrity couples due their hectic work schedule, plus the media who constantly poking and over sensationalized a simple circumstance need not to be publicly known and invaded privacy certainly added pressure to the struggling unions of the celebrities and superstars.   There is an apparent increase of celebrity single parents lists. The most popular alibis are; divorce, new found love, unfortunate passing of their partner and the decision to move forward with becoming a parent in their own right. Recently is Bridget Moynahan, whom Tom Brady left in favor of supermodel Gisele Bundchen. The actress is famous in her role as John Cusack's fiance in the movie Serendipity seems adjusting well to her new solo job a single as mom.   Sandra Bullock follow through, the actress life-changing year has included an Oscar win, a divorce filing and an adoption. Public was sympathetic to Bullock when news of her cheating husband, Jesse James broke. It is a public knowledge that Jesse James philandering acts prompted Sandra Bullock to file divorce. Sadness was replaced by joy for her elated adoption of her baby boy, Louis Bardo.   Halle Berry and boyfriend Gabriel Aubrey heading to Splitsville and are now reportedly battling over custody of their daughter, Nahla. The gorgeous actress has a very rocky and public love life. Her recent split from boyfriend Gabriel Aubrey, and father of her daughter, Nahla seemed amicable at first, but there had been a change in the direction of the wind as the two are embroiled in a custody battle.   Kudos to all single parents, celebrity or not. Your toil deserves great appreciation. And one way of showing is through giving mothers jewelry. There is a wide selection of personalized necklaces and personalized jewelry to choose from. So let your creative juices flow and pick a unique mothers gift.   Another gem called How to Become Famous Like Justin Bieber:  Do you want to become famous? And do you want to become famous like Justin Bieber did? **Well what if I was to tell you that it's not actually that hard to do?**  Bieber may be too criticized by many but is a great example of what the marketing, social networking and other elements can do.  First Bieber began releasing their videos through YouTube, a platform that has given 5 minutes of fame to many people, but these 5 minutes stretched into years due to other internet tools... Twitter.  If we learn from the biography of Justin Bieber is that if someone wants to become famous, should begin now to put their videos (as real as possible) on YouTube, because you never know who might "accidentally" discover your talent for delight the young fans.   This is exactly what has happened to Justin Bieber.  Twitter really help Bieber began to attract attention from your target market. Many marketers still do not understand the scope that is Twitter users and yet this was the platform that Justin used to engage with your audience. Justin currently offer your movie called "Never Say Never" (never say never), a type of documentary which presents the story of the singer and how he came to where he is now.  And of course had to take a perfume especially for girls called "someday" but the video is a little weird and may even get you a laugh, in two days has reached the 2 million views. A very good example is Google; that is starting to become obsessed with the pop stars. This search engine company has made a change in its marketing strategy. Last month, he joined Lady Gaga in an ad to show all the opportunities offered by the Chrome browser. Now he has done the same with Justin Bieber.  The announcement is similar to Gaga, but also shares some similarities with the recent announcement Dear Sophie, which shows a father using Chrome and other Google products to remember her daughter's childhood.  It makes sense that Google has thought Bieber for their promotion. The young celebrity was discovered thanks to his performances uploaded to Youtube. And with it, Google manages to reach an important demographic: teenage girls.  One of his secrets: Its well-defined market.  Justin Bieber is not intended that all are his fans; he knows it would be almost impossible, yet the market for young girls have it well controlled. So it adds the elements of marketing, good use of digital tools and a well-defined market and the rest is history.   *brumby*   gumbis   More brilliance, a review of No Strings Attached from a paper mill:  The funny can be credited to screenwriter Elizabeth Meriwether, who not only creates lead characters that are likeable, but has surrounded these people with a surprisingly rich supporting cast. There is not token best friend that gets all the lines. There's actually a posse. Natalie Portman's Emma and Ashton Kutcher's Adam are surrounded by friends and co-workers that are very very funny without having to resort to outrageous infantile humor. Heck, they all seemed like they could be any of the inherently funny people that I know in the real world.   Adam and Emma meet cute as teenagers at summer camp where his sheepish moves on Emma fall flat. The run into each other again at a frat party in college, then again a few years later. As always happens in the movies, they are destined to end up in the same state, in the same town, at the same time. So when drunk and depressed Adam calls every phone number in his cell for a booty call, he ends up waking up in Emma's Los Angeles flat surrounded by her roommates. Emma is now a workaholic doctor, and Adam works as a middling minion in the television business. Emma doesn't have the time or energy for a real relationship, so she proposes that she and Adam become fuck-buddies. What guy would refuse?   I think it is interesting that there is a string of "no strings attached" sex comedies spilling into the theaters. And they all seemingly have the same twist (which is not much of a twist when they are all the same): In the modern take, it is the guy who falls for the non-committal woman first. But where the similar setup of Love and Other Drugs failed from lack of chemistry between Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway, Natalie and Ashton actually make a cute couple. Their quips seem natural, and even though Emma is a bit over-the-top bristly whenever she thinks she is being conned into a relationshippy-type moment, she is still appealing. And who doesn't like to see Natalie Portman have an occasional potty-mouth moment? That's right. We all like a smart girl that swears.   No Strings Attached does falter a bit. It struggles with momentum toward the end as it falls into the predictable territory of whether or not these lovers should also be together for realz. Hollywood does always want the perfect kiss at the end. But until then, I was totally enjoying the ride. Along with great supporting turns by Greta Gerwig, Mindy Kaling, and Lake Bell (along with more awkward appearances by Kevin Kline and Cary Elwes), No Strings Attached is funny escapism with a great cast that won't leave you feeling cheated after your two-hour fling at the movies.   More gems from a genuine paper mill producing top notch film criticism:  They're wicked and foul with the stench of 40,000 years. But what would movies be without them? While most are truly quite horrific, others are actually funny. But throughout the many years of cinematic history, one fact has always remained constant about movie villains... we love to hate them.   Heroes get all the hype, but deep down, we all love a good villain. I can take or leave the square-jawed boy scout, the do-gooder who gets the girl and saves the day; but the villain is a different kettle of genetically modified laser wielding fish altogether.   Funny Villain have more fun and get most of the best lines. Movie history is littered with fiendish foes, evil overlords and malevolent masterminds we loved to hate. The summer blockbuster is the perfect breeding ground for evildoers and this year's pageant of box office behemoths provides rich pickings, from robots out for revenge to muggle-hating wizards.   Cinema is filled with memorable villains. Whether it's the sardonic cheer of Gert Frbe's Auric Goldfinger, or the sneering oiliness of Die Hard's Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), the movies are full of superb, loveably evil performances. The hero may get the girl and save the world in most instances, but it's the villain who gets most of the quotable lines.   It's like the alignment of the planets. Occasionally, a great director, an exemplary script and a gifted actor will join together on the same project, creating the kind of unsettling performances that linger in the memory for years afterwards.   Michael Mann's 1986 adaptation of Thomas Harris' novel Red Dragon was the first movie to bring cannibalistic academic Dr. Hannibal Lecter (in this instance spelled Lecktor due to rights issues) to the big screen.   Robert De Niro chews both characters and scenery in a manic performance as Max Cady, an ex-convict who terrorises lawyer Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) for apparently failing to defend him effectively in court fourteen years earlier.   An indifferent and Funny movie villains can be threatening as a villain with an almost cartoon-like evil uniform like Jason Vorhees from Friday the 13th. In The Matrix (1999), the army of 'faceless' agents are cold and emotionless and suggest an unbeatable threat with which the hero cannot reason or negotiate.   The all-powerful emotionless villain is portrayed excellently in the X-Files TV series by William B. Davis as the Cigarette Smoking Man. Throughout the series he is constantly in control of the heroes and any attempts to kill him are deemed self-destructive or futile. His power over the protagonists' behaviour is linked to his role in the Syndicate, a mysterious organisation who seemingly are more powerful than the U.S. government.   On the opposite end of the scale are the villains that are emotive, excitable and with exaggerated personas as demonstrated by Heath Ledger's villain in the most-recent Batman film, The Joker. The latest incarnation of the Clown Prince of Crime perfectly conveys his lack of empathy and almost-humorous contempt for human life. The most prominent aspect of The Joker is his colourful clothing and unusual physical appearance, with white face make-up, dyed green hair and smudged red lipstick.

Sometimes I think I would rather to catch a triply to watch than to sleep with a dull man, Because each set is very short, it probably still can give you the climax, even it is a neuter version. I still remembered that I really did't think Belle is a beautiful woman when I watched season one. But I have been able to appreciate her beauty to season four. I like to watch her to receive each customer in high spirit. She let me become more believe that there is some people really like to be a prostitute as career. From her, I felt a little shamed, I just in labor, I didn't work hard.but she does't.   Ben and Han is alike,both are brave,Both have the courage to make a choice, choose what they want, rather than they should.From the start, Ben appeared in Han's world, his state cannot be removed. From season one Ben delayed he and Vanessa' s wedding ceremony, at that moment, I knew he was really love Han.real love. But they finally broke up. Ben wants a family,but Hannah cannot give. just because she know she cannot give,she choose to leave. Hannah just wants to be herself.They separate,not because they don't love each other, they are too love.they love, but cannot give each other they want. So they say goodbye. Losing Ben, it means, Hannah and bell lose everything, but she finally decide so. love, like on you.   In fact, I know they will not be together at last, but I still hoping. Finally I having no choice but to Give up the lens. Sometimes. Two people who love each other deeply always can not be together. That's it. If it's you. Would you do as Hannah. Choose to leave because love too much. When you can't give your lover what he needs. When you can't let him be happiness. choose to leave is more great than to possess him.    Bernie   ###SURPRISE UNDEVELOPED ROMANCE   Holes. by the ending they dug a lot of holes.    I have a feeling that our next batch of conservative politicians are going to be former Redditors and the debates are going to be even more entertaining because SJW, White Guilt and Triggered Tumblrnas are going to be said on national television with sincerity.    **his Ron Paul senses are tingling!**   It was Bernie Sanders. YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY FROM HIM THIS TIME.   [You mean like a Island only inhabited by Redditors who believe in the libertarian principles of Ron Paul and an economy devoted to anime and cheese pizza?](http://gawker.com/5932987/reddit-island-could-an-enthusiastic-online-community-create-a-nerd-oasis-in-real-life)   I hope everyone who auditions reads the Im CIA scene.          Wow. Digg used to look like Reddit. It's not a bad site now, the curate a bunch of great articles and their subheds on them are  funny.   He reported to Ellen Pao, but Alexis is still her boss and Steve Altman is over both of them. Pao didn't even have a board seat.  He's over her and he also admitted to firing Victoria on top of Yishan's clarification. So what's the big deal here? Reddit fucked up. Vigilante internet mobs don't work.    What the fuck? She got to taser the fucking mayor for charity? I'm not sure whether living America is awesome or just the most fucked up thing.   Make the American Sniper plastic baby CEO of Reddit.   Memes.   The Band's Visit is an incredible little drama. It's really charming too.   I would also recommend Lebanon, Ajami, Omar and Bethlehem too.    The only guys who are saying this movie is good are the video critics who are already nerds, while I'm seeing general critics who veer toward liking more movies than just comic book ones are finding it meh.   If color coordination is the biggest twist in this movie, I'll just gonna stay home and watch the Shahs of Sunset.    It's not easy being green...and in a medieval torture device.   "We a family"    "No"  "No, you say yes."  "Well...no. what now?"  "I guess nothing. Movies over."    Maybe F4 just can't be a movie?  They need to hit F4 and start again without Josh Trank.   Who wants to bet the villain says "FIND THEM/HIM/HER" as the camera cuts away with a crescendo of music.   I realize now why Vin Diesel is the only guy to make that line work.    Ae lamaeo   Should put a countdown ticker till all that's left is Ohanian and a bag of popcorn.   Ohanian was demoted from chair to co-founder with Steve Huffman. Altman is in charge now.   Wow, this is filled with tons of bad information. Victoria was fired by Alexis. Kickme444 confirmed Ellen Pao didn't fire that disgruntled guy because he had leukemia. Shit, that's just the start. Why can't Redditors just admit they don't have all the information and put the pitchforks down? You people are terrible at it, but you guy keep instigating.   Because the first thing Reddit needs is another anonymous "Whistleblower" so it can go on another witch hunt.   Also, who the fuck brings guns to a tech job in silicon valley? Is he Hugh Jackman from Chappie?   Moderates were powerless. When /r/videos was on a rampage upvoting that caricature of Ellen Pao singing a parody of Keene's "Somewhere Only We Know," I pretty much realized I was watching a train wreck in progress.     John Tuturro as a fucking EGYPTIAN PHAROAH! Best Comedy of 2014. Deserves an Oscar for Best Comedy.    Alexis was board chairman. He was Ellen Pao's boss. It flows up to him.    Hot Dog Pizza came out during Paogate. I blame Domino's for this.   He used the term "dumb dumbs" to showcase his superior intellect. He's an intelligent person.    Hear that? It's the sound of Reddit pedaling backwards.   I'm nut ur mister, memester.   its like this is some kind of suicide thread.   Shit, have we ever been linked in drama? I feel like this is an auspicious first.       I wonder if the comments on that site ever get any hits in their spam log?   You mean the one they show in the trailer? Caw Caw      CIA   Yeah, but what about skills in Dank Memes?   Come by /r/movies sometime. We yell at each other about comic book movies, Dredd and Joey Fatone.

 [I don't know why, but this GIF instantly came to my mind](http://i.imgur.com/7IgWM.gif).   If Bronn dies, we riot.    I'm not sure if this belongs here... The actor who plays Edmure - Tobias Menzies - recently did an interview, which begins with him talking about GoT and his hope that they eventually tie up Edmure's storyline. I found it funny that he is just as clueless as the fans. [Here's the link](http://www.vulture.com/2015/05/outlander-tobias-menzies-on-going-full-frontal.html) to the interview for those interested.    Go Rand! Make Kentucky proud.   Anyone have a count on how many times Sen. Wyden said "my colleague"?    My university is the same way. Graduation is usually on Saturday, grades aren't due until the Tuesday after.    I'm a day late to the party, but [I'll leave this picture here anyway](http://i.imgur.com/rYf60RB.jpg).   Currently at Pop Century, and yes there is a fridge but no microwave. If you decide not to use Garden Grocer, you could look into shipping items to the hotel. Like order online from Walmart or some other store and instead of shipping the items to your home, ship to the hotel. We ordered water and some breakfast bars from Amazon Pantry and shipped them to Pop - they accepted the package four days before our arrival without any problems and we picked it up at the front desk when we checked in.    I am now going to call the black end on a banana "butt nugget."   Touch.   Isn't birth control [supposed to be free under Obamacare?](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5888320)   Random question. I was just looking on the Disney app for wait times at Epcot. It says the wait time for Test Track is 300 minutes, or 5 hours... Pretty sure it was just a crazy error. Does that happen often on the app?   I hope you had a safe and wonderful flight! Have a great trip! So far Pop Century is awesome.    Woo hoo!! T-minus 24 hours until we board our plane :)   I just started packing today! Saturday can't get here soon enough!      Thank you! :)   Check out [this](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/bands-cards/) page over on the Disney website. That should answer your questions!  Basically, if you're not staying at a Disney resort, you'll receive a card instead and you'll have the option to buy a MagicBand online or at Disney World. If you are staying at a Disney resort, you will receive a MagicBand free. To customize your band, sign into your Disney account and under My Disney Experience you'll see "Magic Bands and Card" ([here's a link to it if you have an account](https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/bands-cards/)). There, you'll be able to customize your band - there are various colors including pink. According to the Disney website, you have until 10 days before your arrival to customize your band if you want it shipped to your home. If you don't customize your band before then, you'll pick it up at your hotel.   Arriving May 9th, staying at Pop Century (my phone autocorrected to Poo Century... Really, phone?). Anyway, I can't wait! I'll be celebrating my birthday on Monday :)  	18

 I'm sorry but it's still not making much sense. Can you ELI5?    I'm going off of the movie Labyrinth. How did Sarah know who was lying or not?      I was trying to stick up for you.    It's all cool. Perhaps /u/oree94 is a young buck/doe.    [T to the I to the erra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaIUbeDAHdM)      Demiguise hair.   'almost like having friends'    As far as I Know, there are no dogs at the Burrow.   I'll be there to secure a Ravenclaw win.    I have to during that evil week of the month. Speaking of..      Thanks, we went out, and the sky opened as soon as we left.   When Albus escaped from Fudge, Umbridge, two aurors, and the Junior Secretary of the ministry, he spoke to a portrait of a past headmaster called Fortescue. Is that perhaps an elder of Florean, the ice cream guy?   noobs.  Edit: it was meant to be humorous.    Which is sad in it's own way because Neville and Luna got the most structure from the DA.          I agree, and I think Harry made a mention of this. Sorry, but my HBP is not on me.     ...he defends him during the dementor attack.  *This* I think was the biggest factor. Dudley leaving Harry a cuppa each day.. he knew what was going on. Even though Ms. Rowling said that they would get together so the kids could know each other, I hope that they could chat about Harry blowing up aunt Marge, and have a laugh.        The DA was only formed because Umbridge wouldn't let the students use practical magic. If Fudge believed Dumbledore, he would not have placed Dolores at her post.   There would probably be no DA.   You are correct.   Thanks.   I don't think dragons are beasts of burden. I think they are highly intelligent beings that live long and productive lives. I liken their intelligence to that of a djinn or genie. They will help you, but at your expense.  But then some dragons talk and others are just beasts, as you mentioned.   That's Pottermore, right? Been a few years since I have read it.      If you figure that a dragon's heart is probably a meter across, and wands are generally between 10-12 inches, add in the other cores making them less needful, and I'm sure there would almost be a surplus.  Edit: I would be interested to know what type of person is chosen by a dragon wand. I have one on Pottermore.   Dragons do die ya know, and they tend to be pretty large beasts.    The taboo takes away all protective charms disapparition. Sort of like the caterwauling charm in Hogsmead.   Eastern Kentucky.         They have still been adding to the previous books.   It wasn't that She rehashed old information, it was all the crazy spins and input She put on each bit. I think I'm going to re reread it and take notes.  Edit: I posted earlier that the Dursley bit was underwhelming.    Thank you.    What I love most about it is that it's so close to the books, and so well done. She did skip over a few things, but I expect they will be addendums.   Let's hope.   I would do nothing less than keep fighting.   Stone faced mannequin, tyvm.   Correct, but all of her cleverness was omitted. I thought Bonnie did a great job, I just hated her directing.    That could be true, but cats have always been magical/mystical beings.  Also Kneazles are magically intelligent cats.   One more thing, why is it called the decoy Harrys instead of the seven Potters? I thought Ms. Rowling had control of this?   That bit was really underwhelming, only one mention of Dudley.   The films took away every bit of Ginny's character, so I would expect nothing less.   Remember my last referred to the actual letter he left with Harry on the doorstep if 4 PD.   Great job catching up!

We always love Auxier Ridge, and we stop at Devil's Gulch for sunsets.   We do the shorter hikes during the heat.  Edit: I always love the backside of angel's windows. Just discovered that two years ago.    Why not just bang dudes? Go to a bar, get free drinks, and then go bang them.    You could do that now.    Auxier?   Right? I would play with my boobs all day too, but what if they weren't that big? Why jill off when you could just get laid?    This is our annual trip to the Red. Last year we went to the Smokies first and stopped at the RRG on the way back.   Who says you would have one big enough?   It's not that hard. Haven't you ever watered a plant with a hose?   Cheers.    I would go to every bar, and get guys to buy me drinks.   HA!   Not sure about that because Andromeda was kicked out of the family for not staying true to the pureblood beliefs. I would assume that Lucius and Narcissa wouldn't talk about her and Ted at all.      Hippogriff. Because how cool would it be to have a frickin' horse eagle in your backyard whenever you wanted to go anywhere?   I taped Larry Lester's buns together. Had to spend a Saturday in detention.      Do you have this reply saved somewhere? or just memorized? I hope there's pudding.   I used to be so happy when Dumbledore awarded the quartet the points, and Neville was the last one. Cross my heart, I would cry sometimes.    Decent.   [Here](http://i.imgur.com/tB85Gy2.jpg) is another, they had the entire street blocked off.   Jawbreakers and JAAAAMMM!!

Here they are, [1](http://i.imgur.com/UmpPtqh.jpg), [2](http://i.imgur.com/zvDYxts.jpg), [3](http://i.imgur.com/TL43eKy.jpg).  I didn't go far enough to see Lucius in the last one, but he's there.   "Aren't those tentacula leaves, sir? Very valuable, aren't they?"   My DH2 bluray/DVD is like that.   ..and when he showed at the ministry and was emanating power.   I don't think Begbie would have made a good Snape. I wouldn't be able to get past his previous roles.   Niether could live while the other survives.  Sybill made another correct prophecy. I believe that The Dark Lord caused his own downfall by trying to do too much, in turn making it fairly easy for Harry to defeat him.   I know Heather. That's why I am stepping down. I'm going to be AFK(holidays) for a long time, and I don't feel like it's fair for the house.   Shoe...   nice catch, I was outside.   I will add that Harry got the firebolt at christmas, not the end of term.      No man, there are no Cliff's Notes for Harry Potter. But if you want a quick refresher, explore Pottermore.   I doubt it since the Dept. of Mysteries was a British thing, and they were the ones experimenting with time. It wasn't a worldwide phenomenon.    My fault, misunderstood your comment. By that time all the time turners were destroyed because She forsaw what a plot hole they could become.   No, It had already happened that way. Buckbeak/Witherwings never died.  [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_loop) is some more info on the STLT.    Nope, She has also said that anything more than five hours is seriously messing with nature.   Ms. Rowling subscribes to the 'Stable Time Loop Theory', meaning everything that has happened will always happen, there is no changing the past.   Pretty much.   While Lily's blood sacrifice was in Voldemort, it tethered Harry to life as long as Riddle was alive, which is why Dumbledore had a flash of triumph in his eye when Harry was explaining what happened in the graveyard.   Correct, making Riddle a sort of 'anti-horcrux' for Harry.   I'm telling my principal on you.   Lightweights maybe, and the proper term is cannabis. Marijuana was used as a scare tactic in the 30s to make people think it only grew in Mexico.   I don't think so, not with the Stable Time Loop.   It's a 'Trailer Park Boys' joke.   What do you think are some examples?    Molly Weasley's maiden name is Prewett.  Her *mading* name   It's pronounced exactly like it's spelled I'm pretty sure.   What? How the hell could that happen?    Riker: Can't stay away from the big chair, can you?  Troi: I don't think I'm cut out to be captain.

 Significant losses on multiple screens.   An honest question here:  has this gentleman even read the Satoshi paper? His argument takes the following form:  1.  Bitcoin's value is dependent on the existence of a number of its features, especially the integrity of the "miners".  2.  "Mining" inherently trends towards monopoly.  3.  A mining pool which has become a monopoly nullifies the key features of Bitcoin.  4.  Therefore, Bitcoin is inherently flawed and doomed.  Even granting him that his first two propositions are true (which can be argued, but to Hell with it, I'll be generous and give him those), his conclusion (#3, and thus #4) does not follow, because a 51% attack does not create the problem that he thinks it does.  In the Satoshi paper, there is a mention of a 51% attack problem, and it clearly shows how the incentives for the system make it economically infeasible to apply your mining power to a 51% attack - the system is such that applying that power to the network honestly would get you a greater reward.  The only thing that a 51% attack can do is shut down (or delay) the system until the other actors discover what is going on.  Hence, a 51% attack can, at most, maliciously attempt to destroy the functionality of the system - but it would not hinder it for long, *for multiple reasons*.  First, these gigantic mining pools generally contain many individual miners.  Once they realize that them being part of this pool has hampered the system, their incentive for remaining in the pool is gone (they are getting a return of exactly zero - even hashing by hand is better than that!) Second, even if (somehow) this really is one single, gigantic, malevolent actor using all the mining power for evil, all we need to do is alter the Bitcoin protocol enough to make his ASICs obsolete.  Then, all that money was wasted building and maintaining ASICs that are now built for a slightly-different task, and the Blockchain goes back to the longest "good" chain and re-starts, albeit with much less mining power.  But - the wealth (the coins) are still there.  tl;dr - This argument is based on one incorrect assumption:  that a 51% attack can disrupt the Bitcoin network permanently by stealing coins.   It.  Does not.  Make. Sense.   Using [win %] (http://espn.go.com/nfl/playoffs/machine?2014) as the automatic determining factor for the rest of the season is absolutely stupid for the following reasons:  1.  It biases towards teams with already good win percentages.  As such, the Cardinals and Patriots don't lose another game, and several teams do not win another game.  2.  It has no tiebreaking procedure, so from week 12 to week 17, this simulation predicts 16 games will end in a tie.     Right but this way *they* get the HC that *we* kicked out of town early who then went to become a coordinator in the NFC West.   The very best solution, in my mind, is to move away from conference-based playoffs to a full seeded system, still with 12 teams.  The 8 division winners can still all have invites, but will be seeded according to their records.  It ends up looking like this:  Four Teams with best records (regardless of Division Championship) - 1st Round Bye.  Four next best records:  1st Round home game  Four worst records; 1st Round road game.  Let's take the infamous 7-9 Seahawks year into account.  Here were the seeds for that year:   Rank | AFC Team (Rec) |  NFC Team (Rec)  ---|---|---- 1 | New England (14-2) |  Atlanta (13-3) |  2 | Pittsburgh (12-4) | Chicago(11-5) |  3 | Indianapolis(10-6) |  Philadelphia (10-6)|  4 | Kansas City(10-6) |  Seattle(7-9) |  5 | Baltimore(12-4) | New Orleans(11-5) |  6 | New York (11-5)|  Green Bay(10-6) |   This led to the stupidity of the 7-9 Seahawks hosting the 11-5 Saints.  With the seeded bracket system, it looks like this:   Rank | Team | Record  ---|------|---- 1 | New England | 14-2\*  2 | Atlanta | 13-3\*  3 | Pittsburgh | 12-4\*  4 | Baltimore | 12-4  5 | Chicago | 11-5\*  6 | New York (J) | 11-5  7 | New Orleans | 11-5  8 | Indianapolis | 10-6\* 9 | Kansas City | 10-6\*  10 | Philadelphia |10-6\* 11 | Green Bay  | 10-6  12 | Seattle | 7-9\*  \*   *denotes Division Champion*  Obviously, the tie-breaking procedures might want to be changed a bit, as we had 6 teams with 10-6 records, and only 4 could get in.  The three who won their division made it, but there was a logjam for that last spot.  Exactly how to decide these isn't a hard problem, though.  Interesting tidbits here:    1. The four best records get the first round bye.  Two of them are in the same division, though.  2. Three division champions will not be hosting a playoff game due to the strength of some wild cards.  I feel like this rewards a team for winning the division (as two 10-6 teams do not make the playoffs, depending on the tiebreaker used).  However, it also rewards teams that performed well in difficult divisions (i.e., the Jets and Saints host a playoff game - and the Ravens even have a bye!)  3. The coolest thing (and the hardest thing to get used to) is non-conference playoff games.  The First round is:  Seattle @ Chicago  Green Bay @ New York Jets  Philadelphia @ New Orleans  Kansas City @ Indianapolis  Some familiar playoff matchups, some very strange.  Round 2 could see Chigaco @ New England, New York Jets @ Atlanta, Philadelphia @ Pittsburgh, and Indianapolis @ Baltimore.  Wow.  And you can't tell me you don't like the possibility of a Steelers/Ravens Superbowl (they are on different sides of the bracket here, so it *could* happen).   Josh McDaniels, obviously.   Somehow, he is a success and it sticks in the craw of all Broncos fans everywhere as he wins a Superbowl for the resurgent Raiders.  That is so much more Raiders than Rex Ryan.   Honestly, with the way this group is playing, it appears as though we are only going to be able to compete against the bottom third (maybe even bottom quarter!) of the league.  Our division is very strong, and we have little to no chance against OKC when they get healthy (hell, we already botched one game against them when they were under-manned).  If you figure that we show up and compete hard in the games where we aren't out-matched, talent-wise, I can see us around 10 wins come January.  I mean, we have 32 games before Jan 1st.  10-22 seems WAY above how this team is performing right now, doesn't it?  That's going 8-15 over the next 1.5 months.  It is possible, but I think unlikely.  Now, for what I think happens.  Others are correct in that we have a lot of pieces (and very good ones!) for which to offer some contenders.  Once January comes around, if we're sub-10 wins, I think we go for the all-out tank, and start trading some of those pieces to contenders.  I think that you make two of Ty, Faried, and Gallo untouchable, but everyone else can be got.  I think that is a splendid core, and allows us to offer Mozgov to Cleveland, Foye to a team who needs a 3-point shooter, Nate to a contender who wants a little more bench scoring, etc, etc.  Stockpile picks and young talent, and hope the balls come out in our favor.    This team looks like garbage right now, and the NBA isn't exactly fair with its talent acquisition process (Chicago, LA, NY will ALWAYS have an advantage over Denver, Sacramento, and even OKC), but we have done a very good job nabbing talent in the middle of the 1st round in the recent past (Faried and Lawson being the shining examples).  We need that star to kick us up a notch.  As for Shaw?  My jury is still out on that one.  This may just be a McDaniels situation (not the cheating, petulant, horrible human being part - just the inexperience in Head Coaching and poor player relationships part) that we have to scrape away and start anew.  It'll be very telling how he and the team handle this gigantic suckfest that I predict will soon be upon us.   Yeah, it is very selective memory whenever a bad loss happens.  Passionate fans are always just super-worried about their team's success and a loss makes them feel very uneasy.  Some people are quick to forget that:  1.  Last Year, the Seahawks lost to Arizona at home, despite Carson Palmer throwing 4 interceptions.  The same year, the Broncos got clowned by the Chargers, at home, in a fashion eerily similar to yesterday's loss to the Rams.  Both teams went on to play in the Superbowl.  2.  The Ravens were left for dead in December.  They had just fired their offensive coordinator, and looked like absolute garbage.  Super Bowl Champions.  3.  The Giants.  Ever.  4.  Green Bay looking like garbage the whole year, sneaking in, and going on a run.  Just punch your ticket, boys, and we'll see how January goes.  There's still lots of time to look good.     Yeah, but they'd all be Sam Rockwell.  Actually, that's okay.  Carry on.   "DAE Padding stats?  LOL, Peyton/Fox are poor sports!"  Did you watch the game?  How about the vine?  It is still the 3rd quarter here.  Peyton came in *for one play* and then the Lobster had the whole fourth quarter.  It is kind of amazing how far some of you will stretch the events to fit your preconceived narrative.   This is exactly what happened to me.  Wife and I switched over to the hockey and saw 1-0, 19:15, and then the stretcher!  "What the fuck did we miss!?"  Very scary.  Good to hear he seems to be doing okay.   Oops, fine for "Leah Strong" on the eye black.  Your move, Goodell.  You gonna fine a cancer girl's loving daddy?  *Shane Vereen has friends in the diamond business*.   Okay I guess I am going to have to be the one to ask.  Leah Still is kind of a cunt, right?  *Tom Brady gets all "The Onion" references*   Wife and I are seeing it on Friday @ 6:30.  Will be more relaxing not having to get up for work the next morning, but I understand your excitement!   Awesome!  Set my own up!  1000 bits /u/changetip    I remember being *very* excited when Tulo signed his long-term deal.  Ditto CarGo.  And, I loved when Ubaldo looked to be inked for a long time, too.  I thought that this core group could compete and give Colorado baseball a strong chance to be entertaining.  These things did not happen.  Ubaldo underperformed, Tulo and CarGo were often injured and also underperformed.  I am not saying that you set everything ablaze and start completely fresh, but a step in the right direction is entertaining any and all offers for our last-generation stars, while attempting to develop our new boys.   Just got a changetip account!  Looking forward to using it to teach facebook friends about bitcoin!  (I already had some coin).   Nice article, but this is a little misleading:  If this story is true, then wealthy Russians will need a way to convert Ruble holdings into US dollars.  One of the easiest and least transparent channels would be to buy bitcoin and then convert those holdings into other fiat currencies.  Specifically, I take issue with the "least transparent" part of that statement.  Transactions on the blockchain are inherently transparent!  I think what the author is trying to say is that doing these transactions through bitcoin are less noticeable when compared to something like directly trading rubles for dollars or gold or other stores of value.  Is this nitpicking on my account, or is it important to clear up this misconception?   The Oakland Raiders are a dumpster fire behind a Planned Parenthood.  *"The Tuck Rule" game will go down in the annals of NFL history, much like "The Immaculate Reception".*   Hayward Jablowme!!!   Another example is using sound waves to break DNA molecules, which is called, "sonication".   Paying off a lost bet wherein I must praise the Patriots organization and/or players until the end of MNF for week 10 in every post on /r/nfl.  *Randy Moss* **could** *grow on a rolling stone.*   The confirmations happening is what the "miners" do.  It isn't "automatic" - but it is being carried out by the actors on the network, not by you.   Was there any Stadium-related issue on the ballot?  You know, like a new tax to pay for it or something?  *Mike Vrabel is better than Cris Carter, because he does more than catch touchdowns*   Starting to look like the best we can hope for is competing for a wild card spot.  I mean, maybe we can go on an insane run, but we can't even keep a 2 goal lead right now.  *Multiple games* have been given away.  Varly faces 40 shots almost nightly.  We **R** never give up.    But we have lots to fix.   "Whurs Sacic?  I thought he made us good last year!"   Exactly.   And sometimes they don't even show up for the first 20.  Running out of time to right the ship . . .   Yeah, it's okay to be fruatrated, but fucking relax.  This is your team.  Stand by them even when they are struggling.   They don't like it any more than you do.   Stats people will call it, "Regression to the mean."  People watching the game will just call it, "sucking."  They're both probably right.   Yeah, I am getting the feeling that we don't play well very often.   My cat flips out during all of those commercials.    Gif request:  Avalanche Baby.   I do not like it when the Patriots beat my team.  *The Patriots often beat my team.*   *Interstellar* comes out on Friday (earlier for some extra-fancy IMAX screens).  Imma see it on Friday.  *Bill Belichick can navigate through the Limbo Space from* Inception *with impunity, and without losing his mind*.   It would be easier to win games if anyone could make a shot.  Also, if our opponents didn't shoot 50 free throws.   Yeah, I am a big fan of non-sequitur type jokes, so they come to me fairly easily.  *Despite what Giselle says, Tom Brady* **can** *both throw the ball and catch the ball.  He chooses not to in order to keep the NFL competitive.*    Yeah, man.  fivethirtyeight does really, really good work all year long.  Bookmark it and visit it regularly!  These are also the people who bulls-eyed the 2012 presidential election.   This is about exactly how I feel.  These teams are both great, and it is fine to be fiery after a bad loss on the road.  Bottom line:  "The Best Team" is up to opinion until we start playing elimination games and the loser just goes home.  *[Drew Bledsoe] (http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/199411130nwe.htm) once threw so many passes that the 300 Spartans were happily shaded.*   Lost bet with /u/mmb5757. It should be kinda fun.  *If you drank a beer with Teddy Bruschi, the strength of the pun would get you drunk faster than the alcohol would.*   We're still about three times more likely to win the #1 seed than the Pats are.  The predictive stats say that New England will be coming here in the playoffs.  Obviously, anything can happen, but losing this game is certainly not the end of our #1 seed hopes.   Anyone remember [*The Cell*] (http://stream1.gifsoup.com/view4/3543188/the-cell-horse-scene-o.gif)?  *If Julian Edelman had been tasked with returning The One Ring to Mordor, "The Lord of the Rings" could have been fit into a half-hour sitcom*.   I find it amusing that a Jets fan responded to a gif from *Flight*.  I am a simple man.  *Rob Gronkowski can lift himself over his head.*   If they can take that second game vs. New England and have the tiebreaker?  Man, who knows how this AFC playoff picture is going to shape up?  *Tom Brady once discovered the fountain of youth, but decided that mankind did not deserve it.*   The folks over at [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/nfl-week-9-playoff-implications-a-crucial-week-for-the-saints-and-panthers/) have you covered on this one.  tl;dr:  Broncos at 59.7% to win AFC top seed now, Patriots at 20.6.  Next closest is Indy at 6.9%.   You're probably heard of [Raining Jane] (http://rainingjane.com/home.rj). You might have heard of [Cairo Fire] (http://www.reverbnation.com/cairofire). You probably haven't heard of [Galt Aureus](http://www.galtmusic.com/). And almost no one has heard of [The Jeffries] (https://www.facebook.com/thejeffriesband)   +/- only counts for 5-on-5   Nuggets holding teams under 80, Avs possessing the puck and preventing shots, Broncos winning in Foxboro.  It's a strange world.   What did you learn?   Surely people who make inordinate amounts of money will give some to schoolchildren, right?   AKA:  sucking.   HEY! IF YOU TAKE OUT THE 2ND QUARTER, WE BEAT WASHINGTON 10-7!!!  HONESTLY, THOUGH - IT IS JUST A STRATEGY TO SHAKE OFF THE BANDWAGONERS PERIODICALLY SO WE DON'T TURN INTO ANOTHER PATRIOTS, STEELERS, COWBOYS, OR 49ERS.     I KNOW, CALLAHAN DIDN'T EVEN CHANGE THE SIGNALS FROM WHEN GRUDEN WAS COACHING!   I KNOW RIGHT!  [LOL] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgNREzBAnY4) @ BRAIN DAMAGE.  FUCKIN' PATS FAN.   I got it.  Predominantly Orange post two days ago explains it well.   Every three years, but yes, that's correct.   But, that means the other two games were due to both teams finishing 1st in their division, right?  Why were *both* of those in Foxboro, again?  I have read the reason before but can't remember.   Edit:  figured it out.  The position - based divi on all games are on two-year cycles.   How about that defense?  I mean, I know Detroit isn't exactly known for lighting up the scoreboard, but you hold a team under 80 and you will win a lot of those games.  And did you hear The Manimal talk about Josh Smith shooting his team out of the game?  Seems like people are listening to Shaw.  I like the bigs, too.  The three-man rotation of Mozgov, Nurkic, and McGee gives us a lot of hard fouls and good rebounding.     Ehh, turnovers happen, especially with new guys.  It's not like we're going to see a 64-59 game here.   Auto corrects to shaved every time.   People were shitting all over this game like it was going to be an affront to basketball.  It's been fine!    Nov 5th, I think.     Good.  And *no repeating praise*!   I will still say that Champ Bailey saved our entire 2005 season, and turned it into something special.  I remember it like it was yesterday:  I was in my 2nd year at college, and I couldn't watch very many games, so I would listen to 850 KOA online (when they still let you do that).  Week two, we were reeling from a 34-10 drilling in Miami, and playing [San Diego at home] (http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2005091813/2005/REG2/chargers@broncos#tab=recap recap=fullstory).  The first half was abysmal, and we went into the locker room down 14-3, hearing boos from the fans after six straight shitty quarters.  And the Chargers got the ball to start the 3rd!  Then Champ pick-sixed Drew Brees on the first play.  The defense held San Diego to 41 yards in the second half, which we would eventually win 20-17 on a last-second Jason Elam field goal.  We were inches from 0-2, in the AFC West basement, and playing like absolute dogshit.  But Champ would not have it.  He had one of the best seasons a CB has ever had, and it started on this day.     Any Patriots fan out there down for a signature bet?  Loser must offer praise to the winner's franchise, players, coaches, etc as an italicized signature for every /r/nfl post until the end of the MNF game of week 10.   I say Indigenous Persons.   *Wave your hand in the air if you feel fine . . .*   That's my S.O.P.   Depending on this punt, we may see a free kick here!    I'll take it.  How do you feel about punting?  I would like to not have a punter on the roster.   Look within yourself.   It is destined for overtime.  You *know* it to be true.   Is this an appropriate forum to discuss my recent obsession with *Girls Chase Boys*?   There is not enough whiskey.  (But there is)   This seems to be a blind spot for NFL coaches.  I would onside or mid-squib every time.  Onside will result in either a new possession,  or their ball at the 40ish.  Squib could pin inside the 10.  Coaches need to consider this.   I have never seen Jerry Jones and Jason Garret on the same screen together.  Could they be the same person?  Like, a *Looper* type of situation?   Oh yeah, one of those really long deep slimy ones that you can feel slide out of your throat as it comes out.   Colt McCoy's skill is directly related to the state of the US economy.   That was like Dan Snyder in the Southpark episode, *Go Fund Yourself*.  Hut. Huthuthuuuuuut!   It is way less funny when it isn't cartoon characters.   Robocop!!!   So, we get all-oranges next year for a couple of cool games, which I have wanted for ever, and then the 2016 season we get to show off the Nike-designed new stuff?  What is the usual time-table for revealing new uniform/logo design.  Usually it feels like we don't know anything until the offseason beforehand (like the Bucs this year).  But, with Nike wanting to use the Broncos re-design as a posterchild or flagship, I figured that they might want a little more pomp than that.  Also, I have pieced together a number of your answers in this post, so I am going to describe what I am picturing so far:  Helmet:  Mostly chrome/light grey.  Orange "D" makes a comeback on the helmet with an updated chrome horse which looks like a cross between the old "D" horse and our newer swoopy horse.  Home Jersey:  Mostly a dark grey (not the light grey of the Seahawks) with Orange numbers.  Orange shoulder accents with a design similar to the Bucs new stuff.  Pants will be grey, too?  Aways:  White-Out!  Aside from the orange "D" on the helmet, outline for player names, and player numbers, we're all white here.  Seems like there is a possibility to have orange bottoms, as well.  Camouflage-style plays during snowstorms will change the game.  Broncos choose to wear white at home in playoff games and bring the snow-making machines from the ski slopes to guarantee a snow-covered field.  Alternate Home:  Orange featured more prominently than the grey.  Possibility for all-orange.     Looking forward to the mock-ups from your buddy, and the official announcement as well!   They'll never be, "Royals".  (I like "Admirals")   Swept your team.   Wow, Panthers.     Game plan has to be get around the 50 for a Hail Mary.   Dan Fouts just described the players as, "Culprits".   This is an absurdity pretending to be a football game.   No, they can't do that - Lions have too many downs left.   Why did ATL call a timeout there?  Are they all drunk?   Riddick is a person.   Don't be stupid.  No one does that.  O/   Just think about the particular history that you want to highlight.  Full Game Superbowls exist on youtube, just have strong Google-Fu.  "John Elway's Greatest Comebacks" are also on youtube.  You can find the entirety of "The Drive" and "The Drive II".  You can find Louis Wright returning the 2nd of two blocked FGs against the Chargers.  You can find the 1977 AFC Championship against the Raiders ( IT'S ALL OVER, FATMAN!!!).  Just go on a hunt.  It's all good!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_if_zC44WlI    100% correct.   My girlfriend (now my wife) got me a Von orange during his rookie year (Xmas present).  I wore it as we lost to the Ravens and I fumed while cooking dinner.  I will wear it forever.   drooling sound   My wife and I are waiting to get DT or Julius, once they are signed.  There are very few, "sure things" in football, but one thing that I want to see if DT playing a game with his mom in the stands - and I hope he does it in orange.   They should get a Husky and call it, "Nymeria".  Duh.   Von Miller is a Pan-Dimensional being who has decided to grace us with his boring presence in this singular reality.   Fucking *sickness*.  This southpaw rocks it up with Pot Roast, flips out, and then hugs one out with Miles.  I would have fucking died at that age.  I guess it woulda been Trevor Price (maybe Simon Fletcher) for me.   Nuts.  Good on ya, SouthPaw.   Just to rustle some jimmies:  OJ Simpson still has a bust in Canton.   My Mom and Dad were at that one, leaving me at home to swear and shout at the TV alone (uncommon for a 7th grader).  Get fucked, Belichick!   how is it that I have never heard the term, "Lamestream Media" before now?   I was at that game!!! (I was also at the game where Davis got over 2000, and the game where he went over 1000 at game 7).  Fuck you, Chiefs; fuck you, Seahawks.  TD4EVA!!!   I hope it is earlier than old Floyd Little made it in.  We (the Denver Broncos franchise) could draw real attention to the issue by making damn sure that nobody who dresses in blue and orange ever wears #30 again.  I love David Bruton as much as the next savvy special teams fan (Keith Burns, what up!?!?!), but *come the fuck on*.   YES!  I was not going to respond to my own post (obv).  Glad to see a civilized redditor.  Also, love your mustard bronco guy.  	105
       Oooh Thanku .... 1 more think can i take this as a pet.. ? or not ?   	3
                   x-post: /r/virome                        [Wikipedia: crAssphage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrAssphage)               not *all* day, and not just here. but thanks for the advice                                 ...oh, you'd be surprised! :)                                       yeah, u/microbiomedigest and I are the only two that ever really post to it... and she at like a 10:1 ratio to me ... esp lately...  and *no* one ever comments but... it's steady.  a little repetitive, but I suppose that's how things in that field are going to go for a while?      /r/microbiome   That's not only really cool, but it also makes a lot of sense... But 1km of wire sounds both heavy and like it'd take up a lot of room for something with 'nano' in its title.  I was thinking more a compressed co2 cartridge (like a bb gun) that either slowed it down or pushed it down such that its orbit would begin to decay pretty quickly.  But, hell, the 1km spool of conducting 'nanowire' may end up being able to both take up less room *and* weigh less.  Either way, it's a 'doable' thing if they think to incorporate it                  [Wikipedia: NNT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NNT_(gene))               I agree... but drones are still a great way to get intel.      Definitely on that last part, but they're still a lot cheaper.  Stricter standards on how   when we fire on targets is definitely long overdue.   what's wrong with drones?  they're a helluva lot cheaper than boots on the ground   you can buy it online already.  ...unless you're talking about larger quantities?                                                            'could' being the key word there, I think.             There are 456 million hectares  an area about the size of the European Union  under cultivation in and around the world's cities  y   "We found that 80% of urban croplands occur in low- to middle-income countries," said Anne Thebo of the University of California, Berkeley. "We also found that 60% of urban or peri-urban croplands are irrigated. Urban croplands are twice as likely to be irrigated as their non-urban counterparts."  y   Within cities alone there are about 24 million hectares of land under irrigation, and 44 million hectares that are rain-fed, the researchers found. They also note the prospect of "irrigated urban croplands playing a larger role in more densely populated and/or increasingly water-scarce regions, such as South Asia".    According to Steinfeld et al (2006), livestock takes 70% of all agricultural land and 30% of the planet's land surface.  learn a new statistic everyday                                                                                                                   Terran is launching small satellites that orbit at only 600 kilometers. That lower altitude makes it practical for low-powered, even disposable, sensors to use a satellite data link, says Previte.  that's such a low orbit that all they'd need is a small burst of 'last minute use' to push them into a very quick decaying orbit in such that they'd burn up pretty quickly.   but, again, he's probably right :)                                                                        [Energy storage - new views, part 1](http://blog.environmentalresearchweb.org/2015/03/21/energy-storage-new-ideas-part-1/)  [Energy storage - new views, part 2](http://blog.environmentalresearchweb.org/2015/03/28/energy-storage-new-views-part-2/)                                                                                                                                                        	199
          A shorter commute and a change of scenery could be just what you need to get yourself in a better place mentally. It's worth a try.   It's up to you, obviously. But in my experience, high pressure sales tactics rarely lead to anything good.  Also, seems like a lot of training to be able to sell cars. What are they training you on?   I guess.   But a traditional  hearing aid is just an amplifier. Modern ones can select out certain frequency ranges to amplify, but that's pretty much all they do.  These devices can amplify or muffle certain frequencies or add processing on top of that. These could have come in handy back in the day when I used to go clubbing. The music was always too loud for me and it impeded my ability to chat up pretty girls.    The remake of Big Trouble is probably going to be terrible, because most remakes are pretty terrible. But it's not going to be terrible because The Rock is going to be playing Jack Burton.  Look, most of us who are fans of the movie get the central joke of the film. Jack Burton, the putative hero of the piece, is actually the goofy, comic relief.   So there's some concern that, with Johnson playing the main role, Burton will be a straight ahead action dude, thus ruining the movie.   But Johnson has the talent and the inclination to play silly, goofy roles. He's never been just a straight action hero. Go watch him in Be Cool or The Tooth Fairy. And I think he's smart enough to know what paying this character is going to require from him.         eBay, dude. You can get boxes of random, used Lego for way cheap.   As long as James Hong reprises his role as Lo-Pan, I'm OK with it.      Maybe I'm just old, but manipulating physical objects is still more fun that pointing and clicking them on a computer screen.         I think eventually they will. We'll hit the saturation point and there will be a big retrenchment.   Marvel is set to weather the storm, I think. Most of their movies aren't straight superhero flicks. GOG is a space adventure. Winter soldier was a spy movie. I get the feeling that Ant-Man is going to be a heist movie. Etc.   It would have been better if they thought you were Kevin Matchstick   Yeah, USA Today kinda blows.   Here's a [better article](http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article22753806.html)  Besides 1998, the inaugural year, the only time Thompson has missed the race was in 2013, because shed recently had all but one of her upper teeth removed as a result of an oral cancer that also took her upper jawbone. In 2010, 2011 and 2012, she did it while the disease was eating away at her mouth.         A protein bar? I'm pretty hosed, yeah.      Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.   They raised over one and a half million dollars.   In other words, he did the same thing that every other President with a Social Security surplus has done. That's what you mean, right?   How stupid do you have to be to believe this shit?      Also, as a 1099 contractor, there are things you can deduct from your taxes that you can't as an employee.   For example, keep track of your travel.  As an employee, commuting is on you and you can't write that off. As a contractor, you'll be able to deduct the IRS rate for every mile you drive work work.  Here's a good [1099 primer](https://tryzen99.com/blog_posts/the-7-most-common-1099-tax-mistakes)  If you're going to be doing this long-term, spend a little money and consult with a tax professional. A little money now could save you a lot of money down the road.  Also, as an aside, the IRS has some pretty strict rules about who is allowed to get a 1099 and who must be paid on a W2. If you are treated like an employee and paid with a 1099, the IRS can bring the hammer down on your employer in a big way.   I don't see the point of trying to bullshit about this. The cat's out of the bag. He knows you went on an interview, so he knows you've been looking for a new position.  Come Monday, don't mealy mouth it. Be honest, but respectful. When he asks you what your plans are, turn it around and ask him what his plans are for you.   Tell him you've been working there for a year, for low pay. He just denied you a raise. Yet your position is so vital they you can't even take a sick day. He basically forced your hand.  Don't be a jerk, but don't be weak. Believe in your own value. If he doesn't want you to look for a new position, make him to convince you why you shouldn't. Ask for firm commitments.  Hey, maybe he's an asshole and fires you anyway, either now or in a few months. But you're not going to avoid that with lies and bullshit.  And from now on, keep your mouth shut.   I'd say mid to late 90's is when personal computers became ubiquitous in the office environment. Before than, it was possible to have an office job and not have one on your desktop.   It was around this time my boss gave up the typewriter he'd stashed in the corner of his office.   Most distracting make-up? Is there an award for that? Because a bunch of times during the movie I was like, "What the...who is that? What is that supposed to be?"  If that's the effect they were going for....kudos.                  Yes, Madden used to mention that from time to time when he was calling a Giants game.   The thing is, sometimes you have to be blunt. Some people just refuse to take the hint.   Guys like Steve rely on the fact that most people try to be accommodating and helpful when then can and don't like to give a flat no.   There will probably come a time when you realize that all of your attempts to deflect and redirect Steve just aren't working and you'll have to flat out tell him no. Be prepared for that.  Just remember, no can be a complete sentence. There's no need to explain. No, I can't. No, I won't. I'm sorry, no. No. No. No.  Best of luck to you.   Don't make excuses for people because of their age. Computers have been a mainstream part of office life for nearly two decades. A professional person should have picked up how to make a simple PowerPoint or perform other, basic computer tasks at this point.      Seriously?   Yes. I dated this one girl. She was actually my first. She took my v-card and then dumped me a week later to date one of my friends.  Then, about a year later, she dumped him and started dating me again. We were together for the whole summer. I started a new job in August and she dumped me a couple weeks after that.  She ended up marrying one of my (other) friends and moved with him to live in a trailer park in Montana. That didn't last and they headed back east and split up.    I got married (to someone else) and lost track of her after a while. A couple years back I decided to Google stalk her and found her FB page. We reconnected a bit and had lunch last year when she was in town.    Yes indeed. Well spotted.   Yeah, I watched the Live Leak video with the guitar music and I was all, "Ha ha, what a moron."   Then I followed the link to the news report and read about the five year-old girl dying. Now I feel sick.         Former athlete, NFL QB I think, working for a sports management agency.    If I lived in Texas, I'd buy myself a single-action Colt and walk around with it strapped to my hip like Wyatt Earp.    There are a lot of devices that will play files from your HDD to your TV.  Here's my setup:  1) Synology Diskstation (NAS) with all my video files 2) WD TV Live box connected to my TV  WD TV Live can see all kinds of shares and play just about any kind of file.    Just let it go, dude.   You don't know what was going on with your boss that day. Maybe he was upset that you were leaving. Maybe he was dealing with some other issues and your leaving didn't even cross his mind.  You're done. You may never see this guy again. Why make yourself upset about it?  You've got a brand new PhD, a new job and a the whole future ahead of you like an open road. Embrace it. Good luck.   Are they putting him in the [hacker tank](http://www.thecomicstrips.com/store/add.php?iid=80460 submit=Get+it!)      Too many quick cuts for a real 80's vibe.    Nicely done.    I'm going to give it few episodes and see how it goes.  I love The Rock, so I'm hoping it's just a case of a the trailers trying too hard.   Yeah, I was pretty excited about this when I first heard about it, but the trailers have been underwhelming.          I'd love to see it, but CW is pretty full up already.       The article talks about and links to two different studies by two different research teams that were both published in the May 27 Science Translational Medicine.            I have The Little Mermaid with the "special" cover illustration.   Doesn't look great.   Yes. Yes. An internal investigation has cleared us of all wrongdoing. Why would anyone doubt us. We are the injured party, after all.   None of this is particularly new or exciting. You can look at the career of Roy Lichtenstein, whose most famous works were blatant rip offs of comic book panels.    I'm surprised that The Rock hasn't done more straight-up action movies.                Here some [more info](http://abcnews.go.com/US/hudson-river-kayak-mystery-vincent-viafores-body-idd/story?id=31307061)  prosecutors said last month that Graswald admitted to investigators that she tampered with Viafore's kayak so that it would take on water. Prosecutors said Graswald also told police that she watched Viafore struggle in the Hudson's icy waters for several minutes before he went under.    I think I've seen that one.   You don't need to prove anything to get an indictment. Just reasonable cause to believe.            It's a little disturbing that it takes a Justice Department lawsuit for them to agree to this. It's even more disturbing to realize that, for a lot of police departments, this stuff is perfectly fine.               If you document it properly, you can sue them for it when you leave.   Sadly, some states don't care too much about going after wage theft, but you always have recourse to the courts. Walmart has gotten nailed for this more than once.   	84
 I agree with this. Do not take laxatives. Just watch what you eat. Maybe do some extra running or steady state if you have time.   I just have a few bites of greek yogurt mixed with oats, berries, honey, and chia seeds the night before so everything is nice and soggy. Keeps me from getting hungry during practice even though I eat just a little.    My coaches always say the sleep you get the night before a 2k is just as important as the sleep you get two nights before a 2k, so try to get a good amount of sleep both nights before your test. Good luck!   Thank you very much!  	4

 After 9/11 U.S. Fire Administrator David Paulison described a list of useful items in case of a chemical, biological or radiological terror attack. In his advisory Paulison recommended plastic sheeting and duct tape to seal the windows. To me this sounds like a ludicrous suggestion. How effective would plastic and duct tape be against a  chemical or biological attack?  	1

 Usually someone will take the podcast and host it somewhere else. so the plug is usually for those cases   you're a live saver   thing is I'm not from the UK so it's hard either way. Thanks tho    bah both stream are not working for me :/   Zandvort  Sepang  Bahrain  Abu Dhabi  Macau   Legit Shoot WWE2K match where the match are legit, but wrestlers are playing on the XBOne instead of in the ring using their own characters   Hitbox.tv and Gaminglive.tv are honestly better and faster than twitch. But yeah, once you found out how to use Youtube, you would never want to go back    - More CDN across countries, like for me in Asia, this is waaay smoother than Twitch - Silky smooth Google connections - Everyone has a youtube app on their phone, you don't need to install a third party app to view it - Monetization.  - All of your streams are archived, and encoded by Youtube automatically  There are a few kinks (I feel that they could make this easier for game streamers, right now it's targeted for people who are doing things like concert and such) but IMO once you get the hang of it, it's miles better than twitch   Twitch has too much traffic streaming along it's stream, hence for people like me that lives in far flung regions (I live in Asia) it induces stutters and lags.   Some people solves that using Ghostery but I rather use Youtube right now   I love Matt Striker's "This moment has just become an instant classic"  tho.       I just realised your edit. Sorry mang :/      You mean Broadcasting? The built in broadcasting is good if you're only streaming to one or two people. For more people, it would be better to use an ingest server in between so you're not wasting your bandwith   You can embed it without the chat on your site, and use your own chat box like from chatango or a JS IRC box      Oh god, you reminded me of an online race I had on rFactor years ago at Valencia. penalties and start accident meant I was 15s behind 3rd place, and after the last pitstop I was catching him lap by lap. I was so in the zone and like in a trance. And my roommate had to tap me on the shoulder and ruin it all :/   Audio out of sync?      She meant "Perfect"   The new ones are made from painted wood I think.    Rumours are he's turning heel this Sunday.  But honestly, I am so hyped about the matches that I did not even care he's included or not in the first place. He was not in the Raw after Payback (with Randy) and was blended into the background as Ambrose and Rollins take the spotlight for the last two weeks, and it kinda worked.    That guitar riff at the start always reminds me of Benoit's entry riff.    Malaysian here  Our flag is not based on the American flag, it's based on the  East India Company flag.     Convert them to MP4 first   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcKnA8j2vuI  I'll mark out if this theme hits   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnQjSZWI_84   LU is a Telenova with wrestling in it. Completely different from WWE which is wrestling with drama in it.  There is no suspension of reality, since, well, you know it's a telenova. so just sit back and enjoy the ride.  But if you enjoy kayfabe that is spliced with real life, then it maybe hard to get into LU    For an easier comparison, this is like Wrestlemania 3. Everybody WANTS to see Andre vs Hogan, but Savage and Steamboat stole the show   Maybe the shorter time for editing? Smackdown for me looks like it uses the "Live" style of RAW, where they just edit the show as it goes. Make sense as they need to send the tapes to international market a day after it's taped   There were only three times that the German anthem were not played last year. Guess when that was   FIA/FOM has the feed for all the cars during the race. I'm sure something as controversial as this would have been released by the FIA/FOM to help gather more viewers to F1   And he has to handle   1 - Singapore Media  2 - Malaysian Media (X2 one on one)  3 - Regional (South East Asia) Media  Each would need a special answer and know how for their culture and WWE's individual reach in that country, so Dolph needs to be briefed about that first. Totally more hectic than the schedule makes out      I've seen lower effort post but meh.   Was just pointing out she looks different now. Still good looking tho. Like Madusa   she has seen better days      http://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/36m0uh/hideo_itamis_first_nxt_shirt_and_it_was_probably/crf9r4e  I pointed this out a week ago :/   Omg Cena will kill Steen in this Sunday       Him with Mr T training for the first Wrestlemania?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkcGhAh9TCQ  Suddenly Gundam Unicorn soundtrack   Good event. But quite a few large fuck ups that could be attribute to the language barrier. The ending for Team AAA vs ROH/LU for example was a clusterfuck.   He cleaned his act after his incident and Liz's death. Now he's teaching the newer superstars of how dangerous drugs are      takayama reminds of of Big Khali. Plodding and nothing much selling   http://powerrangers.wikia.com/wiki/Shuriken_Sentai_Ninninger  Nah, Ninja Ranger is the latest one      Congrats Jaz!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t79gSPuZLJ0   Thank god nobody is hurt. that was an almighty crash   As a Malaysian, heh thank you commentator's curse   Thanks. A bit sluggish but works. Better than nothing I suppose   Cricfree always give me a Server Not Found error :/   Not coverage. Commentary   They need to drop Yukes! honestly   He has a limited time to do his notebook feature.    F1 broadcasters that elect to use English commentary are provided with SkyF1's commentary by the FOM, except for USA which does their own broadcast      I think a Reigns heel turn would be much more interesting. The crowd is still 50/50 on Reigns, and he's not Cena who is the appointed Superman and won't turn heel.  Heck, he might turn out to be as charismatic as the Rock given a heel turn.    Big Van Vader is one and he has an illustrious career as a heavy wrestler that moves like a lightweight.   WWE sometimes acknowledge ROH on TV, but it's rare. This is usually in return for ROH letting WWE using their footage for documentary and such  Interestingly they acknowledge the  IWGP belt that Lesnar won, so they kinda acknowledge NJPW in general   https://www.facebook.com/25562491499/photos/a.10152864677326500.1073741884.25562491499/10152864679466500/?type=3 src=https%3A%2F%2Ffbcdn-sphotos-d-a.akamaihd.net%2Fhphotos-ak-xtp1%2Fv%2Ft1.0-9%2F10996952_10152864679466500_3623248077262191878_n.jpg%3Foh%3D428e69fe2b6da5ab1eb236e933de57db%26oe%3D55F69D5C%26__gda__%3D1443679897_98467fb9c8027ef4c08e3888be8e4d21 size=960%2C640 fbid=10152864679466500  The photographer must be an art student   Actually NXT is the sum of a lof of contributers. Never pin down NXT's success or growth to one man, because it's not. And I don't think anyone down in NXT would want to either  HHH, Regal, Dusty, Terry Taylor, Norman Smiley, Steve Keirn, Gerald Brisco, Del ray, and a lot more contributed to the growth and the high quality product that we are seeing today.    Leva was not even wrestling under any names. She was supposedly a no name jobber to Carmella. Ironically she was the one that caught people's eye   For any South East Asian? Rice. We ate rice for breakfast, lunch and dinner, and some students who were sent overseas even went sick when they can't find rice to cook there  The reason we are not sick of rice is because it can easily be eaten with anything. Fried meat, gravy, veggies, heck if you're out of money even soy sauce would do   Depending on the tracks IMO. The first corner for watkin glens for example can be taken on it's entirety off track without penalty. so some corners are more strict than others  One thing for sure tho, Spa and Bathurst have bugs where if you pit, you will be given a penalty when exiting the pit lane which makes no sense as the car is auto controlled by the game   EC3 and the dancer formerly known as Brodus Clay walked under a disco ball in a segment poking fun of his WWE run   Josh is saying the only reason people know who Samoa Joe is, is due to TNA, which is true, somewhat.   But the way he makes it sound is like he's bitter.      Huh? I used the combo of both and never have to do this. Windows detected them as two separate controllers as well as P Cars. Calibration works fine.   1080p @120Hz  GTX970 SLi with default settings. Usually I'll get 100++FPS which is good enough for that smooth effect I guess.    My G25 was the first generation G25 and the first one to be brought in Malaysia by a friend of mine. He already had it 3 years before selling it to me and it's still working til today.    P Cars has shitty DRS animation. I had mine opening mid corner for some reason even tho it's off   They harvest energy under heavy braking. That is why even now there are times when a car goes for a fast lap with Kers, do a fast lap without to recharge and do another one with Kers again   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1mQ9Im-EbI  Without the overdone motion blur   Depends. A little traction control would help the car going out of a slow corner  Interestingly I think it was the first year of "legal" traction control where Hakkinen turned his off and immediately took pole in Spain.   Tradition. Just like the Dutch TT's Moto GP race is on Saturday instead of Sunday.  Ironically the GP2 have their race on Fridays   For me :  Petronas  Marlboro  Mild Seven  West  Microsoft   I now wish that they would get Angelico to NXT, and have him in a match with Joe. Angelico would climb on top of the rafters and fly and Joe would nonchalantly swat him away   I honestly thought butcher was going to die in that match.      When combined with the TV equipment/HD/pyro. They do run house shows there still   Too many limes!   She also should wear something purple but that's just a minor thing.  She could easily get anything she wants, considering the new WWE seamstress (?) is her fiance   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKmEpRDPWBE feature=youtu.be  The best I could do for now is a 1:20. Lot more time to be found tho. I still yet to soften the suspension  and increase diff lock.  But the hardest thing is in real life, Monaco is lapped with a super soft tyre. PCars only has one tyre compound and it's suited for every circuit so that means it's harder than what  you would use in real life, hence slower   god. Will be a while to wait til December :/   I used Sony before, the A300 and the A55. What i usually do is focus on the track where the car will be going and start to prefocus there  http://i.imgur.com/3VcHpUJ.jpg (A55 + 50mm)   Use a VPN and buy a subscription from Now TV? http://www.nowtv.com/   This happened with Hamilton at Sepang last year. He pitted in the lead and Hulkenberg inherited the lead, but Hulkenberg pitted before he completed that lap, so Hamilton was still considered to be the leader for that lap and got the Grand Chelem   It was banned before the race. But people forgot that it was not only McLaren but also other teams like Jordan were using the same thing. Only McLaren was caught.  Ron Dennis was so smug when the team easily won without the system  I'll try upload the 1998 season review if you want to know more   True. Not to mention they would also get TNA's library, that includes the TNA-NWA years, as well as Christian's first world champ reign   I... I.. don't even know who they are, let alone hating them. I think I'm worse than you   MMM WHATCHA SAAAY~~   Not this week. There were two people missing that people didn't even notice   http://tfwiki.net/wiki/Mirage_%28G1%29   1 - Pan and follow the cars  2 - Set the focus to AI Focusing (Canon) or Auto (Sony)  3 - Burst mode  4 - Hope that 1 in 10 of your burst image is not blurry  Examples:  http://i.imgur.com/yBmK97F.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/GohWBNc.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/nSX78PV.jpg   MOTHERFUCKING Owens came out in The Champ is Here shirt. That was a so awesome heel move that I clapped   TNA Friday Nights on the WWE Network!   Kayfabe wise, true. but in reality Sami is far from healed, and he needs a storyline rest. They already lost Hideo so they can't lost him in the main event, especially after weeks of anticipation. EVERYONE wanted to see this main event. And WWE gave it. I have no complaint   The ending makes sense non-Kayfabe wise  Sami is certainly still working injured. He needs a longer off time and in the meantime, they need another top level face since Hideo is also out for 8 to 6 months. They have already plans for Uhaa to debut slowly, so why not get one of the most hottest property right now to debut and take over Zayn/Hideo's role?  This is awesome   Might be like KENTA when he first came. They changed the name later   I just realised that WWE uses a different Kanji for Hideo. Hideo uses  (Eiyu - Hero) as his twitter handle. WWE uses  instead for the shirt   I'd be more happier if they keep the DRS as in real life, AKA there are sections and special event before you can trigger the DRS. Makes no sense when everyone can use DRS on every straight as it takes out the real use of DRS  Also does anybody notice the animation for DRS is wonky? Some cars have DRS open mid corners, while at Catalunya the animation does not work at all, showing the DRS is open permanently   The 458 Italia is actually recognised in windows as an XboX 360 Controller. Try plugging it in a friend's PC and see if that works?  Also check out Devices and Printers   Monza, Le Mans and Nordchleife has long straights. Just need to have a good exit at the corner beforehand to reach maximum speed   Took me a while after RAW finished to realised neither were there.    Thank you! They should have made it more clear tho :/   Was wondering if this can be done. Currently when you create a pit strategy you MUST take in fuel. This means for short sprint races where you just want to fix something and change tyres, waiting for fuel makes no sense.   Force feedback is broken, and now it feels twitchy and oversteery   They have an agreement with Full Sail to teach students using NXT about TV production. So the once a month taping at Full Sail is there to stay   won't be that bad. Remember, NXT tapes a month of matches in advance   clicked on the ippv page but its in spanish. on my phone now but how much would the ippv cost?   Hamilton should have been a winger  Weird that he does not join this after his Arsenal vs Sky match   Kinda He thought i hit him from behind so i told him to save the replay   We both underestimated that corner. talking to him after the race, he thought I was behind, and not beside him, hence the door closing quickly.    Yes.       Combined pedals means that the game detect your pedal and brakes as one X axis controller, with the fuel +X and the brakes -X.  This means that you can't really press them both at the same time as only one is detected. This is actually a patch for old games that can't detect fuel and brakes as separate controls   Considering that 230ish = 370KM/h which F1 cars could only acheive at Monza but rarely, I'm amazed they are complaining the cars are still slow   http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/michaelschumacher_ferrari_spafrancorchamps_1996.jpg  They did circa 95/96, but the side impact rule + HANS + Front nose being made not to ride up the side of the car in a T Bone collision + drivers complaining they can't see when a car is beside them has the head rest lowered.    http://network.wwe.com/video/v31367867   Legend of Wrestling - NWO  Have a watch. Featuring JJ Dillon, Kevin Nash, Hayes (urgh) and JR. Basically it was Dillon and Nash talking about 80% of what posted up there with Hayes trying to bury everyone and JR trying his best to not let Hayes do that  Also this is where Nash admitted that NWO was a rehash from New Japan Puro Resu  http://network.wwe.com/video/v31364197  NWO: The Revolution  An expanded version of the Legend of Wrestling NWO show, with more interview by Nash as well as former NWO members, and two sons of former NWO members, Cody Rhodes (Dusty) and Axelmania (Curt Hennig)   Change your STEAM name to whatever and just change it back to your real name when you race in your league?   http://s1.tsuki-board.net/pics/figure/large/167204.jpg?r=1386175911   Bathurst too  has this pit exit bug   If you notice that McLaren has a grudge on me since the first corner up to the hairpin where he took me out    No worries man. I actually find this funny. If you see what I was doing was holding back and still I got spun out       Started following F1 when it was held in Malaysia in 99. While technically the internet exist, it's still in it's infancy and you have to go to a cybercafe to use it, which is costly to me.   Thankfully every Sunday there is a cars special slip out section in our newspapers, and Mobil One sponsors a 10 page F1 spreadout in  it. So I collected that. And since Mobil One sponsors McLaren, it also has special features on Mika and DC  I remember watching races delayed, and I would turn off all radio and TV news before watching them.    The noise in your image shows that   1 - Auto ISO bumped to max  2 - Rather slow shutter speed  3 - WWE does the opposite for their broadcast  It's not that bright, but it's not as dark as what WWE is showing in TV either.    Wary, unless you mean you always need to be tired and sluggish around him   PC only tho :/   The control mapping option was created with the PC in mind (remember, it was supposed to be a PC only game) which with the keyboard, you have a lot of keys to assign these functions to.   Sadly you need to sacrifice some other functions if you are using a controller, unless it allows it to be mapped to a connected keyboard?   I am in Asia but I changed my region to either London or Manchester. Lots of Europeans. Note that weekends would be full of new drivers that might be too aggressive in defending   Cockpit. Also remember, you could adjust your seat if you feel that the view is too high/low   or maybe his mom or wife messaged him. There is a whole lot of reason for a person to not ignore a message   The Authority will be around at least until the next WM where likely Rock and Rousey puts an end to them. so yeah, happy days are here again   I'm convinced that's Kimi doing commentary   Also by editing the configuration files you can even race with the safety car. Awesome stuffs   A lot of games have the same game/physics engine by ISI. rFactor, rFactor 2, GTR, GTR2, the Brazillian based Stock Car Extreme and even NFS Shift 1 and NFS Shift 2.  	139
 Haha, I thought the same but no, they just also happen to be dwarves, I believe.    Haha, yeah I feel like they made a lot of similar calls like that in the movie :)   [Like this, perhaps?](http://youtu.be/jItz-uNjoZA)   **He put music boxes inside their rib cages.**    [NOPE](http://gifsforum.com/images/gif/disgusted/grand/vomit.gif)   Cool! I love painting cats! Yellow eyes or green eyes?   I'm so sorry to hear about your friend and his nephew! I can't help with money becaus I, too am in a rut but i'm happy to write a letter to the family with my sympathies, though! I hope you're okay, too- I'm sorry you're all going through this :(   Thank you SO much! Is there anything I can do for you??   Thank you! Is there anything I can make for you???   Thank you! You are very sweet :')   Thank you so much! What would you like created for you? Literally anything you want!   That's more than I could ever expect! Do you want any art or a thank you note with a sketch?   Thank you so much! That's more than I could ever expect from a generous stranger! Do you want a drawing or a thankyou note?   It's everydayshea at gmail dot com... It's vaguely mentioned on one of my screencaps. Sorry I didn't make it clear :-/   Thank you so much! Everyone's been so kind and I've already teared up so many times today. You're awesome; your kind words mean so much to me. 3   That sounds amazing! Let's do it :)   Sure, let's do it!   Perfect. What days work for you, usually? I'm out of work at the very least until thursday still.. maybe longer so I have time besides the odd favors I'll do for friends in order to keep myself from going crazy or in exchange for a meal. I like cooking lots of things so you tell me whatever your favorite dish is and I'm happy to cook it! Feel free to PM me any time whenever you know what days work for you. 3   Thank you so much! Is there anything I can do for you in terms or art/a letter/a sketch??? I will definitely pay it forward. The funny thing is I try to do RAoK's as often as possible in hopes that good karma will be infectious to others. I can't thank you enough. :')   That's very sweet of you! How about I cook for you if you pick up the ingredients? :)   Oh gosh, I didn't realize... Fixed. Thank you! What can I do for you???   I do not... I'm actually asking reddit because I'm too ashamed to let my colleagues and my boyfriend know I need help. It's a psychological crutch; I was abused growing up and made to feel like I didn't deserve anyone's help and that it's shameful to admit you need it. I don't know why, but auctioning my art to strangers feels so much emotionally safer. I have a paypal account, but I don't even know how to set up a gofundme... Maybe I'm just being pathetic. I also unloaded a LOT of info on my thread and I don't want to inundate anyone any more than I already have...   Thank you so much for your kind words, though. I've been struggling for months and now with the health issues, it's all kind of bubbled over.    I just made one. I don't want to seem greedy so these are the most important things I could think of to help me get by...   [http://amzn.com/w/1H1YLKSDB4QL9](http://amzn.com/w/1H1YLKSDB4QL9)   I do not, but I can make a new one! That one was on paper but I can do it on a clay aquaboard for better presentation if you want... Or I can do paper and frame it in a goodwill frame for you.   The trees with the stars are sold but I can make another similar yet different one. I can attempt nautical stuff... I love drawing sperm whales, squids, octopus, nautulus, etc... I will PM you.   No... I don't really need stuff. Cat food and litter, I guess, or winter shoes but I can figure out how to make one. I guess new paints so I can keep selling art wouldn't hurt but I don't want to be greedy. I'm not used to asking for help.   Aww I love cavaliers! Poor little thing, she looks so sad! Hope she heals up quickly 3   I can give you the bird; that one I still have! I stupidly cleaned off the spilling because I was being hard on myself and ended up making it have an orange background.. You are welcome to have it anyway, though. Other than that I can make you a cat if you'd prefer! I gifted the fat cat to an old room mate for holding onto a sentimental piece of furniture that I sold years back but I love drawing cats and am always happy to do more :)   We can meet up but I will probably be an embarrassed lump of sorry's and thank-you's and tears. When I'm confident I'm a good conversationalist and friend but when I'm embarrassed and mad at myself I can be a little pathetic. I'd love to meet a new friend, even if it means getting out of the house for a walk and cat food... I guess I just didn't expect anyone to respond. I'll pm you... You are a sweetheart.   Also, what is your favorite animal? If we do meet up it want to have something for you...    How flexible are your hours? You can always try volunteering on an organic farm in exchange for a free place to stay and three meals... The only thing is it depends on whether you can handle it. Most farms ask for 5 days/5 hour commitment... You can check out WOOFING (worldwide opportunities on organic farms) to see what might work for you! Otherwise, couchsurfing or air bnb may be good starts... Good luck :)   I don't even know how to ask for it. I made this at 4am. I guess the most important thing I honestly need is cat food and cat litter right now. I'm more worried about taking care of him than myself. I still have some ramen packets I can get by on for a bit. Gosh I'm embarrassed.   This made me cry. We need more kindhearted, patient people in this world. Even just making eye contact and smiling at your bus driver or a passerby might make their day even an iota brighter.    This breaks my heart :(   OP you should have joined him...   Well good luck! I am a terrible night owl and I used to work at a coffee shop at 5am; sometimes I wouldn't go to bed until 2am only to wakeup at 4... Woof. Do you work at a grocery store or something?   Thank you so much! Do you have a favorite animal?    Also, thank you for all the hard work you do. I hated my social worker when I was a ward of the state, but I recognize how overworked and under appreciated social workers are. Thank you for even choosing/attempting that career path. Try not to burn out; you may change someone's life more profoundly than they care to admit.   Voted. Good luck!!   **Edit:** I feel like I've received enough kindness from the wonderful users of reddit to close this.

People felt "betrayed" by the beloved Unidan.   Jeez, 10 is a LOT when tipping isn't a common practice, too!

I work at a bar as a cocktail waitress and one thing I absolutely **hate** is when coworkers complain about their tables/tips/etc... You have *one job* and you can't at least keep a good attitude?

 I misread this as "*James* in the waiting room" and got really confused lol. Clean pair though!

Thanks though man   I am 100% sure it was Wii and equally sure it was *not* Castle Crashers, as I said the game was First Person. Thanks though!   Nada. Thanks though!   No, not this either. Thanks!   it was a First Person game. Thanks though!   December 21^st , 20*15*?   No, not that. It was like an actual *game*, with a story and a goal I think. I just know it wasn't Medieval Games. Thanks though   I remember playing this game around 5 or 6 years ago or so. It was a medieval-ish cartoon looking game. **First person**, you went around slashing people and stuff like that.

But in terms of *individual shoes*, I think that the 5 lows from the "Dunk From Above" pack is the best colourway. The contrast in the White/Navy combination with the hints of gold really sell it for me.  What are your opinions?   The "downvote" key is for something that doesn't contribute to the conversation at hand.

 IMHO Riker's today is much worse than the Alcatraz of yesterday.   Just the nonchalance with which the aunty in the first coach gets off.   Cool story - knew it before hand. But I hate that asshole Horus. He is a religious extremist and a fanatic, and is directly responsible for most of the filth on defence.pk   I call it the House MD syndrome. If you are smart/succesful your asshole nature will be tolerated.  At the end of the day, people tolerate that simply because the asshole is the most productive guy or is the chief rainmaker. That perch however is very unstable - case in point - Jobs himself was once fired from Apple.   The solution is to reform archaic labor laws. India remains 138 in the ease of doing business rank. Have you ever tried opening a startup in India, and seen the paperwork involved?  Saner labor laws will create more valued startups - internet dependent companies who can push back against the Mittals and the Ambanis. And finally, the GOI has to invest in fiber optic infrastructure. Even in the US of A, the big ISPs do not care about internet infrastructure, and in fact bribe Republican legislatures to purposefully stymie improvement.  Superfast internet, like that in Chattanooga, TN is municipal broadband, built by taxpayer money, in the understanding that there exists a critical mass of startups that will be attracted and will help pay for the infrastructure investment.  Another critical aspect in India is net neutrality. Nobody gives a shit whether you, as a lone consumer care about net neutrality. You have no *aukaad*. And this is not India specific, but is present in USA too. FCC was able to enforce net neutrality, because Obama had their back, who gets big donations from Silicon Valley. And even then, the Republican Party is trying tooth and nail to repeal it - including defunding the FCC. Do you think net neutrality happened in USA because the consumers demanded it? Dream on. It happened because there are internet dependent companies whose valuations rival, and exceed AT T and Comcast, and who can outlobby the ISPs.   You need a critical liberal sanctuary. One of the oft-criticized aspect about US politics is that how much liberalism/conservatism differs from state to state. As an Indian who grew up in India, and who has been in the USA for quite some time now - this similar blue/red divides do not exist as much in India. Sure, UP, Bihar and Haryana are uber retrogressive, but really liberal states do not exist in India. Bengal was once such a state, but decades of misrule has significantly hardened the population there.   The most obvious pathway is for one state to first legalize it. To be India's Massachusetts and Hawaii. My bet is that it will be one of the Northeastern states. The answer is probably Tripura, or Sikkim. They are liberal, but are not majority Christian so that there will not be significant Church pushback. This will happen in 2018. For a few years after that, the Supreme Court will punt on the issue, while entitled morons will harass NE people in Delhi as *gay ch####*.  There will be blowback to that in the form of renewed secessionist action (not so much for Sikkim, definitely for Tripura.)   In 2024, we have now a critical choice ahead of us. The GOI may act really foolishly by redoubling its Army efforts, or use its brain once and try confronting the inherent racism in Indians. If it follows the second mature route - things may calm down, and you may see movies coming that focus on LGBT rights, around 2025 onwards.  The first few ones will definitely be offensive, but at least they will start a conversation. And we need the first few ones to be a bit offensive and to play for the gallery for cheap laughs. Because remember, if the movie is too progressive for its own good some moron will file a vulgarity complaint against the movie for crap like corrupting morals and such - and some jobless judge will hear that case. And obviously this is India, there will be no shortage of paid trolls to burn down a theater or two. Remember, college kids will always torrent the movie and will watch and appreciate it - but that's not the point. We want aunties and uncles to watch it, and the conversation to be planted there.  Then may come some better movies around 2028 along with a patronizing Satyamev Jayate episode and a cheeky Amul ad. Some High Courts will move towards legalization, notably West Bengal (assuming Mamata loses), and Delhi (assuming AAP stays) and Goa. The Supreme Court will still punt, while both BJP and Congress will pass the ball along.  Around 2030, a critical mass of states will vote yes, and around 2031 the case will reach Supreme Court. Of course Haryana, UP, Bihar and the Mahakhap Panchayat is still vehemently opposed. Then, on 17th December 2032, as /u/prawn_account stated the Supreme Court will legalize it - narrowly, briefly achieving complete and unanimous religious solidarity in India.    The fight then begins.   You just described my grad school experience till now. I have now cut back on quite a few projects, and am better at doing a cost-benefit analysis. And oh yes, I now understand fully my advisers' saying, "If your work does not lead directly to a publication, don't do it."   Going on in Kansas too as we speak.   Do you do this for free, or get paid for this?   Link please?   That's all *chunauti jumla*.   Do you have any contact with sympathetic professors in your old grad school? A recommendation explaining the situation from their side would do wonders.   And people are already successfully growing [TMDs on graphene](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsnano.5b01677).

 You have a completely valid point. But a good reason not to write God off is that it can be comforting to think that maybe there's more to life than what we immediately realise. Even if it's a lie that I tell myself, it's a harmless lie that only serves to make me happier. I understand that this is illogical and understand why many people can't make the same decision I have, but it works for me.   So I haven't switched to the complete polar opposite view, but I used to completely write off the existence of a God. Now I feel more agnostic about things - maybe there is a God, we have no idea what forms, limitations and capabilities a God could potentially have.   Not getting wound up by the little things. Annoyed at that customer who moaned at you? Fair enough, but don't let them colour your mood for the rest of the day.   Schoolgirls   I think Americans do this as sport.   If that is genuinely the case, then great. But that's a very easy thing to kid yourself into believing whilst you're in a relationship, after breaking up you often get a whole new perspective.    Well wait a second there, selfless and loving is a great thing and all, but letting yourself be walked all over most definitely is not. Not everyone is worthy of unconditional positive regard and a cheater certainly isn't.    I joined Toastmasters (a public speaking club). When someone stands up to talk in front of a room of people I feel it's like putting magnifying glass up to their social skills - you quickly learn what you need to improve on. For me it was eye contact, improving this has made a huge difference for me!   Condoms. They last for years anyway and it turns out my personality is much more effective.   Once you read the mindset of some of the guys on that sub you can see they've gone too far. Instead of excessive masturbation, they end up defining their life by non-masturbation and letting it affect everything they do.   If Curiosity was being covertly observed by martians they would have lost their shit when this happened. Hundreds of scientific papers would be published attempting to explain this lonely tune, which is ultimately meaningless.  Maybe the "wow" signal was just some alien celebrating his birthday.   I can't comment on the scientific side of this, but anecdotally I have been in an almost identical situation before. I found it much easier to gain the muscle back, but a lot of that came from the belief that I could achieve my goal as I had done so once before.   These ducks are on my uni campus and look so cool. Unfortunately the image is shopped so the real ones will just look disappointing to you now.   Oh God that reminds me of myspace profiles so much. "I'm so random LOL deal with it!!!!1!11!!"   Hey Joe   This isn't a life pro tip but rather a "You're being an idiot and don't realise it". Unfortunately it's one of those things that way too many people do.  	16
