 I could have sworn I read somewhere that Montana had a highway with no speed limit.   Apart from being a horror (several people think it is along the lines of Human centipede), it was poorly marketed. I saw zero trailers/standees/posters for it and I work at a major theatre chain. In fact they added the trailers a week before it came out. On top of that it has poor distribution. Many times I read on here that it is just too far away for people to go see, especially with less than spectacular reviews.  All in all almost no one I work with had heard of the movie release weekend and the ones that did are the ones that, like me, live on the internet.     Its ok. I read dick quack too.   I used to have the DK Mode version of this picture :3   And?   I enjoyed episode one and have downloaded episode two, but have yet to start it.    Has there ever been a black Hawkman?   I really liked Spaceman. The whole trade is like 9 issues and was an interesting story.   Actually, I didnt play any version of this game until after high school. Twice I played "Never have I ever." first time I won due to being a virgin, by the second time I played I had lost it and was the first one out.   Has anyone here gone to a Lykke Li concert for her I Never Learn Tour? I thought it was pretty dope she used a couple Yeezy samples. Both from Send it Up. On sound check they kept using "We can send this bitch up, it can't go down" and then during the actual performance she used the beginning sounds from it.    Try finding one **in** your foreskin *shudder*   Well there is one way to find out. . .   Hulk and a coupme months between issues 4 and 5 being released I think. This is my first Hulk series and the premise is pretty cool.   Yes with a minor change.   I'd get a part time somewhere at a national Chain and see about transferring to Chicago. Most jobs seem to start off at minimum wage and the headstart on long journey on wage increases.   Was wondering if the new Godhead event is going to make the next Infinity Man and the Forever People issues 'unreadable', meaning I'll have to get the Latern issues in order to not be 100% lost. I don't really read Latern books (yet) and have so many other books on my pull list that I probably can't afford to get the whole Event's collection.   Linked to the failed breaker that was 6 seconds before o.0   Yea don't see it available in USA :/   Mmhm...mmhm...I know some of these names /Kel   "I don't ever think about death / It's alright if you do, it's fine"     (Texas)   I think Vertigo's Spaceman would be tricky, but very rewarding if done right as a movie.   Probably need to select credit option next time before tapping.   They are making a Klarion ongoing that comes out in October, but I do agree we need more Dark (in addition to Edge) comics.   I wouldn't say NBC has the whole dark universe. They just announced FOX buying a Lucifer Pilot.   I would love to do reviews as I just started reading comics this year(after buying a good number from Google Play's 4$ sale), but I don't feel I am very articulate on top of the fact I don't pay any attention to writers/artists/etc...just the Characters involved and if they interest me at all. If any one has tips/guides on how to review I wouldn't mind contributing.   Or Absinthe and Grape Soda.   I was mixing Root Beer Liquer with Jaegermeister. Still wonderful.   Grape Soda and Absinthe. I kid you not.   I actually forgot Google Wallet had that feature. I mostly use the Google Card as a prepay. It seems, from various google pages, that the server would just write down the Gift Card number on your receipt and type it in themselves on their POS terminal. Any restaurant that has tap to pay would have it readily advertised, and off the top of my head can't think of a chain that isnt fast food that has that option.   implying every sperm isn't sacred.   The Dream of Cats is best Dream King.     The whole premise of the story is that the JL has been resurrected. .   It was definitly the edition you read.   Considering she has an oscar, I do believe she gets paid to act.   I lost my virginity.   Or his virgin lenses on. . .   I recommend it, especially if you enjoyed Sandman. I've only read Book One, but have Book Two on the shelf waiting for me to catch up on my queue.  I particularly liked his interactions with various other Angels and Deities of rival underworlds. His reputation of being cunning/deceiving/one step ahead is definitly not played down.   Batman Eternal weekly has been rather enjoyable. It is about 1/3 rd over I believe   So is this Swamp Thing-esque hulk gonna be a thing now?   I'm wondering how the Valiant Masters from the 15$ option fit into it all also.   I like how I started at the bottom of your list with Rai #1 ╮(╯▽╰)╭   I am loving the fact most(All?) Marvel books cost the same or more than DC's 3D covers this month.   I wanna read a Graphic novel adaption of it now.   Just a flashback sequence. Nothing rather explicit.   Not a lot of torture by any means.   I started a sinister laugh when he was revealed in he movie.   People who feel entitled to piss on the seat/floor/wall/toilet paper just because 1/5th of our urinals are Out of Order.  Also the other managers not making sure the night Janitors are fully stocked on supplies before they clock out for the night.   I quit listening to game music back in my GBA days. Nothing is more annoying to me now. Even games with awesome soundtracks, one play and I just cant stand to hear it any more.   My main LCS had a closing clearance where they had their entire stock at 50% for cash. I got from them Gaiman's Black Orchid, New 52 Flash vol. 1, HC Batman: Earth One (can't wait for next May to continue it), a Venom Might Paper Wallet, New 52 Redhood and the Outlaws vol. 4, and Larfleeze Vol. 1. I would have got some various Green Latern trades but I was between paydays and short on cash.  At my new main LCS I found a Mint New 52 Static Shock for retail price, which is a steal compared to Amazon and considering getting their other copy as an investment.   Shoot over to Instocktrades and you could add a couple more.   I've been eyeing it on my LCS shelf, but didnt want to jump in so far along. This bundle let me catch up for way cheaper.   I think I busted in her during round one a little bit, before pull out. But during round two and three I pulled out fast enough....I think. Don't judge me it was my first time and no babies 16 months later.  I saved a near-nude pic my college roommate's girlfriend had on Facebook for no longer than a minute at like 5 in the morning. No I wasnt just going through her page. It just showed up on the frontpage, of course I saved it, but then a minute later, as I was contemplating hitting Like, it was gone. Right place at the right time I guess.    My old WoW guild had a rule for no Levitation during raids. I once botched a boss pull because the secondary tank was Levitated by me and couldn't charge in, because I did it last second :3  At my job we have to check the first aid kit daily, because I didn't realize a cream was expired and lost several % points on an Audit.    I mean...that wasnt that bad...from the tits down that is. . .   I just hope they build on what is hinted about Dr. Fate in the Future's End weekly.   The Future's End for JLD is next week, as for the actual story, I've only kept up with the first three traded, but immensly enjoyed it.   I still need to read it, Thursday was payday and had to work most of it.   I would choose The Sandman: Dream County trade. I know it isn't one story/arc, but four short stories, including my single favorite ""A Dream of a Thousand Cats." (Only single issue that has ever made me actually cry) I feel it really shows how great Gaiman is. Not to mention "A Midsummer Night's Dream" being the only Comic to win a World Fantasy Award.   I like to think the Humble Book Bundles had a hand in getting people to start picking up Trades. I know that is why I keep up with Saga, Lazarus, and East of West. Ever since the Image Bundle I've been hooked on those.   Shoot just now bought the Valiant Bundle, and if everything seems good, I'll be picking trades from them.   First Kanye featured with Lykke Li and Santigold on N.A.S.A 's Gifted, now Kanye with Lorde might happen. I can die happy once this happens.   And didn't Lorde say that Kanye was someone she admires/inspired by, or something like that?   One can hope.   There is also the fact that hearing something live at the concert can be drastically different than a live concert recording.   Actually there are one or two additional tracks in addition to the Love Club EP on the Pure Heroine Extended. . .one of which is missing from the Google Play Store version.   If two or more devices cannot stream netflix, while another watches youtube, then it is deemed unliveable.    I guess rating more things that you do like might help.   Someone tell that to ATT, who charge me $40 for 1.5 mbps, which is the fastest possible apparently.   I wouldnt mind hopping back into runescape if this comes to bd.   Maybe we dont know that yet. He is still gone and apparently is not even aware of this.     I can only imagine the reactions from the more conservative part of america....  It would be cool if they did the storyline of Morpheus cutting off his wings and his search for them later...perhaps linking up with Joseph Gordon-Levit's Sandman movie.   Acension is a good one.   Go bar hopping, with UBER as your DD.   Sword of Scorcery Vol. 1    Yea....didn't Super Saiyan God just get added to  DBZ canon this past year?   Terraria has a good number of achievements.   When is Arrow Season 2 supposed to come out on netflix? I read somewhere it was today but still isnt there :/   I still have about 15 Trades or so to read still....their sales are too juicy to pass up sometimes.   Perfum: Story of a Murderer.  It is just so good.   My roommate slept with his girlfriend every night and had this pillow. Your argument is invalid.   They have a disclaimer somewhere saying that oversales can happen, but yea it would be nice if they gave a personal update when it happens. If you check your current orders you can see which items are picked and scanned. I mean unless you ordered just 1, then it is a matter of waiting.   Umm...link?   Are you telling me that you don't have this pillow? I'm 23 and I have it in my linen closet....if I used pillows, this would be the one.   Sometimes they have to reorder stock through their supplier, which used to take a couple days alone. IST recently moved closer to them so that would only delay your order by a day or so.   Well....this is my first time seeing this post...so yea   I've been ordering books from them since beginning of the year. Never had any issues with them. This one time I accidentally ordered a book I had previously ordered. I noticed before they sent my package and they were willing to exchange it for a different of same price.  I hear they recently changed locations, so hopefully lower waiting times for delivery.   They bag and board their comics carefully. I've ordered a couple times from them with no problem.   Empire Ants by The Gorillaz. Every time I listen to it, I get chills.   I keep my cards in the back pocket so it slides to the side instead of up.   I just redeemed about 50+ codes yesterday. Only had a handful like this, but not nearly as bad. ╮(╯▽╰)╭      I think it depends on what  planet he is on. We see this in Justice League United.    I've enjoyed Acension.     I didnt update it and can run it just fine. So server is ok.   Changed my first bulb in a theatre projector. It is like handling a bomb. Shit is intense.   How about a spot for the priest that likes to levitate others randomly?    They need to put some Constantine back in Vertigo IMO   I would like to read a Death of Constantine book...   Didn't moot just add the catalog like last year?   I pay 42$/month for 1.5 MBPS from ATandT. I've talked to them and that is the fastest physically possible for my address.   And have to redo all my achievements, games linked, not to mention every purchase beyond games? Are you dense?  It is simply a matter of not wanting certain online personas of mine beinf linked to more public accounts of me.    I'm not dissing Google+, in fact I wish it was more active amongst my acquaintances, it just I'd rather remain as anonymous as possible on the select forums I choose to participate.    Shoot I am almost to my second set of 10gems from daily kills....imma see if it loads for me when I get home, havent updated it yet.   I would post mine, but it is my actual name...and yea not trying to link my reddit account in case I have friends lurking around the subreddits i frequent.  	103
 Hey all! I live in the Richmond area and I'm itching for a road trip, so I was thinking that this weekend I would just get on 81 and head down that way - Roanoke/Blacksburg/Radford. I went to Radford once years ago but really don't remember much about it. So basically, I know nothing about the area.  I'm a photographer and will be mainly using this trip to just get away and take photos of something new. I will probably be heading down Saturday morning, staying overnight and heading back Sunday night (it's a 3 hour drive).  I figured the best thing to do would be just list the things I like and see if you all have any ideas for places to go. I appreciate it!!  - rural scenes / scenic roads  - Americana, including kitschy tourist stuff, old motels, etc.  - abandoned places (saw the urban exploration thread posted on here within the last day or so, I'll check that out)  - street photography - are there any areas that would have a lot of people around on a weekend? Shopping areas other than a mall?  - I was flipping through the sub and saw someone mention a "growing hipster population" in Roanoke - is that a certain area of town?  - thrift and antique stores  - nature stuff including mountains/river are nice too but seeing as how I will only be there about two days, I don't want to be spending a lot of time hiking somewhere and back.  Thank you!!      I agree with you but it's not taking a dig at everyone in that situation. Given my lack of giveashit about relationships these days, I may actually end up that way too. But this particular guy, according to my friend, is NOT content living his life alone and is NOT happy about not having children yet. That's why I made that comment. It was just funny to me that he was lamenting recently about being bad with women and then he makes those weird comments to me.    Nope, native English speaker...   No and according to my friend it's a sore subject with him that he doesn't.    He hasn't made a decision to be unmarried. By his own admission he is not good with women and that's why he is single. My friend even told me today that this guy has some chip on his shoulder about not having kids yet.    Figured you all would get a kick out of this.  There's a guy on Facebook I am friends with. I don't know him that well but we have a mutual friend who has known him for years. He is in his early 40s and never been married, and recently told me he "isn't good with women..." well, after yesterday, I learned he is 100% correct about that.  Yesterday I posted a link to some article on Facebook about famous women's response when people ask why they don't have children. I commented that Margaret Cho's comment "I ovulate sand" made me laugh out loud.  This dude sends me a PM. "Do you really ovulate sand?"  Me: No...  Him: Oh. I'm confused then for what your excuse is.  Me: Excuse for what?  Him: Preferred excuse for no babies?  Me: You're right. That's my purpose in life. I keep forgetting.  Him: Ok. I'll let your family remind you in the future.  Me: I didn't post that as an invitation for people to tell me what to do with my uteus.  Him: Alright. Sorry. Enjoy the rest of your weekend.  Um... WHAT? To me personally it's actually worse when MEN give me shit about this. Women I just write it off as ignorance, some of them desperately want babies and assume the rest of us do. Men, I take it a little more offensively. I mean, who the F*** are you? And why do you care about what I do with my freaking uterus? It isn't 1950 anymore, I don't need some man telling me what to do with my life. Good god I was LIVID.  I would NEVER send some parent, or wannabe parent, a message that says something like "What's your excuse for having children? After all, they are useless and the world is overpopulated" - even though that's how I feel about them. Because it's not my place and none of my damn business what they do with their own lives, and I'm not arrogant enough to think that my opinion matters.  The kicker came later when I asked our mutual friend what the HELL this guy's issue was. She informs me that, based on what she knows about him (which is far more than what I know), she is pretty positive he was trying to flirt with me.  Oh god. Well, major FAIL on his part. No wonder he is "bad with women" and is still unmarried in his early 40s. Jesus. What a clueless d**k. What's my EXCUSE? Like I need an excuse to not have babies. AGHH!     That's like saying that I don't know how my Honda is limiting me, and I should go rent a Porsche.        Buying meat off Craiglist has about the same appeal to me as buying meat off the back of somebody's pickup truck. Just seems sketchy...   I hate to be snarky, but... when you can answer this question for yourself and you know exactly why your crop sensor is limiting you -  then worry about upgrades.   I read it as THEIR car hit the truck. I had the same question and read the article a few times trying to figure it out. but the way they phrased it sounds like their car is the one that left its lane.    I'm telling you how things generally are in the photography business and you clearly just want to argue about it. How about, the sky is blue? You want to argue about that or just accept how things are?  I don't know about you but it's a beautiful day here so I'm actually going to go out and use my camera, not sit on reddit arguing about business models I don't agree with.    Missing the point here. You're talking about OP specifically, I'm talking about why photographers IN GENERAL do not do release their RAW files and allow others to post-process them.     Because as someone else mentioned, you work 8-10 hours shooting a wedding, hand someone the RAW files, they HDR or over saturate the hell out of them and then they're out there with YOUR name on them.  Post -processing is part of the package/art for most of these photographers. It was the same for film, they printed them for you bc they as an artist had a certain look or feel. That's what you're paying for.   If you just want RAW files to edit yourself, get someone to do it for free. Plenty of people out there who will do that, you just get what you pay for.    Gotta have Netflix binge in the background while I'm working.   Sometimes I use the coffee table as my desk and sit on the floor.    That car... holy sh*t.  I didn't agree with their tactics, but good lord that car is a mangled mess. Yikes. Wonder if the driver fell asleep or what.    I don't know any self-respecting professional who would allow this.    Good luck. I just posted something the other day about these "someday" guys.  http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/2z562c/online_dating_rant_someday/  I'm almost ten years older than you and you would think men would be more certain one way or the other. Nope, not really. Plus a lot of people in my preferred range (early 30s to early 40s) have already bred.    Well, there's a big difference between the look of film, and the look of badly exposed film, expired film, light leaks, etc. That whole thing I don't understand at all.   What is so awful about VSCO? It's meant to mimic film stocks... you know, that stuff people shot with before digital. :)   Wow people. Mine is:  Macbook Pro, on the couch, in front of the TV.   I pretty much ignore people who use those kinds of hashtags. #stfu   Yeah, no - not for a date!  Not to mention that a lot of people don't eat that much to make the price worth it. I know I don't.   I shoot what I want, when I want. I don't care if other people like it. I guess I care to SOME extent because I share my stuff online, but I guess the point is, I shoot for myself. It's why, EVERY time I've done someone a favor by shooting an event, I come to the conclusion that I would never do this professionally. I don't want to shoot weddings or engagements or photos of a kid's birthday party.   Other than that, I shoot in a documentary style. I don't like posing/staging. My processing style over time has become a lot more minimalist. I like recording every day life. I think - or, would LIKE to think - that I make something beautiful out of the mundane, or even the ugly.    I thought my allergies were bad when I lived in Hampton Roads - then I moved here and they got even worse. I've already started taking allergy medication - trying to get a head start.    Bummer. I so cherish the one-two weeks of warmer weather before my allergies start preventing me from enjoying it.      I feel like when I'm looking at a scene and then I put my camera up to my eye with the 27 on my camera, the scene is the same as it looked with my eye. With the 35 it's a tad more narrow and with the 23/x100 it's a tad wider.   I find that very appealing for a prime. I know you get used to any focal length eventually - but it's still a novelty for me right now and kinda cool.    Knowing where you live would be helpful. I'm guessing you aren't in the US?   I've been meaning to have a "challenge" day where I stick my 18-55 zoom on 18 all day and shoot it like a prime. I find 18mm challenging (I have the XT-1 as well). I know it's not super wide, but for me it kinda is.  I didn't realize my iPhone 6 was 28mm. For some reason I thought all the iPhones were a 35mm (FF terms).   Fuji XT-1 + 27mm 2.8.  I had the original X100 and this setup is just ever so slightly bigger - still fits in the same case.  	29

 The consensus here seems to be that these are poor arguments on an important topic. What could we do to strengthen the arguments?  Definitions:   Person: a rational, living actor.  Suicide: the intentional act of ending one's life.  Assisted suicide: planned euthanasia with the intent to lessen harm to both actor, assistant, and those affected afterwards.  Framework 1: Suicide harms others, and since you have the infinitely valuable opportunity to not hurt them, you should willfully elect to suffer through.   Assumptions:   All people have the universal right not to be harmed. A rational person will want to do what he/she "should" do by definition because from reason we derive ethics, the study of what we "should" do. An ethical life is not necessarily a happy one.  Conclusion:  Therefore, it is our obligation and opportunity to shield others from harm, regardless of cost.  Problems: What about assisted suicide? We find ourselves in a paradox whereby each rational actor wants to lessen the pain of the other. By the same logic we could argue that a doctor who won't assist in a suicide infringes on someone's right to be least harmed.  Framework 2: All people have an absolute right to their own bodies.  Assumptions:   Rights exist and come from reason. Inalienable human rights are by definition universal to all humans and are self-evident.   Conclusion:  Jump, your have a right to kill yourself even if it harms others.  Problems: The universality and existence of human rights may or may not be self-evident.   Framework 3: We can't know/Might makes right/etc  Assumptions: There are no rules. There is only what a man can do and what he will do.  Conclusion: Get to killing yourself while you still can.  Problems: This leaves us in a society of concentrated, arbitrary power.  Framework 5: Society should cure their ills or send them off.  Assumptions: Rights don't come from God or reason; rather they come from human decision to give up ruthless materialism for benevolent mutual cooperation. If rights exists, then that necessarily imposes obligations on society to help its weakest members.   Conclusion: The living actors cooperate to decide who needs what more, whether that means death or a live person.  Problems: Obviously, this doesn't cover what happens when the negotiations come to a standstill.  Anyway, can we come up with better arguments and settle on an answer?     Hey docs,  A while ago I was in a crazy electrical accident on set. I was zapped by an 18,000 watt light at about 250 volts. The producers took me to the hospital, and the doctor noticed low heart rate, about 30 bpm. They released me after an EKG. I had minor burns on my fingers that healed right up. Since then, I've had every scan imaginable and I've seen all the specialists.   I'm fine now, but I wanted to crowdsource the amazing group-knowledge of the internet and see if any of you could shine some light on some weird side-effects.  Immediately after the injury, I started to see inexplicable fog that nobody else could see. It was very scary because I was also a cinematographer, and I rely on my eyes for my job. And to make matters scarier, the fog was sort of magic. It felt like I was walking through a dream. Not quite real. The fog would come and go as would the feeling of unreal-ness.  Separate from the episodes of unreal-ness, I could, and still can, see colors that didn't exist prior to the accident. They seemed super pronounced just after the accident, but I think that's because I was just not used to them like I am now. Music has changed too, to a lesser extent, but I can't describe it as well as I can with the colors because unlike with cinematography I'm unlearned in sound engineering.  I know this isn't a place for real medical advice to replace the doctors, but all the doctors and specialists have given me the same answer: "We don't know." So if there ever was a time for wild quackery, or unsubstantiated theories, now would be the time.  Thanks   I was once zapped by a 20k cine light on set at about 250 volts. 30 milliamps can kill you. I got 20,000.   I have asthma and it caused my heart to grow big without my knowing, causing me to have a really low bpm, usually about 30 at rest. Anyway, the shock hit me between beats so I'm still good.    Greenpeace argues for government intervention; she does not. If Greenpeace wanted the market for whale products to stop, outside of making whaling expeditions illegal or implementing a Pigouvian tax, they would have to change the demand for whaling products, which means getting people to vote with their dollar.   Inherent in her argument is that there is a demand for women-positive games, which is to say that it would be profitable for a firm to produce media products that she would not need to critique or boycott.   The responses are suggesting that if such an untapped market existed, the big companies would probably have already profited from it.   So maybe the problem isn't evil, sexist game companies lying about how hard it is to animate female characters. Maybe the problem is that responsible suppliers can't afford to invest in socially conscious games because the demand is so far nonexistent.    She's not trying to change the laws, though. She just wants the market to correct itself. From an economics perspective, there are two ways to solve a market inefficiency, outlaw it in the cases like slavery and tax it in the cases like cigarettes. But she's not suggesting either of those. She's not suggesting affirmative action for video games or taxing non-representative games. She's not even suggesting a subsidy for games that represent women fairly.  (Quick note: though there are other ways for the government to fix market inequalities, like PSA's to change popular opinion, those do not require changing the rules of a free market.)  What she really wants is for the market to magically correct itself. And there are only two ways to do that: change the market with your dollar or become a supplier who caters to the ignored market.   What is sexist media? Having a game, movie, or book from a male perspective is not sexist. (Harry Potter) Having a game, movie, or book with a sexist protagonist is not sexist. (Tom Sawyer, Anchorman, Clockwork Orange, GTA) Sexism in the media is when the inherent argument is harmful to women (Barbie, Snow White, some of the early Bond films).  If we want people to take feminism seriously, we need to adopt a better model of social criticism. Sexist suppliers may exist, but when an entire market is sexist, you know there's something else going on: a demand side cultural sexism.   So let's assume we've identified a sexist form of media. There are two things for a person like @femfreq to do: change the cultural perceptions and change the marketplace. The media marketplace is not our culture, it is merely a reflection of our culture. To argue otherwise is to give undo and unobserved power to the suppliers. Change the culture first, and the market will respond.   And the most effective way to do that is to critique sexism publicly, appointing blame to those who deserve it. The message should be this: "If you buy sexist games, you support sexism; therefore, you are a sexist," instead of "gahhh! all these evil game companies are invading our minds with their sexism cuz they hatez wymynz." It's a subtle distinction, but important.   The above points are captured eloquently in the above link, but it's very supply-side, so let's make the distinction that you don't have to be multinational media conglomerate to change the media. You just have to vote with your dollar.    Genius. I had no idea. Thanks a ton.   The Gospel according to George R R Martin. He dies and comes back, so George kills off everyone in the world that you like.   http://i.imgur.com/thbygzZ.jpg   No, but being a whiny, entitled little bitch is not necessary.  Don't give me a lecture on how oppressed you are or how unfair the system is. If you don't want to be part of the project, then just fuck off already.    This guy needs a reality check. Whether the music is valuable to the company, or whether he worked hard on it, or whether it cost him a lot to gain the skills to create it is completely irrelevant. It doesn't matter what you *should* get paid. If you're feeling underpaid, go work somewhere else.  Negotiating is about exploiting shared interests. Am I supposed to get up in arms because some company made him an offer he didn't like?  As someone who has spent literally thousands of hours working for free, from hauling dolly equipment through the god-forsaken desert to getting shot in the face with synthetic puke from a real life mud cannon, I ask, "Where is your artistic integrity?"  For some of us, it's not about the bottom line; it's about working on a project we believe in with people we love.   If I want to play an Xbox game, I have to buy an Xbox, and even then I won't be able to play any of my PS3 games on it. Why don't I have to buy a Lionsgate-box to play Lionsgate DVD's?   Can this be modeled or explained?  Thanks in advance.  Edit: Yeah, obviously I understand the limitations in terms of format (re: why can't an xbox play PS3). What I'm really looking for is why the market evolved like that. Microsoft owns the xbox console, which gives it power over the home distribution of its games. Why doesn't this model of distribution work for other media markets?   upvote for username      I disagree, but up vote for a convincing argument.  Sure, feminism is very female centric. But must all organizations that agree with each other take the same steps? Put another way, if feminists were so interested in egalitarianism, why don't they campaign for black civil rights issues? Further, should we refrain from participating in organizations that do not actuate every single one of our values?   Let me put it like this. I am a man. I support men's rights activists. For example, I was recently in a major workplace accident. 92-95% of workplace accidents happen to men. This is likely due to a subtle form of discrimination as a result of a mentorship program. In an industry where you are going to be spending a lot of time with whomever you train, men train their best male friends and women train their best female friends. By this logic, there is a natural (if probably immoral) semi-chosen segregating process into certain male or female dominated industries. My best friend went into grip and electric, a male-dominated department that happens to have above average incidences of catastrophic injury. I support the men's rights activists who are combating this problem.  At the same time, I am a family man. When my little sister makes less money than I do for the same job, our household suffers. I support the feminist activists who are combating this problem.  I can be both feminist and men's rights activist because my overarching philosophy is egalitarianism, but in order to actuate this philosophy, we have to design our organizations strategically by the issues we face. Feminist activists face issues separate and apart from men's right activists. That doesn't mean that we can't face both issues; it just means that we're part of two movements that are linked philosophically.     Saw you on Bill Maher. Really funny.  As an executive producer for a bunch of shows, you know a bunch of stuff that I want to suck out of your brain with a vacuum. I'm directing a 22 minute pilot for my senior thesis at LMU. When it's done, what's the smartest way to get it pitched, seen, and on TV?  	15
 With regards to court in England, if you want to change who has custody you need to prove that the negatives of moving that child, are  greatly out weighed by the positives. The problem with family court is most of it, is their word against yours. I've been to court 5 times so far.  I didn't win because the court didn't think there was enough reasons to move her.  It seems like, the only way I would get custody is if he did something terrible, like physically hurt her. :/   Mentally hurting her, isn't even enough it seems. According to the UK deed poll website, our laws are the same as yours. However, I has reason to doubt that even with all the smaller things he's done plus this incident, are not enough.  My partner and I have just moved in to our first mortgaged home. Due to the summer holidays, I wasn't sure what date I had her next as we had made a verbal agreement. After many unanswered calls and texts, he eventually applied threatening to call the police on grounds of harassment.  Baring in mind we didn't know he was receiving our messages.  I needed to know when I was having her next a I wanted to try and move when she was with him so that she wasn't bored etc. He refused to answer the simple question and instead, did nothing but throw accusations and insults at us.  When I told him, I needed to know the date for my daughter's sake, his wife replied with PMSL {pissing myself laughing}  and the only reason my partner was getting on his high horse is because he's banging the Mother{me} My partner has done a hell of lot to make their lives easier when it comes to the travel arrangement for handover. My daughter is also extremely fond of him. Although technically he is no relation to her, my partner still has a hell of a lot to do with my daughter.  He also told my partner{a very calm, logical fella} that he had no right to get involved{again kinda true but there was no need for the rudeness. This behaviour; which shows no concern for our daughter, is still not enough in court apparently.    I do have a solicitor, however, he's not been very good on the communication level recently. I'm making an appointment tomorrow to discuss this and have a moan about his lack of communication, I'll have to consider changing solicitors if it continues.  People do renegotiate all the time, however, the courts really don't like to uproot a child that is 'supposedly' settled. She has been with her Dad for most of her life. Last year he met a woman with 4 other children and decided to marry her after he'd moved them in, 7 weeks later. They then moved a bit further away last xmas. He pulled her out of her school etc. I've now been informed that they are moving back to their original location by xmas. So basically he's put her in a new school for a year and is now moving her back to her old one, just after she's started a new school year. She now has to share her Father with 5 other people which she doesn't like as she gets no 1 on 1 time with him. She's 6 years old, so her consent in not necessary to change her name. The courts also don't give a fuck what she wants until she's at least 12 years old. Because apparently children don't know what they really want until that age or older.    p.s thank you for your comment :)     I guess, I'm just looking for more ammunition to use in the court room, when I finally go for custody again. I should point out that if things ran smoothly between us and he showed respect to me as the Mother of his daughter then I wouldn't be thinking about court at all. He likes to make everything difficult for me even if it negatively effects our daughter. She's now torn between us although I do my best to hide the bad things from her. She constantly asked why she cannot live with me. I find it very hard to construct an answer with out saying her Father has the control and he decides{I don't want to do this as that would be slating him and that is something I do not want to do to my daughter.} One evening whilst looking at what she thought was a shooting star{a plane lol} I asked her what her biggest wish was. She said to live with me. If she was happy there, I would have no reason to go for custody, as after all her welfare is paramount to me.   Glad to be of service :)    Ambivalence is a state of having simultaneous, conflicting feelings toward a person or thing. Stated another way, ambivalence is the experience of having thoughts and/or emotions of both positive and negative valence toward someone or something. A common example of ambivalence is the feeling of both love and hate for a person. The term also refers to situations where "mixed feelings" of a more general sort are experienced, or where a person experiences uncertainty or indecisiveness concerning something. The expressions "cold feet" and "sitting on the fence" are often used to describe the feeling of ambivalence.  Now they do :)    as we're talking ages here, I'm 24. I completely concur with this MyriPlanet. Have an up vote.     I'm not using my child as a weapon, if I was, I would have it reversed as revenge. I'm after custody of my daughter. He leads a very unstable way of life for her and she is not happy. Her biggest wish is to live with her Mum. He often denies her access to me when it suits him and goes behind my back with smaller things like ear piercing. I've been put through hell for the last 5.5 years and so has my little girl.  It's amusing to me that the more pleasant I am to him, the more control he feels he has because he sees me as weak.    Just to clarify, I have weekend access and half of all holidays. I know it's unusual for a Mother not to have main custody, but please don't judge. He left me homeless and heart broken a few days before my 19th Birthday. He'd also got my friend and neighbour pregnant{she miscarried} pregnant at the same time.  I was in no fit mental state to fight him properly in court. Once a parent gains custody, it is very hard to ever win in court. :(  I'm 24 now and have recently got a good sized mortgaged home. My partner earns good money to support us all, whilst I've revisited education. My daughter is now six years old.  She constantly cries every time she goes back to her Father and says how her step brothers{3 of them} and sister intimidate her. She says Step Mum and Dad don't let me read to them because they are too busy. My partner of 3 years and I hear this and other things a lot. My solicitor has informed me that they don't take notice of what the child says until she is at least 12 years old.     So basically, I don't know where I stand legally. I have 50% responsibility for her so don't I have to give my consent to this? Do I have a chance for custody over this?   Looking forward to any advice given. Thank you muchly for taking the time to read this :)   I'm in England not America by the way.     http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150239544075327 set=a.10150239541240327.472269.713945326 type=1 theater  That's my tiger tattoo. :)  It took 2.5 hours     I don't mind that, as long as I'm told in advance     Did you mean NOT up voting?   Obviously not a female. . .   To defend the smokers . . . in England there definitely is NOT enough cigarette bins. You know, most bars/restaurants have ash trays but it's when people are walking around and they can't put it in a normal bin, so there's no place to put it. I sent a letter to my local Council about this, and they said they couldn't afford to put more up because the Government has cut funding etc.    My partner did that, even after constant nagging from our 6 year old daughter and I.  So I put it all over face book. He only rarely does it now. Progress!    Just remember, the more heated the discussion with your grandmother and step Father, the more upset your Mum will be.  Also, things get exaggerated when sliding down the grape vine.  Try to be as normal as possible  and go about your daily routine, talk to her as you normally would without mentioning atheism. The less change she sees, the better.  Good Luck soldier!  p.s come to us if you get stuck on any questions your family throws at you. We'll help you as much as we can. :)    Is your daughter's name Alicia? She looks identical to a child I used to look after at nursery{in Essex England}    Doesn't your jaw start to ache?    why not?   You lived in cheese? Are you Swiss?    You lived in cheese? Are you Swiss?    I noticed a bitter male redditor down voted you too. Blimey, they don't want females to judge them on a stereotype, like I dunno .  . .all men cheat. Yet here they are, doing that exact same thing to us!   Awesome dude!   That's what I'm trying to work out, whether or not it's a big enough thing for the courts to look at.   No problem     That's because we are goddesses whereas you are measly men!     not all women are like that.    I would if they were fit.    On the pp form there is a bit for Father's details. I filled this in of course. Right next to it there's a bit that asks for an address. As it was so close to the Father's details I assumed that it meant his address.  Face palm yes.  The fact that it was delivered to his address is not the problem. It's that he is denying receiving two bits of mail that were sent on different days. Amazing considering we have two photos of his front door-taken by the courier. The court order gives me full permission to take my daughter on holiday abroad, and of course apply for the passport. I have 50% responsibility but I don't have main custody. She is with me on weekends and most school breaks.   Oh and no her Father and I were never married. Thank you for the good luck I think we're going to need it :/   I don't know because if we have physical evidence that it was delivered, and he says he never had it, that mean he's lying. Because losing something after it has been delivered and denying ever receiving it in the first place, are two different things. He's still denying it even though we have a photo of his front door from the courier.     Yes I'm in UK lol. :)  Now you have me curious on this big post!     Okay so here's the short hand on the background.   I lost custody on my due to being nieve when having to fight in court {aged nineteen} Not due to my lack of parenting skills. I've been back to court four times already for custody but lost as they weren't good enough reasons to remove a child from a supposedly already settled home.   He has had custody since our daughter was eight months old. She is now six years old. We are meant to be flying to Cyprus to see family in NINE days time!!!  My partner and I applied for mine and my daughter's passport on the same day. I received my birth certificate back and then a day later I received my new passport. However, I did not receive anything regarding my daughter's passport.   After hours on the phone to the passport office, we find that MY application for her passport was delivered to her Father and step Mother's home. So we rang them up and asked them if they had it. However, they denied any delivery. We then showed them a print out of an email sent to us by the passport office. It had the delivery details and a photo of the front door it was posted through.   They still deny having received it. After more time spent on the phone to the passport office they send us another email with more delivery information. IT HAS HIS SIGNATURE for BOTH deliveries. {We haven't told him yet}  We are now having to do a long journey on the 25th up to the passport office in Peterborough to collect a new passport. However, for some unknown reason we have to apply for a fast-track one week passport and then ask them VERY kindly when we get there, to give it to us that day. So we STILL might not be able to go on holiday. Including petrol, this will be roughly another £250 on top of the costs for the previous passport.   I'm now wondering whether I've got a good case to go for full custody of my daughter due to this. After all, he's opened my mail-which is against the law,{it would have been addressed to me but sent to his address. He's upsetting his daughter by trying to stop her going on her first holiday abroad-even though legally I can take her on holiday and he's causing us to spend more money unnecessarily as well as added stress.  What are your thoughts guys?   EDIT: Found out today that the signature is NOT the Father's but the courier's who amazingly has the same name as him. We have now been told we have to write a letter to the passport office to get them to do an investigation as to the whereabouts of my daughter's passport.    TL:DR  Passport got delivered to Father's address by mistake. He denies having it. We have proof he has. {He does not know that yet} He's a wanker for risking upsetting his daughter to get one over his ex partner. Do I have good grounds for a custody case?   I became insecure and low in confidence. It felt as if any decision I made was the wrong choice. Whether it was over something trivial or big. Even as an adult, I'm hesitant about making big decisions, I'm 24 now and about to sign contracts for a mortgage. Other relatives have told me that he's been telling everyone that I won't be able to 'cope' with it. My Father is very lazy and hasn't achieved much in life. The house that he, my Mother and youngest brother live in is owned by my maternal grandmother.. He's also not working due to 'health problems'. So I think that maybe he's a little envious and that's why he's always putting me down now that he can't control my actions. It's very frustrating as a child because all children want to do is make their parents proud. I was so eager to please and yet every decision I made for myself was the wrong one. Even for work placement week at school, I 'apparently' chose the wrong thing and he guilt tripped me in to doing an activity that I didn't want to do, oh and I struggled like hell with it. So thanx Dad lol. Don't get me wrong I know my Father isn't the worst Father out there but he certainly isn't up for Dad of the year award.        I'm female too and yes equal rights blah blah. However on a stereotypical note, most males are built larger and stronger than majority of girls. Thank you evolution. Which means most guys can hit harder than girls. I know my fella can hit much harder than I could and that doesn't stop me giving it all when play fighting. He just restrains me. Then it turns it to sex .... But guys do need to know how much strength they're using. If I girl is kicking your arse, just put her in a head lock etc.    Can't upvote this enough.    exactly, they CAN but it's not for definite. That advice was actually correct.    Not true, as long as you are only weight training or doing like body building.     My father did the same thing. I think they mean well but don't actually know how to get the message across in a 'nice way'.    And I would be right by your side dude. :)   Jack and Jill went up the hill to fetch a pale of water, god knows what they did up there but now they have a daughter. {say it without pronouncing the t's. It sounds better}   Go the fuck to sleep forever!   You know, most immigrants in England are actually Irish.    FUCK YOU! Yes I'm female, not a simpleton and I have a good sense of humour. After all, I found the book hilarious!    perfect little angels? pfft!    Cannot upvote enough!   Apparently the government are talking about banning high fives in England's schools. Also giving the dinner lady{midday supervisor as they're now known} or favourite teacher a hug won't be allowed. It's going to end up like demolition man. No touching and sex will be via a some virtual world helmet thing.    Who are you to say a cow's opinion doesn't matter? Don't be cowist :p   My daughter has heard swearing many times via her step Mother and Dad{unfortunately} but she NEVER swears. She was taught not to, she's six.  Yes children pick up on things, you're right. However, it's up to the parents to teach what's right and wrong-not hide any evidence of bad stuff in the world. Otherwise they're going to get one hell of a shock when they leave home.   That blatantly deserves an upvote A_Mann   That line was nothing but amusing.     What a load of bull shit. As a mother and ex nursery practitioner, I feel that as a society we do nothing but turn our children in to wimps via 'wrapping them up in cotton wool' and attending to their every whim. My daughter is read to every night and reads to her Dad or I during the day-every day.  She's six and her best skills are currently mathematics and using her imagination. My daughter has heard swearing many times and never repeats it-even when she was younger,  because we taught her not to.  It really winds me up when people say that children should never see this or hear that because it can have damaging effects. Look at the generations before-they {most of them lol} turned out okay and they weren't so smothered with 'protection'!    CULL ALL CHAVS!!!     Your wife looks fit.   This is why my six daughter is only allowed to watch a small amount of television. I also sit with her and watch it and we then talk about it afterwards. Movies are considered a special treat. Instead of television, we have music on a lot of the time, or we communicate over board games and meal times etc. I feel this not only develops her communication/interaction and physical skills{because she's doing something else instead of just sitting there} but it also means that she hopefully she won't end up believing everything she views on television.      OMGOSH! What do you expect? It was a hot day and the air con was broken!   My partner and I have been together for nearly 3 years. Yes he did make the first move and approached me first. However since then, I make the first move when it comes to sex, 99% of the time. I've told him it's getting boring. But still it's always me making the moves. Oh and no this is NOT due to my lack of sexual performance. However, I do have a higher sex drive than him. . . .    Well to be honest, the best person to tell him is his Mum. Then if he asks you any questions . .why are you going etc . .then you can tell him. I'm a Mum/Aunty/Niece/sister myself and I've had a lot of experience with young children so I feel my advice is sound. When you're away make sure you have skype. Children love the video link and find it much more fun and exciting than a phone call.   I've never seen them here in England. Which I feel may have sent me in to a deeply saddened state. :(    As an ex nursery nurse, I have seen I lot of babies in my time and that child is fooking gorgeous!  	59
 Let's hope that never happens. But sometimes I can't help but think that they will be so much better off without me, and they know that they would be happier without me. I don't want them to leave but, sometimes I wonder if they want to leave but they are just too nice to.  	1
 I am one of the people that actually enjoy going to the parties!   Yeah, all of the jobs around here at the moment want availability until 10pm and over the weekend.   They do both seem to be better companies than a LOT of the other work from home companies I have researched.   Thank you!   Why though?   I just wonder how the people repping at the parties manage to make money then?   I guess I just feel he could be a little more supportive as I gave up my career to support him in his job which involves moving every three to four years.   Can you say why you would side with him? (out of interest)   Thank you for your reply!      Ovarian cyst with torsion. I told the ER doc that I would rather go through natural childbirth again than have another hour of the pain. And that was after they had given me dilaudid.   One on my lip and one on my ear from falling into a post hole aged 18 months. Appendectomy scar on my stomach (duh!). Six  1 inch scars on my stomach from laparoscopic surgery to remove ovarian cysts. Three inch scar on each of my knees as well as three  1cm scars on my left knee, and six  1cm scars on my right knee from cartilage tearing and joint clean out.   Sorry for the spelling :-)   Admittedly I have seen in the US (after living in the UK) that Drs no longer hand out antibiotics as frequently, but there is a bigger issue in the US. I refer to the simple antiseptic creams available on suoermarket shelves. In the UK you buy a simple antiseptic to treat a small wound, scrape or burn. In the US it is nearly impossibe to but such a cream that does NOT contain an antibiotic. In fact a majority of the cream available on shelves in the US contain between 3 and 4 different antibiotics. And people use these frequently when in all honesty, a simple antiseptic would work just as efficiently.    I didn't know.    Except that they can be fined for leaving snow on pathways.   We have had to dig out our car a few times and we moved here 18 months ago!   We do (Aurora).   The ibuprofen (and Naproxen) works as an anti-inflammatory drug. It is not only for pain, but for reducing swelling and inflammation. Pretty important for the OP. Not all painkillers are designed to do the same job, which is why Drs often 'layer' them together.    OP needs to check rule #2 then :-)   All the hipster kids look like minors to me now. Im getting old!   Is that a male or female?   Perhaps they should try some oxy for that 'fun' high! It just makes me ache less and very tired but not able to sleep for some reason. Do check out wiki for hypermobility and hypermobility syndrome. Ask about it when you see your chiro or MD next. Although there is nothing you can really do about it, there are lots of things you can do to help it becoming a bigger problem. It is not readily picked up on in general screening, but it can have a big impact if your medical team are aware of it. Eg I had surgery two weeks ago and had to talk to the recovery team about moving me between the beds. I didn't want them pulling my arm and freaking out because they dislocated my shoulder! They were awesome and made sure everyone knew to slide me on sheets, or to support my joints realky well when moving me.  I know a few people like your brother. They feel that their past experiences mean that they have superior knowledge over others when it comes to drugs. I hope he stops being an ass and starts supporting you soon. Maybe he is jealous he cant get high anymore? :-)   If you didn't need them, your Dr would not be refilling your rx. So, unless you are buying them off some shady dude on a street corner, you are not doing anything wrong.   I live with an 'invisible illness' just as you do. Admittedly, at the moment, mine is no where near as bad as yours, but I live with pain, and I know it will only get worse as I get older.   People do not understand pain as an 'illness'. It is hard for people to see you walking around without any physical imparement, looking, as it were, 'normal'. They don't see that every step you take hurts, because you have gotten good at hiding the grimaces. You play down the pain bacause you don't want to be talking about it all the time. People don't understand the sleep deprivation from waking every hour from the pain because you have moved in your sleep into a painful position.  I completely understand your not wanting to take the narcotics, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do to get through the day.  When your chiro said you were flexible, did they check you for hypermobility? Hypermobility Syndrome is characterised by extremely lax ligaments, and could possibly go some way to explaining some of your pain (the ligaments don't hold your muscles and joints together properly causing joint and muscular pain). Just throwing that out there as something to look at!  I found pilates and yoga quite good for teaching me breathing techniques to breathe through the pain, and also for strengthening my core muscles to provide better stability for my skeleton.  Pain and depression are intrinsically linked. When I am having a bad time with my pain, the depression quickly follows.   Sorry that there is no more that I can add. Just that I know how it can be with people judging you for taking so many drugs, without really even being in the situation to understand why.  Sorry for any typos, spelling, 10mg oxy on board tonight :-)   Anything involving hot oil.   Chill the malt loaf in the fridge, then slice gently with minimal downwards pressure. Allow to return to room temperature. Take a block of butter and cut a thin slice. Place sliced butter onto malt loaf. A block of Anchor butter cut on the smallest rectangle fits a slice of malt loaf perfectly with no need to spread. Repeat until you have eaten the entire loaf and are filled with a strange mix of fruit and self-loathing.  Edit: Oh god I miss Malt Loaf living in the US at the moment!   Sipping room temp water and watching The Simpsons Movie to take my mind of the sugar swirling in my stomach!   And it is so hard to just have one!   Peanut butter and white chocolate. Sooo good, but now I feel soooo sick from the sugar rush!   I would have, but the kids were in bed and my husband was out... What's a girl to do? :-)      No problem!   That is so cute! I wish you every success in your big move and your future together! EDIT p.s. Moving is pretty awesome sexually - so many new places to do it! :-)   Thank you! :)   We both kind of had a 'love at first sight' thing going when we met. Thankfully we were able to spend a lot of time together, getting to know about ourselves, without the stress of being alone together as we met at university and we were part of the same social group. We started officially dating about four weeks after meeting each other. We moved in with each other after two years of dating (and basically living together anyway!), he proposed after a year of living together and we were married three years later. We decided to have a long engagement as we were not financially, or to be honest, emotionally ready to be married, and we both wanted to save to enjoy our dream day. We did not abstain from sex early in the relationship, and really learned through each other what sex was all about! We had a lot of fun researching and trying out new things, and we still do to this day. As we have grown older, our tastes have changes and we have been able to get through this by being open and communicative with each other.   I guess when I first met him I could see myself with him forever because of the way he made me feel about him and myself. He was 18 and not really thinking more long term than his next dinner :)   Good! I hope it gets even better for you :)   They did several pregnancy tests and ultrasounds before the surgery. I had tubal ligation as the sterilization method. EDIT- I forgot to mention that I was also days away from my next period, so any test would have indicated pregnancy.   Thank you! I hope you find that feeling again :-)   Thank you. One of the reasons I wanted to post this was because I rarely see comments here from 'older' people in maturing relationships. We seem to fade away into monotonous sex-once-a-week drudgery. I just wanted to share my experience with my husband, and to say that it can still be new and exciting, even after all this time :-)   I hope so! It really does take time and communication. If you have those, I think you can get through most things :-)   Lol. Thank you :-)   I am just glad that we have weathered the storms together so far. I couldn't imagine having this depth of relationship with anyone else! Time and communication are definately some of the biggest factors in a good sexual relationship :-)   Thank you :-)   Thank you, glad to be making people happy! :-)   Thank you :-)   Thank you! I am very lucky to have someone to put up with me! :-)   The fear of pregnancy really did affect my view of sex as I got older. It went from being fun and exciting, to worrying and stressful. Have you ever used a cycle calendar that estimates your most fertile dstes? I used one to work out when I was ovulating and most fertile and we avoided sex around those days (even though we were using protection). It gave me a little more confidence in not getting pregnant!   Thank you! I am just so amazed by how differently I feel about sex now, no more end of month panicing!   Not a bad thing at all if it gives you hope! Good luck for you and your SO :-)   For me, when I am depressed, I don't have the energy physically to 'want' sex. I feel ugly and worthless, and that anyone who wants to be near me is only doing it for their own needs, or to pity me. Obviously I know that us not true, but depression can make your mind very irrational. Try having non-sexual dates. Go back to when you would walk together just holding hands. Take away any sexual pressures, but keep intimacy through smaller gestures like a kiss on the cheek, a stroke of his back as you pass him. Little things can really go a long way. Take an evening out each week just to get out, away from everything, and enjoy each others company. If I am able to get out if my depressive 'rut' I find it easier to feel better about myself, then the sexual side if things returns pretty soon. I don't know if he would be into it, but reading erotica with a good storyline usually helps to get me in the mood! Remember it is not your fault, it is the pain in the backside depression that is altering his outlook on life. I hope you both get through this soon :-)   I asked my surgeon and she told me that female sterilization basically gives instant protection. There are risks involved because it is a much more invasive surgery than a vasectomy, but as I was having surgery anyway, there was no real drawback for me. I had two large cysts removed. One from each ovary.   Oh, the way he licks that spoon...hnnngh!   Oh we had our share of rough patches! Sleep deprivation and a complete and utter change to your life is never going to be easy! I am happy for you that you and your wife have made it through :-)   He really is! I am very lucky to have him.   My husband and I have always had a pretty good sexual relationship. We were both virgins when we met 14 years ago, aged 18. We started with very straightforward and 'vanilla' sex, and blossomed into being able to delve into each others desires and fantasies. We went from missionary position every time, to exploring positions, to watching porn together, to buying our first sex toys, to exploring deeper and darker fantasies as our relationship progressed and we matured sexually.  We have two young children, and it can be very hard at times to be in the mood for sex. A quickie is near impossible when you have a child that needs their butt wiping all of a sudden! We have had many night times where they have woken crying, close calls with interruptions and a couple of sleepwalking incidents that were thankfully never mentioned in the morning.  My husband has been fantastic in accepting that the birth of both my children had a huge effect on my libido (and body). He still tells me how sexy I am, and how much he wants me, even when I am bemoaning my stretch marks and drooping bosom. He held me close, never demanding, and waited an incredibly long time after both of the births for me to be ready for sexual contact of any sort again.  He has stood by me through many battles with depression, and understands that because I have to take antidepressive meds long term, I stuggle with my libido, and sometimes I just can't be in 'that mood' at all. He still sleeps patiently beside me, cuddling and loving me never pushing me for sex, never making me feel like it is nescessary to keep our relationship together. He welcomes sex when I initiate it, but always ensures that I am satisfied before satisfying himself. Even if it has been several weeks, he never rushes me or takes only for himself.  We recently made the decision that our family is complete and that he would get a vascectomy. We have always been particularly good at getting pregnant, and despite always using protection, I would always be quite stressed each month waiting for my period to turn up. We both were excited for the day we would be able to be carefree and wild, without worrying about what time of the month it was (we would 'risk' it the day after I finished my period occasionally) and whether we had any protection.  As it turned out, I had to have emergency surgery recently to remove two ovarian cysts. Whilst the surgeon was talking me through the surgery, she offered to sterilize me and I jumped at the chance. My husband looked after me through the surgery and my recovery. Obviously he was pretty made up that he didn't need his operation after all!  Now, it is 10 days post op, and we have been able to have our first ever sexual encounter where we were able to have unprotected sex in a completely relaxed manner. He was able to lay with me after, still inside me, holding each other, without me having to rush to stand up and clean up 'just in case' and without worrying about things like the condom slipping off as he lost his erection. We actually had time after the sex to just be together. I have never felt so relaxed after sex, and I am really hoping this is a new chapter in being able to be more spontanious and adventurous in our sex life.   I guess what I am getting at in this post, is that a one night fling is exciting and thrilling, a relationship when you are young is fun and full of new experiences, sex is possible after children if you are good at taking advantage of the brief moments you have alone together, and a long term sexual partner can let you discover so many new things about yourself and your partner and can bring a whole new dimension to your relationship. After 14 years we are still finding new things to try!  I love that is am still so in love with him, and that we still have so much more that we want to explore sexually with each other. And I wanted to share that feeling :-)   You were still leading him on.   You are one horrible human being! You are leading this poor guy on and calling him creepy really is the pot calling the kettle black!    What is your favorite aspect of the job?   I know! I just saw it again, and there were actually two notes left on different days from different firefighters, both feeding the fish!   Saw one on the news today from a woman who was left a note to tell her that the firefighters had fed her fish :)   We are south of DIA, but apparently there were some storms in the area that looked nasty.   Cant see anything because I am sitting in my basement with the kids! Good practice for them if nothing else!   Ah, ok!   According to 9news twitter, there was a rollover crash at E470 and Pena.   Both me and my husband have them :-)   Nope! Of all the 'lady part inspections' I have had, the women have always been far more gentle than the men!   Very! We were both completely innocent(ish) when we met :-)   My husband :-)   He reminds me of Pierce Brosnan with those eyes.   As a stay at home mum, I completely agree with you. However, I also see other SAHMs who literally spend every waking moment on their feet from 6am to 10pm meeting the needs of their families. Please remember too that when you have little ones, you're NEVER alone! I often remind my husband that at least at work he can go to the restroom without either being accompanied and/or yelled questions at! And getting up in the night several times because of kids illness, nightmares, sleepwalking, falling out of bed, deciding it is time to get up etc, the next day does become pretty exhausting!  Then again, I had a day recently where both of mine were in daycare at the same time and I had a whole 6 hours to myself! That was sweeeeet! :-)   I don't know why, but reading that bio always makes me want to vomit.   I don't know why, but reading that bio always makes me want to vomit.   Really didn't think that one through when I wrote it :-)   Yes, I mean good brushing and flossing to prevent heart disease!   That is creepy.  	74
 Hey... whatever works to keep you in shape.  You'll need to let go of the unhealthy obsession with your ex however.  What if she sees you and doesn't care?  Will it send your whole world crashing down?   Give it time...  Or you could forgive her.  Those are pretty much your options.   It's not like it was bringing down the quality of this subreddit.  Hell, I don't like Success Kid but I don't complain.  "Asked a girl out.  Found out she likes video games."  It's annoying to me but I believe in free speech.   I'm confused.     I've done this before.   Typo in comic.  Will not fap to this image.   And all I see is insecurity   Hate to break it to you, but that aint your kid bro.   Are there no free public wifi areas around?  That's why my brother does to get his hw done.  Plenty of book stores, coffee shops, etc.  Not to mention the computer lab at the school.   Wait, not only are you a grad student in HISTORY but you missed your thesis deadline as well?!?!?   http://replygif.net/i/1049.gif      I like the idea,  but this is dangerous because it could also lead to complacency.  I mean why go for that promotion when the job you have now is enough right?   Hey... I know it seems bad but keep pressing on. We've all been there.  Especially with the suicidal thoughts.  But why should you stop living just because of someone else?  Like I said, I KNOW it's hard. I still struggle from time to time. Allow yourself to grieve and don't feel bad about it.  Eventually you'll come out of your slump.  Also, leverage your friends and social network.  Now is the time when they're supposed to be there for you.   Well it’s officially been 39 days since we last had correspondence, but who’s counting right?    **HOW IT STARTED:**  After a 7 year relationship we broke up.  I tried to get back with her but she didn’t want to.  I went through emotional hell for a six months with contact between us every few days.  Then I got a girlfriend.  After that we still kept talking.  She expressed being upset that I had a girl.  I dumped my girl hoping to get back with my ex.  Bad move.  After that the NC period increased to weekly then eventually to every two weeks.  After having enough, I told her to stop texting me in July because she didn’t really care about me.    The NC period has been increasing since then hitting a previous high of 17 days.   **HOW I FEEL NOW:**  I don’t really know how to describe how I feel.  I guess ambivalent is a good word.  I have been fortunate enough to be busy recently so I didn’t notice.  After awhile after the days start piling up it becomes easier.  I wish I could say I had closure and everything was well.  But I don’t.  I have no idea what she’s doing, who’s she’s with, or even if she’s alive for that matter.  As for my own love life, I have the benefit of having numerous attractive women who want to be in my company.  I date one in particular at the moment.  But to be honest I’m scared of getting too attached because of being burned from my last relationship.    **THOUGHTS ABOUT NC:**  I’m conflicted.  On one hand I do believe that it is in the grieving party’s best interest to cut contact ASAP but on the other hand it’s all situational.  I was with someone for 7 years, it would be impossible for me to just stop talking to her unless what she did was very foul.  But I’m also a results kinda guy, and since none of the talking resulted in us getting back togeter I’d just have rather never talked to her again.  What was the point?  Also, I will say that after 30 days nothing magical happens.  Just an FYI  **ADVICE GOING FORWARD:**  If you’re suffering, I would advise making yourself busy and moving on from you ex.  If you talk, don’t listen to what they say, watch what they do.  I made that mistake and never will again.  I asked a good friend how he moved on from his similar situation and these were his wise words:   “How did I get over the relationship... I didn't. You're not supposed to - not if it has real history and depth and if you both had long stretches during which you truly felt an unselfish love for each other. I carry that loss with me, and I'm lucky if I make it a full day without thinking about her at least once. We dated for 7 years - that's longer than plenty of marriages. It ended for a lot of reasons, but the primary one is that there came a time when we valued the relationship more than we valued each other - what I mean is that we didn't want to lose the relationship, so we started to hide shit from each other, be dishonest about what we wanted and needed at different times... Also, life is just a bitch sometimes. Timing is a bitch. Circumstance is a bitch.”  Ironically that made me feel better.  He's living his life of course, but he kept it real.  Best of luck to others on this journey of recovery.   **tl;dr**: Was together 7 years, broken up for 2, FINALLY hit the 30 day NC period.   I honestly wish more women were like this.  As a man I can tell you that most jobs suck.  You're not missing out on anything.   Last time I wore a suit in Vegas I felt overdressed.  But that's just me.   I'm a black guy and I hate the term African-American for that very reason.   Just being blatantly honest... You did this to yourself by continuing to be her friend and internalizing your feelings. You were better off just being honest    Me too. Sometimes I'm having a down moment and this subreddit puts things in perspective    Eh, this happens more often than people think. Just don't bring him back an std or get pregnant and pawn the baby off on your husband and I won't judge you.    thanks for the suggestion tho!   I was hoping for something with a more narrow focus.   Eh, that's too rant-like.  I'd like to coalesce with other males who share my issues... not gripe at the world in general.   sort of like /r/bigdickproblems  but different.   Oh ok. Thanks for the bg info!   Being drunk with firearms sounds like a bad combination anyway.   I'm sorry but what's the big deal about this?   While noble, people have been shot for doing this.  Tread lightly.   He clearly says TWO LANE highway though.   No!  Don't do it!  What would be the point?  What would you gain?  You're going to completely ruin anything you've gained from going NC if you do it.  From what you've said, it sounds like she gave you a BS reason for breaking up in the first place.  I'm telling you, if you do it you're only going to prolong your torture.  I could see if you guys were still friends but you're not even talking.  I've seen this go bad too many times.  The guys gives his ex a gift while secretly hoping it makes her happy and in the end she feels that the gift is pressure to get back with him and subsequently does something to hurt his feelings.  (whether on purpose or inadvertently)     What you're experiencing is normal.  But I have some bad news, it may not change.  The best thing you can do right now is focus on things you can control versus focusing on something you can't (your ex).  It's going to be tough, but hang in there.  You're very young.  I suggest you keep working on yourself and live your life.   As a black guy I could do everyone of these tips and it wouldn't matter.  My facial hair grows out like individual curly fries.     I agree.  I bought my first house at age 26 and lost $20k when I sold it three years later because I moved to take a promotion.  Luckily my company took half of my loss so it was manageable but I won't buy another house again until I feel I'm completely settled and married.  It makes no sense to own if you're not going to stay in the same spot for at least 5 years.  And I need to be flexible right now.   He was walking back to his father's house in that neighborhood.  But your use of the word "wandering" tells us where you stand on this issue.  Regardless, he didn't deserve to die.   Your post said nothing about intention.  You mentioned the result of being late as a consequence of traffic.  My point is that if your grandma was in the car and you were in traffic due to a regular accident you're still fucked.   A few things sir...  1.  Hispanic is not a race.  There are plenty of white Hispanics. 2.  Hundreds of trials may end the same way but this was the one that THE MEDIA blew up. Nobody has time to keep up with every trial.  Why are you surprised that this one got more outrage than a local case? 3.  There are plenty of protests for black on black crimes.  But once again the media doesn't cover it and posters like yourself aren't going to go look for them.   4.  I don't know their rhyme or reason.  Honestly, these people stuck in traffic did nothing to Trayvon Martin so I agree with that.   What stereotypes would that be?  Oh you mean the one about protesting and blocking highways?  Not sure I've ever heard that one.   Wouldn't this still be applicable if traffic was held up for a regular car accident?  I'm not sure I see your point.   Walk by the people standing/sitting around watching the game, project your voice and say "Who's got next?"  If no one has it say, "Okay, I got next then."  Then you can also start asking people if they wanna play with you.  If someone has next then ask them if they have 5 people.  If they have a team ask who has next after them.  Wash. Rinse. Repeat   I'm in the wrong line of business...   I'm at the point now that I can only play simple games that don't require a high learning curve.  I also can't play RPGs because I'll get them started, play for a couple of months, not play them for a year, and try to pick them back up again only to spend an hour going "Where the hell am I supposed to go next?" and get discouraged and turn it off just to play a simple game.   Since she has her new boyfriend she already made her choice.  Respectfully tell her not to contact you any more.  It sucks but I know the feeling.  I just recently did this with my ex of 7 years.  It hurts like hell but you gotta have some self-respect at the end of the day and an ex contacting you with no intentions of reconciliation is just being selfish.   I know them feels.  *bro hug*   There's no right or wrong way to handle this.  You've expressed how you felt and now you can go forward knowing that you tried.  I just wanted to share my story with you.  What happens next and how you handle it will be the key part.  It can be the difference between suffering for the next few months or suffering for the next few years.  The reason that I said I wish I had never broken NC is because although it would have hurt, I would have eventually gotten over it and began the healing process much earlier.  Like I said, I'm better now but it's been two years since the breakup.  I should have moved on by now.  I wish the very best for you in the future.    I'm no expert but I've went through exactly what you did and while it feels good in the short term, that pain is waiting right around the corner.  Ultimately, contacting your ex doesn't lead to any answers.  Over time this will frustrate you even more.  Even if she did respond, unless it is to get back together you're still back where you started.  Breakups are probably one of the most complicated things a person will ever have to go through in life.  Things that make sense in normal situations make zero sense in a breakup.  I broke NC several times after being with someone for 7 years.  I eventually told myself that we could just be friends, but here I am 2 years later wishing that I NEVER broke NC.  Why?  Because nothing has changed.  I'm much better than I was before but I didn't get that closure I was seeking.  She never came back, even when I had that "Eureka!" moment similar to yourself.   Yeah, this looks safe.   Lies.   I don't agree with this tone.  The person comes off bitter and hateful.  How does this person know they will be around for the downfall?  What if it never happens?  Will they be miserable forever?  A better mentality is wishing the best for yourself instead of wishing the worst for someone else.  It is necessary to move on.   What's so awesome about this outfit?   Why don't they ever list the inseams as part of the sizes?   Really?  It's kind of late to be applying to the top schools when classes start in a few months.  I would think you would have applied by now and known your fate.  	50
 And I'm glad you did. I've been there - made plans, got everything prepared, and then - boom - at the last second it becomes a one man party. And I spiral out in much of the same way. It's the depression. You're beating yourself up for reasons you're not even sure of, and when you're depressed, your mind instantly goes to the darker places. Did he explain why he had to bail? Is he a friend you can trust? Because if he is, err on the side of friendship, and trust him. Or, is he someone you feel you can't trust (and do your best to think through the fog that depression envelops your mind with)? If he is someone you feel you can't trust, as much as it pains me to say, you may want to reconsider your friendship. Or - when you do get him to sit down with you, see if he's willing to discuss it openly with you. Then go from there.   And I'd like to say, likewise to you, Triple. Depression is a road best not traveled alone. It sounds like you want to help - and trust me, you can. Sharing your own experiences with depression, the emotions it brings on, and what you do to get yourself through it can help others get through their own situations. And when you find yourself feeling down, we'll return the favor.   Don't apologize, and venting helps. It gets it off your chest. And I'd like to start out by pointing out that you've noticed the people "who has the confidence to go out there and make a change for themselves" - when you just proved through your own words that you ARE one of those people, at least in that respect. How many people don't care about themselves enough to take care of themselves? You obviously go to the gym for a reason - to work out, right? And what does working out lead to? It leads to a healthy body. It sounds like you have a lot working against you, but mainly, it sounds like you're working against yourself. There are situations in life that you can't control, no one can. Those are the situations you need to learn to let go of. It's hard - it's downright hellish. But it's possible. Let go of those situations, and grab what you -can- control with a firmer grip. Keep going to the gym, keep working out - it helps in a lot of ways. As for you job - I can relate. I absolutely hate my job, and I work for one of those soulless corporations that just don't give two shits about anything but the bottom line. But you, like me, are not your job. It's simply what you do to pay the bills. If it really is that bad, start looking for another one. There's absolutely no reason you should continue working somewhere you feel under-appreciated. As for goals and dreams, those take time and effort, but mostly time. It takes reality time to catch up to your dreams, as long as you're putting forth the effort to make it happen. You want to be a better person? You are who you are, and unless you're off intentionally hurting people, you're better than you realize. I'm glad you reached out and shared how you're feeling. It's a moment, and it will pass. If this moment sucks, then set your sights on the next, and do whatever you can within your power to ensure it's better than the last. That moment turns out to be not much better, then again - adjust your sights to the next one. And the next, if you have to. And when you need to feel less alone, come here. This is my first day spending some serious time on reddit, and I'm finding that the people in this sub are more than willing to help. I hope this helps. And I really hope things start looking up for you.   If you don't have any plans, I'd suggest coming here and being open and honest about what you're dealing with, and what the day means to you. But the most important thing that I noticed about what you just said is this - "Two years ago". You made it past that date once already, you can do it again. You've shown that strength once, and that strength is still inside you. But again, if you're having trouble, maybe put aside to come here and ask for help. There are a lot of people here who can - and will - help you through that day.  There's no reason for you to face it alone.   He's right - as hard and cold as some people act, they're human, and they have their own experiences, some of which may parallel your own. Like teklord said - it never hurts to ask.   Happens to me too when I witness massive amounts of love and compassion. I've found myself fighting tears more than a few times today while exploring this sub. You're not alone there. :)   That's the problem with humans - they're human. People who help do so for a variety of reasons, and you nailed it on the head with "some people do it to feel better" and "because they truly care" - and there's a myriad of reasons in between. For myself, I help because until recently, I dealt with the bulk of my depression alone, and in my head. It's only recently that I came out to my own family and said "I don't know how much longer I can do to this, and I know I can't do it alone". But until I did that, I just let the weight of my own depression crush me. My wife was there to help at times, my family was there at times, but even then, I hid the bulk of what I was going through. I tried to do it alone, and it nearly killed me. But now, I'm very open about my depression and how it's effected me. I share my experiences because I want to help people - I want them to know they're not alone, that there is hope, even when that voice in your head is screaming that it's hopeless.  And autumn is still quite some time away, and whatever you're going through, you don't have to go through it alone. Open up - talk. You may be surprised by what you hear in return, as long as you're willing to accept the help offered, and regardless of what you may think of the persons intentions. If someone offers you help, and you think their reasons are less than honorable, I'd suggest still listening to what they have to say. Put it like this, my dad tells me this all the time - "If you buy a book, and all you get out of it is one idea, then that book was well worth the cover price".   Try telling them that. Don't even feel selfish about it - straight up ask them how much they rely on you, how much they need you, and put it into context. I've done it before myself - I've gone to my sister and asked her to help me through some hard times by just reminding me that I'm loved, and that, without me her world would be a bit darker. It helped me immensely, and if you chose to do it, I hope it works out for you as well.   Admitting you need help is not a sign of weakness - these days, that's (as far as I'm concerned) a serious show of strength. And the fact that you came here and posted your thoughts and shared with us how you're feeling tells me that you're not ready to let go. Sounds to me like you know that your story isn't over, and that you have more to tell. Go to the doctor, get the lesion checked, and tell them about your mindset. You've admitted you want help, now the next step is to seek it - but that's a step only you can take. You've been through a lot, you admitted it yourself, and when you try to take on a burden that heavy by yourself, I'm sorry, but it risks crushing you beneath it. If your friends aren't there to support you, then they're not much of friends. But you do need support, and coming here and getting that off your chest is a step in the right direction to finally healing, to re-sparking your passion for life. The first sentence in your second paragraph proves that you've put a lot of work into yourself, becoming yourself, and accepting yourself. Suicide would only mean you're taking all that hard work and throwing it away, when it sounds to me like life is finally getting interesting, and finally worth living. Friends come and go - you can find new ones. But you're irreplaceable. Just reading what you wrote here makes me believe that. Here's a bit of a corny quote, but to be honest, corny quotes have helped me get to the point where I am today, even though I feel I've done everything in my power to prevent that - "I'm not telling you it's going to be easy - I'm telling you it's going to be worth it" (Art Williams). You're special, whether you want to admit that to yourself or not. You're unique, whether you want to admit that to yourself or not, either, but that right there - in a world that seems to value conformity over independence - is important. The world doesn't just need -you-, it really could stand to gain more people like you. I hope this helps, and I hope it finds you well.  	9
 haha caffeine for sure. thanks dude. congrats on graduating   post coital chilling. just being intimate and having pillow talk   mmm. the crazy thing is i was raised and sheltered in this christian bubble for so long i almost don't know how to interact with people not in that little microcosm   currently in deconversion. took a pretty big step and told my church that id be leaving. not sure if i should be completely honest and explain why.   edit it wasn't exactly a ceremonial or crazy process to deconvert, it was actually after i had smoked and was being completely honest with myself that i admitted, wow i don't even believe anymore.   i actually gave a eulogy when my friend died in 2010. i remember convincing myself and saying, wow god wanted him so bad, he's in a better place now, but looking back i realize and admit that i didn't and don't think he went anywhere. his consciousness left his body, and my friend is dead.    COMPLETELY AGREE   wow... great job   i laughed too hard at this one. belongs in /imgoingtohell   i love me too   agreed. physical/sexual abuse of anyone in my family   religion   that's a good one. you mean change perspective as in how you are viewed? or do you literally mean your line of sight since your back would be straighter      yeah i learned about that a little bit in my buddhism class. he never really claimed to be a deity, but was it his original teaching that buddhists would be reincarnated? or that there is an afterlife? or was that based on something else   This is one of the questions that still bothers me. Who was Jesus if christianity isn't real? I guess this goes for Muhammad and Buddha too. Did these guys all just convince themselves they were actual deities?   definitely think about it. one of my best friends died couple years ago and i gave his eulogy before my deconversion. i said the basic christian comforting lines and i also said it so i would feel better too. but now that i think about it, i have to admit to myself that he's just dead and gone. its painful but thats what ihave to rationalize. when my mom had cancer, i was tempted to pray, even though my brain knows that there probably isnt anyone listening   that's from just 7 weeks? that's awesome  	16
 have full blown conversations with my cat.   the drama. with my guy friends we can just forget about life and do something fun. but with my girl friends its always "remember that bitch that did that thing 3 months ago? guess what happened this time".    I met her in 4th grade and she attacked me the first time she saw me. I was the first person who actually put up a fight and lasted a little while before we both fell on the floor and laughed. we soon found out that we are equally crazy and random and have almost identical interests. we are practically sisters now and we still have a strong relationship despite the fact that she moved out of state last summer.    my worst nightmare happened 3 years ago and I will never forget it. in my nightmare I had committed suicide. my body was dead but my spirit still lingered in the house. I remember watching as my body was taken from the bedroom and brought down to the morgue. I watched my funeral and I stayed as they buried me. But things started to change at home. I was no longer there for my mom to beat on so she turned toward my 7 year old sister. every day became endless torture watching her get hit and slapped and yelled at, knowing that I was powerless to save her. all i could do was hold her close and tell her that everything was going to be okay, even though I knew she couldnt hear or see me. I woke up crying and went over to hug my sister. I promised her that I would always be there for her no matter what.   	4
 You're supposed to stomp?   I thought it just broke up after a while and went down.   I would think not... but... you know, maybe ask?   A virus... uh... finds a way...   Hold on, let me google that for you...  No, 2 kids.   22k since last oil change Hyundai rolls up.   "Take it to tire kingdom, I'm not touching that."  Loud seizing noises from shop next door.   "No, it won't help any."  EDIT: Fun fact, I had a 'mechanical engineer' tell me not to replace his 10k overdue Mercedes air filter because he knew it was fine.   Yeah. UP is 6 years old now. So is Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Hurt Locker, and District 9.   Jaycee Dugard was on the top of the news... yeah WHO?   No, that's just a first gen real doll.   SOME OF US TAKE LONGER THAN OTHER TO REALIZE WE ONLY WANT MEDIOCRE LIVES OK?!   TL;DR  If you're gonna go, go quick.   Is there any other way to be?    Go back to your fucking hole, dumbass.   You don't know how a cock right works, do you?   Bro, you should have left yourself some space, bro.   Bro, chill out bro.   Sure thing bro-bro.   Bro, brobro, brobruhbro. Bruhbruhbrobrah. Brosephus, the brostorian, teller of brotales and sayer of brosooths.   That's a shame, some of the stuff is pretty cathartic. Like shooting one of those stupid MTV Sweet 16 birthday bitches...   Or that dude who says bro wayy too much.    Light something on fire and inhale the fumes...   Yeah, completely healthy.   In civ ghandi's aggression was set to 0. Then he would choose freedom ideology with came with a -2 aggression setting him to the top of the scale as you couldn't have a negative. It hadn't anything to do with his number of cities.    The whole series of CC was on origin for like 10 bucks a few weeks ago.   And then that glitch when you left it at reduced funding for a while, your roads went to pot and when you tried to increase funding, it would only go down.   Oh man, this whole thread is funny.   I like how everyone forgot three rights make a fucking left.   Yeah, I figured.   Unimproved tiles. Gotta get those done man.    I've seen the game drop an icon over a unit on occasion.   It'll show up at some point.  EDIT: Why is your capital so poorly developed?   They could make it so that a garrisoned unit is similar to an unemployed citizen. And then make it so you can buy a unit while another is in the city.    in every interview I would read.  How do you get tone from text unless you put it there yourself?   Something like an endangered or over-harvested element.   I dunno. I'm really tired.   Oh yeah, piggyback rides.   :(   The problem with your argument is that you are assigning a rare disorder to the larger population.   That's like saying intelligent people shouldn't have a bias towards them because a small group of them ended up head of a despotic dictatorship.   The common thread I'm finding here is that you believe bias towards height is unearned and based in genetic phantoms from our African savanna past and that it should be irrelevant.   I hope you don't like women who have symmetrical faces or slightly wider hips.   So again, you're upset because of a slight mass bias towards taller people?   'Fresh water'   Dafuq?   What's going on? All I'm seeing is their steam profile.   "Not talking about height. I spend most of my time talking about heightism."  So you're mad because people believe that height is a marker for better genetics, or ability to take care of a family? Are you also mad at attractive people for being attractive?   Not to mention physical diseases too.   I never plan on having kids.    I haven't been crowdsurfed on, but I feel like this is justification for dropping their ass.   Right about 375.   I'm dense as fuck.   It's always one thing or your mother.   Yeah, because the doors are about as thick as a crushed soda can.   If they ask a stupid question, they should expect a stupid answer.    Block party. I like that one.   The point is to get people to question what they've been told, why they believe etc. Most people end up believing the religion they grew up in, without truly thinking about what it means.   And then there are the people who use religion to justify murder, and fuck what those people think. If they want to be irrational asshats, fine, but don't expect me to give any consideration to their feelings.   What happens when people don't think about what the believe, they become dogmatic and hardliners in getting others to believe, follow, and respect. Extremism begins when you don't allow others to question your beliefs.    Still are.   Fuck that cheap Eagle bullshit.   I know what it's like to go through that at a young age. I'm glad you are better now.   Having experienced depression, did you find it easy to get up and go exercise? Or did you just want to say fuck it and give up, live under your blanket and not do anything?    You do realize that it's the equivalent of walking into a game of wheelchair basketball right?    Some people drink, some people sleep around, some people do drugs, some people eat as a mechanism to cope with shit.   I'm going to assume you've never dealt with depression.   Depression is fucking shitty.   Then that guy needs to be provided with better heat protection.   How hard is it to be at the place you said you were going to be at the time you said you were going to be there?   I absolutely understand that having kids, there was a delay in traffic because some jackass merged into a semi, and the like, but sans shit like that.... you should never be late.   And it would have gone right over her head.   It's OK, I know what you meant. I don't have an accent either.   I have a Corolla.   "Is PEPSI OK?"   "Was the fucking holocaust OK?"   And then the next night you'd have $4, then $8...   After 14 nights you'd have $8192  30 nights you'd have more than half a billion. Clearly you'd have to increase the denominations of the bills. You can fit a million in 100's in a plastic grocery bag, a billion on a pallet 6' high.    landlocked  has rivers  wut.   Lap? I'm not sure it could actually make a full circle on the test track.   *subjected to shitty opinions.   FourLoko is still legal in east Tennessee.   I was kind of surprised when I saw that.

Doing nothing is the least costly option here.   "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, and fuck you, I'm out!"   Was that because she couldn't run?    Looks like a giant winged harbinger of doom.    First day of the fall semester of college and a couple of girls are moving into their dorm.   Girl from Georgia walks in and sees a girl from Connecticut and her mom hanging curtains.   First girl says "Hey! Where y'all from?"

The paint helps protect against the extreme changes in temperature blah, blah, blah.   It would be nice to see something in that classy 50's-60's style.

Appropriate immediate response.  http://i.imgur.com/rpSrKF1.gifv   You don't know me, my background or what I believe towards how business and the state should operate. I haven't derided you in anyway, or inserted personal judgments in my statements. I'm looking at this from a logical point, and you keep trying to belittle me through statements that you have no proof for on top of attributing points of view that I haven't expressed.   Calm down, just because I don't agree with how this might work out, doesn't mean I am Satan incarnate.    Pay attention to the words I am using, not the context you think is there. Think of this as monotone as you can make it.  the tax credit is worth less than the amount they would be applying to student loans. The company gets a $450 dollar tax credit a year if they spend 1,800 a year paying down an employees debt  The company spends more on paying down student loans, than they would receive in tax credit, which (again) would not encourage hiring of new college grads. This requires businesses to spend more than they receive, which they are not inclined to do.  I think that as a means to an end, it's a bit too complex and likely ineffective.   Just because it's AN answer doesn't make it the BEST answer.    Better than Ron Paul.   10th grade learning strategies class.   This wouldn't encourage businesses to hire college grads because the tax credit is worth less than the amount they would be applying to student loans.   the point of this is to pay down the loans not give businesses more money.    State Legislatures hold most of the control for tuition rates in state schools, University of Florida, or Michigan State are examples.   Private and for-profit schools need to have their reigns pulled in though, for sure.   Its more of remarking on how stupid it is that helping an individual is frowned upon or worse, but helping business is the best thing in the world.   The idea that they have to go this far around to help pay down student debt because of appearances is ri-goddamn-diculous.   I know right?   /r/60fpsporn    Spring is bukakke season.   tea_funbags?   Of course the UK doesn't win a world cup...   I take issue when people say stolen about paying taxes. Its inflammatory and misrepresents the situation.   I didn't say they were undeserving of the money I said everyone benefits more when we all have the ability to do better on a personal level. Especially the rich.    I haven't been here since the war, chroman? generals?   wut?   Unfortunately I think we need to start resorting to pictographs.   Two kinds of people.   You're forgetting how much it costs to live. A loaf of bread costs the same for everyone, but it is a larger portion of total income to a poor person.   There's basically a minimum cost of living if you have a place to live and that cost doesn't necessarily increase the more money you make. If you take 5% of someone making 20k versus 100k, the person making 20k has to make harder choices to cut, as opposed to the 100k person.   The 100k person can still invest, afford property, play and not have to worry about paying the electric, or rent. the 20k person has much less room to save money, which means they can't take the actions that would allow them to increase their wealth like buying property, investing in retirement or the stock market.   The point isn't that the person making 2mil doesn't deserve it, the point is that we operate more successfully if more people have the opportunity to make 2 mil.   Some people just can't math.   Its like you should know better than to judge people at like 4.30 in the morning at a donut shop.   I mean, you probably looked homeless too.   The fck is going on?   Traffic light near me turns red for no one to spend FUCKING FIVE GODDAMN MINUTES for nonexistent oncoming traffic.  Super heavy traffic in the middle of the day, not a damn soul at 3 in the morning. Someone forgot to turn the timer off for nighttime.   Oddly enough, natives are overwhelmingly O and B type blood.   I'm not familiar with individual tribes and you should get in touch with the tribal council, they deal with these things on a regular basis.   However, it would really depend on the tribal hospital having a birth record of the grandmother being born to a native. As in on the birth certificate being born to 'this person' who is a tribe member.   Then the father has to have his birth certificate updated, and then her birth certificate. Its a pain in the ass, and it will take a while, but it can be worth it.   I'm getting health insurance for $0 co-pay $0 deductible because I have my certificate of native blood.   Fucking fascist.   Sorry, all this lovey, not hating each other stuff felt a little weird. LOL.    they are mostly Native.  I don't believe you.    I worked on Steve Southerlands campaign  http://i.imgur.com/3k79KjF.png   Came so hard, his dick fell off.   Some Mexicans do. Some Native Americans are short. But statistically, Native Americans tend to be taller than their Caucasian counterparts.   Jackass.   I get the tone. I just want to make sure we don't repeat mediocrity because someone isn't able to understand sarcasm.   Also, defending my point because alcohol.   Take that you fucking Islamic State asshats.   "that the experience has taught him to "never give up." "  Christ. Seriously, respect people's wishes. If someone does not want to be kept alive on a machine past a certain point, let them go.   Also, get a medical directive set up. You could be in a shitty crash today and be in just pain for the rest of your life unless you tell your family.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tet_Offensive  "Winning Militarily" huh?  The opponent was maybe out-numbered, seriously outgunned and still gaining ground on a strategic level.   On a just war, no politics level, they were handing us our ass in a war of attrition.   Confidence in being able to resolve an issue =/= hubris when we lose.   Oh jesus. Grow a pair you pussy bitch.   Cute kitty. I like the jeans bit.   Is that how we explain retreat? Instead of owning up to our mistakes and saying, "Shit."    I'm more of asking who has documented blood.  Not that 1/64th on you dad's side bull.   I just got my certificate. Who here has traceable blood?   This is the funniest film review I've read.   Maybe that's the 40 i just finished talking, but still. Hilarious.   But... the North Vietnamese won....   Those are campaign donations.   It is actually pretty different than just paying the candidate.   Scummy as fuck, but still different.   Tithe, Religious Community, then swords into plowshears or divine inspiration (because wonderlust) and Religious texts.  Religious texts really helps with tithe if you have nearby friendly city states or a major civ that didn't get a religion.   Marconi Union (ambient) Deadmau5, some soundtracks.   I prefer Order for a science victory. +25% science from factories is pretty kick ass and I can stockpile engineers to complete spaceship parts.   Plus if you focus on science over gold, outright purchasing parts is kinda difficult.   Should have named it timeout or something.   There are advantages to Rollins.

 Yeah I gave a vague medical reason why I had to take a leave of absence from my last job before I got laid off but my weight was so extremely low that I'm sure everyone knew why I was leaving. Now that I'm back to a healthy weight I'm really hoping I can pull through with a medical problem/caring for a family member excuse without raising too many eyebrows. I hate calling it an excuse since it really WAS necessary that I got help but you know what I mean.   It really does, thanks. It's just nice to know that I'm not alone and that other people understand what I'm going through.  I've been trying to start up my creative side again and do some writing and drawing projects, but I am terrible with self-motivation and I tend to get incredibly frustrated when I'm trying to wake my brain back up and get back to caring about things for their own sake. I'm trying really hard and I'm just at the point where I need to have just a little bit of expectation from someone other than my therapist to get me motivated. I'm going to keep at it though :)  	2
 not me. but my best friend literally called yesterday to say he bought condoms, soap, and paper towels. only those 3 things.    eerie!!!   "its too hot" "its too cold"  people will never be satisfied with the damn weather   honestly rn mh370   actually or jonbenet   for real it would make it so much easier   I love being alone but I'm lonely    christ this song is good. yes i agree. i have a spotify playlist called you're feeling emotional and when answering your question it was hard to decide which one to write hah ;)    really well put. i relate to this tremendously. dont end it, we cant lose any more of us.    ill definitely check out Best Deceptions. Glad you liked the song, it wrecks me.    Ace Enders-Motion   Yeah the mom thing sounds about right :( so I'm thinking about things that don't cost money...it may sound silly but are there any support groups in your area for people with mental illnesses? Sometimes just being around people that feel similarly could help tremendously ya know    Hey..sorry things are so rough right now. You must feel at a complete loss. Have you ever gotten professional help for this?   Yeah, this is me, always. It's where the awful assumption "people aren't depressed they're just lazy" comes from. I think getting engrossed in tv or not harmful thoughts pushes away the bad thoughts. Or sometimes I can't clean my room because I physically can't get up and do it, not because I don't want to. It sucks when people don't understand. I think it's good you're recognizing it at least    Thank you very much    Hey guys,  I was wondering what everyone's favorite or go to self care is when they are feeling down. I used to go to eating, but now thy a I'm seeing a nutritionist and trying to stop binge eating I'm looking for new ways to promote self care within myself.  Thanks for any advice in advance   Every damn day. Thanks for putting it into words    Thank you. You put it into words.   it was a little too close to a swastika for me know what im sayin          "I'm confused about my sexuality"   20f and you sir, are attractive    Crop top and high waisted shorts for the love of everything holy a crop top should not be the same price as a normal shirt anway?????

I was looking around and realized this probably was not normal and everybody else on the plane wasn't going through this. I told my mom I needed help.   I'm 20 and doing ok now :) there's just one last unhealthy behavior I'm sorting out  Thanks for asking   Ace Enders-motion  Holy feels.   Is my ugliness boootthhherring you?!  	30
 You lucky bastard.   Just let her do it. It'll be worth it. For me.    The relief!!!   I can't stop laughing at this   Two....only two big ones?   ....I still think blankets are the safest bet against monsters and ghosts.   Of course not. On this subreddit?   Don't resist! Give in!   Show AND tell. Sweet. My health teacher made our class say 'penis' and 'vagina' over and over again until we didn't laugh. It didn't work.   Loved that game.   I think I appreciate videos like these more than other because it's an actual popping video, and not one of someone constantly wiping a cyst.   ....ingrown wig.   Those are the bestttttt   *cries impatiently*   ....which one?   You have to forgive yourself. Let go of the past and be there for Seth now. Don't be so hard on yourself, life is too short. I know it's easier said than done, I understand your guilt, but being in the background is worse than being completely absent, because the only thing that's holding you back is fear.   You did more than you know by being there for her! I mean it. Divorce is so hard to go through, no matter what age, and you were a safe, positive, and happy environment for her. It is so important for young minds to recognize a place where they feel safe, and you gave that to her. Keep your head up!   	17
  we can came much closer to lol  Pretty sure nobody cares about or wants that. If they wanted to play LoL, they'd play LoL.   It's 7 minutes already. If it started at 7 and increased as the game progressed, how would you scale that?   1 minute extra per 10 minutes of game time would lead to buybacks being 12 minutes at 50 minutes. But people rarely buy back in the first 30 of the game anyway. The only reason they do is to get immediately back into an engagement to turn the tide for their team, which is the opposite of what OP is talking about. And that extra 5 minutes isn't really anything.     Aghs Tinker and BF SB are really the only things I see wrong with this. Having faith that his Perseverence is for a Linkens and not Refresher.  No supports on the Dire but that happens in every bracket.   No.    buy a force staff and push me into a pudge hook or something  I've done similar things unintentionally just trying to be helpful. Oh shit the carry got arrowed, I have a Force Staff, I'll save him! Oh...he was facing the enemies...my bad.    The bad thing in that style of gameplay is that it needs skilled team and people willing to co-operate, both lacking from 90% of pub players.   Not strategies, just specific heroes.  I basically learned how to play Puck from watching s4 do it and then trying him out in pubs after I saw how it was done. Now I laugh at the 3k Pucks that choose him and don't orb over cliffs to escape ganks, or phase shift Assassinates, etc.   Just an example. You'll also learn what builds are appropriate for what situations from the casters (assuming you're watching good ones) and why. It's something you'll eventually learn by playing, but I learned way faster watching vods.  I never played a game like Dota before this. Closest I came was 4 years of World of Warcraft. My initial calibration when I calibrated back in October 2013 was 1.8k. Rose to 2.2k or so over the next year, but completely stagnated. Since then I've risen to 3.1k, and I can attest a ton of it to watching tournament vods.   We know.   From what I've seen in my pubs LC is amazing against Crystal Maiden. However, the other 4 heroes shit stomp her.   Pretty much this. Everyone knew that after Puppey left NaVi just wasn't going to be the same.    Empire taking a (albeit former) NaVi player? Is it April Fools Day or something?   Earth Spirit wrecks every hero provided you actually can play him to his full capabilities. I've never tried to learn him, but apparently up in 4-5k he's absolute hell to play against.   Currently it's FL!P. This is taken from my handle in pretty much all of my other games which is Candy Flip. A Candy Flip is when you do LSD and MDMA at the same time. Really fun to do, and Candy Flip is a pretty sweet name. Came up with FL!P because there are some people I don't exactly want to explain a drug reference to, and the exclamation point instead of the i is kind of like flipping the i over. I dig it.   Probably my favorite Brit song. Womanizer is up there too though. Upvote.   She's picked often. Teams usually wait until 4th or 5th pick to get her because if you pick her up too early it gives away your plan and it can be countered. The downside to that is she is also often banned in the last stages because pro teams can see what you're going for and how she would fit into it, and ban her.   I learned more from watching pro games than I ever would have learned by just playing the game.  You see pros playing heroes to their full capability. When you see it done, you can replicate it with some practice. If you're 1k, 2k, 3k even MMR you'll rarely see a hero played to it's fullest.   Shadow Demon is a support I might start picking against Troll. Disruption/Force Staff to save an ally, Purge goes through BKB.   Bane's Fiends Grip can lock him down too provided you position yourself well.  The problem with Troll is you need to 5v1 him. And that means the rest of his team, under the benefit of his ult, destroys your team.   The instant Skywrath silence is a bigger counter than Kotl.   I use it as a mind game. There have been numerous times where I told the enemy team to gg ff mid and we had 4 heroes smoked off to the side, they went in for racks, we surprised them and 5 wiped them, proceeding to get a bunch of gold from comeback mechanics to eventually win the game.  ez mmr   Wraith King is great for a 4-turned-core role. Build an early midas to help get your level 16 and some better farm and you're solid.   People always insta pick WR when I pick Troll. Okay she can run away from you, big deal. Build MKB - useless WR. If you even need to.  Lina is great against Troll if you play her well. Her Aghs upgrade destroys him, and you can Euls him or yourself to potentially survive if he goes on you in a teamfight. If he bashes you you're fucking dead though.     Maxing Tide is one of those things where it's not what you SHOULD do, but it works well enough to get away with it.   Haha actually you're right, especially if you hit it at a slightly wrong angle and ended up trapped inside of the rubble instead of going through. Happened to me a few times.   Roaming with carries is generally a bad idea because you should be using that time to be farming up early items, unless you're in a 4 or 5 core lineup where someone else has farm priority.  The best roaming supports, in my opinion, are Earthshaker, Skywrath, Lion, Lina (if the lane has a setup stun), Venomancer with boots first isn't bad if you land the gale, SD/Bane assuming theres lockdown to follow the Disruption/Nightmare.   Pocket Abaddons when I play PA are fucking beautiful.   It's Eul's that needs a bit of a nerf, not Lina. She just benefits from it massively.  Her Aghs ult is extremely strong right now. I wouldn't say it's too strong, but it's up there for best Aghs upgrade in the game.   Depends on where you're laning him. Tidebringer is insane harassment, but it also pushes the wave extremely hard.   If you're mid or safe lane, you should max torrent and X for kill potential at 6 in my opinion. If you're safe, you don't want to continuously push the lane, if you're mid you're most likely going up against someone with a bottle that can regen through your harassment.  The Tidebringer max isn't useful except for being extremely fucking annoying to play against, and helping you farm in a way. However, Kunkka isn't a hero that you want to be farming that much realistically. Kunkka doesn't rely on items, he relies on proper usage of his skill combinations. A good Kunkka doesn't need tons of farm to be useful, hence why maxing Tidebringer is just annoying for the other team.   Icefrog fucked Necro in pubs by putting a support tag on him on his profile. He's not a support at all. Even though his support tag has been removed, a lot of ignorant players still believe him to be a support because of that reason.  Also any hero with a built in heal and that Mek is core on is automatically a support in trash tier players' eyes.   That would be retarded.  I think the pick/ban setup in CM could use adjustment though.  What about 3 bans to start (per team), then 2 picks, 1 ban, 2 picks, 1 ban, 1 pick.  We're seeing the same 4 out of 10 heroes picked in the first phase in over 90% of games. This would mean each team gets to ban another hero before they pick their initial 2.  Just a thought.   I'm surprised it took Radiant 64 minutes to win that game.   2000 MMR?   PA/Abaddon/CM. Such a deadly trio. Found this out in a 30 minute stomp last night. We took racks at 20 minutes and Abaddon and I (the PA) didn't leave the enemy base until the game was over.   He's easy to play, but takes a lot of practice to play well. The combination of your X Marks ability, Torrent and Ghost Ship will take a lot of positioning knowledge and timing practice to be done correctly. Don't get discouraged if you don't land them immediately.  Also, a neat trick, if you're running a bottle, cast X Marks on yourself, TP to base, and you get a free bottle refill when it brings you back.   Yeah that's intended.   If I'm in ranked I'm trying to win every game.  I don't play unranked except to practice heroes or different builds.   IG is one of my favorite teams to watch, have been since before last years TI.  They were actually my pick to win TI4 in the Compendium, but alas they let me down.   It's not complicated.  If the DC happens before first blood, and he does not reconnect in 5 minutes, regardless of if first blood happens, the game will not count.  If the DC happens before first blood, then first blood happens, and he reconnects within five minutes, the game will count.  People are stupid.   The idea is that if you pick captain, you should be able to play every hero in the pool/that you draft, so if you draft a hero for yourself but one person on your team can only play that hero out of the others that you drafted, you should let them have it and play another hero.  I think if you're queuing for CM in the first place you should be able to play everything, but that apparently isn't the case.    If he doesn't have sceptre up   A early aghs on Doom is so fucking strong  Learn to read.   Most good Dooms are buying Tranquils these days and will start with a RoP. If they're concerned about getting ganked or harassed, they'll devour a Wildwing and get the aura. Between the two of those that's +6 armor, for a total of 7 potentially at level 1.  Have fun.   I'm 3k and I actually prefer playing at these hours. Generally the players are less skilled and I can take over a game easier.   Yesterday morning, maybe around 6 AM, I was Enigma and we had a WD on our team. The game was pretty close, I'd say we were in the lead around 35 minutes but it definitely could have gone either way. WD and I were running away from a team fight that we had just lost, followed closely by the 5 members of their team that had survived. We had a PL that got picked off earlier, that was respawning around this time. Radiant bottom lane, where our T1 used to be, I blinked into the trees, WD tried a juke spot. Our PL repsawned, TP'd into the T2 and started running to help us. Their team split into groups of 2 and 3, the 2 went after WD, who promptly casked and Aghs ulted them to death, and the group of 3 thought I TP'd out, so went after our PL. Luckily for me my Black Hole had just come off cooldown, and I BKB blinked into the center of them and used it with the aid of PL.  5 wipe, three of them rage quit. So satisfying.   Pick Troll Warlord. Easy MMR.   EG.  They'd cut you and ppd would pour salt in your wounds.   At least you don't forget you have items.  Can't even begin to count how many times I've forgotten to activate my Satanic.    More money won.  Xboct has won 3 times the amount EE has won in Dota 2.   Played one against a PL and a Meepo the other day.  Some of the most satisfying echo slams I've ever landed.   The players.   Can you site your source please   From dota2.gamepedia:    Juggernaut can perform normal attacks during Blade Fury icon.png Blade Fury, but these attacks will deal no damage to enemies being affected by Blade Fury icon.png Blade Fury.  So if I'm 1v1'ing an enemy hero, my auto attacks will do no damage to them while under they are being affected by Blade Fury. Things like Basher, MKB, Diffusal will still proc though.  Is this correct?  edit: Cool so I got reported in my last game for being correct. I hate people.   Depends on your carry. I've been picking AM against jug recently, he omnis me and I just blink away. Spectre can Haunt out of it. Manta Style softens the blow of it on those carries as well as someone like Dusa. Hell you can even build a shadow blade if jug doesn't have a slot for detection.  On the topic of AM though, it really shows how overpowered jug is that he outcarries an AM at every stage of the game with only needing an abyssal.   I think you could turn it off, but yeah it was stupid.   Doesn't change that Most Wanted was my favorite racing game of all time though. I honestly don't think I could find a flaw in that game. The gameplay was perfect, the soundtrack was perfect. I probably played through that like 4 times.   Yeah. The best time to gank is when their heroes are at half health due to lane harass, not when they've killed you 2 times and regenerated to full health and mana.   Draft nothing but high ground defense with one or two extremely good late game cores (Dusa and Spectre would work). Lose early game, lose all T2s, defend T3s, let comeback mechanics win the game for you.    I understand that this was what happened in the TI4 meta  It wasn't even that. Both teams picked early deathball lineups in the finals. Both knew that if they didn't get the extremely early lead, their lineup wasn't going to win. That's why we saw gg's at 20 minutes.   A huge change in comeback mechanics for the entire game was absolutely not needed based on a pro strategy draft in a tournament finals.     If one player is doing horribly, and are being toxic at the same time, I'll type a simple "wp" into chat every time they do something stupid. But that's all I'll do.  This pisses off the aforementioned player more than directly flaming them, and it does slightly heighten team morale because it's funny watching them get so pissed off.  Does it help you win the game? Not usually. But in what looks to be a sure loss, it helps lighten the blow.   God I fucking hate this. A game yesterday had a Troll mid on our team. Easy win right? No, he fucking sucked. As TROLL. Didn't go bottle, didn't go acquila, went directly into Phase/Shadow Blade. 25 minutes in all he had were Phase, SB and a morbid mask. I kept trying to tell him to go solo rosh after 15 minutes and his only response was "play your own hero."  We ended up winning, but definitely not because of him.   What I've noticed when people ask for ganks is that they don't ask when it's an opportune time for both parties. They ask when they're losing their lane.   While you may think this would be the best time to gank, it's really not. If the enemy has an advantage over you, the last thing you should be doing is going to gank their lane and potentially dying because they are so much stronger at that point.  When a side lane feeds 2 kills and demands that I gank, I never do. a 3v2 does not automatically ensure a victory, especially when it's essentially a 2v2 because you got wrecked.   The problem is that many heroes in this game are MEANT to excel in the first 20-30 minutes. That's when they're the strongest. These heroes are now punished moreso than before for having their early lead because of an ingame mechanic.  These heroes generally fall off in the late game anyway (Viper, QoP are two examples I can think of immediately). There is no need to punish early game dominators harder simply for dominating, when that's the point of the fucking hero.   Some racing games had this same mechanic. If you had a significant lead, the cars behind you went faster to catch up to you.   It was fucking retarded.   What I don't understand is if I queue, click Accept, and can't connect to the game, the home screen tells me the game is safe to leave. So I leave.  Then I'm prevented from matchmaking for 8 minutes for failing to ready up for my game. Okay valve.   Just won a 65 minute game because of comeback mechanics. The lineups were:  Drow, WR, Sniper, Timber, Techies on Dire (my team)  vs.  SF, LC, Necro, Invoker, Clock  WR fed SF 3 kills in the first 3 minutes. We lost the early game horrifically. SF bought a really quick BoTs and Shadow Blade, and him and Clock basically went around the map picking off the Drow and Sniper for the next 20 minutes. The only reason we won was because Techies just mined the shit out of the towers and lanes after we lost all T2s around 25 minutes and they couldn't push high ground.  Couple that with the comeback mechanics and synergy between Drow, WR and Sniper (massive damage boost from Drow aura) and we were able to win simply because one kill would give us something like 2k gold and we'd get an item.  We shouldn't have won that game. I'm not complaining necessarily because I got 25 MMR out of it, but without the current comeback mechanics that game would have been over in 35 minutes.  On the flip side, it does slightly prevent a complete mid domination (like this SF over our WR) from ending the game solo. In that case I like it because if 1 of your heroes feeds a ton but the other 4 are doing their job, you're not going to lose because 1 person fed a snow ball hero.  I don't exactly know where I stand with it. On one hand its stupid because if you're in a comfortable lead you should be allowed to win without an in-game mechanic punishing you harder for dying or losing a team fight, but it also slightly prevents snowball heroes from dominating and taking over a game and solo winning in 30 minutes due to a skill disparity, even though that's kind of the point of a snowball hero.   Then you run away and make him waste a BKB charge.    What? Bloodseeker is fine. Maybe I'm just really good at him, but he was the first hero I ever excelled at and I find him extremely fucking easy to pubstomp with. So easy that I don't even pick him.  Isn't he a Troll counter in a way? Build fast MKB and blade mail, Ult Troll, run at his face, pop blade mail. Troll can't do shit against you. He can TP away, but then I suppose that works too because now Trolls in base instead of raping your entire team.   Nobody can complain about the Weaver flair. I win!   That aghs ult is so fucking strong. Not overpowered necessarily, but god damn.   Eh. I love playing QoP, but I'd pick a Storm Spirit over her any day, and they accomplish pretty much the same goal.    They are really good cause no one knows what they do.  That made me chuckle.  But yeah, if you're sub 1k, learn Brood and just avoid fights and push towers. Remember that the point of this game isn't to get as many kills as possible, it's to take the enemies ancient. While the other 9 people are fighting mid at 15 minutes, rat away taking side lane racks and win the game because of it. I highly doubt anyone will buy dust to counter you, and if they do, it'll only be one person. And Brood is a pretty great 1v1'er, so you should be fine.   100 cs by 15 minutes  That's actually pretty difficult in the trench considering after minute 8 heroes constantly just run at you. If you pick a hero that can rotate to the jungle early then yeah you're fine, but in that case your hero pool is limited.   I don't think invis heroes like Clinkz or Riki will ever be super prominent in the meta, simply because you counter invis heroes with a 180 or 200g purchase.   He's really great pubstomper, but skilled players will rarely be caught out alone because they know to expect a Clinkz looking for them.    500 MMR detected   If throwing is losing one team fight when you're ahead, that's fucking retarded.   Damnit. My dreams are crushed.   2k you say?  Brb making my 11 year old half brother a dota account, battle point boosting him to 13 and queuing with him so I can roflstomp OP.   If you're radiant you can use the dire camp to pull your creep wave over, which messes with their equilibrium. If you're dire you're pretty SoL just try to not die and get levels and you've done your job.   75% win rate with him and I just realized today that the damage, hp and armor didn't scale with points into the ability.  He's too easy.   Because you steal stats at a faster rate, increasing your AS/damage at an even higher rate on a hero that has an invisibility ultimate that can't be countered by true sight and gives you faster health regeneration as well coupled with the lifesteal, and bonus movement speed if you don't kill the target during the duration of the Pounce leash.     Play to win in Ranked, play for fun in Unranked is usually what I tell people.    Been playing Dota since the Warcraft 3 days   370 hours racked up in Dota 2  He's not going to be sub 1k.   I think all he really needs is base movement speed reduced by 10 and his inherent bash removed, allowing him to build Skull Basher.  This hero does far too much work with just SnY and BKB, as well as being able to scale to the late game incredibly well. He has a built in 3k gold item on a hero whose ult allows him to reach max attack speed. That's kind of stupid.   I've wanted to try building MoM on Slark. I've seen people do it in trench tier incorrectly all the time, but if you combine it with orchid that's a fuckton of damage.  SB/Blink in, Orchid, Pounce/Dark Pact, wait for DP damage to stop ticking, activate MoM.   Retards build MoM and use it before Dark Pact and end up killing themselves, but if you're not bad maybe it could work, especially in conjunction with Shadow Dance because nobody can physically attack you, you'd just need to avoid AoE or point target spells.   I don't sympathize with them at all. I'm all for region locking, but Valve won't do it.   Damnit I knew that. Must have had a brain fart.   Pick Troll Warlord, win game regardless of your team.   Because if they don't pick English their queue times are insanely massive most likely.   80% of reports I use give me notifications later that action was taken.    Pucks not that hard, you just need fast fingers and reflexes.   If you were implying he's one of the most fun though I agree.   Every jug builds MoM this would never happen.  The Troll would dominate it.   If nobody picks within the last 3 seconds of the first few rounds I just random.   We definitely don't need a reward for insta picking heroes.   If you start off with a lead, you must proceed to play a perfect game afterwards or else one mistake gives away the advantage you spent the last 10, 20, 30 minutes building. That's fucking retarded. It punishes lineups and heroes that excel early game, even though that's when a large number of heroes in this game are meant to excel.   It severely punishes players for playing sloppy. and at the same time greatly benefits players for playing well.  While in a way this is true, it's also misleading. One team can play horribly for the first 20 minutes, group up as 5 and get a few pick offs and the game is back to even.   If you have a lead, you shouldn't have to worry about a mechanic IN THE GAME that allows the losing team to come back easier.   It's the same premise in some racing video games where the farther you were out in first place, the faster your opponents were able to go to catch up with you. In most of them there was an option to turn this off, but it was stupid as all hell.   It applies to all allies around you.  And just as an example, a level 3 Aghs Refresher Zeus ult does 1280 damage before all reductions. 1024 after basic 20% reduction, and 768 after basic reduction + Null Field.  1024-768=256. That's 256 damage you, and all allies around you, aren't taking because of 4 points in passive.   If you put those points into stats instead, you'd gain 152 health points on just yourself.  If you'd take stats over Null Field, you're wrong.     There's nothing you can do. Just play on and hope they're not in your next game.   I was just pointing out that that point doesn't really provide anything. His situation was that he missed the deward. Saying learn how to properly deward indicates you'll be able to properly deward 100% of the time, which is simply not true, and doesn't provide any help to his situation.    Laning: when you're playing carry with nukes or other spells that can help your supports get a kill - you should fight enemy offlane when supports initiate, that kill grants much more xp\gold teamwise then 2-5 lasthits you'll make meanwhile.  This is wrong. You should only participate if you're positive you will secure the kill and have communicated so beforehand. Just because a support throws out a stun doesn't mean you need to run away from the wave to follow up stun.    Counter-Stacking. If enemy team is making stacks, ask for help for push at your lane then contest those stacks with supports. There were so many games recently with 0-5 enemy offlane tide who gets ravage, participating in 2-2 exchange fight, getting stacks then owning rest of the game. Your supports can't really do much against that.  If you're safe lane and the enemy team is stacking the enemies jungle, there is absolutely no reason you should leave safe lane to help them contest stacks. That's the offlaners job. And if you're contesting ancient stacks with an enemy T1 or T2 still up, have fun getting destroyed when their heroes teleport in to kill you while you contest.    Obviously someone can't read. I called the cops because of the boyfriend beating the mother you fucking twit.    learn how to properly deward  Even pros miss dewards.       A beginner Bane will constantly misuse Nightmare and Fiends Grip at inappropriate times and get cancelled immediately.  Bane is a hero that if you're picking him without ever seeing the hero played before, you're most likely going to do more harm than good.   How the list should be:  Sniper, Viper, Bloodseeker, Nightstalker, Bristleback.  None of these heroes require Blink Daggers, and the only one that requires positioning knowledge is Sniper. The other 4 you can essentially face rush the enemy team and right click to win.         farm, buy items and right click.  Bane carry new meta? Okay.   Your responses are astronomically dumber than the question. Good job.   This is the only correct answer.   Null Field is actually pretty good. It's 20% at level 4 on top of the natural 20% every hero except Visage and Meepo have.   As opposed to her odds.   Wasn't Secret picking Zai offlane PL with some success? Can't remember specific games though    community it selfe gets better.  This will never happen.   I've started to drink a beer for every minute there is a pause.  I've also started to develop cirrhosis.    Depends on who you stack with. I've stacked with IRL friends that queue ranked and they go in to pick trolling combos or mess around instead of actually trying to win. That's fine if we're queuing unranked, but I don't stack with them any more because if I'm in ranked I'm trying to win, not mess around.   Maybe it's different in ranked than unranked. I only play ranked, and in the past month I've maybe been queued with a 3 stack once. Even 2 stacks at my MMR are fairly uncommon.   No it doesn't. It just makes it so you can't face rush two heroes and six creeps and spin to win an easy kill at level 2.    I used to be one of the early gg'ers if a particular player was doing horribly. I'd never give up, I'd keep trying though. I realized it creates a toxic environment and demoralizes the entire team however.  So now I don't say gg, because that brings down the entire team. I just type a simple "wp" every time that person does something stupid. It's actually been working because the rest of my team finds it kind of funny and lightens the mood in what could be a crushing loss. It also pisses off that particular player more than typing gg does, which is fine because I can then report him if he starts flaming.  Am I wrong to do this? Yeah probably. Oh well.   Look on the right side of the screen.    New to Dota 2? Start here.   I very rarely get matched with people in more than a 2 stack. Guess I'm lucky.   I randomed him in a game earlier. Dual safe with a PA against Troll and Omniknight. Had a Nature's Prophet on our team that ported in every time Omni left to check rune. We killed Troll 3 times before 10 minutes.  Then lost the game in 24 minutes because our mid Storm fed their SF 4 kills and they had a Pugna to just mow down our towers.  That's dota for you.  I rarely play Oracle, but it looks like it's a solid pick along side a heavy physical dps carry.    go around saving enemies when they are trying to help   builds an aghs when we have an ns already  Those are individual skill problems. They don't have the skill and knowledge to realize what they're doing on that hero isn't appropriate for their current game.     Counter Helix rescale from 100/135/170/205 to 50/115/170/205.  No hero should be able to cut a creep wave at level 2 with two heroes harassing him and walk away having done more damage to the heroes than what he took.    The base MS and the bash removal are the only changes out of these he actually needs. All of these will completely destroy the hero. While I wouldn't mind that happening necessarily, it's not an approach you should take.   I was thinking that it was because you can't lifesteal from illusions, and while people are saying that, I looked on two different dota 2 wiki's and neither mention that this is true.  It only mentions that illusions don't benefit from lifesteal. Maybe someone has some editing to do.   Are you playing in ranked? Because if so, and if you're getting Deso over Euls/Aghs you have every right to be called a noob.  If you're playing in unranked then it doesn't matter.   So it does the exact same thing, but as Unit Target instead of Point Target? I don't think that's necessary.  	117

Some people used to compete to see who would stay in the circle the longest. Now, with my current friends, we can smoke a joint between 4 or 5 people and all be functional.

They'll all get high but no one wants to be the first guy out. I must be the weirdo because I catch my buzz, acknowledge I'm good, and go about my day.

Tl:Dr. Alcoholic friend lectures me on doing coke once, fails to see hypocrisy in choices.  So last night, I went to hang out with some friends I hadn't seen in a while  (I transferred colleges). One of them had caught wind that I did coke within the past week, and gave me a huge lecture on how I'm not on the right path, how my life will be ruined, and all that jazz. I'm just venting a bit because I did it once (no redose, no urge to do it again) yet my friend is an alcoholic who will be drunk almost every day of the week  (they have about 20 empty handles of Fireball whiskey on display in their kitchen). One friend won't even acknowledge my presence anywhere anymore, and the third guy is cool, and knows I actually have my shit together. So yea, I hate word of mouth and the warped views of addiction people have. Yes, drugs can ruin your life. No, I don't believe you can be hooked on substances after one use.  Said friend is like "yeah, I chew, I drink, I even smoke pot on occassion, but that hard shit will ruin your life." Well, at least this friend has stopped being anti-marijuana  Edit: Removed some phrasing that made me come off worse than intended.   2nd edit: The friend who wasn't acknowledging my presence has been a bit reserved about things lately, and I was told something else was probably on his mind.

 So the dream i had last night is still kinda freaking me out, even though i don't have arachnophobia. I even went to australia for 7 months last year and took the biggest spiders i found on my hand to freak other people out. However this was simply too much for me.  So about the dream:  I was in this big transportation vehicle all on my own, with my dad being the one who flies/steers it (I think it was probably an airplane). There were no windows or anything just the lights inside that illuminated everything. There were 2 sections inside the plane, the middle one which looked like your normal economy class and the seperated section in the back which was smaller but resembled the first class. It even had a bed. To be fair it was my own bed that i have in real life.   So in the beginning of the dream everything was kind of normal, there were no spiders, and i was just hanging around alone in the middle section. As time evolved a few very big spiders seemed to appear on the ceiling and in cracks. They were as huge as the biggest spiders in the world, completly black and looked as intimidating as possible. Soon medium spiders seemed to appear in bigger numbers (probably in the hundreds). They were of the same species as the bigger ones being just as black but with smaller abdomens compared to the big ones but i'd still consider them large. Last but not least the baby spiders appeared. Again same species but in even larger numbers. In the end there were these kind of nests everywhere in the middle section. It freaked me out, everthing was infested with spiders and i couldn't stay there anymore. So i moved to the back section, the more luxurious first class.   It was seperated with doors from the middle section and because of that it was completely clean. My own bed was standing there against the wall and the section had these air shafts which were closed. Again i was just hanging around in there, basicly doing nothing but soon the airshafts opened up. A lot of air was coming out and with that the same spiders appeared in this section. It ended up being even worse because this section was smaller than the middle one so it was tighter to move. Some particular big bunches of spiders were located everywere on the walls close to my bed. And being even more freaked out i had to move again. But this time there was nowhere to go. Everything was already infested with spidernests. And that's when the dream faded away.  Now being awake and all i'm feeling very paranoid of spiders. I had this chair in my cellar that i needed to bring up today and i just had to check it for spiders before i could pick it up.   Also the nests in my dream looked kinda like this: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BSigMbHCEAA4e3N.jpg:large  What does this all mean? What does my head want to tell me? I don't want to be scared of something that i could handle before just because of a dream.   Also forgive me for any grammatical mistakes, english is hard :)   I'm 100% confident that i got this one right. http://www.dravendoesitall.com/Fantasy/Midlane.aspx?code=X6ZJ44R6Z7   I think you are underestimating Gambit. Cabo is a monster who outclassed Zion every single game at IEM and Diamond is most definitely a tier above Santorin. Niq is consistent although he won't win lane on his own vs Bjergsen. Botlane is a wildcard since i don't really know how turtle and lustboy would do against a hyper aggressive botlane like p1noy+edward. But Gambit vs TSM is a match that i'd love to see...riot more international competition, please?   Maybe wait for the new GT3 RS?  	4
 I don't *know*. That's why it's a belief, not knowledge. I have taken time to think about my beliefs and practices and to me, they seem to be true to me. I'm not certain, but I believe.   Thank you so much.   You look lovely!   She is in the hospital with bleeding in her brain, and the doctor doesn't think she has much longer. She's 91 and had a great life, and she would have wanted to go suddenly. Please pray for God to help her in which ever way He chooses to. She is an amazing woman, and I love her so much.  UPDATE: Doctors say it was a stroke and she probably has less than a week... Please pray for her soul and my family.   You make a very good point.   It just seems like someone who is more familiar with law should be choosing someone's sentence. Judges and lawyers must have degrees, why not jurors? Thanks!   WOW! You look fantastic! I would never guess that you're the same person. Also, that lip color is perfect on you.   When I say different ways, I don't mean different "pictures". I don't think that there is a picture of God. I don't think he *looks* like anything. I don't think he has an image. Maybe God has revealed himself visually to certain people in the past, but that doesn't mean that's what He looks like. He just manifested Himself that way. I meant that He reveals himself through different situations. He reveals Himself when we're lost, in need of help, etc.  People fighting over what He looks like is ridiculous. God (despite Jesus) isn't a physical being. Again, I don't think He *looks* like anything. If/when I go to heaven, I'm not going to have eyes... Now Jesus was a man, but no one should claim to know what He looks like unless they met Him.  I believe Jesus came down to tell us to love and accept *everyone* and to judge no one. We don't know for sure what God wants, but we are made with consciences which, if correctly develop, should give us a correct sense of right and wrong. I don't believe God came down to John Smith and told him that something's a sin and told Suzy Jones that it isn't. People claiming that they know what God wants are incorrect. Now, He did give us things like the Ten Commandments, but things like that don't cover *everything*. Like the Ten Commandments say that you should not kill, but does that mean self defense is out of the question? The Church says it's okay, but does God think it's okay? We don't really know.  I hope that cleared things up, but I've had a long day, so it may be just as confusing... Also, I would like the note that these are *my* beliefs.   Yeah, sorry. It was ~3 in the morning.   Can't blame me for trying... (:   Jiffy! 1:04-1:05   Switch lives with me. Please.   I don't think anyone sat down one day and "invented" a God/gods. I think that either God reaches out to people and reveals himself to them. I am a Christian becomes something inside me tells me that there is a God out there that loves me, and I couldn't believe otherwise if I wanted to. Does that mean my beliefs are correct? I hope so, but maybe not. And then there are people from thousands of years ago who thought that it simply made sense for an omnipotent being to have brought the world into existence. What I believe is that maybe God presents himself to people in different ways, and they see Him in ways that make sense to them or seem like the God that they want to love and worship.  I hope that made sense...   No, I just think that *no* religious subreddits should be.   No, these questions are fine to ask if you're actually curious. They're pretty easily answered as well. They just made me feel more strong in my beliefs that I could answer questions about my faith.   I think that's a completely unfair thing to say. I would be totally open to answering these questions rationally and thoughtfully.   Hello TrueAtheism. I'm a Christian, and if you guys would like me to answer these questions, I'm totally open to it. I am fairly young, but I've read the list and I think I could answer them for my personal beliefs. All Christians beliefs are different either slightly or majorly, but I could definitely give you guys my perspective. If any answers seem unfit, I would be open to revising them so that they would be fit. So let me know.   I avoided reddit for such a long time because of this reason. As a Christian, I do NOT want /r/Christianity to be a default subreddit. It's I think it's a wonderful community, but completely insensitive and rude to those who are not Christians. I am so glad that it's not a default anymore. Most people who post there are mean, hateful people seeking out people who don't believe what they believe.   Or simply "just for some quick, cheap karma." Either way.   Um, I most people would agree with you? How the hell did this make the front page? You're obviously not the only one, karma whore.   Absolutely gorgeous!   Thank you so much(:   I'm currently am on vacation and haven't had a chance. If I decide to, I will definitely update.   Okay, I'll consider that. Thank you.   Great advice. Thank you very much!   Thank you very much(: I did word myself a little incorrect, though. I have decided on my career, but I'm just nervous about it. I'm going into musical theatre, and I'm just worried that I won't be good enough. I shouldn't worry so much, but I do. Thank you for your prayers!   I feel that I have a close relationship with God, but maybe I should try to get closer. Thank you(:   So glad I could help(:   Thank you so much. And you can pray for Nicole(:   That gave me a big smile! Thanks(:   Thank you for your advice. I'll be strong.   Thank you for this. It's really beautiful(:   I'm not sure what this has to do with my situation...   Okay, thanks very much(: God bless you.   Thank you. I don't think I wasn't sharing everything. I have no idea what I was doing wrong. Now, like I said, I'm just afraid to go back. I guess I'll have to find a way to face my fears. Thanks, again.   Aw, thank you so much. This made me feel better(:   Just caved after a 25 day streak. It was amazing, as now I feel awful. I wish you all the luck in the world. It is so worth it. Be strong.   Thank you for your advice(: I'll have to think about that.   but I'm afraid.  My last two confessions went horribly. They were probably two and a half years ago, and I left in tears. I remember both priests had given me a lecture. They weren't giving me advice to be a better person or Christian or anything, but told me thy my confession was "too vague." I have no idea what I did wrong, but I didn't leave feeling like I was forgiven like I had in the past. Now I feel like I have all this baggage from almost three years of sinning, and I'm worried I'll only make it worse. I'd pretty much sworn off confession because of these instances, but I feel like I need it.  Any advice? Thanks so much.  Also, sorry for any typos. I typed this up on my phone.   Thank you so much(: I am not currently, but I have in the past. I know how to deal with it, so I'm not to inclined to go back Ito counseling or anything. I'm also afraid to talk to my parents about it, so I don't really want to have to ask them. Last time I needed it I was twelve years old and suicidal, which I'm not remotely now, so I don't want to bring it up, now being fifteen. (Sorry if I carried on a bit, haha)   I would really appreciate some prayers from you guys right now. I kind of feel like my world is falling apart with my career being at question and my clinical depression looming over my head. Sorry for being kind of vague, but I need God's help, so I thought my fellow Christians could help me out.  Thank you so much. I love you.   Don't worry about it. People are entitled to their own opinion. There will be people that gawk at you for it, but ignore them. There are more people that don't like them / don't care about them than you would think.  Glad you could get this off your chest(:   That's a really good way to look at it. Thanks!   I'm glad you found something you love, but I do love singing beautiful music that amazing people have put together. And thank you or your support(:   I had the same problem for the past week or so (and just posted about it on /r/NoFap), and please, don't fall. I was at 25 day and like 30ish on here. Now I finally cave in to the same feelings you're having right now, and it was awful. I felt nothing. I immediately thought, *What am I doing?* and felt nothing at all. So, somehow, find a way to get excited about being porn free again. If I can help you through my experience, my failure will have a purpose. I know it sucks and exactly how you feel, but be strong. Giving up now will only increase the stress in your life. Remember when you were at day one, and all those people who were at a month or so seemed so far away from where you were? Don't go back to that. It. Is. Not. Worth. It. Trust me.  I wish you all the luck in the world. Stay strong, I'm rooting for you.   For the last week or so, I felt like I was fighting a losing battle. I would get really turned on and almost cave, but I wouldn't. For some reason, I kind of wish I had. Well, now I did, and it sucked. I immediately thought, *What the hell am I doing?* Then, I felt nothing. I tried to finish rubbing it out, but I just felt... unsatisfied. I've been nervous this whole time because I'm waiting to have sex until I'm married, and yet I just made a mockery out of that commitment. I'm an idiot. The one thing I can take from this is that now I have a short term goal, a month, as opposed to the next ten or so years... Pro Tip: Always make short term goals.  Tl;Dr:  Don't do it. You will feel nothing but shame and remorse.   I'm currently in high school and plan on pursuing a carrer in musical theatre. It has always been what I wanted to do. I know it's difficult and very likely that I will always be poor, but I'm okay with that because it made me happy and nothing else did. Recently my sister told me that I was a bad actor, and went into vivid detail of why she thinks so. She was angry with me at the time, but has never taken it back. Now every time I'm with my voice teacher I become insecure with myself and feel horrible for the next few days. I don't know what to do. I just feel like I have no idea what I'm doing and that I'm making a mistake... I don't know, I just feel awful. Like I said before, this was really the only thing that I am happy pursuing, but now every time I try I break down. I just feel like I'm never going to be happy with performing again. I'll just feel horrible afterward like I do after my lessons. I don't know, maybe it's all kind of ridiculous, but I feel like my world's falling apart even though I know I shouldn't let her get to me. Thanks for reading.  EDIT: Thank you all for your support and advice. I do want to say that I know very well that I will have a lot if criticism coming my way. The only reason it really bothered me is that this is my sister that has always supported me and been my biggest fan. I can take criticism, I just feel like she betrayed me as my sister and friend. She used to always be there for me and now I feel like she's against me. It wasn't the criticism itself. I just thought that needed to be said. Thanks again.   Damn...   If you scroll down any page linked to NoFap, you'll see on the right side there are nine boxes you can click on. If you click "Add Badge," it'll show you how to get one.  Good luck on your NoFap Journey!   I LOVE this! So pretty(:   LOL yes! I haven't mixed them up yet, but I'm awaiting my doom...   GORGEOUS! You look amazing. The look fits your very well(:   Absolutely gorgeous! You look like you stepped out of being a mother and housewife to a beautiful, young woman!   Oh my God, that's crazy! I don't even care that it breaks the rule of no screenshots. Haha, that'll be a good story one day.   Me too sister. FTFY  Anyway, thank you for your support(:   This saved me as well(: I didn't do it! Actually, it kind of wasn't my choice because I got pulled away from my computer, but still! I read this post and it made me feel so much better. Thank you!   LOL! Too bad I'm not a guy... Gave me a god laugh, though.   I'd love it if someone could help me out here. Thanks.  UPDATE:  http://imgur.com/ZobtGPr   Congratulations, and welcome back. I hope that you continue on your path to God. I'm sure that He is glad that you've returned, and all is forgiven. It warms my heart to know that you've found love in God.   nice repost.   Seriously? This was on the front page. Don't steal other people's material!   Hey, we're on the same day!!  Anyway, I definitely feel your pain. It sucks. Try to be strong. It is so worth it.   I wish you the best. It must be tough, and I'm sorry that you fell. Stay strong on your new path back to where you were.   I'm good with that. I like being a Duchess(:   What a beautiful little girl! You two did a great job(:   Good luck man. My last streak was eight days, and now I'm almost at 3 weeks going strong. Be strong.   We have those sons of bitches in Texas too. I hate those things...   Thank you very much.   Things are great! My mom retired early this year, and my dad has been retired since before I was born. Luckily, the financials worked out, and here we are! My mom and I definitely spend a lot of time together, but my dad and I, not so much. My dad actually turned 62 this month and my mom is 55. I think that having kids at their age has kept them young. Yes, they are much older than most parents of kids my age, but they don't look like it or seem like it at all.   Yes and no. My mom retired at the beginning of this year, and I missed her so much. I really appreciate the time I have with my mom now. She is a lot more relaxed and nicer than she used to be. I think it's the best thing to have happened to our family.  On the other hand, my dad has been retired since before I was born. He seems really bored with his life and has blamed my sister and me on a few accounts for that. I love him, but I think he has grown impatient with being a father.   Nope. My parents got married when my mom was 31 and my dad was 38. It took them seven years to have my sister, and I was born the next year. They wanted to have three or more.   Not sure if anyone will be interested, but if you are, ask away!   This is amazing. Thank you so much for sharing.   ...What the hell idd I just watch?   I personally like Period Diary. I like the layout better.   LOL! That intro made my day(: And I'm very glad to hear that I'm not the only one! I'm fairly young and somewhat new to the whole world of dating, and sometimes I get really afraid that there aren't other people (or men really) like us. So, even though people like us are a "rare breed," it is reassuring to hear from one.(:   I'm waiting until marriage because I love my future husband. I don't know him yet, but I know that he will be the love of my life and the father of my children. Well, I shouldn't say I *know* that, but that is why I wait. He will be the person I love most in life and the only person I will *want* to have those moments with. I don't want to have sex with someone that I won't love forever. I don't want to have sex with someone that I will grow to hate. I don't want to have sex with twenty guys, ten guys, or two guys. I want to have sex with one man. I want to have my children with one man. I want to be forever bonded with one man: my husband.   I seriously love all of your posts. You're amazing!   Wow... That's horrible. I love your everyday makeup though(: Happy birthday!   LOL! That's great man, keep up the work. I always get excited when I see you appear(:   That's exactly it! Thanks(:   Yes and no. I came here for religious reasons, but continue for personal reasons.   Just so you know, as a 5'10" woman, most tall women I know dream of meeting a 7' tall man. You have a lot of sexy, tall women in your future.   Yeah, I've tagged him as "Is Actually Relevant; Do Not Trust".   I'm now out of school and getting more sleep, so I've been having these long, complex dreams every night. Usually somewhere in the mix, there's a wet dream, but it's not really a wet dream. I get turned on and either almost fap (schlick, I guess) or I almost have sex (I'm a virgin by choice), but then I feel guilty and don't give in. I usually wake up feeling kind of unsatisfied because dreams are kind of freebies. Then I think that I should be proud that my brain is being taught to really control itself, even when not in control... I don't know really how to feel about it.  Thoughts? Similar situations? Please share! Thanks for reading. You guys are amazing.   YES. Have you seen that new Durex commercial? It's like three or four couples having really intense sex. I saw that commercial so many times today, I'm *really* proud of myself for not letting it get to me.   I feel you. I am waiting to have sex until after marriage, and I'm kind of terrified. I'm currently fifteen, and I'm scared to not have another sexual pleasure for maybe another fifteen years. I'm also afraid that I'll give in to sex so that I won't give in to fapping (schlicking I guess). Glad to know that I'm not alone(: Be strong.   Oh my God! This really made me laugh. You're schooling experience must have been... interesting. Thanks for sharing!   Yeah, that's definitely why. Sorry that we Americans have it so cheap!   Okay great. Thank you so much for your help!  	90
 Because it is a competition. Competition is a law of nature; it is an archetype. Also, in this monolithic capitalist monstrosity we call America, we are taught that success in economic competition equates to a higher social stature. If you are American, what you feel is completely normal.  It is difficult to maintain one's beliefs if they are in direct contradiction to everything that we know and are taught but to do so is the sole indicator of true individuality and that is something we are also taught to aspire to.   Plus, it helps to align one's self with like-minded people; there is greater strength in numbers.   One on one went well, group didn't go well.  Gave up after trying just one group? Group helped me more than anything but it wasn't until the 3rd group that I found one that helped and it helped greatly.  I have huge problems with AA/12 step-type programs but among the few things they got right is this: you cannot help a substance abuser until the abuser hits bottom and wants to help himself. So go ahead and drive yourself down further if that's what it takes. But to some extent, we each get to choose our bottom; it is a choice.  I self-medicated for 40 years; just understand that you are self medicating (all substance abusers are).  What I would like to do, is go back in time ...  Alcohol will take you there and keep you there. You think you wasted time? Again, I wasted 40 years with self-medication. The only healthy choice is to move forward and alcohol will prevent you from ever moving forward.  But you already know all this.  	2

 Living amongst them. The three things I noticed within the first twenty minutes after leaving the airport were 1) Traffic laws were a suggestion 2) Spitting and burping is appropriate behavior 3) Smoking is cool anywhere. Hotel lobbies, elevators, THE LOCKER ROOM AT MY GYM. After about 10 months here, I have accepted that they are relatively inconsiderate of others, they are loud, they pathologically break rules and laws, and I don't know how many times I've past a mom suspending her kid above the sidewalk to let the little guy do his business. Also, I live in Beijing, and I'm sure, no I know, it's gets worse the more rural you get.  That being said, they have many other redeeming qualities. If you think you about what they've gone through in the last 70 years, it makes sense that their social etiquette hasn't caught up with their economic stature.   Seems like this thread's consensus is that Chinese and Brazilian tourists are especially bad. They are both rapidly developing nations, with the separation between the wealthy and impoverished expanding every year. Coincidence?      Not a staffer, but still. We shared a flight to Hong Kong with this weird Buddhist monk. He was in full garb, ran around the plane the whole time, had a girl voice, and rapidly flipped through magazines. He wound up staying in my room at a hostel. He also jacked off to gay porn in broad daylight while people were present and awake. We asked him why, and he said in Chinese "It doesn't count. They're white."   Also white in China. Rules and laws are only suggestions here.   I work in Beijing, and my students showed me this months ago! I think it's been a thing in China for awhile. FYI   The part about the goosebumps won't leave me.    Agreed. Not usually the case in China. South Korea on the other hand...   Twist: The monsters are their kids   Everyone says I look like James Franco, and everyone says I look like their friend. I think James and I just have a face that is easily interpreted.    I get drunk on reddit a lot. Are you referencing something, or is this a true story? And do grandpas really live to 145? And did your 145 year old grandpa really give your ice cream to a bastard?   Can't forget Fred Phelps      My cousins taught me that if I wanted to dream about something specific, if I thought really hard about it the moments before I went to sleep, I would in fact dream about it. I said "Like I could be Michael Jordan in my dream?" and they said "Yeah! Or even be with a girl!"    I think he wants to have sex with you really bad.    you're totally right. learned it the hard way. i came off as defensive for sure.   I did today in front of the boss, and the annoying coworker was just like "You can't get personal in a professional setting." and I said "What. You want me to just call you out behind your back? Be you?"   I work at a high school in Beijing, and we send the kids out in hazardous/dangerous air quality conditions weekly.   No I got it immediately.   	18
 I FEEL PRETTY!!! THIS IS MY CHOICE!    Thank you!        What type of EDS do you have that was tested for via skin biopsy?    Haha. I actually look older than I am, my skin is not aging well. But yeah I do have other skin stuff, stretch marks, a couple cigarette paper scars, very visible veins, vericose veins, and I am also pretty pale. My mother is Hispanic and Filipino but I look totally white unlike my sister who looks like our mom. Yet I have the dark hair as well as a big nose so everyone thinks I'm Jewish. Haha... Aaaaaaanyway...   I'm sorry it's like that for you. :( You really shouldn't have to go through any of that. But at least you know that you are strong enough to do it, not to mention keep working!       I am glad that my feelings can resonate with yours though. It's good to know there are people out there that *really* understand.    Hahaha. That's probably an auto correct, I'm on mobile.      And thanks. I hate people like that.     I was diagnosed with CRPS when I was younger. I am just realizing that I was misdiagnosed. Need to take that part off.    Thanks! I have actually been doing pretty much all these things. I always have to bring my mom with me or I will get turned down immediately.       The only thing I haven't done is dress nice. I don't really have a lot of clothes and even when I pull something normal together it's like everyone still knows! Haha. Even before the dyed hair and piercings. And some of my piercings are difficult to take out or obvious that they are still pierced anyway.    :/ good luck lady.         And holy shit, I had no idea ovarian torsion was a thing.   That could be fun.    Thank you, I will definitely make that phone call. And yeah. I even made a flow chart woth symptoms and all that stuff. Ha. What sucks is that my symptoms are a bit weird. I am incredibly hypermobile but my skin isn't stretchy. And other things like that.    I'm in the US. What sucks is that I have even been seeing university doctors and such. I have good enough insurance to get decent health care which I  am thankful for. But I guess being young and dressing weird makes it pointless.    Thanks. You seem too wise for your years.      I don't think I am faking all the time or anything. There are just frequent glimpses of doubt in the back of my mind. It's frustrating that so many doctors really are just satan. I am fairly articulate, and I can't remember the last appointment I had where I didn't cry. Only a couple doctors have believed me.   Exactly.    I am seriously in the exact same position as you. I have the diagnoses of TMJ, arthritis, fibromyalga, hyperothyroid, hypermobility, and blah blah. But trying to get them to give a shit about the EDS, dysautonomia, and POTS is a pain in the ass. Not to mention the possibility of mast cell and to check for chiari.           It has seriously saved my asshole from some major trauma. Haha.    I suppose we are so used to sucking it up that we can't help but pretend the pain isn't as bad as it is.    Um. You should. Include a photo of yourself with your meds, a smile, and your middle finger.    That is so hard. I'm sorry you are going through that. It is so incredibly not okay. I wish we had more resources.       If there were anything I could do I absolutely would. You will be in my thoughts though.    That is so incredibly awful. I hope you have found people who understand and actually have respect for your well being.    Yeah. After turning down so many opportunities to go do something I start feeling like a jerk. Like I am choosing it and I forget the real reason. Then I try and go do normal people stuff and I spend the next week recovering. It definitely reminds me how real it is.   Seriously. It's like sometimes I wonder if my idea of pain is wrong or something. Almost my entire body hurts. But maybe I'm wrong? Then I remember that my stomach doesn't hurt, but I know what it is like when it does. So there's no way I am wrong about all my muscles. It's confusing, especially on top of the brain fog.   That's awful. I'm assuming he didn't mean any harm by asking. But we know what its like. Some days we can accomplish something. But a lot of the time we can't. It's also different when it lasts so long, we aren't always improving so maybe we could do something but it may make us feel worse later.           That is seriously the worst. It sucks that you're going through that. I honestly feel like doctors are the worst part of my life right now.    Thank you, that's actually helpful.    Yeah I tried that. Haha.   Yeah I like to craft shit. Haha.   Yeah I am on doctor #7 of this year I think.   Haha. He ate it amazingly fast too. I just barely got the picture and it was gone.   Yeah its mainly the doctors that are the problem. I need to start writing reviews.    It won't need to be that small. I am fairly familiar with painting. I may also just tape it off and spray paint it.   Maybe that's the point?    Haha.      Yeah I have been trying for years but they just won't understand. I am fairly articulate and cry a lot so you would think they would get it.   Probably all of it besides the top parts that flip open.    I used to be constipated a lot as a kid. Now I usually just get it from pain meds. I can get over most of it but I am so tired of having fissures.      This is really gross but sometimes I have to resort to the ole 'assisting the poo out by applying pressure via the lady bits with a finger' trick. It's gross but the relief is worth it.         Lately my stool softeners aren't doing shit.        (I apologize for the shitpun.)   Probably paint.    If my suspensions are correct I am probably not the only one who feel like this, yet I haven't seen it be addressed. So I figure it may be good to start an open discussion about it.        There are probably several factors to this and I know of a couple but hopefully some of the rest of you may have some light to shed on the subject. Having so many doctors/friends/family/and acquaintances say the typical "you can't be that sick, you look fine" and "oh you're too young to be in that much pain, just wait until you're older" type garbage makes a real impact. I'm sure many of you are plenty familiar with some variation of that. I can only hear that so many times before I begin to doubt it myself. Which is on top of my own doubts I already have. Sometimes it's hard to accept the fact that I am 23 and can't function well enough to work. I mean really, how can someone so young have it this bad? All my friends are out and about every day doing all kinds of things. And then I stand up, get dizzy, lose my vision, and have to sit back down. Oh yeah, now I remember what my life is like. Looking back it's hard to imagine I was just being dramatic all the times I would be in enough pain that changing my shirt involved sobbing and struggling and taking breaks.         Then there's the fact that we live like this. Every day. And this is what our lives are like. It becomes so normal to us that we often forget that it's actually not normal and it is actually really awful. Almost every time someone asks me where my pain is at I say 7. On a good day it is a low 7. But the answer is always 7. I feel like if I say 8 or 9 I am being dramatic. We hide the pain so well that we even hide it from ourselves. Which is a good thing at home, not so much in the emergency room though.        Every doctor I see tells me I shouldn't go on disability. As if I am doing it because I want to. If I could go back to work I probably wouldn't be here! I would be 2000 miles from here where my home and job are! Yet they never fail to make me feel guilty or think maybe I am just lazy. Really though I am the only one who knows what I am and am not capable of. It's just hard to shake the doubts sometimes.         I am hoping that by talking about this we can resolve it a little bit. Maybe your input will help me quit feeling guilty about things that aren't real.                   [So uh. Yeah. Here is a cute little slug eating a flower.](http://imgur.com/gxIGeYb)   I'm sorry you're stuck in that shit right now. But you're not alone. When I am in that sort of situation I just keep going to the ER or urgent care. I always have much better luck with ER doctors than others. Last time I went th doctor was pretty understanding and gave me 52 tramadol. And I don't even have any sort of thing they can see like a cyst.   I just wonder why he wouldn't have taken his glasses off.   Actually that would be much more reasonable than whatever the real reason is for them to do that.   Yeah I know all about that.    Yeah. There is often yelling.       Hahahaha. I meant cath. My phone is a dick.         As a fully recovered catholic I hope you're recovery is going well. Haha.   You must be expirenced.   Seriously almost every doctor I see is convinced I just need to exercise and eat better. I'm not even overweight. Considering my entire fucking life I can safely conclude that the more active I am the worse I feel. I know I need physical therapy but I'm sure it won't help the pain. Even when I do nothing I feel like I have been working out too hard all week. Shit, I get sore from sleeping. If I were to *actually* exercise it would take me at least a week to recover.          So many doctors are awful. They refuse to acknowledge the severity of my pain. If it weren't this bad I would still be back home and working at the job I love.    Also I don't have to catholic but I sort of know how it is to be so dysfunctional that going pee is even a bitch. Autonomic dysfunction makes me have to try really hard to relax those muscles.    Thank you. It really is hard losing so much of my life but I have been dealing with it the best I can. But if I lose my boyfriend  (along with everything that comes with it) it would be a lot harder to cope with.    Thanks, that makes me feel better. Hopefully we can do the same.   Thanks.      The problem that is causing all this isn't that I am sick, it's because I'm 2000 miles away and have to stay here for a while. He also works constantly so we hardly have time to talk. But we are trying to work it out. We are going to make sure we Skype like once a week at least and try and figure out those sorts of things.    I masturbated like three times when I watched that. *I haven't been with another woman for too long.*   Spelling. I am a fairly intelligent 23 year old but somehow spelling is impossible for me. It took me a long time to memorize how to spell yogurt. It's never the big words either.    I never really have people ask. I'm one of those people who is usually in a relationship so people just assume. But in my scene no one really cares anyway.    Suicide may be the only option.    It's ok. I appreciate it.    Thanks. I'm just having a hard time with trying to make the relationship work when I don't know which way it will go.   Seriously. It would make for much better doctors overnight.    I have the upmost respect for pedophiles that never actually act on those urges.   Yay! Me toooo!   I seriously woke up with one on the tip of my tongue this morning. It is driving me insane.    It's a bit of a secret society.    That's one of the reasons I don't call myself bisexual. I have never gotten any kind of shit for those kinds of sexual preferences. If anything I would be considered pansexual but I don't put much thought into those sorts of things.    Usually I am fine with them but I just had the worse one ever. That woman fucking destroyed my vagina with that speculum. I was seriously sore for days. Apparently she has no idea how vaginas work. Pretty sure she scraped a bunch of skin out of there while inserting the speculum.         As if I didn't already hate her before that.   If only we all had as much money as you do.   I just feel like they failed on the medical end of the show. The diagnosis didn't make any sense. All they knew was miscarriages. Which on its own would never ever point to EDS. They could have at least added a dislocated joint or skin tearing or at least some vericose veins. They seriously had so many interesting options.    This is probably my most hated thing about being a female. For a while I had to ride my bike every day through the city to get to work. On an average day I would get a dozen or so cat calls. Some of them were scary, some friendly but still uncomfortable, and some were crude and disgusting. It really effected my self image for a while and made me hate leaving the house. Especially when the weather was nice and I needed to wear shorts. I am still nervous in public all the time and get freaked out when a guy walks in my direction.    I'm a lady and I hardly shave anything or groom all that much.    It's just difficult because he insists he wants to work it out. But the little bit of doubt he has scares me.       And he has one dog (who I call my step dog) but we also work at a dog rescue. So I have a dozen dogs I am in love with. There's one I am supposed to adopt but if we break up I probably won't even go back there.    I want his death to be long and painful stuck in the hospital for months and never get any visitors. That's my realistic one.       But it would be neat if he could become an attractive young woman in a part of the world where women have no rights. I want him to be genetally mutilated, raped, and tortured for a decade or so and then burned alive. I could go into further detail but I think that is enough.         I should also add that I generally fine it important to be kind and caring to people. But some of them really do just deserve bad things.   Maybe not the worst, but the episode of House where he gets 13 from jail. They were treating a guy and eventually his wife as well once they found her in their messy house. They figured out she was the hoarder and had mental issues, then they found out she had miscarriages. *Somehow* they concluded she had ehlers-danlos syndrome and that was the end of it.         Ehlers-Danlos is a rare, complex, and incredibly interesting disease with all kinds of variation. They could have done all kinds of interesting things. EDS can cause miscarriages, but that is not even a major symptom. And it doesn't help the reputation of the disease that all it explained was the miscarriage and mental illness.        It was just really disappointing.    They aren't wearing gloves.   Aside from injuries caused by accidents most conditions that cause chronic pain  (like fibromyalga and CRPS) effect women more than they do men.   I just don't know how I can be prepared when I don't know where my future is headed. I have already done everything I can do at this point and I am basically just stuck in limbo.   What if that's not the problem?  She just has to be gone for a while and can't be super active anymore.   Interesting. I actually don't know much about joint replacements and all that. But that's interesting.    Your grandma sounds like a smart lady.      I don't mind being alone, but I think I will be able to stay social. Worse comes to worse I can set up a dating profile and at least get laid. Haha.   That is so awful. There are way too many unbelievably bad dog owners out there.   Ha. I have a problem.    Ugh! Seriously, what the fuck. It's like the whole understanding and caring thing is just an act and while you're talking all they hear is elevator music.   Thanks. I just wish I knew what is going to happen at this point.    Had to stop working.        No real social life.       Then I had to leave town to seek treatment. So there goes most of my life, my home, and all the dogs I love.       Now it looks like my boyfriend is getting ready to decide he can't handle me being away any longer so he will probably dump me. He's not even sure he can handle being with me and my shitty health even if I could go back now. He says he wants to make it work. But I know better. If he isn't sure now there won't be any improvement.          I just really thought this was the kind of relationship that could overcome something like this.   Yeah I  can definitely see how that wouldn't work.    Yeah I actually don't have that many issues like that because of my conditions. I mean it sucks and I cry at every doctors appointment I go to. But if anything it is making me stronger. The worst part about it besides probably losing my partner is having so many doctors treat me like shit and trying to get someone to listen to me.       The main problem is the current distance I think.    I'm not expecting him to stick around at this point.    Yeah would imagine that's about how it is. And I don't technically have my diagnoses yet. But I know what it is.   I guess I just thought I was in the kind of relationship that was serious enough to deal with something like this.    Haha. I mean it's understandable. And luckily I don't need a wheelchair yet, then when I do I won't need it all the time.    Yeah. It's hard to try and fit my mind around both.    Well I am hoping I will be able to go back in less than a few months. He has to stay there to work and hold down the fort.    Yeah couples seem to work together fine when both people have health conditions.    Why wouldn't you be happy? I'm just curious as to what all kinds of factors there are from that side of it.   I am going to get on disability. So I will be able to support myself. My plan is to have enough pain management that I can work a couple days a week under the table as well.         The distance is the main issue. We would still be able to follow through with our plans. I will just be low energy most of the time, I could need surgeries, and I may fall down in the shower  once in a while.       There is no cure for what I have but it is fairly manageable.    I honestly feel like trying to date now that I have these problems wouldn't be difficult. They would know what to expect of me at least. And people seem to find me fairly desirable.       Also it's not like I am in a wheelchair. I may end up with some braces and a cane but at least they will be decorated all punk rock. Haha. The biggest problems are the current distance that could last for a bit and when I get back I won't be able to go out a ton. But with pain management I will be able to keep myself busy and maybe even work a couple days a week. So it's not like I can't brush my own hair, I just might fall down in the shower or not be able to make dinner some days.   I have talked to him and he wasn't sure if he can handle it. I know he loves me and wants to make it work. Before all this he was confident that he wanted to be with me as long as I would be with him. But now it seems his main issue is that he is depressed and the current distance is getting to him.   Yeah the second one made it real for me.   Now I know that a large percentage of relationships don't work when one of the partners has chronic pain. So I probably shouldn't get my hopes up.                   My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half or so. Over the past ten months I have been becoming unwell. For the first few months I thought it would get better and just pushed through it. Then I got a more active job and I kept getting worse. After a few more months I was no longer able to work. I saw several doctors and none of them were willing to help me.                   When that didn't work out my boyfriend and I both decided it was best for me to go back home to where I am from because I would have easier access to better doctors. I have been away for three months now (this is the longest we have been apart but not by a lot, temporary long distance was fine before). Now it is becoming an issue.                    We have talked about it and he really wants to make it work, but he is also not sure if he can handle it much more. I thought it would be fine because we have been great partners together and had plenty plans for the future.                    Do those plans become void when one person gets sick? Would you stay with your partner if something like that became a factor? Should I just set him free now?                        TL;DR: Got sick. Long distance for a while. Might not get to keep my partner. And I'm not sure how a situation like this is supposed to work.     I am asking here because chronic pain mostly effects women, and I happen to be having such problems as a woman who dates men.       If the person you love who has been a great partner became ill and had to be away for a while/would never be able to be too active again would you stay with them? Or do you think it would be too much?  When you make plans with someone to share the future together does it become void if something like that happens?         Probably just a type of dialater. But I don't know if it has a fancy name or something.    I feel like that could be interpreted as a sexual thing. Haha. But maybe I just have  too dirty of a mind.   That's my issue. I can't put weight on my wrists anymore either. I don't care what doctors say, I know for a fact that the more active I am the shittier I feel.    When I was a kid my symptoms weren't all that bad. Sometimes I would pass out getting out of the bath. I was never able to run around as much or keep up with the other kids, but I have always been incredibly flexible. I was in ballet for eight years or so. Then gymnastics in high school which is when I began to notice something was definitely wrong. The more active I am the worse my pain and fatigue are. Now it is fairly severe. Growing up I would complain about lots of aches and stuff. But even as an infant I had a super high pain tolerance. I was constantly injuring myself without any tears.   Just watched lie to me. It was pretty neat. Some of my other favorites that are on there are (of course) house, rescue me, nip tuck, Salem was good. Aaaaaand brain fog.   I want to do cosplay but the events seem stressful to me. I desperately want to be sexy Mr. Popo. It would be terrifying.    Are you also short? But yeah that's probably all there is to it with you shoulder. Also your scapula, the are both just able to extend back further than most people. Not very common but also not that crazy of a body thing.   Normally when a joint is hypermobile I would say the muscles around the tendon need to be strengthened. But assuming you don't usually skip leg day I imagine it is already fairly strong there. Do you have any other problems with that knee? If it is ever swollen or tender I was guess you have patellar tendinitis.       Also is it just hyperextending or could it be subluxing?    Absolutely. Where I was working there was a lot of dog fighting in the area. People would use a small weak dog to lure big aggressive ones. So we get a lot of sweet little beat up dogs. It's really sad.   Yep. I think I need them more.    Yeah its really awful. Some of the sweetest dogs have been through so much cruelty. The little girl I am going to adopt looks like she was a bait dog for shitty fucks that fight dogs. It's so sad. She had clearly been beat up by other dogs a lot. Part of one of her ears was missing and when we first got her she was pretty underweight.    Yeah everyone is different. But I figured I would throw it out there. Mine is pretty consistent and reliable so maybe someone will find it useful.    This is only kind of relevant. I went and did a somewhat dirty photo shoot with a photographer. He was a huge black dude and he lived in a super nice apartment right in the city with his children and his two girlfriends. Now I am all for the poly stuff and nudity is fine with me. But it was so weird. When I arrived one girlfriend was just leaving, half way through the shoot the other girlfriend arrived. She was really nice (mind you I was mostly naked this whole time) and he showed her some of the pictures and then they sit there for a while talking about how hot I am. It was strange. Doesn't matter, got paid. And the pictures were pretty cool.   I gave my boyfriend an ultimatum a while ago. I told him he had to stop treating me like shit or I was leaving. He stopped treating me like shit.    I'm not entirely sure what your getting at as I'm not familiar with all the terminology. But I assume if your ankles are weak and you roll them easily without serious injury it is because your soft tissues are loose. What is probably happening is your ankles sublux (when the joint miss aligns but doesn't fully dislocate) and it goes back into place on its own.         You could possibly strengthen them with the right exercises to a point where they stay in place better.    Wow, did that happen to you? That's awful. You should do an AMA.   I have been curious about trying them for a while now. They are kind of weird and probably awkward since the ring sticks out and looks silly. And the concept of lining my vagina like a garbage can isn't too cute. But they must have their benefits.        The reason I am interested is because I get so sore quickly from the friction. In theory the female condom would eliminate that and just leave me to feel the pressure. (I know this is kind of a crude topic.)       So have any of you used them regularly before? Or at all? What was your experience?          EDIT: Thanks for your replies ladies. Too tired to respond to each of you. Maybe I will try one out one day. But I assume you are all probably right about them.  	112
 she's a werewolf but she is also A revenant(is a visible ghost or animated corpse that was believed to return from the grave to terrorize the living.)Though later legend and folklore depicts revenants as returning for a specific purpose (e.g., revenge against the deceased's killer)      Ok   Thanks!

Those were werewolves.      Thanks!               No problem    You know what else is rude ...reality       Touché I'm still learning and your advice really opened my eyes.   But I do get what your saying   The picture next to it was just there from when I was working on it, no intentions of side by side.         If you look close there is a piece of wood in his hand and if you look at the far right there is a fire so could be someone op knows.   You never know.   What if a demon and angel had a child would it be good or evil what would it be called by hunters ?   Well it's supernatural not that far fetched if dean became an angel   	68
 Thank you so much for your comment :) It's so hard to suffer in silence, feeling like a freak and not normal. I never want anyone to feel the way that I did. You're right it is hard, that's why I want to help others not feel ashamed anymore. Hope you are having a good day xx   Wow thank you so much for such high praise!   	2
 A beauty guru on youtube. She used to known as KaiKhaod/ForeverKailyn. People typically watch her to make fun of her.    She says it's normal but I would probably assume it's because she's obese.     Nope, still ever so present. She is now known as "MsKailynMarie" on Youtube and Instagram.    Here's the video the screenshot is from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FYTYHeeLCl8  She talks about how she wants to wear thongs but the string just disappears under her stomach.       I have this too!! I thought I was the only one!             Have you tried thrifting? You can definitely find a lot of cheap  fashionable clothing there! :)    I think you have a lot of potential if you lose weight, dress better  get new glasses (possibly contacts?). Also, I don't think the mohawk helps..    Is this your cat? This looks more than it was done with an app.   	12
 My friends can no longer send me funny memes or cool pictures or interesting articles. I've already seen them all.   600+ hours in the Elder Scrolls series between Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim.   I've seen so many of these places. Is this something that is typically uncommon?   This sounds like it belongs on yik yak.   Guys... Before you freak the fuck out about running out of right swipes, read: http://techcrunch.com/2015/02/03/tinder-tests-limited-right-swipes/#2finQa:8wOn   You assume. You don't know for sure.   Bates Motel is the story of how Norman Bates got so fucked up.   Just started watching this show, so I'm still in the honeymoon stage of thinking things like this are really fucking cool. Thanks for posting.   Did his house burn down?   I read "possum" as "potassium" for some reason and was very confused.   Aayy VA! I'm dealing with the snow here too. Thankfully I don't have many friends with school-aged kids around here. Right now it's all babies/toddlers out in the snow.   That last one, with the cigarette. I feel like it could have some profound meaning. I like it.      This guy is correct; don't downvote him.   Sorry about your cousin. I was a senior in high school when the shooting happened and had many friends at VT. I lost one of them. All the people being mean ITT can suck a dick. This gesture means a lot for those who had their lives affected by that awful day.  Hokie love.   There's a memorial for that? Where?   Hokie respect.   I would have been happy living my entire life without ever hearing the word "planogram" again. Dammit.   I was wondering about this. Thanks!   I remember several years ago there was a story about a family of a particular religion painting a religious mural on their driveway to commemorate their son's coming of age. The HOA had a field day with fines and the like. Made it to the local news. I was probably 15 years old, and it made me furious even back then.   Someone had to say it.   I find when I read these kinds of things I don't actually know what each individual word is, but I understand the overall meaning.   I love this!   I thought that was a cat.  Awesome pictures though. Seems like an awesome place to visit.   Totally legitimate reason to move.   I own one of your username.   You're an asshole.   2070 to see if The Jetson's comes true.   I went back and read the whole thing again after knowing that it was a dog, and it makes it even better. OP, you're fucking clever.   Um... Do you even math? 329 deaths over the course of *25 years* from vaccines, compared to 450 deaths *every day* because of not getting vaccinated. How do you not see the flawed logic here?   Out of all of the things ITT, this is the one thing that *actually* screams its own name while you use it.   And escalated quickly.   Now I'm imagining cars saying their own names like Pokemon.   How is it mail fraud?   I do this almost every time I need to break a larger bill. "Lemme just run up to the store and get a pack of cigs with the cash." Next thing I know I'm hearing "Is this credit or debit?" And I'm thinking "fuck I fucked up again."   It took me way too long to realize that they put a giraffe because "giraffe" kinda sounds like "graph". Way too long.   There are stars in front of the moon in this. It's a beautiful picture, but that bothers me.   Admitting it is the first step to recovery.   That was awful. Have an upvote.   And creepy.   Is anyone else slightly disturbed by this?   a little bit  being an understatement.   I was 100% sure of never wanting kids before I started working with them. Still 100% sure. Working with kids has made me like them a little more, but definitely still not for me.   I use the Carrot apps. For anyone who's played Portal, it's like GLADoS but for being fit. It's awesome. Also, with the Health app (on iPhones, I don't know if Android has an equivalent), if I record a workout on the Carrot workout app, or with one of my other workout apps (NikeRun, Fitnet, etc), it automatically puts the calories burned into my Carrot calorie counting app. Makes life a lot simpler.  What do you guys use and why do you like it?   I'm in the same boat right now. I've had the flu all week and today was the first day I felt well enough to put on real clothes and leave the house. I haven't been counting calories all week (and I'm pretty sure my app is going to yell at me when I open it up tomorrow).  No real help here, just letting you know you're not the only one. I will have to return to working out a bit slowly, as the flu took a lot out of me and I think I'll be weak and vulnerable for about another week.   I can see the Buzzfeed article title on Day 11: *This man sneezed every 30 minutes for his whole life. You won't believe what's happened to him!*   But sneezing isn't a pressure release. It's suppose to blow all the bad stuff out of your sinuses.   And if autocorrect would not change "redditors" to "redactors", that would be fantastic.   I do the same thing.   You sound like you're speaking from experience...   And it would work too.   $73.37   It's ok. I'm female, mid-twenties and I'm also seriously considering finding all the materials to do this.   And all this time I thought I must be the only redditor who watches Doc Martin.   It looks like Portwenn from Doc Martin.  Also just learned from this thread that the actual place is called Port Isaac.      Don't forget about Loudoun!!   Lost my composure. Laughing like an idiot at my desk. Now boss knows I'm on reddit. Thanks.   I also hate when people talk to me on a plane. Or anywhere. I keep my headphones in and don't make eye contact.   I like having the seat next to open so I can put my feet up, lean against the window, prop my laptop on my lap, and watch a movie.   There are subreddits for that...   This is now the background of my cell phone lock screen. Thanks for the post, OP! I needed a new lock screen.   I have the best chicken ramen noodle recipe ever. It sounds so gross but it's incredible.  Make the noodles, strain out most of the water. Then stir in about half of the seasoning packet and toss it with a bunch of lemon pepper. Set it aside.  Cook a can of cream of chicken soup. Ladle the soup over the noodles to your preferred level of soupiness.  Enjoy.  The whole thing costs like a dollar, and takes 15 minutes tops. And it's so delicious.   No... That's not... Am I missing something?   You made the sub; I think you should go first.   Is that a can of shaving cream in the vending machine?   Riding in Cars with Boys.   I wasn't looking for feels with my coffee, OP....  But keep your head up, and know that there is an astounding amount of support and help out there. And of course, you have your lovely reddit community :)   Thanks for ruining my morning...   ITT /r/misleadingthumbnails and spiders   Pretty much this.   OP tagged as lucky motherfucker.   This is in the wrong order...   I tried this, but I end up hitting snooze and taking my phone (alarm clock) back into bed with me.   My friend is reading this over my shoulder, and just turns and looks at me with this "oh really" look on his face.  Thanks OP.

They may have a bit more insight as to what kind of roles your transferable skills could be beneficial for.

I personally don't think we have a valid excuse to be rude to guys who approach us simply because we're "not in the mood" or we're already taken. If you genuinely just want to say hi and start a friendly conversation, there shouldn't be anything wrong with that!  If you're being sleazy/creepy and all up in our personal space too soon and getting touchy/feely - our body language will tell you we're uncomfortable then yeah, chances are you're going to end up getting rejected. Outside of these kind of scenarios - a rude bullshit snappy "not interested" is pretty stink. Turn right around and walk away - you just dodged a bullet.     Exactly! And then if the answer is no you can move on. What have you got to lose? Good luck and let us know how it went!!  In my opinion, when my texts start getting a bit sparse and short i'm actually just politely answering your texts but I'm also losing or feigning interest - I need to stop doing that and just be up front.

    "I wrote a hit play and directed it, so I'm not sweating it either" "Maybe I'm spending too much of my time starting up clubs and putting on plays. I should probably be trying harder to score chicks."  Urgh, one of my favourite films :)  Edit: My God, the more I look at all his quotes the more sense it makes http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0008323/quotes   Shit like this is why I left the MLP fandom   Gosh that's horrible :(   Poor little baby. Make sure you keep him in a dimly lit quiet room so he can have some peace whilst recovering. If you keep his wounds clean and dry, and try to minimise his stress as much as possible he should be on the road to recovery. When I was little one of my piggies was attacked by a magpie, he had to have stitches in his abdomen. As I remember he bounced back ok.  Edit: All the best OP, keep us updated   I demand this be redone but with them wearing little sailor hats. K thx :3   "Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert"   Well.   My heart just about melted :3 Little punks   Seconded, you'll need a little dust pan and brush that you use specifically for the piggies and nothing else, especially if you're keeping them on fleece, so you can give it a daily poop brushing. If your piggie-owning experience is anything like mine this will probably be your most used piece of kit :p  Edit: I'm talking like any old cheap household dust pan and brush, I think I got mine from poundland i.e. it cost £1)   "Dawn Faizey Webster, who has just been awarded a 2:2 Open University degree in ancient history – a feat she achieved by blinking the answers"  Bloody hell that's inspiring.    I get that it looks kinda cute and nice having a table overflowing with adorable creatures but WHO THE HELL THOUGHT THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA   Scapegoating. Circlejerking.    This is adorable. I know those feels, and they are amazing. I hope you have a super life, OP :3    As A Mother  Just what I was going to say. I have literally never ever ever heard anybody use this phrase, apart from people on the internet complaining about people using it. I get the attitude they are trying to criticise though, a sort of "I'm a mum so I know what's best" but again, outside of maybe the odd hysterical anti-vaxxers group, I've never encountered this...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss7AQC79t2s If it hasn't been already posted. Quest of the Manwhore.   But...skeletons don't real...?    Which men can have sex with hundreds of women? Rich, famous, extremely attractive, confident men, a combination of those.  I was responding to that, primarily. All I know is that some of my most promiscuous males friends openly hate and oppose red pill ideology, and don't fit many if any of the standards you said lead to increased women-getting.  Maybe it is easier for women to have a lot of sex, but let's face it, society doesn't look so kindly on women who do. The answer isn't to feel bitter about it but to just say "screw it" (no pun intended) and go out and live the life you'd like to. I'm sorry if you maybe feel your love life isn't what you'd perhaps like it to be, but the key ingredient is increasing your empathy, not bitterness and the compulsive tallying of the ways in which the 'other side' has it better than you.  Edit: as a tangential post-script I'd just like to add that I don't see the point of approaching dating from a position of cynicism and bitterness. I just don't see what enjoyment there is to be had from treating any interpersonal interactions in this way.   Precisely, and I think it really is a shame that we place so much emphasis as a society on how important and manly it is to have a whole lot of sex if you're a guy, and to lose your virginity as soon as possible. TRPer philosophy sees sex as a numbers game: everything revolves around sex and getting plenty of it to prove your worth but they clearly aren't in it for the pure and simple fact that they enjoy the act of sex itself. It's really sad.  It's ok to like having a lot of sex, it's ok to not want any sex. Just make sure you're doing it safely and for the right reasons with a person/people who are also happy and in to it. Simple.     Really though? Because I see a lot of that sort of mentality on TRP type forums, and yet when I think about my friends it's some of the most normal type guys I know who are the most promiscuous. My most promiscuous male friend is the most laid back, friendly guy you could ever meet. Yes, attractive but not hugely so. It just seems to me that the people in my groups of friends who have the most sex are the ones who do it because it's fun and they (shock, horror) actually like and naturally get on well with other people. Let me reiterate: actually *like* other people, enjoy sex for sex (not as some powerplay exercise) and would probably bend over backwards to help you if you had a problem. Hardly the douchey alpha archetype at all.  Sadly, a couple of my guy friends are into TRP and trying to be alpha, they rarely if ever seem to get laid.   Maybe it's just my skewed sample of friends but...yeah.   Same guy who brought us this musical delight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4QBRgyitFs :-\   To be fair, men should feel able to openly express their liking for traditionally feminine stuff. Good for him :3    Nice. This might do well with the good folks over at  /r/juxtaposition too btw.    But...what sort of reaction is this guy even expecting once he's made his point? Gah. Poor librarians.   I'd say get her 'toys' that provide shelter, if she's still nervous (or even if she isn't). A tube or a little 'tent' or even just more creations made out of cardboard boxes will do. This way she can leave the box she's currently cowering under and feel like she has other places to go in the cage, and to hide under should she feel nervous. If she feels like her only 'safe' space is her box, then she won't really want to leave it for long unless she has to.  Also chew toys, lots of chew toys.  And a cage mate once she's settled a bit more, piggies don't like to be lonely.  Hope she settles in well, all the best with your new little pal :3   Ignore the rude circlejerking that's going on here about time/money and crafting during a lecture. These are so cool, great job, OP :)   I'm not sure what exactly you're looking for, so here's a bunch of stuff on disfluency in speech. It's amazing how much our slip ups can tell us about how speech and language works. Every way in which you can mispeak a word has been categorised and studied and some psycholinguists spend their entire career researching what makes us say the wrong thing, from spoonerisms to good old parapraxis (Freudian slips) and of course the ubiquitous "uh".  Hopefully there's something in here that'll answer your question:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_disfluency  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freudian_slip  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malapropism  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism (this could be what you mean, it's when you accidentally transpose the first letters of two words, often with amusing results)  Source: am (not very good) psycholinguistic grad student   Thanks so much for sharing the pattern, I know I'll never get around to actually doing it myself but this is so cool. Be sure to post a picture when it's finished :D   My undergrad uni has a brony society, I went to one of their meetups in my final year. It was honestly a really fun evening. Sue me.   Oh I love the cat! It's great seeing other people's improvement, so satisfying :p Keep up the amazing work :)   As someone who uses fleece I can say it definitely makes things easier to have a hay rack, cleaning-wise. Mine was until recently in a hay rack over the kitchen area which is just a cat litter tray, and for the most part it stopped loose hay strands getting all over the fleece. However some piggies will refuse to eat from a hay rack (too much effort? I don't know) including mine. As hay should make up the majority of your guinea pig's diet I'd say provide it for them in whatever way works best for them eating it. Even if that does mean having messy fleece from dumping it in the cage in a big pile, as I've had to resort to doing.   Fucks sake OP why.   M'dragons   Amazing Atheist, no contest.   Jane Goodall is such an amazing person, I got to meet her after a talk she did in my city recently. I mean, I was too start-struck to actually say anything interesting to her apart from something about liking her talk and could she please sign my book but, hey, ^still ^^counts ^^^right?  Edit: Totally meant to say 'star-struck'. It's been a long week   That's such a cute idea. I named my two after characters from the book 'The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman'. If I ever get females I plan to name them after the Bronte sisters...or characters from Adventure Time...   Poor little pigling, hope he(?) gets well soon. Keep us updated :)   But people like this would just argue that they don't have those traditional indicators of success because everyone else is so moronic as to make him simply an unappreciated genius in his time.   My ~~boyfriend~~ Gentlesir has a moustauche, should I end it and try find someone more self-aware? Pls advise.   Totally, I started using it about a year ago, just because it was a nice time killer and often funny or interesting. The community though is just awful, I feel like it's definitely worsened more recently too, it's like having the lame parts of Reddit but you can't avoid them like you can avoid subs. There are times I genuinely come away from that place feeling kinda crappy.   I see these sorts of responses on Imgur too. It's so depressing. The only times Reddit and Imgur are eager to get behind any sort of feminist values is when it's to talk with a little too much enthusiasm about being able to hit women...in self-defense of course...   Same, that video gave me such chills. The way the people are literally jammed in the doorway, stacked on top of each other. Horrible stuff.   I don't know why you were downvoted, as a psych grad student, the title makes me uncomfortable.   Hey no problem :) it's one of those things you could go your whole life without even mentioning to another person, yet it seems like such a common experience. Just knowing that other people have acknowledged and put a name to something can be big help in a lot of cases.   It's one of those things that's hard to put into words really, but if you keep trying it should eventually 'click' and become easier the more you try (vague and unhelpful I know, sorry) :p   I'm honestly so surprised by the number of people who say they enjoy this sensation, most material I've seen online about AIWS has been very much oriented around 'How can I stop experiencing this?' or tips for snapping out of it. But I suppose those who enjoy it would have no real reason to kick up much fuss talking about it...   Those are excellent descriptions, and I think the first one really hits home how my experiences of it feel: incredibly isolated from the world around you. You can be touching something, or talking to someone inches away from you yet they feel impossibly far.    I just can't stand it, I don't know why. It sort of makes me feel incredibly uneasy somehow. But to each their own :p   Yeah, it's always reassuring to find out that some things are...'things' that other people have talked about and given names to :) When I was a little girl I used to sort of 'force' it during long school assemblies, by staring at the head of whoever was standing at the front of the hall and making it switch to looking tiny and close up. Clearly it didn't bother me so much back then and I really wish I hadn't; I think it's made it 'easier' for my brain to switch into that mode and gah, it's horrible.  A few tips for trying to snap out of it: Shaking your head. Getting up and moving about in the room, so you can appreciate the actual scale of the world through more senses than just sight. Pinching or hurting yourself in some way. If it's night time, switching on the lights can sometimes help. These can usually work for me, hopefully they do the trick for you too :)   Sounds to me like Alice in Wonderland Syndrome https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland_syndrome  Lots of people find that when they are tired, their sense of scale gets kinda messed up. I get this too, especially, as you said, when lying in bed. Other triggers can include focusing on small print or staring for too long at very far away or close up objects. Tiredness and illness can trigger it, but so can many other things like stress, apparently.  Anecdotally, I've noticed that people are always annoyed by it and find it an unpleasant, disorienting experience. I don't personally know a whole lot about it but you shouldn't worry about it, as it's very normal. Hopefully now you know what it's called you can do a little bit more research into it :)  Edit: I retract my previous statement; a whole bunch of people seem to really enjoy it, according to this thread. Mostly I've only ever seen discussions about how to stop experiencing it :p   When I was little we had Civ II and good God the hours I put into that thing. Then one day I was really really ill and all night long I just laid there in bed alternately rushing off to the bathroom to vomit and hallucinating Civ II imagery.  Never played it since...   The other day I think I saw one of my exes on one of the many reddit gw subs. I'm still not 100% it's him, but a few details add up (including his location etc.), as well as the little of his face shown in the photos looking a hell of a lot like him.  Of course it's none of my business what he does online these days, but it is amusing so I'll just keep stalking that account for the lols.   Many a time I've spent minutes pawing at my eye trying to remove a contact only to remember I'm not wearing them...   To those questioning why this is rage, I don't think it's to do with the fact that they aren't giving away their own money to just everyone. Rather more to do with the fact that they're barging in with their typical naked ladies and bravado on a situation where people are suffering in a way that isn't really all that helpful and is actually kind of tactless.      Nice one, good job buddy :)   I needed that, thank you kind stranger :) You too x   Seriously I appreciate the advice and it's reassuring to hear that your piggy did a bit of hooting without showing any obvious heart problems :) I'm watching them like a hawk and am ready to pounce should they show any other signs of anything being amiss. They're already such sweet personalities and I hope they stick around with me long enough to really get to know them both :3   Thanks for the info :) He seems completely fine this evening and I'm keeping a close eye on him. Yesterday (when he was hooting) I had just switched them on to fleece from shavings for the first time, so I'd be surprised if there was anything dusty going on; his breathing and nose seemed perfectly clear. This evening he is maybe a bit more subdued than he might normally be about this time (they tend to run and play a lot around about now) but it has been so hot today and it still quite warm in my flat (it's coming up to 11pm just now).  I wish I had had them both a little longer before this scare, because I'm still only just getting to know what is 'normal' for these two :p    He hasn't done it since I posted, so I've not had a chance to record it, but pretty much this, maybe a tad louder.  Edit: Forgot to actually attach the video :p https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzS8G3Gh_nI   Update: he's stopped hooting for now and is munching on hay in his 'kitchen' area. He's acting as if nothing has happened but I'm so worried, guys...   So I adopted my pair of guinea pigs about a week and a half ago. They are both male and I believe they are reasonably young and have seemed to be settling in really well. They've been running around plenty and eating and drinking with what seem like perfectly healthy appetites but tonight out of nowhere the biggest piggie, Toby, (who I actually posted a picture of just the other day) has started 'hooting' a whole lot, pretty much constantly.  I'm so worried and have been Googling and of course I am seeing a lot of stuff coming up about heart conditions. This is all very concerning, what else can you guys tell me about it? And what should I do?  It's currently 11.30pm ish where I am right now, so I can't really call my vet just now, but I'm guessing that's what I should do first thing tomorrow morning, right? This is so upsetting after having him for only such a short amount of time, he's not even really gotten used to me yet as an owner and I feel like I've failed him.   I often feel 'pain' in my dreams, or something approaching it, certainly intense discomfort at any rate. Many times this is when I'm experiencing pain irl though (for instance if I've rolled on to my arm and it's gone into 'pins and needles' mode I might dream it's on fire), however it often happens without any real world reason too. It's not uncommon for me to 'feel' the pain of being electrocuted or on fire, or maybe bitten by something.   I almost didn't notice this post, this sounds fun, count me in :D   I was watching Family Guy the other day (it's on pretty much constantly on the UK channel BBC Three, which is thankfully getting canned pretty soon). One of the jokes was basically "lol Asian women like small things and also have small breasts, AMIRITE GUYS?!". Maybe there was something I just wasn't getting and I'm a huge joyless wet blanket but my God, he seemed genuinely angry at Asian women, it was bizarrely unpleasant and just...not funny.   Precisely, and also this whole blaming other people when your joke fails thing is ridiculous (see Seth Macfarlane re: his latest film, he seriously gave an interview about how his film flopped because everyone else just 'didn't get it', though he was just unfunny, not necessarily offensive). You can't just yell out "HURR BLACK PEOPLE LOL AMIRITE?!" or "HURR DURR RAPE!" and then be pissed off when people don't laugh. Joking about a potentially riske or taboo subject doesn't automatically grant you some magical free pass for funniness just because the subject matter is off-colour, you actually have to make a decent or insightful joke.  	66
 Whether you do or not that isn't the question. I used cocaine and was addicted for six months than I was on oxycodone and went to heroin. This stuff is no joke. If your willing to put your brother or yourselves futures at risk go ahead and keep doing it. Substances are all a lie. It took me years to finally realize that myself. Nothing wrong with having a addiction. As long as you keep it in the past and do good today. That is what matters. Try something new. I would suggest going to a meeting or getting a sponsor. I was about a year sober and I felt like I was still running I was angry at myself, selfish, and tons of self pity. Not worth the struggle.   15ish years Adderall, Lorazepam, Anti Deprassants  16 Drinking alcohol, with a little bit of adderall and lorazepam still in the picture.  17 Addicted to cocaine for about six months than became addicted to oxycodone  18 oxycodone harder to find, I try heroin don't like it the first two three times but with withdrawing and it cost less I kept using it  19 to 21 Heroin went up to a $200 dollar habit and one point  21 to 22 and a half I was sober  22ish I relapse and use two times  Been sober since 7/25/14  These are good estimates I made.   I moved to Boston from California in middle school. (Total difference culture in each city it was very hard for me to adjust at a young age) I saw my grandma in the hospital in a coma. I started getting panic attacks throughout the month and went to the doctor and I was diagnosed with ADHD, depression, anxiety. I was given adderall and anti depressants. I started abusing the adderall because the more I took the happier I felt it gave me a sense of purpose and made me feel normal.   Live your life being kind to others and love your family your whole world can change in a matter of minutes.  	4
 I tried pretty much every SSRI and tricyclical antidepressant in existence over the last years. Its hard to give you a full list because I know only the local names and frankly a lot I have already forgotten again. Unfortunately for me I never really had any major success with it. I am not knocking meds I know a lot of people where they really helped. Its hard to say how it would have been without the meds at the time of course, maybe it would have gotten even worse.  I never had any major side effects, I was on Venlafaxine a long time which killed my ability to get it up, which was annoying but not a big deal because I was never in a relationship anyways :) Other than that I never had any side effecets on any of the meds I tried.  	1
 I love how they all squish in against each other 3   I knew I recognized her! Thank you so much for providing her a good home. I hope she gains some weight soon.   I remember this from a sociology prof back in my undergrad years about how these sexist lines in sitcoms (an example at that time was Everybody Loves Raymond) often go rather unnoticed because the female character's retaliation soon follows. Everyone laughs but the stereotype is still there (e.g. women belong in the kitchen / should be docile, etc.) and perpetuated.   We weren't talking about this seriously and I didn't exactly see that type of gag as a problem, but I thought it was interesting regardless.   Asian and stuck in low Silver. I've brought shame on my family.   That's such a sultry come hiether look. Beautiful!   My god they are so affectionate! They must really trust you. Thanks for being so kind to them.   I'll steal a plate just to hear that thundering roar of the Imperial guard   I am so so excited. Will she able to ship overseas? I'm in Asia right now.  Of course I understand she's still considering so no need to rush detail. :)   Is she a professional quilter? That is amazing! She should open up a store on Etsy or something.   I too love SP but arguing that it's acceptable to say fag because SP uses it frequently and "redefined" it in that one episode with Harley riders, sounds so dumb.    Holy crap she looks just like Emma Watson. And I don't think that's all because of makeup. I'm really envious...   Guess that's where Fantastic Mr. Fox settled!   He's also feisty as hell. Middle finger raised high in the Hobbit making film lol   Is this some kind of super secret anime series the knowledge of which must be earned, not given?   [Her comment photo](http://i.imgur.com/UCw9Lsh.jpg) was way nicer than the one she posted. Sure the difference in the colours of her eyes isn't that obvious, but I can still tell she has one greenish hazel eyes and another with blue.   You are a champ. I'm glad you're still with us to share your experience. The strength and positive attitude are really inspirational. The iron prosthetics look cool as hell. If I had RES I'd tag you as 50% iron man. Keep on rockin' it.   I was feeling bad for him and then he said a bunch of stuff about how all their comments mean nothing and don't help him at all. Also he told a guy to "go die". Wow. It's hard to support him when he himself made the post and refused to accept any advice.   I had to move with my cat overseas and in my case he was put in the part of cargo storage with temperature control. Had to endure 12+hrs including the immigration and security check :(   Those ears. Those eyes. They all raise a red flag. And yet I remain motionless and keep on staring! -- Cats' gaze causes paralysis. Confirmed.   Oh could that be the reason? It was protected, but they allowed me to copy (albeit only some) so I figured there was no problem. :(   Absolutely love him in the series. Even more endearing that the character was based on Lee himself.   His totally chill attitude makes me love him even more. Apparently he's incredibly humble and there was great disparity between the Thranduil persona and his actual personality so he was apologetic to fellow actors! :p   I think so too. Sometimes their jokes are really low brow and not very funny but they have some good episodes too. They seem to be turning it around esp in recent seasons.   "Report my cat for griefing"   Poison one of Coke zero cans. I'm pretty much addicted to it so it's bound to kill me one day.   Baby it'll blow your mind.   I watched Vertical Limit last night. Safe to say I'm doomed.   I feel like you also own a trophy for being the most non-competitive!   I don't believe you.   Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter.  I'm not a big fan of the franchise so I'll leave this up for hardcore fans to decide, but at least the way he looked in the first installment was just what I imagined for Harry Potter.   wp! I think the laughter in the end killed him twice.   I hope they add another item that includes NLR... :(   I hate toxic players/ragers and am in S5 myself, but I think you need to just ignore this type of people from the get go and forget. I have a feeling you're fairly young (correct me if I'm wrong) and his words may seem very personal to you. Trust me, it's not.  Also I think this goes against the subreddit rule "no personal sob stories". Just a heads up for the next time.   I think this will be a good compromise. I think Lux can still be pretty powerful with the standard AP runes (magic pen + armour + flat AP glyphs and quints) especially now that Talon can no longer silence ;_;   Umm wow... excuse me while I drool. He's gorgeous!   Was not aware of the fact that jars were trending. In any case this seems like a wonderful idea for key lime pies! I love them but they always collapse when I'm half way done eating a piece. This is an elegant solution!   I have a siamese x turkish angora mix cat. He used to be a sweet kitty with a lot of patience but as he grew older he's become increasingly manipulative. He knows the scheduled meal times but would extort mom into giving treats early by clawing sofa. I don't give in since I don't give a crap about the sofa but mom does so he keeps doing this :s  Another peculiar thing is that he doesn't ever purr except when he gets sleepy and sucks on his arm in the kneading motion. He does this only around me so I should feel blessed, I suppose!   Something like "of course you have to wait 5 years. Citizenship should not be given out. You should stop sounding like a brat that finally got she wanted"   Damn as a Vancouverite I wish BC could be one of the more badass houses but I don't think we can be Lannisters...   Ahaha yeah there were a character limit. Having to type Pr. Edward I. irked me so much as well.   Maybe he was a dick to his beaver too :(   I think you can pick up a beaver at the local pet shelter. And everyone knows Safeway is obligated by law to provide you with emergency maple syrup :D  Joking aside, congrats!   Really hope he can go back to looking like [this](http://i.imgur.com/5uJtgRu.jpg)...   You should give him a little sarcophagus too!   I can definitely see where Matt   Trey are coming from. FG has such amazing voice actors and gag potential but they made some really crappy episodes especially after the show came back for Season 4. It's frustrating to see that they have that "the bird is the word" kind of thing when they could be way funnier.   I'm in an MA program right now but I actually feel so dumb and really insecure about myself. I'm not sure where these people are getting this kind of confidence.   I remember there was another SRD with people asking OP for the original source when he changed captions of an ad and he got really defensive. He ended the conversation by saying something along the line of "whatever, I'm going to bed and have sex. Bye, losers". So this is what it boils down to in the end? Apparently no one else on the internet is having sex besides these guys?  I get they want to just end the argument. Sometimes people just can't come to an understanding or compromise at all. But to go out with that "doesn't matter, I'm having sex" remark... He may be in his late twenties but his mindset doesn't seem mature enough to consider marriage.   I made these some time ago when I came across a post by an American redditor who created house sigils for US states with [the sigil creator](http://www.jointherealm.com/). I had to make do with default cliparts available on the HBO website so some of them don't resemble the official flags, but I tried :p Enjoy!  [The album](http://imgur.com/a/0FmxN)   For someone who lectures against lazyass-ism that user has a lot of free time on his/her hands...   I get the feeling his/her parents are probably responsible for this kind of elitist thinking. Most kids I've met that are like this have really condescending parents. They change their mindset the exact moment their kids don't get into the Ivy league.   Thanks for posting. The album was gone by the time I got here. I thought the one who gave CC might have been too critical but now that I see the actual photo... wow. I don't think she was harsh in any way.   OP sounds like a very sweet girl and I really hope she sees she doesn't deserve this kind of shitty treatment, constantly being compared to girls that her bf used to know in high school.  Also:  He actually does have mental problems: severe suicidal depression and bi-polar disorder. I'm the one who called the ambulance miles away from him when he went missing and was about to commit suicide. That's how we started dating.  I'm clinically depressed myself, but I don't think this is the ideal path to starting a relationship.   Reminds me of American gothic!   Look at that beautiful coat! Just shows how far love and care go in any creature's well being. Thanks Op for being awesome!   I envy that! I'm working abroad right now and it's difficult to explain what Reddit is. People have trouble understanding that Reddit can encompass people of all nationalities, cultures, etc. Most people picture Yahoo / MSN type of website.   This is really surprising. I thought the US was undoubtedly the most reddited! I suppose most Icelanders are lurkers? I don't see a lot of posts in their perspective in AskReddit questions and whatnot.   Oh man I didn't know that... that's a bummer. But from what I read here he married a very interesting person who lives with enthusiasm and drive so that's really awesome. As I grow older I've compromised my fan girl infatuation so that I'd be happy when the actors I like date someone like JGL married, or actresses I like (e.g. currently Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone.)   Although there is ample evidence that Pannucci's has a disgusting cooking environment, it has always made me crave pizza.   I had to stare it for a few seconds to see if the ship was printed out. Really well done! Would love to see character paintings too. :)   AHH I'm so envious now... You must collect other weapons and boast them all in a long corridor lit with candles!   I really love the colours of the Sun one! Where do you plan to hang them?   That looks beautiful. I've always wanted to get something like that (for instance Aragorn's Anduril) but I feel like it would seem so out of place in my otherwise very plain room :s   That was also the first thing I thought, but then I realized how tiny they would be. Cute, but not very functional as a letter opener haha.   Your boss definitely sounds like a great person, but I'm sure you earned that kind of good gesture as well! Even the coolest boss would find it difficult to be that nice if you weren't already a great employee.   I love that content look on his face! I can almost hear the purring :3   It's so good to see a cat that appreciates that kind of effort. My cat would scratch it off his neck :/    I should mention that this is not my cat but that of a Korean illustrator Snowcat. See http://snowcat.co.kr/ for more photos!      I would really like to have to a heart-to-heart talk with my cat. Want to ask him if he's happy. Ever since I moved to work he's locked up in an apartment with nothing much to look at. (Back home he would look out the window and enjoy scaring unsuspecting birds.)  Also this: why do you wake up in the middle of the night at 3am to yowl when there's fresh water, a bowl full of food, and a clean litter box??   Mom is right for telling you that you're not cut out to be a lawyer. Follow your passion in literature and work hard on THAT instead.   Deckard Cain. I was actually really mad at Blizzard for taking him out while keeping that insufferable Leah. Now who's gonna tell me to stay awhile and listen? ;_;   When I was four I had to take a rather long walk to attend piano lessons. I still remember climbing down a very precarious, steep stairs and navigating through maze-like streets.   I didn't particularly enjoy practising, but in retrospect I'm glad I was given the opportunity to learn the instrument. I wish I worked harder on it.   I'm enrolled in a master's program and it's costing me a lot of money each term. The least I can do is to get the degree but I have little clue in regards to what my thesis should be about. Since I'm working full time and going to school at night I'm exhausted and feel like I'm not retaining anything.   I have thin straight hair that cannot be permed under any circumstance. I really wanted to have luscious curls but every hair stylist said I'd only be wasting money. :( So I've had the same shoulder to waist length straight hair for the past decade. Layered with bangs.   I managed to save up a decent amount of money while donating to charity. It will eventually be used to pay off my debt to my parents (tuition-related) but I'm happy I've saved up that much so far.   I'm so happy for you! I remember that feeling. University years were undoubtedly the best time of my life. Hope you have a good one!   Complacency. My current job is pretty okay but it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. But since it pays me relatively well and is stable, I'm afraid I'll just settle for this. I'm also working abroad when I'd much rather be home so there's that.   I feel like I saw him/her in /r/catbellies. I distinctly remember the Garfield-like quality!   White. Socks. Irresistible.   S/he is gorgeous! Those green eyes are just captivating.   I love it when they do that with their paw. It's like saying "five more minutes", except they can sleep as long as they want ;_;    She'll look beautiful with a little sailor costume!   I'm also annoyed by my cat knocking over stuff [but turns out they do it for a reason...](http://wanna-joke.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/funny-picture-comics-cat-bitch.jpg)   "You don't need to know anything else other than to adore and serve me."  Which is probably correct. XD   It's not fair... she's so pretty. Like haute couture beautiful. Karl Lagerfeld's Shupette has nothing on Luna!   Photos like this make me so envious of dog people. I can just feel the love 3   I doubt this will be much of consolation, but it seems s/he lived a wonderful life and had a great family since she got to be 22 years old. Sending you internet hugs.   Ok.   It's extremely frustrating when my original comment was my attempt to explain why people may take offense at OP's choice of the title. I didn't bash him. I know it was only a joke and I said it so in my first comment.  You said you don't care, and yet you continue to reply to my comment in length. What is it that you want to accomplish? I've already explained where my understanding of the two terms came from. I grew up in Vancouver, Canada with both straight and gay friends, and learned that the term homo usually bore negative connotations. It is only natural for me to assume that the word also bears the same sentiment on the web.  Frankly I'm tired of trying to argue with a stranger on the web. You are twisting my words and taking in only what you want. I will no longer respond. Enjoy holidays.   I didn't decide which term is okay to say. It's something I learned from my gay friends, academic/casual debates, media, etc. Perhaps people around you have different opinion. If you think homo has no negative connotation, by all means, use it.   If you have time to spare.  http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/03/23/fashion/gays-lesbians-the-term-homosexual.html?referrer= _r=0   I'm upset because you accuse me of being uncomfortable with something I actually support. I'm not sure you keep getting the idea that I view homosexuality in a negative way. But it looks like you're adamant in that opinion so I'll stop trying to convince you.   Haha ok. No I don't think it's a bad thing and in fact I support gay marriage. Have you ever encountered gays that refer to themselves as homos? Have you even read my comment? My qualms here was the use of the term homo (NOT homosexual) and the fact that it is widely recognized to be pejorative. The expression "no homo" is often used among people who disapprove of homosexuality. If OP said something like "I'm not gay but" people here wouldn't post negative comments.    I'm so sorry you lost her. Holidays must be especially tough. Sending you a lot of hugs.    " *sigh* I've been givin' these out for 647 years...'   I think you should update your original comment with this info before the shitstorm hits. It definitely made me better understand why you'd be concerned.  Edit: nevermind, the storm is already here.   Wow thanks for the info! I usually use the app for purchases and it's a bit annoying to think I may have overpaid considerably because the app failed to reflect the correct prices... TIL. I should go back to using the website!   Could someone explain the reference?   Content arbitrary trusting and brave? I shall conquer you in bed behind your wife's back and manipulate you to tend to my every whim... muhahahaha   While I can clearly tell OP only said it as a joke, it is my understanding that the term homo is strictly pejorative. I see men commenting on /r/ladyboners but they never say "no homo". Instead they'd say something like "I'm straight but so and so is hot".  EDIT: Apparently my view is not widely accepted. Downvote me to oblivion.   Man talk about mixes messages. Must resist walking into a fluffy but lethal trap....♥   "Paying attention to something other than me? Impossible!"  Also I tried to guess what game you are playing but I can only see so little!   My god. Those dire wolf figurines... If I were your coworker I would be staring at them whenever I pass your desk. Those are awesome.   "I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive! As long as no one wears the skin."  	103
 Awesome! So if my face has been handling the two products well but split in the morning and night, is it possible that using both at night could cause irritation? Or is my face basically used to it now?   A lot of people like Cerave products because they are very cheap. I would say look into a Cerave cleanser and a moisturizer (a lot of people like Cerave PM). Also, if you aren't wearing sunscreen during the day please check out the recommendations for one in the sidebar.   As for the acne, I would look into the spot treatment recommendations. So that's about four products I believe? Cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen, and spot treatment.    I believe you can use both, as long as they aren't drying. Just be sure to wait about 10 minutes after using the BP for it to dry, and then use the TTO mixed with a carrier oil. If you don't dilute the TTO it can cause a chemical burn, so be careful.   Yes. It could be any of the new products, but avoid using any products with fatty alcohols and see how your skin responds. If your skin is getting worse there's no point continuing your routine! Good luck.   I use the same Alpha Hydrox product. I think you should probably just use it once a day, preferably at night. I don't think you need to switch to a lower % if your skin isn't irritated. But yes, twice may be too much chemical exfoliation.   Can I use my Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion (SA 2%) and my Alpha Hydrox (10% glycolic acid) both at night? I really don't have a lot of time in the morning to wait for the Neutrogena lotion (and I believe I have to wait 20-30 minutes?). Can I do both at night? And how long do I wait in between?   I know I've seen people use the PC AHA and BHA both at night but I'm not sure how to go about it.   Also, just wanted to share a little success. I had a pimple growing on my cheek and I just left it alone, didn't pop it, nothing. I put my BP cream on it, and last night I mixed a bit of neem oil in with my moisturizer and this morning it was really, really reduced in size and the redness has lessened as well. So yay! I'm just recovering from a pimple I popped on my lip a few days ago that is now an ugly scab...sigh.   Haha I've become a little obsessed honestly. Sunscreen is my number one thing to replace with an Asian product once I have the money. And I was looking at the biore one, it's actually on my amazon wishlist lol. But thanks for the info, I would like a sunscreen with more than spf 30.   Why do you use the Thayer's on non-AHA days? Are you not supposed to use the two in one night?   Current routine:  AM -   1.) Rinse face with water.  2.) Thayer's Witch Hazel as a toner.  3.) Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion. Wait 10-20 minutes.  4.) Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence.   5.) Clinique Acne Solutions Emergency Gel Lotion on any active pimples.  6.) Light layer of Cerave in the tub.  7.) Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunscreen spf 30.   PM -   1.) Makeup remover wipe.   2.) OCM with sunflower oil.  3.) Cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser.  4.) Thayer's Witch Hazel.  5.) Alpha Hydrox, 10% Glycolic Acid  6.) Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence.  7.) Clinique Acne Solutions Emergency Gel Lotion on active pimples.   8.) Cerave in the tub.  9.) Thin layer of Vaseline.    Questions:   Can someone check that the order of my products is okay? I recently added in the witch hazel, is it okay to use that twice a day, and do I use it right after cleansing?   Also, when should I use my Benton Snail Bee? I've been using it after I wait for my AHA or BHA.   I bought neem oil because I heard it was good for acne. If I use it with sunflower oil as my OCM, will it help with acne? Or do I need to apply it directly to spots? I guess what I'm saying is how do I get the most benefit from it? I've heard people mix it with their moisturizer which I have tried.   Also, I haven't really noticed any different in my acne since using the BHA and AHA, but I have noticed a definite change in the feel of my skin. Do I just need to keep using them? My skin feels so much nicer, and if I skip my AHA at night I can definitely tell the next day. But as far as appearance goes I don't see a difference. Would it be worth it to try the Paula's choice BHA or AHA? Or are the products I'm using pretty comparable?   Sorry for the book. I'm trying to be patient with my skin. I take good care of it now, and have been for the past 3 months or so, and other than the feel of my skin I honestly can't tell a difference. If I started incorporating more exercise into my life, would that potentially help my skin? Is there any research to suggest that better fitness helps skin at all? That's one thing I could try along with getting more vitamins in my diet because I eat pretty terrible.   Thanks for the help!!   Thanks for the info! What does androgenic activity mean if you don't mind me asking?    Oh good advice! Thanks!    That's good, I'm hoping that will be the case for me too.  Thanks for the help.    Thanks, I'll do that!    Thanks! I always knew it could help but didn't know it could make it worse.    Oh no :( I'll have to talk to my doctor at the appointment. I've been on three different types of birth control but none have broken me out, so hopefully I won't have issues, but I am older now so who knows... Thanks for the input.    I am considering starting on the pill, but I am a little concerned that the hormonal changes might affect my skin somehow. I have pretty mild acne and I only get really bad pimples during my period. When I used to be on birth control, I don't remember if it made my skin any better but it didn't make it worse.   However, I'm going to be taking a different brand of pill, so is there any chance it could cause me to break out? What are your experiences with birth control and acne, positive and negative?   Thanks!   Well the reason I kept using it was because it was also a lotion and supposedly very hydrating, with the hyaluronic acid in it. So is it still okay to use? I understand I'm not getting any boosted effect.   Yeah, the sugar will probably be too much for my skin. I'm already doing an AHA and a BHA but I want my skin smoother... Maybe I should just give it time.   Oh, also, if it's a product, how do I tell which one? I added neem oil and the hado labo sunscreen around the time I started breaking out, but a few weeks before that I introduced sunflower oil. And it's weird because it's only on my temple area!    Ohgodwhy. I need to stop browsing this sub because I need money leftover for textbooks T_T   Your bath and body lotion probably has a lot of fragrance in it which can irritate skin.  I use vaseline intensive moisturizer which is fragrance free. I also use Cerave SA repair cream which helps keep my legs really smooth and exfoliated.    So my routine is: AM - splash face with water, rapid clear acne defense lotion sa 2%, neutrogena spf 30  PM - Ocm with sunflower oil, Thayers witch hazel as toner, alpha hydrox 10% glycolic acid, wait 30 minutes, benton snail bee high content essence, cerave moisturizer, then dab neem oil on spots, then thin layer of vaseline.   So I have these spots now on the sides of my face, they seem to be slowly fading but they appeared randomly about a week ago. They're like little bumps, possibly closed comedones but some of then I can wipe away with physical exfoliation. What is this? Would any product have caused that? They appeared near my temples and I never get acne there. For the record I change my pillow case every night and use sulfate free everything.   Also, I bought Hado Labo sunscreen, thinking it was the lotion everyone talks about (it was heavily discounted) but it's only spf 18. Can I use this in addition to my spf 30? Is it okay to layer sunscreen? I just want to get some use out of it.   What can I use for physical exfoliation? I have the eco tools konjac sponge but it's not abrasive enough, and the studio beauty konjac sponge is too abrasive so I only use it on my body. I always like the microexfoliant from Dermalogica but it's too expensive for me right now. Can I use brown sugar mixed with water or is that a big no no?    My boyfriend does the same thing! I think he's just not very observant.    I just purchased Thayer's Witch Hazel but I am not sure where to put this in my routine. How do you guys use it?   Also, how often can I apply a clay mask? The only area I get somewhat oily in is my nose, so I wanted to apply my mint julep mask on my nose more than once a week (also in an effort to reduce my SFs). My routine is below.  So my current routine is as follows:  AM - rinse face, apply Neutrogena Rapid Clear Acne Defense Lotion with 2% SA, wait 15-30 minutes, then apply Cerave in the tub - if dry - then Neutrogena Dry Touch Sunscreen with spf 30.  PM - OCM with sunflower oil, cleanse with Cerave Foaming Cleanser, then apply Alpha Hydrox 10% glycolic acid, wait 30 minutes, apply Benton High Content snail essence (my newest buy!), then I do a mix of neem oil and my cerave moisturizer, then layer with vaseline.  I patch tested everything, introduced one at a time, etc etc. I just started using my neem oil with my moisturizer so I'm excited to see if that helps at all.   My acne is pretty much at bay (for now), I have one pimple on my lip but I'm doing all the things I can to prevent acne (fresh pillow case every night, SLS-free toothpaste, conquered my obsessive face touching, I don't pick anymore).   Thanks for the help!   Check out the sidebar information on starting a routine. A lot of people like Cerave products. When I first started out with a skincare routine I would remove my makeup with mineral oil, then wash the oil off with Cerave Foaming Cleanser. Then I use Cerave in the tub moisturizer. You can find all of these products at Walgreens or a drugstore.   It's a lot of trial and error with acne. And it's a learning process!   I put on a ton of moisturizer and sleep with vaseline :( And I'm never flaky! My only symptom is itchiness.    How can I minimize the itchiness of BP? I find that my Clinique emergency gel spot treatment works really well but after I use it my face itches like crazy the next day. Is there any way to prevent this?    Am I the only one who likes the smell? My boyfriend HATES it lol. But I don't mind it!    Do you have oily or dry skin? I would check out the advice in the sidebar.   My recommendation is finding a gentle cleanser and using that only once a day to prevent drying out your skin. Sometimes Cetaphil can cause breakouts so it might be worth trying something else.    How do you keep the vaseline on your face at night? I always end up on my side or my stomach and it's pretty much all gone in the morning so I'm not sure it's really doing much.    Damn! I gotta order some next time I put in a purchase on Amazon.    Ooooh! I really want to try the super volcanic pore clay mask and all the green tea stuff from innisfree. Everything looks awesome.    Dang I should order one after hearing such good reviews!    So I did some searching and [this](http://www.amazon.com/Skyroad-Quality-Exfoliating-Mitten-package-/dp/B00CA8ZEIS/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc ie=UTF8 qid=1408551434 sr=1-1 keywords=italy+cloth) product was recommended for exfoliating KP. I guess you soak in the bath first and then exfoliate. Could be similar to what you'd get using the gloves but it is a Korean product haha.    I think it's quite textured, more so than a konjac sponge. But it may depend on the brand. I know I have a studio beauty "konjac sponge" that is not really that, and so rough I can't use it on my face - but it's okay on my body.   Are you sensitive to tea tree oil? I read of someone having success with using a mix of tea tree oil and a carrier oil on their KP. could be worth a shot.   Other than that, you could try other chemical exfoliants like glycolic acid or lactic acid. Paula's Choice has a few products made specifically for KP, but I'm not sure on the ingredients.   Another possibility is neem oil, which is used for some skin conditions like eczema  and I use it for my acne. I have not tried it on my KP but if anything it would be moisturizing.   I would keep the areas you have KP very very moisturized, and I really love my vaseline intensive care lotion that is fragrance free. And I would try exfoliating the area as much as your skin can tolerate it. Check out exfoliating gloves whenever you're in a drug store next just to get a feel for how the texture is.   I hope that helps. It gives you a few things to try. I might do a search now for Asian products meant for KP because I'm curious now!    What products have you tried?  For my KP my routine is to exfoliate the area when I shower with some exfoliating gloves (I got mine at Walgreens), and then keeping the area shaved. Then I use Cerave SA Renewing Lotion (I believe that's what it's called... It's got salicylic acid in it). I use this at least once a day. I also use vaseline fragrance free moisturizer and avoid any lotions with fragrance as they can irritate KP.   So I know none of those are Asian products but I have found this routine to be working. The exfoliating has helped immensely and the lotion from Cerave is quite good. I have also heard the Repair Cream from Paula's Choice, the bha, is also very effective for KP but I haven't tried it myself.   Apparently more people see improvement with a BHA than an AHA with their KP, so if you wanted to find an Asian product I would look for one that is a BHA or has salicylic acid in it.   Oh, and tight clothing can aggravate KP, as well as scratching or picking at it, so it's best to wear looser fitting clothes whenever possible. I got all this info from a video on YouTube but I can't remember who it was! I hope that helps!    I was gonna get the steam cream haha! But I resisted! Maybe in next haul :)    Hey I'm new too! Since I'm on a budget I only bought two products initially, the Benton Snail Bee high content essence because I read such good reviews of it on here, and then some sheet masks to have fun with.   Then I'll probably get some OST C20 to treat my PIH. These will just be added to my current routine, and eventually I'm going to patch test a sunscreen and replace my Neutrogena sunscreen with it.   So basically I'm adding products in slowly so I can get use out of my old products and patch test new Asian products to improve my routine!   Hey guys! I'm new to this subreddit. I have my first order coming soon, I got the Benton Snail Bee High Content Essence and a pack of MBD sheet masks. I'm excited! I am a broke college student so this is a dangerous addiction lol. I'm already filling up my amazon wishlist with other products to try! I really want to get OCT C20 to help my PIH.   Today is a really lazy day for me, since I have about a week of winter break left until school. I should really stop buying things so I can pay off my tuition lol...    Thanks! I'm not sure what the acne is even after looking at the guide. I'll have to do more research into it.    I would use it once or twice a week or as much as your skin can tolerate it.    My current routine is:  AM - Splash face with water, Neutrogena rapid clear acne lotion with 2% SA, wait around 10-15 minutes, and then neutrogena dry touch sunscreen SPF 30.  PM - Remove makeup with mineral oil or a makeup wipe. Oil cleanse with mix of neem oil and sunflower oil, wipe off with microfiber cloth. If I feel dirty still I will use my Cerave foaming cleanser after the oil cleanse. Then I apply Alpha Hydrox 10% glycolic acid and wait 30 minutes. Then I apply my clinique emergency gel with 10% BP on any acne spots and wait 10-15 minutes. Then I apply moisturizer and a layer of vaseline.  I haven't been using the BP as much because it leaves my face so itchy the next day!  My question is if I wanted to use neem oil as a spot treatment how would I do so? Do I put it on before my moisturizer or after? I feel like if I use it before my moisturizer then wouldn't my moisturizer wipe it away? Or do I wait to let the oil sink in?  Also, what is it called when you don't have whiteheads or pimples but it's like hard plugs in my pores? If I pop them they come out as hard bits of I assume sebum or something. If I pop them they go away very quickly but if I don't it feels like they're on my face forever. What can I do about this?   Baha I got a good chuckle out of the whole shoving fruit up your ass!    Yeah they're plastic, but if you want you could use like regular gloves. Just whatever will keep the vaseline on your hands!   I want to record my skincare regime so that I can pinpoint what is most effective, but I'm not sure how to do so. Does anyone else do this? How do you organize it?   At this point I'm just writing down what I did each night, but I'd rather have something more organized. Any ideas?    Yeah, I'm pretty much the same way. More stress = more acne. I have pretty bad anxiety so I'm taking medication (I'm taking 50mg of sertaline for anxiety/depression) and it's reduced some stress.   So my only suggestion is to reduce the anxiety somehow, either through lifestyle changes or medication. Also, you should try to get 8 hours of sleep - I started taking melatonin at night since I sometimes have trouble getting to bed on time.    Do you use any kind of moisturizer on your hands? Any time I wash my hands I use a moisturizer.   At night you can apply a moisturizer and then apply vaseline + gloves (I use the plastic ones) and you'll wake up with super smooth hands!   Parents can be super cruel. My mom was like this when I was in high school and for a teenager I had pretty moderate acne. I scrubbed my face so hard after she told me I had gross blackheads on my nose (which turned out to be just sebaceous filaments, which are normal), I was left with just a giant scab on my nose. Ugh.   Sometimes oil production occurs because you are not moisturizing your face enough. You could try not washing your face in the morning and just using water, then your moisturizer.   You could also try doing a mask weekly if you aren't already! I really love my Aztec Healing Clay and my Mint Julep mask. Those are both good for oily skin types.   Good luck, don't let your parents get you down. Keep hanging out with your awesome friends!   It's SLS, or sodium lauryl sulfate. Sensodyne toothpaste doesn't have that ingredient so I use it now!   My boyfriend will just be like "boobs!" and then go back to what he was doing haha.    Lol true. My bf brought me chocolate cake during my period. And he even bought me the right tampons, such a keeper.    I have, yeah, which is why I was looking into the super serum because it has both vitamin C and niancinamide. But I'm also using the Alpha Hydrox and SA 2% with not a lot of change :(   My current routine is:  AM - Splash face with water, Neutrogena rapid clear acne lotion with 2% SA, wait around 10-15 minutes, and then neutrogena dry touch sunscreen SPF 30.  PM - Remove makeup with mineral oil or a makeup wipe. Oil cleanse with mix of neem oil and sunflower oil, wipe off with microfiber cloth. If I feel dirty still I will use my Cerave foaming cleanser after the oil cleanse. Then I apply Alpha Hydrox 10% glycolic acid and wait 30 minutes. Then I apply my clinique emergency gel with 10% BP on any acne spots and wait 10-15 minutes. Then I apply moisturizer and a layer of vaseline.   This routine specifically has been used for about 2 weeks, but I have been doing a skin routine similar to this for a couple of months. I included one product at a time and patch tested everything.  My issue is with my PIH. I don't feel like it's fading at all. My acne is generally gone, I only have issues with acne on my jawline that I believe is because I have a problem resting my chin in my hands. My only problem is I have a lot of PIH and it's really frustrating. What else can I do to fade it? I have been using a combo of some kind of AHA and 2% SA for a month or two.   I have been considering getting a serum, like the super serum from Silk Naturals. Would this help with the PIH?  Also, for my body I am using the SA renewing lotion from Cerave in the morning and then either my Amlactin or my Alpha Hydrox at night to exfoliate and keep my KP at bay. What else can I do for my KP/bumpy skin? How often can I exfoliate my body physically? Thank you!!!   What is the difference between KP and regular pores? My legs look okay if you're a few feet away but if you look close they have red spots all over, and they are slightly raised. Is that KP? Or is that what regular legs look like?   I guess my stupid question is what are pores supposed to look like on your body??   What will a derm do? Would they give you a prescription or would you have to get laser treatment?   I had the same question actually, I have bad self-harm scars on my leg. I hope you're all good now!   The only thing I would suggest is to put sunscreen on the scars if they will be exposed to the sun at all.    I did keto for a while and it didn't change anything about my skin :(   That study can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/2rupwx/low_glycemic_indexload_diet_is_beneficial_for/).    The downvotes are because there isn't a lot of data to back up eating healthier with better skin health. Better overall health, yes, but eating better doesn't necessarily make your skin better.   You look so amazing and so much happier! I love how simple your routine is too.    Wait, the oil mix works on your KP? How often do you apply it?   I've tried a couple of things over the years. You could try stretching before you go to bed, or progressive muscle relaxation, which is where you tense muscles individually and then release the tension. You could add in small amounts of exercise during your day, since the idea is that the more tired your body is the easier it will be to sleep.  I also tend to sleep with some kind of video on that I find relaxing. Lately I've been watching Sims 4 house builds! Videos on Soothetube tend to be quite popular.   I also suggest taking melatonin, which someone else suggested. This also helps if I take it after waking up in the middle of the night and can't fall back asleep. I would also avoid caffeine any time after the morning.   Good luck. Creating a before sleep "routine" is often helpful as well, because it cues your brain that it's time to sleep - i.e. brushing your teeth, drinking tea, changing into PJs, etc etc.    What product do you use?    For the scarring, I would recommend using a chemical exfoliator like an AHA or BHA (you can look in the sidebar for more information). You could also check out the information about PIH, which is the technical term for acne scarring.   Also, be sure that you are using sunscreen daily because the sun can darken acne scars.   There's also information on the sidebar about routines for combination skin or oily skin. Good luck!   Is it okay to switch up my routine from day to day? All of the products I have used I patch tested and I know they don't break me out, and I introduced them slowly. I basically just switch up the products I use for chemical exfoliation and for treating breakouts.   Right now I'm interested in fading my PIH and making my skin look more glowy - if that makes sense - so I've looked into some serums like the Silk Naturals Super Serum. Has anyone used this? Does anyone use a serum with Vitamin C and what have the results been like?  Thanks!   Definitely not. I did nothing for my skin until I was in my 20s my skin was never that dry! Hopefully you can find the root of the problem.    What's your current routine?   I assume that's PIH, which you can read about in the sidebar. What's usually recommended is adding in an AHA! Also, be sure to wear sunscreen everyday to prevent future spots.      I had this problem too, then I tried mixing it with a makeup brush I don't use anymore (it was clean!) and that worked well to get out the clumps.   It was also recommended to use apple cider vinegar instead of water but I haven't tried it yet.    I would experiment with different oils just because coconut oil can cause breakouts. I would start with mineral oil because it's a good starter oil and see how that goes.   For dryness, a lot of people on here like to put vaseline or aquaphor on their face after their moisturizer, and I find that keeps my skin very smooth.   I would definitely read up in the sidebar in routines for dry skin!    Thanks! I have seen konjac sponges recommended before so I might pick some up. I've seen an ecotools one I believe at target.    Hey I did a similar look recently off of a video from Batalash. Is that where you got your inspiration? I love those two colors together!   Like the other posters I just apply it once in the morning, as I do wear makeup.    Holy crap, this could totally be why I get acne on one side of my face even after changing my pillow cases all the time. Thank you!!! Gonna wash my pillows now.   So right now this is my basic routine:   AM: Neutrogena Dry Touch sunscreen spf 30, then occasionally Clinique Acne Solutions Emergency Gel-Lotion (BP 10%) if I have spots.   PM: Remove makeup with sunflower oil, then mix neem and sunflower oil together for oil cleansing, then I use Neutrogenas Rapid Clear Acne Defense Face Lotion (which has salicylic acid in it), wait around for 10-20 minutes, then Cerave in the tub, then a thin layer of vaseline.  Once a week I do a clay mask.  I did patch test and added everything one at a time, this routine has been a big work in progress!  So my question is, my skin has really been looking a lot better, especially since adding the neem oil. I don't really even get spots anymore and my PIH is fading. However, on the sides of my face I'm noticing bumps, and I don't think they are closed comedones because I can scrub them off. What is that?   Anyway, I'm also wondering if I should add in physical exfoliation to my routine, and if so, what? I do have a Clarisonic but I don't know if that would be too harsh. Can I just use a washcloth?  Thanks!  Edit: I forgot! I also wanted to ask about sheet masks, because I wanted to try them out. Where can I get them, and what kind should I get? My skin is really normal and not really oily or dry, and I have light acne and PIH. I also heard you can use sheet masks as much as you want, is that true?   Ahaha this is hilarious! And I thought my boyfriend was bad.    I think so. According to the website it says cerave is a humectant (I think) and can be drying so following it with an occlusive is a good idea. I thought it was from my BP but I stopped using it and it still happened. So I just put vaseline on top and my lids are much nicer.    Oh my god this picture is hilarious.    Wow that makeup is killer! Awesome job.    Flaky in my eyelid crease.    I do, but I had issues with my Cerave making my eyelids dry, so I follow up the moisturizer with a small amount of vaseline. For whatever reason my eyelids dry out like that, not sure if it's because it's winter.    I have ringing in just my left ear but I've always had issues with it not draining properly. I do notice that when I'm very anxious that ear does ring, but it isn't constant.    Do you have anyone close to you who knows you have anxiety? You could have them call for you or have them come to your appointment.   It's the first step but it's often the hardest. Good luck!    Thanks! I have am-lactin body lotion at home, I do find it makes my legs smooth but it smells bad to me. I will check out that shave gel too!   Do you wax them at home or get it done professionally?   I'll check out that moisturizer! Thanks!   	83
 I've heard it's a good gun for getting money. Thoughts?   Cool idea! We should post them separately and talk about them. I'll get to work!   This is really freaking cool   crowd!!   I'm stuck with an iPad and an android phone tonight, and no credit card. Is there any way you know of that I can watch TLC?   Thank you!   Where's a good place to see it?    Hey thanks for this!   On this same line, what about frizbee golf?    I like these threads. Let's discussion occur.    Halle berry   Okay, kind of off topic, but also... Derek, in the eighth season. I could not stand him   Mine was when I dove headfirst into a  group of zombies, including the panzer soldat, my plan being to suicide. I was playing with randoms who were all dead. I had the zombie shield, and somehow I not only didnt go down, but the panzer died, and I just got up into a nuke it dropped. Worst suicide ever         I try and go as long as I can without getting a kill. Farthest I made was round 27, three randoms, 0 kills, 17 revives, 2 downs.   Hey, awesome, me too. I'll send you a friend request at 4:30 most likely   :( sorry, I'm est so that'll be around 6 Am, I have to work then   Hi! I'm looking to do the origins ee today, any time. I'm on xbox, and Ive got a mic. My gamer tag is xSu1CiD3 D1NOx . I'm not sure if the o in Dino is a zero or an o, :/   Hey, I'm looking to do the origins ee, any chance you'd want to today?   Hi, im looking to do origins ee today, message me if youre free and I'll shoot you a request   This is a fist for me, and it feels warm and fuzzy!   ಠ ಠ   Your friend wants you to call them.   Just something I noticed about your poem, it can be read back words (by line) and is still beautiful. I enjoyed it.   Beautiful   Its almost impossible to die. My high round is 159 (not bragging, its just a time thing, not much skill)   Pretty chill interview, haven't seen anything this civil and still interesting in a while. I like it!   14, 25, 192, 67, 17   I have to be honest, I loved this map. It felt pretty small/simple to me, but for some reason the homey feel of the map made it a fun fallback if I ever get bored with origins, die rise, etc.   But... King Midas!   I did literally the exact same thing at my school... Like, word for word   Everything he said was true, mate... Dunno what to tell you   This is so freaky similar to the book Solaris! Check it out, its about a new planet discovered that's covered entirely in a strange ocean. 1960's sci fi book   That was very eloquent way to describe the driver in the whites actions   Right here with you. School dance tonight :/   He y, sorry, somewhat new to this. How did we learn zombies have human thoughts?    So, from what I've seen, most of us seem to suffer from extreme heartbreak. I was thinking about the girl I love yesterday and thought of a lyric in pearl jam's song Black. He says "I know you're going to be a star in someone else's sky, but why, why can't it be mine"  So I started thinking... The lead singer of pearl jam had someone to lament over. I have someone to lament over. How many people have someone to lament over?  And the thing that comforted me was just the realization that this person I wanted so much ... There's thousands of them. Everyone has one, it seems.   Suddenly she seemed less special   You impacted my life tonight in a very kind way. Thank you. Never forget the good you are even if everything is bad.   You make a convincing argument.   I just can't live with myself when I let that little guy go down.   1. Buried  2. Origins  3. Kino  4. Nacht  5. Nuke  	41

I've been with this guy for a really long time, and even before that, he was my best friend since middle school. We have a pretty solid relationship for the most part- no trust issues, no fighting, etc. However, I have depression and anxiety, he has depression, and we both aren't in the best situations involving family. He has gotten really depressed, and because of the parent he's living with, he can't talk a lot outside of school, so we have gotten a bit distant.   I am that type of person who has relationship anxiety and needs constant reassurance, which is not healthy whatsoever, and I am receiving help with that, however it is still hard to believe that he loves me, blah blah blah. So, him getting distant has been very difficult, especially since we have two friends (both girls) who's lives are just as wrecked as our's. He feels the need to take care of everyone, so he's trying to keep them, me, and himself up all at once. However that usually ends with me being ignored.. He says he doesn't want to ignore me, or make me feel like he doesn't care, he's just "stressed" and "doesn't want to have to choose" between who to help. He does this every time things get bad, and always bounces back (aka recognizes that I need him too). How do I stay okay with everything while he is having these issues? How can I help him? How can I stop needing reassurance in times like these?    I'm 13. and I don't advertise my phone number anywhere, but it's not hard to get it. A man (who gave me his name but stupid me didn't remember it) called me from an unknown number stating he was from my local police deparrment (yes, he gave me my specific city) and that he needed to speak to my mother. I told him "If you are from the police department why don't you call my mom?" he said "I don't have her number, ma'am." I said "If you are from the police department, then there is no reason for you to have my number, however you should have her's. Please don't contact me again" and they hung up on me. Should I tell my mom? I'm really scared. This unknown caller called me earlier in the day as well, but I missed the call. What should I do?   My mom knows. None of what I write describes personal situations, just vague and metaphoric insights.    I'm a pretty young writer, but I still consider myself to be good. However, very little of what I write are stories. I mostly write about the world, and what's happening around me. Almost like a journal, yet not personal enough to be seen as one. I like to write about what it's like to have depression, anxiety, anorexia, etc. I like to try and give people an inside look of what it's like to suffer from these things, and I do it pretty well. I've won awards at school and such. Is this a good subreddit for me to share and get criticism?  	6
 "FOR GONDOR!!"   i am pretty out of shape. i was just hired for may 1st. what exercises should i do to get in shape for planting? i have assess to a gym, pool ect.   thanks      could you expand a bit on the negative attitude towards rookies? how were rookies treated differently than veterans?   is there anything you still feel like you need to accomplish comedically, or have you reached your artistic goals?    is this a legitimate company? how do they treat rookie planters? anyone planted with them before? thanks   asteroids like this one are the reason the government always keeps a rag tag group of oil drillers on hand.

 What's even the point of crib bumpers anyways?  Just big fluffy decorative crib wall pillows of death that look nice?   The part of Inception that I found to be deep was Dom and Mal, with the whole token thing. It's possible that during the entire movie Dom was asleep and Mal kept infiltrating in an attempt to wake him up, but he perceived her to be a threat to his missions instead.  There's also theories about each of the characters being alts in Dom's dreams, which are always against Mal's invasions.  Unless I'm just 100% incorrect, which I may be.  I formed this hypothesis while under the influence.   This is my first week back at work since having my baby.  So sad and so tired.     I'm going to disagree with everyone here about the calories.  If your doctor suggested that low, I say go for it.  Plenty of morbidly obese people jump start their weight loss with doctor-supervised diets with crazy low calories.  That's just what your diet is, doctor supervised.  Your doctor isn't an idiot, he is highly educated in metabolic disorders and he suggested it for a reason.  Whether it be because your BMR is lower due to PCOS (see below) or as a means to reduce your stomach size and make you fuller faster, I would personally take his advice.  [Also, there have been studies performed on PCOS's effect on BMR, and it has been shown that women with PCOS and insulin resistance have a BMR lower than the average non PCOS/IR woman by as much as 700 calories.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18678372)  So if an average woman burns 1800 calories/day at your weight, you may actually only burn 1100 calories/day.     http://i.imgur.com/Gh2GzLF.jpg   I agree absolutely. That's one of the reasons why I don't advertise my faith, because I know I'm not a great representative. The big things I struggle with are external, easily seen by others.    Definitely agree with you.  I'm a Christian and the whole point about being a Christian is that we are absolutely imperfect and sinners.  Yes, we as Christians should strive to be more like Jesus, but it's impossible to not be sinners.  Honestly, if I was called out by someone who didn't share my faith I would be a little peeved, because the person calling me out doesn't share the same perspective I do.  Call me out on just being a bad human being if I am, don't bring my faith into it unless you're another Christian who I also consider a good friend trying to keep me accountable.   Why do researchers include SIDS in these studies?  I thought SIDS =\= accidental suffocation.   I was really off-put by him too, mostly by the bragging.  Bitch, I don't care that you were in nip/tuck.  Just because professionals made you up and put you in front of a camera doesn't mean you're a great drag queen.   Yes, my husband did.  We were juniors in college and had known each other since 7th grade.  We dated for 6 months in 9th grade until I dumped him, but we stayed best friends.  During college I would hang out with him when we were both home and we would usually end up making out most of the time.  I had made up my mind, though, that I wouldn't date him or be with him and let him know.  During the fall semester, I saw on facebook that he had entered a relationship with a girl I knew he was only with because he was lonely.  I realized how much I cared for him when I saw that post.  It was like a punch to the gut.  So I called him up and professed my love for him, knowing he loved me back.  He called his gf that night and dumped her and we started dating immediately.  We didn't make it social media official for a few months so that we wouldn't hurt the other girl's feelings by immediately bragging.    Got married a couple years later and now have a 7 week old son together.  I don't regret it at all.  I am sorry I went about it the way I did, by hurting another girl.     Good luck!  My tip: eat as much as you want at the beginning.  You may either be ravenous and want to eat as much as you did before, or you may get really full really quickly due to the high fat content.  Don't worry about calories these first couple of weeks, just work on getting keto adapted.  Once you're keto adapted your body will probably start talking to you more clearly and let you know when you are truly full.     Whoa, DeLa was unrecognizable.    I've never personally come across a doctor who wasn't pro keto, especially considering the fact that I have PCOS and am pre diabetic. The medical professionals I come across that are against it are nutritionists and dietitians.    Most people I have encountered via social media don't see it this way. They see it as a murder, almost certainly because of the way he was portrayed in the media, as an angel faced innocent victim.    It seems like all the guidelines for reducing SIDS are actually reducing accidental suffocation. They say things like "to reduce the risk of SIDS, keep all fluffy blankets and bumpers out of the crib due to risk of suffocation". Ok, that's not SIDS, that's accidental suffocation.    Tell him you feel his priorities lie elsewhere and that it's really hurting your feelings and starting to make you feel resentful. My husband can fall into similar patterns and for him it usually coincides with when he's feeling depressed.    If he's anything like my husband the baby's crying won't wake him.    Awesome!! So glad everything is going well.  Thinking of yall and sending speedy recovery vibes!   In the middle of a panic attack: just calm down!  No way, I never would've thought about that! Thank you for solving this mental illness for millions of people!!   Something similar happened to a friend's gerbil. Gerbil got out and was lost for a few hours. Phone rings, friend runs to get it and the gerbil darts under his feet mid stride. The result was unpleasant.    MAID SERVICE   I'm formula feeding so no worries there. Though he won't eat more than will last him 3 hours, but it may be worth looking into :)   I will have to check out that book. Until 6 weeks was your LO still on waking every 3-5 hours or so to feed?  Does your LO sleep in his/her own room now at 6 weeks?   Same for mine, I just started swaddling my baby's lower half because he'll fight his arms free if I don't.    My LO is 4 weeks old and every day he is a little more awake than the day before. When does his sleep schedule get more...normal? When should I start setting a designated "bedtime" and naptimes? Right now we are just playing it by ear based on when he eats. I will admit we are encouraging a little more sleep during the day, which i think is starting to backfire and keep him awake at night. It's just hard having to pack an apartment with a wide awake baby and 2 cats who still aren't used to him yet.    Mine are mostly irrational.   Alexis Mateo: I just can't stand her face or voice. I especially hated her during the patriotism challenge when she was jumping, shrill voiced, and unintelligible.   Coco: I'm all about Alyssa and thought the drama was so unnecessary. She seemed so fake during s5. And she looks a hot mess in her Oraquick commercial  Adore: I hate her voice. I had to work to get through season 6 just because of her voice.   Laganja: hate her voice and how incredibly fake she is. And we get it, you smoke weed. I don't like that it's your shtick.    [Here you go](http://i.perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/taylor-swift-plaid-poncho-dolce-and-gabbana-nyc-street-style__oPt.jpg) for the knit poncho.  Totally doable and fashionable   Perez Hilton.   Can't stand the guy but can't give up his site   This is super random but I follow a woman on INstagram who is really into lifting and lives in Singapore. She is also a strength coach at a gym.  PM me for her Instagram name (cb I don't want to share personal info on here publicly), her gym might suit you!   I did before I got pregnant. I'm 4 weeks postpartum now and really itching to get back into the gym and start stronglifts again. Cardio just doesn't do it for me, but I'm going to start c25k with my husband soon because he wants to start running. I see so much more progress from lifting anyways. And it gets your metabolism up afterwards  for a lot longer than cardio   Gone Girl is seriously good. Those other books are nowhere near that level.    Biomedical engineering. Mathematics with a minor in finance or computer science, and take bio and anatomy as your prerequisite sciences.    http://i.imgur.com/5cBiXcI.jpg  Rhys is 4 weeks old today! We also got asked to be the Holy family at our church's Christmas Eve service!   I use coconut oil on the flanges. I have the spray kind so it's really convenient.    Lmao yeah that's what it looks like.    For me, I needed more newborn onesies. I think we have about 15 or 16 and I do laundry every other day. I always  have about 3 in my diaper bag, and 3 in my husband's, that way there's no need to do much prep right before going out.    I made one myself with a cheap sports bra and a pair of scissors ;)   God yes, regarding constipation.   As an addendum: if you had to have antibiotics in the hospital, your stool softeners are 10 times as important. Your gut flora will be gone and your shits will be like bricks until you can build it up again. I'm 3 weeks PP and still crapping bricks. Started drinking kefir to get everything back on track.    Surprised to find 30 Rock this far down. I fall asleep to it every night and still find new jokes all the time.    My pediatrician said one week for supply to really diminish drastically    I'm also on the relactation road, though I never got a good start with my newborn and am trying 3 weeks down the road.   It's worth noting that dopimeridone (sp) is not available in the US for relactation purposes. Reglan is, but has worse side effects.   Good luck!   I do the same immune system justification when my newborn's pacifiers fall on the ground.  I pick any visible lint off of it and pop it right back in.     Happy and healing thoughts going out to you and Owen! Good luck little man!   I agree that the attitude of "if he doesn't smoke he will drink" is ridiculous. And all the excuses he uses are ridiculous. If he wants to smoke pot, that should be it. But if he's self medicating and can't go a day without it, that's not great.   My husband smokes, and he smokes every day.  He only smokes when he has his free time, even though he works from home. If his pot smoking got in the way of his responsibilities around the house, I would have a different opinion. But if he's pulling his weight, I'm fine with it.    I punched a couple holes in the drywall of my childhood house during arguments with my parents. I chalk it up to teenager hormones and unresolved mental illness. Much better now    My husband works from home and has a standing desk. He's 6'2, and he had baby laying on the desk with one hand around him. Baby rolls/wiggles off the desk at 2 weeks old and lands on his stomach. Cue husband hysterics. Took baby to doctor, got x Rays just in case, baby was fine. I've hit his head a few times, including on the infant carrier like you did. Babies are a lot more resilient than we think.    God yes, no soup has ever come close to that one.   That's basically what confirmation is in the church.    I smoked weed after getting pretty drunk on my 21st birthday. Results were not pretty. Basically what you described but with a lot more vomit.    My LO was born 10/15 and I'm still bleeding. I was told if I bleed through a pad in an hour or pass anything bigger than a softball to go in to the ER. Right now it's just like a light period but about a week ago I passed a huge clot and was still bleeding like a normal period. It's possible to bleed for 6-9 weeks PP. If you're concerned, call doctor on Monday. If you have insurance, there should be a Nurse's line you can call if you have questions   Wow, big for 35+6! Congrats, he's beautiful!   All of mine have been mentioned except Taylor Swift (don't judge) and Joni Mitchell.    God yes. I walked down the aisle to her cover of "can't help falling in love with you".    I strongly suggest you speak to your doctor about this.  It definitely sounds like PPD, and if it's affecting you this much there's no harm in getting help for it.  You're doing a great job.  You've been through a lot, but those "mistakes" you're beating yourself up about won't mean anything in the long run.  Your mental health, however, means a lot in the long run, you need to take care of yourself.     Congrats!  You're a superwoman for having to go through that, I have huge respect for all natural birthing women.  I sat through 90 minutes of real contractions before I screamed for the epidural, I couldn't do it.  You're a powerhouse!  She's precious, and I adore her name!   Yup, but you get an awesome button you can push to deliver more medicine. It's like a spine IV. You can get shots of different pain medicines but I found they really didn't help. I got stadol before my epidural and it just made me feel drunk. I still felt the contractions and the loopiness just pissed me off.    The same thing goes for anxiety! I had to get on low dose Prozac due to antenatal anxiety. If it's interfering with your everyday life, see a doctor. So glad you did!   Happy Valley is so good!  I second this recommendation.   Not OP but I won't take shrooms for mental health benefits outside of a clinical setting because I have panic disorder and I don't want a bad trip to send me into seemingly endless panic attacks. If I could take them in a hospital or overnight clinic under a psychiatrist's supervision I would be way more comfortable. I imagine someone with severe depression wouldn't want to risk possible outcomes of a bad trip either.    Are acrylic and solar nails the same? I get solar nails every 2 weeks. I pick at nail polish and bite my nails if I don't have these fake ones out on, so I look more put together.    Met in 7th grade English class. Dated in 9th grade, broke up, then stayed good friends afterwards. Messed around a bit in college with no strings attached. He started dating someone casually our junior year of college and I realized how much I really cared about him. Declared my love for him and he stopped seeing the girl and started dating me exclusively. Engaged 18 months later, then married 2.5 years after that (age 24). We just had our first child together 2 weeks ago. No regrets, I'm crazy about the guy.    He's had some pretty horrible blog posts in the past. Maybe his recent actions are trying to make up for those.    I feel you. I have an irrational hatred for him and his never changing outfit.    The baby is in a bassinet next to the bed. My husband can just sleep through literally anything! It's ridiculous.    I just take advantage of my long nails and tickle him until he wakes up enough to stop.  Unfortunately he usually has two silent breaths between then and when the snoring starts up again.  Thankfully since baby was born I've been able to sleep through it if I get a head start, but once he starts and I'm still awake there's no hope.   I'm resisting the urge to kick my husband right now. I got sleep in 15 min increments last night due to fussy baby. He slept like a rock for 6 hours. I lay down to take a nap and he follows me and passes out in 2 minutes with loud snoring. And now I'm about 20 min away from the next feeding so what's the point in napping now?   http://i.imgur.com/yUc7oM3.jpg  My little nugget is 2 weeks old today! So in love.    Dang! My labor was only 18 hours from water breaking to birth. Did you get an infection? I got chorio, that was no fun   You should see some of the children's names in Utah. Mormons have recently had an affinity for naming their kids really weird things, or using really odd spellings. I know a woman who named her daughter Nayvie.    Any chewing gum worked for me. Chewing gum tells your stomach to digest quicker because it fools it into "thinking" more food is incoming. Neat trick.    I go to Houston Adult Psychiatry and am very pleased with them.    Exactly my thought. But I think he equated medication with severe insanity and weakness.    Had an ex who got mad at me for going to therapy and being on antidepressants. All because he had an ex who was seriously insane who was on psychiatric medication (anti psychotics).    Though he is my least favorite RPDR judge, he was fucking hilarious on Project Runway.   I second the diaper champ. My husband and I refused any other kind because 90% of others use proprietary bags, which we didn't want to pay for. We empty it probably every 36 hours with a newborn but it holds the smell.    How tight is that tuck?!   Definitely poked it   Yup, the one I passed last week was about the size of a golf ball.  Didn't hurt or anything, but it was a really weird feeling and traumatizing to see.   Not /u/BiThrowAwayForReddit but my husband is bisexual and is in a heterosexual relationship with me.  Not sure if he would have abstained from homosexual relationships had we not gotten married, since he truly embraced his bisexual identity when we were engaged   I had never experienced these elusive period chunks/clots.  Then I gave birth.  The clots that pass after giving birth... holy shit.   The same thing is happening with our son, but I've found the one thing that helps him fall back asleep after nighttime feedings is swaddling him.  Maybe a pacifier if he will take one, but usually the swaddling is enough to keep him asleep.   evangelical Lutheran church of America. Ordains women and openly gay persons. The most accepting Lutheran denomination from my personal experience.    I decided to formula feed and have thankfully not experienced any prejudice so far. But I'm also not sharing my choice on social media. Basically only family knows and they are fine with it. My husband and I were both formula babies and we are just fine. My reasoning is largely centered around my mental health but even if I said "I just don't want to" there should be no discussion about it.   If anyone asked me I would just say "my baby, my breasts, my choice."    Yeah closest one I can think of is 290 at Mueschke but it's a tiny one.    I was going to say the Quran   Proud of you! 3   I just had my baby and I didn't qualify for FMLA because the company I work for is only 24 people (minimum to guarantee is 50).  I am taking 6 weeks off (in addition to 4 weeks of mandated bed rest), all I needed was a note from the doctor.  I didn't even have to bring anything in, I just gave my doctor the number to our HR person and they took care of everything.    Granted it differs from company to company, but I guess I lucked out with mine because I'll be going back after the mandated 6 weeks.  The leave is just considered non-FMLA   Also /r/CautiousBB for the super cautious soon-to-be mom!   It actually didn't bother me too much. He was super complimentary afterwards, saying I was a superstar and did an awesome job pushing him out. But I'm pretty darn proud of myself :)   I had my little man, Rhys Adam, on Wednesday, 10/15, at 37+3.    On 9/15 I had an appointment with my OB and my BP was 140/90.  I was sent to L D triage for monitoring and it was determined I just had a little gestational hypertension (no pre-e!).  So my doctor put me on modified bed rest and I was officially starting my maternity leave.  At my 36 week appointment, my doctor did a cervical check and said my cervix was thin but not dilated.  Two days previous I had lost my mucous plug, but I knew not to hold my breath.  At my 37 week appointment it was the same thing, thin cervix, still pretty high.  Tuesday I got what I now assume was the nesting bug.  I didn't furiously clean, I just straightened up, finished washing all the clothes, ran a couple of errands, but still stayed mostly seated/relaxed.  I hadn't been doing anything to get labor started.  No dates, no pineapple, no castor oil, nothing.  I decided it had been too long since getting busy with the husband so we got down to business.  I couldn't sleep, so I stayed up watching Netflix.  At about 1am I decided it was time to crawl into bed.  I lift one leg onto the bed and feel a trickle that was definitely NOT urine.  So I tell my husband, stand around for a little, and there was another small gush.  We pack up and head to the hospital because I didn't want to wait around with broken water.  We get to the hospital and I have to check in at the ER before they take me to L D triage.  As I was sitting filling out the check in form... GUSH.  Water broken, no doubt about it.  We get to L D triage and it's confirmed.  L D was pretty busy around that time so we hung out for a few hours until they got a room prepared for us.  We arrived at L D triage at 1:40am and got put in a room around 3:30am.  I wasn't having any contractions so they started pitocin.  My mom and MIL arrived at 5:40am.  Around 7am the contractions really started and I was dilated up to 3cm.  I asked for something for the pain and they gave me Stadol and Zofran. As the contractions ramped up, I realized the stadol was doing nothing for me.  I was squeezing DH's hand, and everything was incredibly annoying during the contractions.  They must have been about a minute apart.  At 8:30am I couldn't take any more.  I was at 4cm and I got my epidural.  Sweet relief.  The next 8 hours or so I just continued dilating, watching HGTV, and chatting with my family.  Around 4:30pm I noticed I was getting the shivers but I assumed it was from the epidural.  At 5pm it was confirmed I was at 10cm and it was time to start pushing, but I had started running a fever.  My nurse told me if i gets above 99.5 then I would have something called Chorioamnionitis.  Basically since my water had been broken so long and I'd had a few cervical checks, I started getting an infection.  Not much later my fever bypassed that.  They started me on some antibiotics while I started pushing.  Doctor checked me at 10cm and made a comment about how narrow my pelvis was, commenting about my pubic bone and the position.  He said we'll probably have to do a c-section but we can start pushing.  Pushing wasn't too bad honestly. I had great coaches in my husband and the awesome L D nurse I had. I just felt like a softball was passing painlessly through my vagina.  At 6pm the doctor came back in with the delivery team and everyone started preparing for little man's arrival.  At 6:17pm he was born.  6lb 11.5oz, 19.75 inches.  He had a fever from the chorio, but otherwise he was perfect.    I had an episiotomy and 2nd degree tear.  I'm so in love with this little guy that everything I went through was so worth it.  Because of the chorio, he had to stay 48 hours in the NICU.  His blood cultures were monitored and once both of us were pumped full of antibiotics and determined to be infection free, we got to go home Friday night!  His bilirubin levels were a little high so we had to go back in for a test on Saturday morning.  He barely passed, but we decided to do 24 hours of phototherapy anyways because he wasn't eating as much as he needed to in order to get rid of the jaundice.  He came home for good yesterday morning at 10am and it's been wonderful ever since!

The tax hike and elimination of insurance premiums would result in less money out of pocket for the average American.    Congrats, mama! Love the name ;)   How exciting! Come on baby!!!   I had a baby Wednesday evening. That's when it hit me. I'm responsible for another human life.    :)   Yes it's like Reese. Old Welsh name.       Baptism in a few months ;) he's got all his fingers and toes thankfully! They must have just missed one.    http://i.imgur.com/CpmGytI.png  Rhys Adam was born at 6:17pm and is perfect. Thank you for your thoughts and prayers!   Boy!    Absolutely! Baby will be getting hepatitis shot in hospital and will be receiving all necessary vaccines    Didn't get to nipple stimulation, but I did have sex about 3 hours before water broke. Epidural are the shit, contractions are hell. I have such respect now for moms who do it all natural. Now that the epidural is in I'm napping and just chilling.    Contractions hadn't started and we were just waiting around. Epidural in now. Just chilling again!    Of course! Just got epidural. As soon as it broke I went in to the hospital. Been under doctor supervision the entire pregnancy. Everything looks good so far!   I'm 37 weeks so not a big deal, I'm just super nervous and having typical pregnant lady anxieties. Will I be a good mother? All that jazz.    Was climbing into bed when I felt an uncontrollable trickle. Kept trickling so I went to the hospital and in the ER waiting area... GUSH. Only 1cm and 70% effaced but baby Rhys wants OUT. I guess I'll be here quite a while before he comes out.   Wish me luck! I'm freaking out!!   Two cats: Walter and Evelyn. Walter after Dr Walter Bishop from fringe because he was a peculiar kitten. Evelyn because my husband's name is Adam. Adam and Eve. Eve is short for Evelyn. We never call her Eve though. But the name cracks people up because they're just such human names.    If it gets to the point where it's interfering with your day to day life, you need to tell your doctor about it (whether it be your GP or OB).  Occasional anxiety is normal, but when it's every day and gets in the way of your life, it needs more attention.  Some medications are safe during pregnancy and breast feeding and your mental health is of utmost importance right now and after you deliver baby.   He's precious! Congratulations!  Make a new post and get some karma ;)   Yes.  I had a history of anxiety and depression beforehand, and I weaned off my meds in month 2.  Month 6 rolls around and BAM, anxiety is back worse than ever.  I'm now on low dose Prozac to help.  But anxiety during pregnancy is common, even for those people who haven't experienced it before.  Just take deep breaths and breathe for as long as it takes to pass.  Don't take your pulse during this time, it just causes a negative feedback loop.  That is, you feel your pulse, you feel it's fast, and you panic because it's fast, causing it to go faster.  I have to take my BP twice daily due to gestational hypertension, and honestly my pulse is anywhere between 90 and 115.  Doctor said this is fine, as your heart rate during pregnancy is going to increase due to more blood in your body.  Just deep breaths, everything will be fine.  If you do realize something is triggering them, just tell yourself "panicking will do nothing to help the situation."  Stay away from Dr. Google.   Nope, everyone I've talked to (OB, OB nurses, midwives, and mothers who tried it) said it's a waste of money.  Eat dates, have sex, and do nipple stimulation.  Those are the only things that have been shown to have some effect on labor.   I'm more hormonal and emotional.  I've gained significant weight.  We've been approved for a rental house.  Baby coming soon (like, 3 weeks soon), big life change.  Let me just say, pregnancy sucks.  For most women it is not the beautiful miracle of creating life, it's disgusting, emotionally draining, and exhausting.  I don't think I'll be doing this again.   Don't have a specific place in mind but it would be chicken nuggets topped with mashed potatoes and white fluffy dinner rolls with a donut for dessert on the side.  It would be called "white and bland."     I'm due a day after you and omg yes.  Come on, babies.  No shame in being line jumpers!  The only reason I *don't* want to go into labor now is because I'm super tired after nesting all day.   Whaaat?  I'm 37 weeks and lost my plug two days ago.  No sign of anything since.  Tell her it doesn't mean anything and that it's gross.   Talk about terrifying!  So glad everything worked out for the best, though! Hope you can take your precious bundle home as soon as possible :)   Thanks :) I'm still a little hesitant because it's not used much in the US but I always get positive reactions. Come on baby Rhys!  	117
  it took a lot of guys for her to say that  This is quite the typo, given the context :D   I don't find it unbelievable that he's enlightened or completely accepting of his friend, and I'm glad that he is. What I find hard to believe is what you claim he actually said. As if his enlightenment is such that he wouldn't understand that the 'problem' his friend wanted to discuss was that he was coming out. It sounds like something from some cheesy teenage drama.   [Source](http://www.xvideos.com/video1517509/alexis_texas_analm28)      Look, I'm really glad that your son doesn't see homosexuality as an issue, I genuinely am. But please, don't try and feed us the absolute absurdity that he's *so* enlightened and blase about it, that when his friend came out to him, he didn't even register that it was the 'problem' his friend wanted to talk about. Next time, maybe try something like:  My son's response was "Ok. Is this what you meant when you said you had a problem you wanted to talk about? Don't worry mate, we're best friends, I don't care about stuff like that."  Much more believable, and less likely to get people linking you to /r/thatHappened    I recommend Jedi   Issit?

I love fabric like that, where you can really feel the body underneath the dress, is that silk?   This may be a picture for the heels, but I cannot stop staring at that arse.   Sorry, I made that sound as if anyone who likes it is 'wrong', which wasn't my intention. What I mean is that I'm convinced that there are lots of people who'll go along with anything that sounds remotely profound such as some of the quotes that go with these pictures, just because they think they should, or because it makes them look really deep, not because they actually believe it or understand it.                                 [This is the complete picture](http://i.imgur.com/Y8JbgFv.jpg)   :)   I'm with you, I really don't get the love for this kind of thing. Personally, I think there's an air of The Emperor's New Clothes about it all. No one wants to be the person to stand up and say 'Actually, I think this is ridiculous', for fear of the reaction they'd get.   It could just be the old cynic in me, but please tell me I'm not the only one who enjoys these pictures from a photographic viewpoint, but finds the quotes that follow just absolute pretentious nonsense. Is this what these people are actually meant to have said at the time? Or were they allowed to go away and think about something and send it in? I only ask because I have never met anyone who speaks even remotely like almost all of these people, and reading them makes me grateful that that's the case!  EDIT: Changed wording   I think you could be right! :) Even if you aren't, that woman's fucking gorgeous as well :D   I love how the dark lines compartmentalise her body parts perfectly :)   Yes I do post a lot and I'll continue to do so. All I'm doing is trying to contribute fresh content to the subs that I'm part of, I don't see how it matters who the posts are made by. But as I said, I will take more time in describing the pictures accurately, I can understand the frustrations it causes.   Perfect fit :)   Fuck she's beautiful, who is she?   Yeah they've gone a bit OTT with it, especially in the face :/   Yeah this is Jasmine James, apparently. I didn't know but someone IDed for her me :)   Brilliant picture!    She's done a couple of videos with Leeanne Crow on ddf. She is so fucking sexy   Thanks :-)   Holy shit thanks for the ID and album link she's incredible!    Thank you good sir, you've just cleared up a massive amount of confusion for me and my friends! We were on our way to Kensington, and the District line was packed with people in costumes and we couldn't for the life of us figure out why!                                                   As do I! My pins would look dynamite in it!   I really wish you could edit titles here :(   Thank you for the consultation, kind internet stranger. While you're here, do you think you could have a look at my balls? I seem to have developed a rather nasty rash. I've sent you a picture as a PM. I await your diagnosis with a hopeful heart!   Agreed. I was too hasty in posting and only glanced at them. But thank you for not being a dick when correcting me, that happens very rarely on here.   Love that skirt - very sexy.   Wow! Thank you for that :)   I did not receive the luxury of such an education, raised as I was by wolves in a forest untouched by human hands and unseen by human eyes.      There's a picture from the same set on another sub, and her face looks awful in that one as well. She's got such a beautiful face, naturally, she doesn't need layers of make up! :(      Yeah she's very much like Denise Milani in that respect.                                 I absolutely love how dresses like this make women's arses look so fucking big and juicy! I want a bite! :D   Is there a video of this?    I gladly volunteer to test this theory out!   I love that she's doing more and more hardcore stuff now.   I'm getting a forbidden access screen.      As soon as I saw my mistake I was thinking 'Shiiiiiiiiiiit people are going to think she posts here now!!'.  My apologies :(                                       This picture seems to get posted in a constant cycle between here, /r/legs, and /r/highheels :)  This is not a complaint - it's a great picture :)   I wish I knew, she's absolutely stunning!   Hmmm, not sure why. Just checked it myself and it's working for me.   I mean /r/WendyFiore, sorry!   I mean /r/WendyFiore, sorry!   I mean /r/WendyFiore, sorry!   I mean /r/WendyFiore, sorry!   I mean /r/WendyFiore, sorry!   Does this count as a sweater? If not, please remove mods, but dammit I had to let people see this gif.                        Apologies for the dreadful picture quality :(            I can't stop imagining her slowly unzipping that dress, unleashing the cannons that lay beneath! Mercy!   Thanks for the ID :)   Georgia Salpa I think   Source unknown sorry. Random pic!   /r/seethru would probably enjoy this, if you haven't posted it there already.    Insta-boner   I can't believe a film called Mr Grumpypants has a line like that in it! Disney are getting pretty heavy these days.   HEID! PANTS! NOW!                  This is a great picture of her rack, but I can't believe what her make up artist has done to her naturally pretty face!            	183
 Just take care of yourself, and remember this next time you see someone else who seems down. Even just a smile can pull someone out of the gutter; you can make a huge difference to someone just by doing something little :]    Hi. Please come over and visit us at /r/suicidewatch if you feel these thoughts are getting more persistent. We're here to support you :]   You are not weak. You are strong. You are fighting this. You've thought about suicide, and you've rejected it. You are brave, and you will beat this. You have to want to pull yourself out of this, you have to start thinking up. Start smiling, even if you aren't happy (you'll trick your brain into releasing happy hormones :D) YOU ARE WORTHY! You are human, and you were born here. You've got just as much of a right to life and happiness as everyone else. You are a strong human being. you are worth it    Hi. You are a teenager; by definition you are going to make mistakes. Right now, things seem pretty terrible. It sucks. You feel worthless and shitty, and like nothing is worth it.   But it is. Because your life hasn't even begun yet :] you have to keep trudging on, keep pushing yourself a little bit every day. Make it a goal to accept your mistakes and learn from them. In a little while you'll find the strength to do things you didn't realize you were capable of; maybe even ask out that girl. And I bet you'll be even more super careful now  driving after you made that mistake; that extra caution may end up saving your life one day. Then you might actually be thankful o For cracking that bumper (kinda ridiculous how life works that way, huh?)  So keep that in mind every time you feel sucky, or down. Being a teenager is basically having depression, anxiety, and a bit of OCD all wrapped up in one several-year long party; feeling horrible is going to happen. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Just don't wait for it to come to you, now is the time to start working for it. You can get past this :]   Have you continued seeing a therapist since then? Perhaps it might be good to go talk to one, but specify you're looking to deal with the underlying issues and root of the problem, as opposed to copping mechanisms. Don't afraid to be picky if you need to find a new one; keep hunting around until you find someone easy to open up to.   	4
 typically, deserts are ~30 degrees from the equator and rain forests at 0.   Oh, interesting. I didn't know that. Thanks!   yup! And endangered species are removed from the endangered species list because those interfere with the pipeline   That is a very fair argument, climate is the long term pattern of weather and meteorologists rely on those patterns and should be able to communicate their findings amongst other scientific communities.   I find article interesting because the "gag-order" also involves federal employees such as university professors whose research gets funded by the government as well as those climate change scientists who are employed by the federal government.               Just raise the corners of your mouth with a middle finger  	9
 I've struggled labelling my sexuality for a while now but I still feel very attached to the LGBT+ identifier. I know that some people choose not to have a label (and that's awesome) but I love words and I love having a feeling of identity- and LGBT+ subreddits have really helped.  I just wanted to say that while I'm fairly new to reddit, I love all sexualities and genders and I think that the community here on reddit is amazing.  Much love to everyone and support in their struggles (as sometimes there are mean people). I love all you guys so much for inspiring to feel better about my "no-label" situation.  SUMMARY: I really appreciate having a community to make me feel less anyone and I just think that whatever you are (straight, gay, lesbian, pan, bi, trans, agender, bigender - and all the other ones that I can't remember or don't know about yet) you are awesome. 3 (I'll stop gushing now)  	1
 You can try AgNo3 sticks for treatment, it may work.   I need subtitles. Are there anyway to get videos with subtitles I've chosen?  	2
 Ah! That's the little dude in my gallery keeper :) That would definitely be something to add, thank you!   So the post about collections got me thinking... I don't have tons of neopoints, but they are just sitting there. There's nothing I'm saving up for. I'm just trying to make that number bigger, and that's not interesting. So after looking around, I decided to collect eyeball and eyeball-related eye-tems (hurhurhur i'm so funny)  Here's what I have so far!! http://www.neopets.com/gallery/?gu=elventhevamp :)  There are some items that I would like that I could not find though. Either they were nowhere to be found, or there was no price on the Trading Post, so I had no idea how much they are worth. Like I said, I don't have tons of money, so I'm really hoping to get them for under a certain amount each, but at the same time, I don't want to pay way less than the item's actually worth. So basically, if you have the item and want to sell it, just let me know your price and I will decide if I can afford it right now or not. If you don't have any of them/don't want to sell, but know about how much it's worth, that would be helpful, too. Here are the items:  * Jelly Spider Eyeball * ~~Eye Candy Plushie~~ * ~~Chocolate Coated Eye~~ * Chilled Eyes with Clam Sauce * Pink Spooky Ice Cream * Holiday Eye Candy  Also, if you know of any other eyeball or eyeball-themed things, let me know! I checked Jellyneo's item database but I could have missed things that never actually say eye or eyeball anywhere :) And I know I'm missing Spaghetti  Eyeballs. I already made an offer on one on the trading post.  Thank you for your help!!   This makes me think I should collect something. Mostly I collect neopoints right now.   When you first realized it, how did you feel? How do you feel about it now? How do you feel in general? Did you sleep well last night? Any interesting dreams? What brand of toothpaste do you use?   Ever since my last (and only) serious boyfriend dumped me almost two years ago, I've had a feeling that I was going to die alone. It's not one of those dramatic thoughts like, oh god I was dumped now no one will ever love me, sort of things. Just a quiet realization. I'm going to die alone.  My history with romance is pretty shitty. The first guy I ever had a crush on admitted to me that he liked me... He just liked my friend better. The first boy I dated dumped me after three weeks, in public, in such a nonchalant way I can only guess he was never actually attached to me. I dated a girl the next year; she dumped me after four days because she decided she wasn't bisexual after all. I caught her making out with our mutual female friend a week later.  I lost my virginity to a guy who was horny and I was convenient. He got off and kicked me out. I started having sex with a guy who said I was attractive, but he wasn't interested in a relationship with me six months later, just because I was sad and lonely and would take any attention I could get.  After he got sick of me, I avoided romance for a while. I went on a date or two with guys I met on plentyoffish when I was feeling particularly lonely, but it never went past one date. Then I met a guy and started dating him. I moved in with him fairly quickly, which was a huge mistake.  After a year long, turbulent, emotionally (sometimes physically) abusive relationship, he finally dumped me after I tried to kill myself, because he decided that if I was trying to kill myself, then he must not be making me happy.  My most recent foray into romance is one that is still hurting right now. Basically, about six months ago, I fell for a guy who lives overseas; he claimed to like me too, but couldn't do a relationship, let alone a long distance one (whereas, at this point in my life, I would prefer one; physical contact makes me ill). Then a few days ago, I find out he's dating a girl (I know her as well; we all met in the same place, but they happened to live very close to each other) and is hiding it from me. I'm still trying to get over it. It's like, I know I didn't have a chance with him, but I didn't think anyone else did either. That made it okay somehow.  It's not just that, either. I get a lot of crushes on people (little, fleeting ones; nothing like how I felt about him) that quickly get stomped into the dirt. Sometimes I feel like emotions aren't even worth it.  I feel worthless in general. I've got no talents, I can't keep interest in one thing long enough to develop a talent, either. I can't hold down a job because I have panic attacks about going to work. I can't meet people because I have crippling social anxiety. I'm a burden on my mother, I don't qualify for any sort of disability (I'm trying now, but it's not looking good), I have no income. I'm useless. I can't take any classes at college because I'm too easily overwhelmed.  I don't want to be alive anymore. I don't want to commit suicide. I just want to die in my sleep. I want to stop existing. I'm so tired of being so sad all the time. What is the point of me? Nothing.  I'm fat. I can't diet because I have no will power. I'm ugly. I can't take care of myself. Doing anything beyond sitting here and feeling sorry for myself gives me crippling panic attacks. I'm boring. I don't know how to talk to people. Even my dog doesn't want to be around me these days. I'm angry all the time, or depressed. No wonder no one likes me.  I absolutely loathe my brain. It's trying to kill me, it's trying to destroy me. It wants me to feel this way. I want to know what it's like to be able to function. Not even be happy; just FUNCTION. I can't even do that, though.  No wonder I'm going to die alone.  I don't even know why I'm posting this. I don't know what I want to hear. I guess I just want to tell someone, and there's no one in my life I could say this stuff to. I feel like a burden, an annoyance, someone who doesn't really matter. I'm scared to sleep because I know if I lay down in bed, I'm just going to think awful thoughts and make myself feel worse than I already do.   It's less funny when the sticker has obviously been moved.   This works for me most of the time, but then sometimes, when it lands on the side I hoped it would, I realize I actually wish it had landed on the other. Then I continue flip-flopping. I'm so indecisive.   Even better, my aunt would make me edible play dough that i would slowly consume while playing with it. When I got my first chance to play with actual Play-Doh, I tried to do the same. Not a good idea.   The graphics in 3 are beautiful, I went back and played 1 after finishing 3, and I was blown away. I remember thinking 1 had great graphics.  The game play is great, too, but you can tell when they just wanted to show off ;)   Is her top being torn from that guy grabbing her?   That might have something to do with it.   I would experience vivid hallucinations while on Ambien, and sometimes I would take it specifically for them. But you are right, I would end up forgetting 90% of what happened after, and I did do some stupid, stupid things on it. I've never experimented with a proper hallucinogen, though. Honestly, when I first read the title, I thought it was asking about hallucinations in general, but after I got the first comment, I realized what it actually said. Figured it wasn't so off topic that I should delete the comment, though.   This happens for me when I would take a low dose, slight hallucinations, but nothing big. Those were more enjoyable than the monsters clawing at my bed.   It's really common to hallucinate on Ambien. My doctor recommended taking half a pill instead, and keeping my eyes closed until I'm asleep, which worked better.   Leg warmers, mostly for sewing practice :) Too ugly to wear IMO   I can imagine it wouldn't smell that great, but I can imagine some far worse smelling jobs.   I'm working on my self-confidence right now, and what I've been doing is challenging my negative thoughts. It's helping, slowly but surely. Try to think of reasonable explanations for why the thought isn't true, or in some cases, how you can fix it.   It is probably a confidence issue. If you were more confident, you might not doubt her feelings for you, or be afraid of getting rejected.    What makes this the worst smelling job?    Give her some good scritches for me :) She's a pretty dog.   It also makes it look like you have other, more important things than talking to her. Just text her when you want to.   Thanks for answering them. :D   The opposite is "I embarrassed myself in front of a girl and she didn't hate me after".   How long were you awake before you went to sleep? When will you get another chance to sleep? How long will you sleep then? What class are you going to? Do you like the subject? Do you like your teacher? Are there are lot of other students in the class? If you could have any animal as a pet, what would you pick?   When I was younger, I was prescribed Ambien for sleep. I also lived with  my mom at the time.  So the first night after I get it, I take one. I lay down to go to sleep, and wait for the medicine to start to work. I never really started to feel tired, but I started seeing things move. It gets worse and worse. The shadows turn into monsters, and they start crawling towards me. I could feel them grabbing my blanket and pulling it off me. I started screaming, and I actually grabbed my cell phone to call my mom (who was in the other bedroom) instead of doing something like turn on the lights. Instead of answering, though, she just bursts into my room angrily and yells "What are you doing calling me?!" as she turns on the light.  I told her about the monsters, which were gone now that the light was gone, and she made me sleep next to her that night. I laid awake most of the night and stared at her ceiling, which was covered in circus people urging me to turn the light on because they had a show for me.  That was a weird night.   That fur looks so soft, I want to run my hands through it.   You could go with a friend and make them say it.      I would be worried if I saw a vagina that looked like that.   http://www.olsenhome.com/gif/   A root beer float in the summer, and hot cocoa loaded with homemade marshmallows in the winter.   I think I just stared at this for five minutes. I don't think I've ever stared at chicken wire that long before.   That I will probably never be someone really amazing or world-changing, or famous for anything. That I am part of the average. I might be slightly better at some things than others, but I'm never going to be amazing enough to be anything other than average.   Agreed. I hate the fact that I have to struggle and take medicine and therapy and really think about what I'm doing just stay somewhat in a normal range of emotion, and if I slack off for one day, everything can go wrong.  	34
 No worries though, I called no homo a few months ago.   I think the rule is its only gay if you finish.   Balance because tears.   They are usually evenly matched. My fiance and I only play duel decks or draft together; we love them. But, if you are looking to pull them apart for the cards you are better off just buying the singles. It really depends on if you want to play with others, or just with the girlfriend. If you want to play with others hit up your local game store see what they play!  	4
 i didnt think it was   im going in a group of three and really want to meet new people, i am going all three days  EDIT: if someone wants to make a thread or a page for us to talk/plan meetups that would be awesome!   oh shoot! is that a rule here?      I will thank you,    what price?   no problem! I got a few offers around my area   thanks for the advice!   Serbia Film is the most disturbing one ive seen   i vomited after watching it, and im not easily disturbed   damn, im from michigan so its a little difficult. should i look for someone in my state to get it from? im only r/concerttickets is that any more reliable than craigslist?   invisible monsters is beautiful   they made us read this in my 8th grade class, terribly morbid for 13 year olds   i live a good 4 or 5 hours away, what is the best method of getting the tickets through craigslist    Thank you, I will check it out, is it reliable?    (reasonably priced, ill really take any offer)   thats good enough for me. thank you,   complications happened and i no longer have mine. help would be appreciated   I'm from Michigan! You couldnt mail it to someone? especially someone as close as michigan? i'm in dire need of a wristband   i watched. i cried. i vomited. but... i conquered.    wow, i totally get this. i always seem to make dumb decision that are really influenced by my anxiety   i am also 15 and lurk on this subreddit! i've been seeing a therapist for anxiety for over a year. PM me we can talk!      am i too late? id like to buy    Dust?    no problem! its been about 24 hours since i smoked and ive just been sleeping and lying in bed all day. I asked the guy i smoked with how he was doing and he said it was amazing for him. He smokes a ton everyday so i feel i cant really compare myself to him. It might be fair to mention that i took my anti-anxiety/depression pill right after i smoked because i have to take it at night. i take lexapro, just info if anyone knows if this contributes   thanks! you might has misunderstood as i have smoked alot before. i started in january and really usually just sit on the computer or talk to my friends when i'm high. I never really know what strain i'm smoking because where i live it doesnt really matter. that's what concerns me the most, is WHAT i was smoking seeing as it wasnt like the other times.   my friends we sober, they hadnt smoked anything. It is bad if it was laced?   so im a fairly new smoker and have never really gotten to high when i smoked with friends. Last night i smoked out of a gravity bong with some guys and then went home with my 2 best friends. almost immediately i knew something was weird throughout the night i would start sobbing uncontrollably, shaking and being unresponsive to my friends. they said everything i said made absolutely no sense at all. When i woke up this morning i remembered very little from last night. can anyone explain to me what happened?   two of my friends are over but i just want to end it. I cant think or breathe. i need help  EDIT: thank you for the messages, i woke up this morning and cannot remember much from last night except for shaking and crying, i just logged on to see your messages on a post i dont remember making.i just wanted to say thanks   god, my friends love die antwoord, they listen to them all the time, i think its horrible and creepy!!   Great game! those damn crows are freaky   it's just giving me a lot of anxiety   i wouldnt deny it. im gald i did because it made me 100% sure of my sexuality but people can be mean   3333   i dont want the reputation its going to give me   oh god youre so right how can i ever make up for my tomfoolery?    you can suck my dick for starters   im not a lesbian.    Me and my friend's realtionship is fine, but im worried my mother will find out, (she works closely with the summer program that all my school kids are in)   the girl who is telling everyone is doing it specifically to hurt me. how do i deal with her?   sorry i wasnt asking the opinion of an immature nerdy dweeb    way to be an asshole you self righteous prick xx   So here's the story, my best friend and i are both quirky strange people who are really affectionate to eachother. we hold hands in the hallway and hug; though we both know that its purely platonic. We're both girls. One night while she was staying the night we were both really horny and decided to make out. After we were done we both laughed it off and said it sucked, and everything was back to normal with us. We're both straight. BUT someone found out and told everyone that we made out, everyone knows and i dont know what to do about it. I'm more embarassed than upset but i dont want to be labeled "that girl" any advice on what to do?  TLDR: i made out with my best friend of the same gender. there are no awkward feelings towards eachother. everyone knows now. what do we do now?      youre from Michigan!?! so am i!   i was really rooting for Hitler there   ICONA POP   thats really lovely :)  	49
 That's a good philosophy to have, I'm gonna borrow that. You sound like quite the interesting preschool teacher :)   I just started a new job as a technician at a medical facility and a couple supervisors have made false assumptions about me being straight. For example, I was complaining about having to move out of my apartment and my supervisor said, "What you need to do is go out and find yourself a nice boyfriend to take care of those things, hurr hurr!". Being that he's my supervisor, I was unsure of whether to correct him that I'm in fact a strong lesbian who don't need no man. I am out to one coworkers who I know is friends with many LGBT people, but otherwise no one knows. I wondered if my fellow Raptors are out at work, especially when the topic of dating pops up?   Is it weird that I didn't know kinky hair could be grown any where but on the head? I've never seen nappy eyebrows or leg hair, I wonder if that exists?   I tried it and it worked wonderfully. Focus on the mons, not the inner labia and definitely not near the vaginal opening. There's also Skin Tight and Witch Hazel that are very good as well.   I wondered the same thing with that trans kid who stepped out in front of a truck. Why scar someone else for life? I don't think people with suicidal depression give a whole lot of critical thought to their actions.    Thanks!    But what do ladies "feel like" in comparison to men?   I'll give a definition slightly different than the one above. It's been explained to me as one's "internal sense" of being a male or female, sometimes neither (genderqueer) or both. A sense of gender identity is more defined in some people. For example, I don't feel like I have one, the concept doesn't make a ton of sense to me either.

I'm hoping to not wait for squat racks and such.  Also I'm kind of new, are people in the gyms generally cool and not douchebags?  Thanks!

Out of all the sociology classes I've taken I've never heard the term ethnic used this way.   You can be black and Latino/a. One is a race the other is an ethnicity.

After about 4 months of disappointment with online dating, I've been chatting with a girl I think is very cute and stylish and has similar interests: science, books, and fashion. We're planning on meeting this week in person for the first time but I'm seriously nervous. I've never met someone from online before, what are some dos and donts for having a successful meetup?   I know this is totally unrealistic but sometimes I imagine I have enough money to buy a small island and move there, to get away from all the b.s.

But we don't look at modern Hispanics as evil slave-owners.  There's a fair amount of animosity for Spaniards and Brazilians for their role in the slave trade. From an academic and social stand point I don't think it's overlooked at all. As far as Jews go, undereducated people lump Jews in with whites.   Also, the form of slavery that occurred in the U.S. is unlike any other form of slavery in human history. Prior to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, slaves were of all races. The U.S. slave trade was unique because it focused solely on Black Africans (with a minority of other groups) as this was their "natural place" and then even after gaining freedom instituted share-cropping, Jim Crow etc etc. The social aspect is entirely unique.   I'm not saying you're wrong but in a number of my genetics classes my professors have said there more genetic similarity between randomly chosen black and white people than between two black people who you think would share similarity.    I feel like this is more of a straight woman thing. Most of the lesbians I know are bros and stick together.   There should be better alternatives to periods and giving birth by now.   I've considered public health as a possible career choice, I'd like to know what you do on a day to day basis? What are the most interesting aspects of the job?   How did you get into your field? I'm interested!   Wanna come to Iowa? I'm right below ya;)   Currently on repeat!   I don't think it's racist but kind of cringey for making fun of inner city kids.    I used to think I was bi up until my freshman year of high school, but that changed during a sleepover with several of my best friends. You know how late at night with friends you tend to talk about your sexual experiences thus far and get a little more daring? My friends mentioned how excited they got kissing boys,  and enjoyed feeling their muscles and erections.   I wasn't as experienced as my friends, mostly made out here and there, and some dry humping. I had only seen one penis in real life. I compared my experience to theirs and wondered why I didn't feel the crazy attraction and excitement that they did. And what the hell was wet (I was a sheltered child!). I mostly felt nothing or mildly grossed out.   That changed when my best friend and I decided to sneak off and watch porn after everyone else fell asleep. It featured a pretty red-head and a brunette kissing and tribbing each other. 1 minute into the porn and my clit throbbed and I was more interested in sex than I'd ever been. I guess the film made my friend feel a little adventurous because she leaned over and gave me a peck on the lips. I'd thought I had a "girl-crush" on her before, but this confirmed real feelings. My head rushed and I could feel my heart pumping in my chest. So this is attraction, finally! Even though she ultimately ended up being straight, and I gay, it was my first time  feeling a strong emotional and physical attraction to someone. I realized I wasn't broken, I liked women. And cue, long emotional coming out process.   Things don't always play out the way they did here. I complained to my supervisor about one of my fellow black employees calling me the N-word constantly during this. Nigga this, nigga that. At first my supervisor thought I was joking but I told him it offended me and it's not ok just because it's coming from another POC. Long story short, he got in trouble for using racial slurs but was pissed at me for snitching and didn't see why I was mad. I'm glad my old employer had an anti-slur policy, doesn't matter who says it.   *Drops mic*   Ah I see, I have no idea of the logistics behind that. Interesting point. I know many hospitals hire PAs and ARNPs because they're cheaper for them in the long run. Should be for the patient also.    Ch-ch-ch-chia!   One day shipping!   Can I ask what's wrong with PAs or med students? They are working under the supervision of an MD or DO, whatever diagnosis they come to will be checked over. Plus, most primary care illnesses don't need an MD for treatment.   Do the tryptophan supplements make you tired at all?   Probably. I remember one news headline being about a giant chicken egg. There's not much to report on.   Another Ames resident checking in!!   I'm 23 with 66 year old parents. I keep thinking I should hurry up and breed so they'll get to see their grandkids. I wish my mom would stop smoking so she could extend her lifespan and chances of seeing them.   Maybe it's Mein Kampf   Well there's about 210,000 miles on her, time to trade up.   Besides the emotional turmoil, the arrangements seem endless. Social security, bills, arranging the estate. I have no clue how I'm going to do it alone.   Hugs internet bro XX   I'm in the same boat. It's tough to accept but I'm gradually getting there. I was jealous of my friends who came from teen parents because they get more time with them.   Cell phone missing? Cue panic attack and pocket taps.   Double check pockets for id, phone, and keys. If missing, cue heart attack   How cold it is, and which football team is doing better.   Friends and weed   There's always that asshole who eats Lays or an apple in a quiet room.   Left-handed, gay, scientist, minority. I'd like to see the probability of that.   I used to work the last shift in a plasma center. Around 20 minutes before close we'd begin closing down stations to go home for the night. This involved bleaching down everything and putting away equipment. There is always that one person who'd come in 2 minutes before close so I'd have to reopen the booth and bring everything back out, then rebleach once done. Fuck you person, you could come earlier.   Eating in public. I always worried have ketchup smeared on my face or people are judging what's on my plate.   I call it "Ninja shit" mode   Did your heart race answering this post?   I feel bad walking past people in wheelchairs. *I need to get past you, please don't think badly of me!*   Walking down the street when a bus full of people goes by makes me feel so self-conscious. My walk and face get weird as hell.   L.A.?   President. I know it's unreasonable but I think you'd appreciate how difficult it is to create a stable and satisfied country.   The opposite of naughty Korea   I'd honestly pretend to be a man (I'm a woman) and see what life as the opposite sex would be like.   My solutions to your problems:  -park in the back. No door dings that way.  -Go at night.  -Amazon reviews for deals and reviews  -Ask the friendliest associate you can find  -Don't go to Walmart  -Say hey, on second thought you can help me with something!  -Wear headphones, no small talk   -Sleep on any major purchases.  Fellow anxious person here, hope it helps   Wal-mart employees in a nutshell.   Cottage cheese, shredded cheddar cheese and ham or bacon bits. Made it up as a kid and have been eating it ever since.   Sounds delicious. I always add fries to my burger.   Companionship in moderation. Take time for yourself to reflect and recharge.   Sounds like a hood name   I'd go with Incus for a boy.    She love my dick, call that nigga Richard.   Any post that seems like it might remotely involved race, I steer clear of because I know it'll be a shit show.   I screwed around too much my freshman year of college and now am going into debt to retake those courses and improve my gpa. Even with all this I don't know if I'll be able to get into PA school.   Do it right the first time, seriously.   You could make the Jimmy John's a little more healthy by ordering the "unwich" instead of the normal sub. Less calories and carbs. Or less fast food might help with better help and more money.   Is there any way your credits could be rolled over to another program? I used my biology credits to change to bioinformatics, didn't waste too much time.   Shame   Comes with Donkey   Bad breath   Grandfather by 42   SLAP!!!!

 This is the most profound movie question I have ever been posed with. I think all villains are color blind.   Good luck with that. As I mentioned, it's hard for me to do these "imaginary" things. But my therapist gave me a hint. She wants me to be aware of the "should," "have," "must," "always," "never," etc. That's easier.   Yes, keeping at it. Thanks for the support. :) Apart from antidepressants/antianxiety meds, I'm on mood stabilizers and low doses of antipsychotics. Just reading what I wrote seems a little too much.   I think this is where CBT kicks in.   Yes, it does make sense. I have had feedback, especially from my boyfriend about the same. But to get one level up above the subconscious and to have a voice tell "You are wrong, I'm not a bad person. Stop criticizing me so much!" is a little too much for me at the moment.   All the best, then. :)   It's sometimes hard for me to do imaginary tasks - e.g., the containment task in mindfulness is not easy for me. :)   I got a hard on just from feeling his passion about movie reviewing.   My therapist asked me to try and be an imaginary observer about how critical I'm about myself. She thinks that even if you can't stop being hyper-self-critical, being aware of it helps.  (PS: Is your name a Mick Foley reference?)    Thanks. But does it help?   Not feeling negative could be considered as better.   I think I honestly enjoy my hobbies, but, like you, they may just be escapes. Who knows?  	12
 Becky gets disqualified for not following the fucking rules.   Might I suggest she start using pencil.   Yeah. The miracle of life is just hideous.   I don't know why bartering ever went out of style.  	4
 Seems legit.       Same here, picking/biting though.    I'm hungover and unable to detect sarcasm through reddit. Eh, I've found myself in solid rock a few times and like I said, I've been in firewater. My music taste is everything from heavy metal to 80s pop. So that's not exactly an issue.. ha..    I don't tend to venture into Sauchiehall street too much, been to firewater a few times but other than that I haven't been to the other clubs; I just know of them. The only thing that seems to be appealing to most people about campus is the prices.   Might check out Victorias and the other you mentioned. Thanks!    The first and most appropriate use for that emoji   Haha I can safely say I, nor my friend have ever stolen a traffic cone.    Friend and I are contemplating campus tomorrow but I've heard mixed stuff about it. Any insight into it would be awesome/other recommendations.   Equally as awesome. Appreciate the effort too :)   That's awesome! Much appreciated :)         My therapist is aware, she's asked to see my arms (obviously, that was optional) if you do decide to tell them, he/she will probably ask you why you do or other questions.   The only way they would ever have to take action was if it was endangering your life/you were threatening that.   I still cut, just not anywhere they would see. But I'm curious if anyone else is the same. I don't mind in public, but if I were to see anyone I know; I'd pull down my sleeves.  	14
 Botched Castration!   Happy Birthday,mate! Have a good one!   Pfffft. Get your crazy talk outta here. I'll have you know,I enjoy my boar-chicken.    British English is a non-rhotic dialect, it's difficult to pronounce r's in the way that Americans do (pronouncing them in every context). You guys kind of curl your tongues back when you pronounce an 'r', whereas there are few (probably none) actual r's at the end of words in British English.     beaRs Grilled   +1 for Siege weapons, that shit would be awesome.   Well, that hasn't happened in a long time.   :(   Hey,guys. I've recently been looking into WildStar and am getting pretty excited about the prospect of playing it, but I was wondering if there were any plans on adding a cash-shop into the game? I've heard that ESO is doing one and I'm beginning to get worried that this might be the trend of the other MMORPG's coming out.  So, is there a cash-shop planned?   Wait? They revealed more weapons? When? Do you have any pics?  Cool ideas,btw.   I kind of liked the Happening; 13 year-old me enjoyed that tiger scene with the amputated arm. I don't really remember the story,though.   Yeah, neither community is overly good or bad; there's just as much shit on Reddit as there is on 4Chan.   Damn, now I feel betrayed.   Fuck you, OP. :(   *Brave*   Beautiful. Gotta love their overconfidence at the start. That dude speaking  was probably rocking a rager at the thought of raiding your base, he certainly sounded like it,hahaha/   More what? What more do you need? I'm not being sarcastic, I literally have no clue. I'm not a 'nice guy' --I can't even talk to people my age, regardless of their sex-- so when someone says tells me that I have to be more than 'just nice' to gain friends/a girlfriend, I'm pretty confused.   I mean, all someone would have to do to improve their relationship with me would be to be nice to me, but I'm supposed to have something extra to garner their attention?    The day I tested out my improvised electrical cord noose. Good thing I pussied out, now my parents will never know!   I thought it was from My Little Pony: Jack Cleans the Stable.   4th top comment prediction: Probably some kind of pun/Reddit in-joke about broken arms or a safe or a banana.   I'd love to see more resources gained from hunting-- bone for bone armour/picks,intestines for bow strings, other offal for fertiliser if/when farming is implemented.    Sweet. Well, I've added you. You should get a request from Chezzprinn (dimitricatnikov). I won't be able to play just yet but I'll be on around Thursday.    My group on Rust could use some more people, if you're interested. There's about three of us on a good day and we've got a ts server we frequent, so we're always looking for new people. Only thing is that I'm unable to play until this Thursday, so there's only really one of us playing atm but, if you like, I can add you on Steam anyway.   Good luck, big fella! Make us proud!   Fuck's sake,I was thinking of getting this game. Guess I'm not anymore at that price...   Great Googly Moogly. I almost piddled myself when I had to push hard to clip in my processor.   Rust is incredibly fun when things are going your way, yet can be pretty frustrating sometimes. I personally haven't had any interactions with hackers but apparently they've been fairly prevalent on larger servers.  All in all,though, it has a lot of potential and can lead to a great variety of interactions.   Why would they DDoS steam? It doesn't make sense.   Phew, knew it wasn't just me. Thanks,mate!   Hey,guys.   Long-time lurker here who's recently begun to kick himself back into worldbuilding to supplement my desire to continue on with my novel.   I was wondering about the number of unique states I have in my world and whether there's too few of them for a world roughly the same size as the Earth;I have six autonomous states at the moment, with the world being respectively divided between them. Two are oligarchies run by pseudo-merchants/wealthy families, one is a transhumanist theocracy,one is an absolute monarchy,one is an autocracy determined by a cultural hegemony and one is a partial democracy.  At the moment, my worldmap looks pretty bland in terms of state diversity and amount. Each state holds enormous swathes of land and the more I look at it, the more I'm thinking that maybe I should invest in creating a few smaller states to bring about a more realistic geo-political environment.  What do you guys think?         I feel you,mate.  I spent my NYE and my NYD in bed. Hopefully the rest of 2014 doesn't follow through in the same way. :/   What about a R9 280x and a i5 2500K? Will that be enough?   So DayZ is a FFA Arma deathmatch with the occasional zombie thrown in?   Me,too! We could form our very own wolfpack!   Got myself a nice,fancy weapon-flashlight mod if you guys are interested. I could do with some more 5.56mm rounds and/or an I.V transfusion.   You have the all clear. Hackers are cunts.   Anyone know how to use the Saline I.V bags? I've tried putting the bag in my hand and dragging the I.V starter kit onto it but nothing happens. Is it glitched or something?   As Penguin said, for planning my day. I've bought it now, and stuck it on the fridge. Hopefully it'll remind to do shit,haha.   I got one! I wrote out my thoughts and feelings on 2Chainz's description of a 'big booty ho' in the hit single  'Bubble Butt'.   Yesterday, I told myself that I probably don't want to die just yet and suspended any suicide plans for the time being.  Today, I made a list of shit I should do for the day and plan on expanding it gradually as each new day comes.  Wish me luck, /r/depression, and also luck to those who haven't made their lists yet and will hopefully someday find a reason for staying.  [Link to my incredibly long list](http://imgur.com/S6oauK7)   I would've thought temperance would be a prerequisite for a police officer. I mean, you're going to cop shit like that all the time whilst on duty--there's no place for violent outbursts in a profession where the likelihood of receiving some kind of abuse is pretty much guaranteed and known beforehand.  If you're a cop and you respond violently to being spit on, you probably should've chosen a different job.   As a dairybased-kin, I take offence to your blatant disregard of the sexual agency of cream in that it should be allowed to choose whether it is licked or not. Check your lactose privilege.   Yeah, I'm not adverse to them putting in sound, just as long as that sound makes sense in the setting, ( like no StarWars-esque 'pew-pews'. It'd be awesome if they put in an atmosphere system, it's almost a must for the game.   I can dislocate and relocate my hip.  That's about it,really.   Drilling is the only one sound in the game so far,everything else is silent because space. I don't know much about the bug,sorry,but I have heard that it's pretty common  throughout the community.   Inbreads   "YEAH THANKS,GUYS. YEAH. YEAH. COOL. YEAH, I GOTTA GO NOW, YEAH, SEE YOU GUYS LATER. HAHAHA. YEAH. BYE."   Shh,shhh now. Just let it happen.   Commenting to read your reaction to his reaction later.   Jesus H. Particular Christ.  I can almost taste the congealed hypocrisy dripping off of her sweaty upper lip.   It is!   Just gotta keep in mind that it is in pretty early Alpha (so no guns or multiplayer yet) but the devs have been releasing updates almost weekly, so I have full faith in their ability to continue developing it!  	50
 Maybe you could start talking to some people online,being on social networks,video games stuff if you're into that,blogging,anything really. It's way easier than "getting yourself out there" in real life and it could lead you to make friends you have similar interests with. :)     I'm fooling people into thinking I'm leading an happy and fulfilling life everyday,so yeah..you're not alone.  As for advice : did you talk to a professional about your migraines ? Finding a way to get rid of them could be a great relief for you already.    Happy birthday    internet hugs OP !   I understand what you're going through,I've been there. Right now the pain is very strong so the best you can do is anything that would keep your mind off of it. Something that helped me was time going by,I'm not gonna lie and say you won't feel bad anymore,but it will become less frequent,less intense... yeah.   Do you remember some things that helped you go through life before you met her,if any ? Even the smallest thing. :)  	4
 I used the sponge this time.  I used Ulta Super Blender Sponge.  Thanks for the tips, next time I will blend it a bit more.   I was able to turn on AC and it does give air but it's not cool anymore as it should be.  What is the price range of getting AC refill? (am located in Rochester, NY)   I created [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/MakeupAddiction/comments/368i68/highlight_contour_ccw/) thread not too long ago, struggling with using NYX Highlight and Contour Pro Palette.  So I wanted something simple and hopefully this time, I am on the right track with the contouring and highlight.  I used NYX Stay Matte but Not Flat Liquid Foundation and the color is Nude and I used NYX Wonder Stick Highlight and Contour - Light/Medium.  Here is the current look WITH the wonder stick: [photos are here](http://imgur.com/a/Kz05b)  Please let me know what you guys think.  P.S. I posted a picture of the pro palette in the earlier thread. If you guys could guide me to select shades that may be a better fit for me to contour and highlight, I would greatly appreciate it for all your help.  Thank you!   I never met my father.    In the past, I struggled often because I always see little girls holding fathers' hands and I get extremely upset/jealous a bit, maybe.  Then I would get really angry at times.  I wasn't really handling it well, growing up.  I was also very fragile because I kept losing family members and friends (they died) around me.  So it was difficult for my mother to be able to tell me.  She wanted to wait until I get older; when I'm more mentally and emotionally prepared for the big, full story about my father.  I was 24 years old when I found out. Father's Day rolled around in June 2013.  Then I began to wonder about my father again.  I haven't thought about him for a couple of years until for some reason, I wanted answers. I felt ready to know what kind of father he was.  I researched, trying to find answers and I ended up finding his death certificate along with my half-brother's signature and phone number (I didn't know I had half-siblings).  Sadly I found out he passed in February 2010.  I was disappointed because I had planned on contacting him and try to get to know him and hope to meet him in person.  But I finally got in contact with my half siblings (one half brother and one half sister) I never knew until two years ago and they told me many stories about him.  Most of the stories weren't good, hence is why my mother protected me my whole life from not knowing what kind of father he was (he had a serious problem with alcohol and he was involved in drugs).  So my mom finally told me her story and everything made sense from there.  Even if I had meet him in person, I will end up feeling disappointed, seeing how my father turned out.  I learned the hard way, so for me, it's better that I know what kind of person he was and I would be better off without him in my life.  He wasn't a good person, especially to my half siblings.  They had it really rough, growing up around him and especially when he ran out on them multiple times and is good at disappearing.  He was no father figure.  Regardless with the struggles, growing up, I turned out fine.  I wouldn't be the person I am today.  I look up to my grandfather, as if he's my father.  I love him dearly.  I love my family.  I wouldn't have it any other way.   I'm looking for other places beside Goodwill...    Count me in :( I get terrible puffiness around my eyes, congested, itchy throat, and I basically can't really hear well in my ears.   I use a fan brush (Similar to this: http://stylebust.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Fan-Brush.jpg) first for my cheeks...  and then I use a contour brush (I have this brush: https://roundcheeksbeauty.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/c121b-realtechniquescontourbrushreview.jpg) for my forehead and temples.  I would use the same brush for blending as well.  Yes, I see the weird muddy gray as well.  I may have some contour and mixed it with highlight by mistake.  Should I get another brush to separate what it uses for, one for highlight and one for contour?  I used these shades. I circled the ones. See here: http://i.imgur.com/c8AVOht.jpg   I also did this at 2am.  I will try again, following the tips.  I may try go to Sephora, MAC and Ulta to see if they could tell me the same how I should really highlight and contour in a proper way.   UPDATED:  http://imgur.com/gallery/VOM2t/  MAKEUP:  * NYX Pore Filler * NYX Studio Perfect "Photo-Loving" Primer * NYX Stay Matte But Not Flat Liquid Foundation - Nude * NYX Highlight and Contour Pro Palette (this time I tried a really dark contour... not sure if I made the right call, selecting that color)  Aaah, I never realize how frustrating just to be sure the foundation and the highlight/contour has to be just right.  Plus the lighting in the room, with my light mirror stand, and the camera... (I used Logitech C920 Webcam)  it just gives off my face completely different than what I'm looking at. Hmmmmm....   I knew the foundation was wrong for me.  I even asked for help at Ulta to find a good foundation and matches with my skin and they tell me that the foundation would suit me.  I have a different foundation so I will try another.  I'll keep that in mind with the contouring.  Thanks so much!   I want to be sure I'm on the right track with highlight and contour.  What I put on,  * NYX Pore Filler * NYX Studio Perfect "Photo-Loving" Primer * Maybelline Fit Me! Matte + Poreless - (120) Classic Ivory * NYX Highlight and Contour Pro Palette  If you think the lighting in the photos aren't good, please let me know. I can retake photos and upload them.  Any advices or tips would be great. Thanks!   	10
 This is a really accurate analogy. Thanks you. I guess the key is to not drown myself...  	1
 Just had a similiar experience. I was spy, maf claimed in n2 that "Sk was working with them" and, what a wonder, sk and maf worked together until he let maf win, although there have been no wispers between them all game. Mysterious. I called them out for cheating in my will and reported all of them. In afterlife, I got to know 3 other people were on skype too (sheriff, exe and 1 of the mafs). I do think it should be made a general rule that its prohibited to skype with other players, you cant prove this "meta game" shit anyways.   Steel Legion Lux and Justicar Syndra are banned for their particles being less visible  I think there are more of those   I skipped school classes like crazy. In my final year, I missed about 200 lessons or something like that. Still made my finals, easily. Just because I could do that, doesn't mean my kids can, and I don't wanna end up in some school director's room telling me my kid said it was told by mommy skipping school is cool.   [Shouldn't be too hard to guess](http://imgur.com/3TSP4ZP)   Oh god, I already see this thread escalating terribly.  Whatever, my ranking would look somehow like this:  * 1. Imaginaerum * 2. Century Child * 3. Dark Passion Play * 4. Wishmaster * 5. Once * 6. Angels fall first * 7. Oceanborn [no hate please]   Coffee.   People always give me weird looks when I want a hot chocolate instead of coffee, and it would also be nice for getting starting in the morning but... I just can't. It tastes so horrible :(   Why are they off? There are 9 townie positions in a classic game, of which only one can be a mayor, namely the random townie, there's the chance of 1:8. There are 14 townie roles that a random townie can be, of which only one is a Mayor, so there we go with 1:13. and then a chance of 1/9 multiplied by the one of 1/14 is, if my calculator is right, 1/126.   So, did I miscalculate or did you? :P    So, this one I just HAD to share.  I was playing a classic game and ended up as executioner. One of my less preferred roles, but whatever. I tried a stupid old trick and said day 2 that I had, as an inestigator, found out that my target was mayor or gf and we should lynch him if he could not reveal.  So far, so boring.   But then that guy actually revealed himself :(  Not only he was with a chance of 1 to 8 the Random Townie, but also with a chance of 1 to 13 a mayor when random.   So the rest of the game was pretty much impossible to win for me. The mayor somehow never got killed at night and I could'nt manage to get my town to lynch a revealed mayor. No one suspected me and everyone protected me thinking I was investigator. In the end, town won, and everyone was like "wat" when they realized I did not win with them.   Morale of the story - sometimes a chance of  1/126 just fucks you up     I really enjoy Jailor, Transporter, Serial Killer, Godfather and Witch.  I don't like Executioner, Jester, Medium, Survivor and Retributionist.   Not exactly. Wilhelm and George were, and also George and Nicholas were, but Wilhelm and Nicholas were not first cousins but ... Second cousins? Dont know if its called that way.  http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Research/Files/Blogs/2013/brookings%20now/Familyrelationships.png - here you go   It doesn't work. I receive a message that the key is not valid for this game.  	11
 To say so is to imply knowledge of the unknown.  I have a headache now. Thanks.   Those two things, aaand we could stop wrapping tiny SD memory cards in gigantic plastic boxes.  Everything we eat is wrapped in plastic. Why? Where is this shortage of oil when I have to sever a fucking artery trying to get some theft-deterring crap off of something I buy?   Try to understand why the thought of eating meat makes you sick and go from there.  It's like quitting smoking. I had to reach deep to understand that cigarettes are manufactured by a bunch of assholes that want me to die a slow death and take my money in the process.  Normally I'd get pissed at someone who is trying to kill and rob me, so I went with that. Fuck those guys, and fuck their products.  Disclaimer: I am a cowboy.   I swear, everytime I turn around another $200 has gone missing from my wallet.  Dang, buddy. Maybe you ought to buy a gun or something.   Maybe that was his training.   I like how some people have a sense of humor about this, while some do not.  For example, I wanted to see some jokes about this guy in here. I found some. It was worth having to read through the predictable "discussion" before I got here.       he sits around all day and waits for software updates.   While what you say may or may not be true, it's how you say it that makes the difference.  For example, all everyone wants deep down is peace and survival, but people obviously don't know how to say it.  IMHO they should all apologize to each other and cure cancer already.   I like how they serve breakfast for lunch on Mondays.   For kicks, I can't say it's gotten much better, but school lunch in the US sucks, period unless you have affluenza.. Christ..  Check this out:   https://www.google.com/search?q=school+lunch+in+norway   Or this:  https://www.google.com/search?q=school+lunch+in+japan   At least the food *looks* appetizing. Too bad [it's contaminated with everything from mercury to radiation](http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/08/01/us-japan-whalemeat-idUST6359120070801).     EVERYONE here is a Monsanto expert. I swear.   I think you scared that guy away forever.   This should be the top comment.  Dell images don't ship with FF. And they won't until they strike a deal with Mozilla, which is never. You call in, a tech starts a service request, remotes into your computer and then downloads and installs it for that dumbass customer. The tech then follows up with that retard for a couple of days per Dell policy. Shit costs money, yo.  Spoken like a true Dell employee.   Is nothing sacred? I don't see what the big deal is. If the UK wants to cough up that much money to Dell over this, fine with me. I live in Austin.  Why not just send out a fucking email with a hyperlink to a local copy? How much could that really cost? Aren't we talking about a light bill here? Someone call XKCD. I want answers!  Seriously though.. not all of that money is leaving the Isles.        It's still bullshit.   30 years ago they were still catching big tarpon from the beach. Nobody has even *seen* a sawfish in Texas waters since 1984, and only three have been caught since 1971. There used to be a gigantic species of trout that thrived in the gulf that hasn't been seen there in 50 years. They are only known to live in the Pacific now and keeping one will land you in a Mexican prison. Kings have had a do-not-eat notice out on them for years running, at least out of Corpus, and although catch rates in the gulf are relatively stable, I spent several weekends last May and June at Packery Channel and did not see a *single* king caught, which was incredibly unusual given the tried and true methods used to hook them from the jetties. Kings will probably never be threatened because they are so hardy, but that notion kind of scares me when I see a startling inconsistency in catch rates from prime spots.  It's easy to be optimistic when you can limit out on fishery reds before the sun rises over a laguna, or nail big stripers from a limestone bank at Amistad, but the bigger picture is not just one of dwindling variety but large scale endangerment and extinction of those species that are not actively sustained.  Low expectations are why people don't fish. Anyone can go to a pawn shop and get a rig for $20 or much less.  Not trying to be argumentative btw. Just pointing out some facts that seem to indicate that you need to know what you are doing if you expect to catch dinner.        Much of the problem with south Texas in particular, and this is a bit anecdotal so stick with me for a second, is that for many years during the birth of the nuclear age, radium and uranium mine tailings were dumped into the rivers south of San Antonio, absolutely devastating the PPM life count in those rivers. Source: my biology instructor at Del Mar college. Guy was really close to becoming my step father so I got quite an ear full from him about the whole ordeal. I forget the exact figures but if memory serves the was something like a 98% reduction in this "life count", down to just a couple of hundred PPM between the 40's and the 60's.  Mining is about to destroy the gulf coast. Permits have been granted to resume uranium mining up and down the area, huge swaths spanning multiple watersheds, from just south east of Houston all the way around to the Rio Grande along the shelf.  I only have a moment to get all that out and I'm sorry I don't have good sources for you, but if there is any truth to it, it's still pretty disconcerting if not terrifying.  What can be done? Pretty much nothing. It's gone to hell in a hand basket already.  ---  The other half of this radioactive coin is, of course, agricultural runoff that has had 100 years to build up algal populations that when in bloom have the potential to devastate ecosystems, both fresh and salt water. Much of our Texas economy is based on agriculture, and with more mouths to feed and productivity being held in higher regard than eco-friendliness, even if there were a way to put a stop to the mining, runoff would still be there to kill away what's left.  It's a no win situation. Use less chemicals in farming means less production, less money, and ultimately joblessness. No mining, big companies leave an already natural-resource dependent job market, particularly along the gulf coast. I grew up out there and had to leave the area to find decent work, and it breaks my heart to think that I'll never be able to go back with a good enough job to make ends meet without killing myself in the process.  I could be all wrong about this, but it's what I read day in and day out, where I've been down there, what I've seen working in the oil fields and ranches and learned in school with my own eyes that is truly disheartening.  ---  Turning it around will involve nothing but a waiting game as more and more environmentally friendly politicians are put into office by an increasing population of people who are increasingly affected by this, for lack of a better word, catastrophe. It's going to take time to get those people there, and then it will be another generation who will perform the cleanup. As science advances technology in this regard at a snail's pace, my conservative estimate is that we'll be catching 10' tarpon in the gulf off of the beach again in about 150 years.  ---  This is to say nothing of the tens of thousands of largely unmaintained well heads sitting in the gulf... if you've ever tied off to rigs out there on a bright and sunny day to catch some snapper, you'd notice a sheen or two when the water is calm.    Thanks Vee.   I don't take the subject lightly, and I base my work schedule on the water conditions  (screw the weather) around Port Aransas because it's often the only thing to keep me from going postal. If my boss were smart he'd make everyone in the company join the CCA.    As someone who has lived in Texas for 30 years and has spent a few up north, freshwater fishing in Texas is almost pointless. Unless you know exactly where to go, and have a boat to get there, you are not likely to catch anything worth eating unless you spend a week wading around in a polluted river.  Sure there are some huge catfish in our lakes and a fair amount of gar to be had, but let's face it. There are not nearly as many clean spots to fish as there were when I was a kid.  Even the gulf is getting to the point where nothing to be had is worth taking. Sharks are getting smaller and reef fish less common, and things like king mackeral are few and far between.  The fisheries supporting red drum and their kin are all that I have left. When I go fishing I look for these places and do my best to get close to them. Brown tide and weeds and generally poor visibility plague the gulf coast and it's estuaries. Few and far between are the days of green water to see through to the bottom of the jetties.  Amistad has some nice catfish, and I know some record breaking bass anglers. But those catfish take time and they dont always bite, and those anglers are all but strangers.   Sorry.. I just wish more could be done to protect the very water these fish are supposed to live in. For 10,000 years Indians thrived on these wild and untamed rivers and streams. If one were to drink a full glass of water from the Rio Grande you'd probably wind up in the hospital for a week.  ---  It's not the lack of tackle keeping me from fishing, it's the lack of FISH.  Interesting. I was in a really shitty mood when I started in on this little rant, but just the thought of going fishing made me feel better...   Crazy. I was hit up for an IT job at JP Morgan a while back and told them I'd rather kill myself than work for them.  Looks like I'm not alone.   WELL THAT CANT BE GOOD   had breakfast there today myself. being from corpus, when i travel i really do start to crave their food. nothing beats a double meat double cheese whataburger jr with bacon and grilled jalepenos and grilled onions.. except two of them.   Just goes to show how shitty contemporary music is.   i have officially seen it all.   Your ad-hominem attack is unfounded. I suspect you have ulterior motives yourself.  What, then, are these protests about?   Is it too much:   police brutality,   police state,   wealth in the wrong hands,   taxation,   corruption,   oppression,   government...  no wait that doesn't work.   Or is it about too little:   money,   food,   work,   water,   rights,   essentials,   government,   representation... again, no dice because violence is inherently **about** inequality.  I had to say something and will probably get my ass handed to me, but I'd be interested to see what the motives of violent protesters really are if they are not about being cornerned like an animal at the hands of absolute power.   Spin it DJ.     If there is a product that is a huge benefit to society, like magic apples that can feed families, then that sort of thing needs to be taken OUT of private hands. Privatizing essentials of this hypothetical nature is an absolutely horrible idea, and it leads to situations to... wait for it... a corporate monopoly. Personally, I'd much rather have accountability, unfortunately government today is anything but. You throw legislation-mandated profit for multimilionaires in there and it becomes a ticking time bomb of a situation. Just look at the price of *everything* we buy from private hands. If it's expensive in private hands, it goes into someone's pocket. If it's expensive in government hands, it's mismanagement of funds.  Shit like Netflix, however, can suck it IMHO, but other things like Wikipedia, using search engines, and things that are generally beneficial/educational should not ever be kept from the public in the name of profit. The problem is, without a completely neutral network it would take a large body of people to constantly sit there and judge what is and what is not acceptable to charge a premium for, so the obvious solution is to let the pipes fill as they will.  I'm not sure what I'm trying to say anymore. It's a complicated issue and I've made a poor analogy, but I can say that I am jaded when it comes to my perception of people all sitting around a television day in and day out instead of reading books, educating themselves, or just getting out in general and doing something positive for the world.  Thanks for the conversation though. I'm in a bit of a bad mood today and am just venting.  ---  I don't know why anyone would downvote something like that. It's not like I am really ranting and swearing and being hateful. WTF is wrong with people? It's like once you get down into the depth of a thread people just turn into animals. Jeez.   With the right people and the right product, capitalism will provide wealth and jobs.  You know, I keep hearing that. We all do.  I find it morally abbhorent that one can sell life-saving apples at 1000% profit to people who have to save up between each other and split said apple with 10 other's just to get a little nutrition. That is what capitalism boils down to, or at least what it does in practice.  I'm not trying to compare these apples to Netflix, mainly because if nobody ever made another movie or mass produced another record again, you wouldn't catch me sweating it. People need to go outside more anyway. Maybe once petty entertainment is prohibitively expensive, or at least ridiculously difficult to really enjoy, people will start to wake up to the fact that they have been taking it in the ass the whole time; being sold shit they don't need at prices they can't afford. It's mind blowing how brainwashed the masses are, but what's even moreso is the fact that people seem to *know* how stupid they are acting yet seem to want to do nothing about it. It is at this point that I start to have less pity for that huge swath of the consumer entertainment market that will be truly affected by this.   ---   I'm pretty sure techies will figure out how to get what they need done. That's just the nature of the beast here as much as lawyers in Congress get the shit they need done long before they go around pretending to care what voters think.   I have no idea. I googled for "net neutrality google channel" because I remembered this being posted a long time ago, and quite a few popped up.   It's open source software, and not the biggest project at that. Corporate dollars are not flowing into it because it's cheaper to use that source code w/o telling anyone than it is to do the right thing and actually support the project.  ---  I don't know how *many* people care about PF, but I can tell you that in the course of my IT career I have seen some surprisingly large implementations of it at some surprisingly common household names. The list would probably really surprise a lot of people.  I personally love PF and wouldn't use anything else to secure an edge for a big network where budget and performance are big concerns. When I am asked what to use, I always point to it when appropriate, and reading this news really breaks my heart. I hope some philanthropist picks up where all these companies that use the software for free have shirked their moral responsiblity.   Definitely. Easy for them to produce, and you get some cool art in the process. Last time I bought a CD they sent me an OBSD lanyard and a puffer poster for free out of the blue.  OpenBSD is a wonderful operating system, and I've seen some *really* big implementations of PF not even bump a 0.2 on a load average at peak times.   If there is not already a law against that, there will be. Our legislative system is just a big game show to these crooks. "I'd like to buy another law, Pat!"  Capitalism is deeply flawed in this regard. Greed begets greed in this economy, and with every member of congress being spied on, as long as people out there have that kind of potential dirt on them, and as long as corruption in politics is not punished harshly, there is simply no impetus for our government to change a thing about any of this. This is business as usual, except you can't just demolish the Colloseum without expecting the lions to get hungry.  Should be very interesting to see how it plays out, although I think we all know where this is leading.  ---  Edit: this is where it's going: http://imgur.com/AwSYTzK   Right, because burning dead soldiers is more* like knitting sweaters and petting kittens.   No joke. I always wondered why guys like him never ran for president until I realized just how smart they really might be - being cautious there because to me that level of intelligence is kind of unimagineable, kind of like their wealth. If I had that money I'd blow it all on a used naval destroyer (like you can buy one haha..) and do something stupid like try to invade North Korea and free some real slaves.   It's interesting when it's effective. Right now "the best country in the world" is drownging in the wake of greed, corruption, and breeding a generation of uneducated slaves that might one day find themselves being rescued from this place by human rights activists operating out of Zimbabwe or something.   ooo, this is nice. thanks!   That would piss the old man off bigtime. Can't wait to tell him that next time he drags that one out. Thanks haha...   Haha yeah you would really like him. He's a lot like you except he's funny and interesting and has had sex with a woman.   Seriously miss Winamp after moving to Linux. I wish XMMS had done better, and I *really* wish it had come with something like Winamps AVS.   You were expecting something different? I'm not holding my breath to read any headline like "World's richest people pool resources to rid the planet of starvation, disease, and pollution".  Like my dad says, you can wish in one hand and shit in the other - see which fills up faster.  I used to be all "YAAY SAVE THE WORLD :D", but now that I'm older it's more like "fuck, what the fuck just happened?" even though I know the answer to that question.   I thought this was an article from the Onion at a glance. My grandpa seriously walks to McDonalds and drinks coffee every morning with his ancient buddies, presumably to holla.   Given the technical details, yes, miles seems like a long ways, but I'd imagine an Internet-connected tranceiver next to the mark would be all that's needed to get the data across the globe. I'm fascinated too.      but I don't see how a tiny discreet chip could transmit over miles.  Go open up your cell phone and look at the circuit board in it. Now imagine if it didnt need to do anything BUT transmit 1's and 0's over long distances. The actual part that sends and recieves signal is just a few very tiny components. The rest is so you can play Angry Birds and look at Facebook.   Probably more like the Sinaloa and the feds are just building a monopoly.   GEEZ. If we only had a way to TEST the chemical. I can't wait until we invent science.  Anyone have a link to the MSDS?   At its finest?   Well this is good news. They shouldn't close the pass though. That's some awesome wade fishing back there. You can walk around in calf deep water barefoot for a long ways. Flounder and trout are everywhere in the flats, and bull reds running through that pass are consistently huge.   If I owned that place I'd put a jetty and a grill on the water out there.  Yes, a lot of people didn't seem to give a shit about the place with their trash everywhere. Sad state of affairs.   I used to love going there, but the place was painful to look at. Completely unmaintained, huge rusted sheets of corrugated steel sticking up where the bulkheads used to be - I mean if you fell on one of these it could literally cut you in half. Not a place for small kids.  The place is out of the way, and as such the fishing there was generally pretty good. From there north to Sabine on that beach is just a toxic waste land after these storms.  So sad. Rollover used to be a yearly stop for me, would stay a few days, drink beer, cook out, and fish for everything the coast line has to offer. I have read that there was a restoration plan for the area, possibly relocating the pass or completely re-engineering the solution. There is just not enough of a tourist economy for the area because it is so remote and torn to pieces now to make financial sense to decision makers I guess.   anyone have a link to that pic posted a few years ago of the grackles all over the big bird sign at fiesta on 35? had a friend that lived near there and the noise was insane. there was literally a swath of bird shit 1/4 mile wide in the direction they took off regularly.   this is a big no-no. you install phone system, you configure 911 to dial 911. digit matching. it's easy and there are laws.  source: designed hundreds of them and *always* test 911, even if you have to route the call to your cell phone, testing that functionality before walking out the door is a must.   physics with.. marine biology? they'd send you to the bottom of the ocean with that kind of paperwork. they might even have you work on projects simulating what it would be like to land on Europa.  physics with.. geology? no - planetary geology! then, you could go to Europa too.  physics with.. mechanical/electrical engineering? you could build the space ship *and* fly it.  go for the gusto, i say.  fwiw, you are probably too smart to be a cop, btw.  	51
 Thank you so much, I'll remember that.   ah yes the american savannah beasts  	2
 Ours tossed a blade while crushing ice, shattering the glass container. Also it stained my pants poop   And these things are different how?   I never understood that. Wtf are they made out of?   I am. Tacos are like open ended burritos made out of razor blades. Burritos are so much easier to hold on to. Except if they aren't wrapped well they get soggy by the end   Last time I saw them it was:  Rodeo Ruby Love  Streetlight Manifesto  Reel Big Fish  Lost my coat and shoes in the circle pit, found them in the sound booth, made friends with some of the techs and got pulled over at 3am in Camden because my car matched the description of a stolen vehicle. Epic concert and fun times    	5
 You're so unhappy with yourself and your life that you've created delusions of grandeur to cope  Nah, I fell asleep at the wheel and I came to going 85MPH. I don't remember about half of a 20 mile drive. I didn't get any sleep that night because I had to bring my mom to the ER and tried to pull an all-nighter. Basically, shift started at 8AM, worked until 4:30PM. Got home, Mom called up at 11:30PM that her chest hurt, went to ER until 4:00AM. Got home and had to work at 8AM again. At the hospital, I had drank 6 cups of coffee with 42 packs of sugar and 30 creamers figuring I'd be up all night. Drove home, didn't sleep or eat. Was feeling a bit woozy, but had to go in to work or I'd get fired. Drove to work when it was light out. Next thing I remember I'm going 85MPH and it's dark out. Doesn't make sense as I wasn't scheduled before 8AM ever.   That day at work everything was really fucked up. The entire part of the store I was responsible for was completely changed and kept changing after that. I had all the aisles memorized and pretty much knew where everything was - it was all moved around. Other people at work noticed it too, so I wasn't the only one.   That night I came home and shit wasn't the way it was when I left. People were different. Items were out of place.  After that, items in the house began "moving." For a month after that everything was extremely strange and different.  	1

 The first story I've genuinely enjoyed here! Fantastic writing, OP. I love the mixture of romance and passion, like ed077 says. Do more! :)   	1
 I'm a quarter away from getting my Associates in Art (general studies). My original plan was to get an AA with an emphasis in English, which is my school's equivalent of a major. Unfortunately, the job I had at the time was during the day so I wasn't able to take the all the English courses I needed. So I opted for general studies instead. I'm 20 years old now, and I don't know what to major in anymore. I've yet to apply to a single university.   I had always dreamed of being a writer or editor of some sort, but that was back when I had a passion for reading and writing. After I moved out of my mom's house and started working and going to school, I've probably read 3 or 4 novels. Written a couple pieces of poetry and prose. My writing abilities have suffered immensely, and I've lost most of the passion I had for it.   Now, when I ask myself what I enjoy doing the most, and what I would never be able to give up, the answer is music. I took up guitar and singing a couple years after I discovered how much I loved reading and writing, and though I don't practice as much as I used to these days, it's what I love to do the most. But I realize it's not a practical career, and I've been told many times over that college is a waste of time for what I'd like to do with music.   I used to live in LA, and I was playing at cafés and bars at the age of 16. This was because I had a couple connections. Independent labels were approaching me, but I was too naive and still loved writing too much to take them seriously (plus there was drama concerning my mom, which I won't get into). I moved to Seattle a couple years later, and I feel like that time has passed (so have the connections). Moving back to LA right now isn't really an option, either. I've heard the University of Washington has a good music program, but I'm still wary. Has anyone here had a good experience with studying in music/do you know anyone that has?  TDLR; I can't decided if I should major in music, because I've been told it's a waste of time.  	1
 Told me when I said I was leaving that I'd never do any better than him. This after cheating and leaving me several times with different women.  It was a horrific experience for a first relationship.   Surgical masks are designed for the sneeze to basically flow out back through the sides. Generally, you're supposed to sneeze facing the surgical field. If you turn away, the sneeze would be directed right into it.   Other than that, I think you'd just prepare yourself and put down those instruments before you kill someone.   I remember the earliest meme-ish website I remember being on was Emotion Eric. Or Hamster Dance. Oh, how far we've come.   French fries and mayonnaise. Nomnomnom.   21, 5.5  Being Chinese, I used to mess around with people in high school and tell them I had my feet bound when I was younger. They believed me. I:   I went to work and brought cake for all my coworkers. And then I went out with my then-boyfriend and his best friend who had a thing for me to two mostly-dead bars. Very awkward.  The bartender did buy most of my drinks for the night though, so that was a plus.   Surprised [My Dick](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzYG0ZkrXg) hasn't been posted yet.

 I'd rather have him play the games he likes to play than do some minecraft without really being interested in the game.   Haha alright, I will! Thanks :)   Can someone quickly tell what they did for the people who missed it?            Barely any nowadays. I used to watch a stream from BTC or Chad every once in a while. If Generikb would start streaming minecraft again, I'd definitely watch. I enjoyed his AS streams :)   Yeah, that was it. I'm sorry I didn't have all facts right there, I was on my phone.   I think in UHC #FTK two battles between three teams followed up each other really quickly too. Anderz and Syndicate were still sorting out stuff from the previous battle when the next team arrived.         My favourite build is either Generiks mansion or the S4 nether hub. Favourite S5 build is Bdoubleo's house in the roofed forest :)   Id try to ask this over at r/feedthebeast, more people there who have (had) similar issues and because its a modpack in the ftb launcher you might have more luck there   That does sound like Generik, haha!   Generiks video is too short? :(   Happy birthday to you too then! :)   Happy birthday /u/millbee! :) And amazing banner, /u/warrantica!   He uploaded it at the time of my comment. The other TTT episode from millbee was from the 20th   [Here ya go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJiADGEpfsI)   [Millbee!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJiADGEpfsI)   Agreed! I love watching Potty Mouth's episodes :) They should definitely play more games together.   That's great! I tend to do this during the summer, just pick some series I couldn't keep up with during the year and then marathon those. There's a lot that I wanna watch by various mindcrackers but I just don't have time for it anymore. Can't wait till summer ;)   well I'm still not fully used to it, but I'm getting there. I can almost afford to go to bed around 1am again, lol. Slowly starting to fill up my evenings with fun stuff again so that's a good thing I think.   Had some chaotic weeks with personal issues. Started my internship a few weeks ago too so I've switched from 0hrs of work in a week to 40hrs of work in a week. Got loads of plans for the upcoming weeks though :) Gonna go out for 1hr bike rides every now and then just to get out on the move instead of sitting inside, gonna see Kingsman on Tuesday, gonna enter in my very first UHC on Wednesday with some people on a modded server I play on, celebrating three birthdays this weekend and have to work next weekend (money! finally!) so yeah. Being very busy, but in a good way :)   I'm seeing Kingsman next Tuesday so good to know :)   I think so too yeah. He has a bit more experience in UHC and even though he's nervous while he's on his own now, they can all help each other once they meet.   Have a nice weekend!   I hope Arkas meets up with the newcomers team. It sounds like they could use the 5th person the most, could make things interesting! They're not that far away from the stacked team Potty Mouth either.   Made me chuckle.   While Your Lips Are Still Red is definitely my favorite song by Nightwish.   But anderz almost always talks nether in UHC. I haven't seen many uhcs (joined around season 15 or 16, still planning on watching the earlier ones) but he pretty much always goes there and loves to rush it too.   Yeah same for me. Doesn't work well with an alarm at 6:30am on monday through friday.  edit: oh hey, didn't know you were a fellow Dutchie! :)   I can't, I already lost it once because I was stupid. :p Now I have the holidays edition and I'm definitely keeping it   "Oops, wrong world!"   BTC's never really been gone. It's just that most of his minecraft activity is streamed and not uploaded or saved as VOD. He's done quite a lot of work on the server, for example the guardian farm.   Oops sorry! Must have missed it :( Want me to delete it? (Or feel free to do so.)      Oh god.. I like the idea but I don't like risking my flair. :p   Doesn't show on mobile for me, but believe me, can't be missed when you're in a browser. :)   Definitely the team I'll be watching first every episode. Don't care if they win or lose, this is gonna be great!   Welcome back, I have really missed these!   I can't wait to watch these tonight! I'll be one day behind this whole season :(   Sorry to hear that. Good luck on getting a vanilla fish!   Heh, sorry. It's a bit early. That might do yeah, can be useful for creative mode. Stuff like toggledownfall, setting your gamemode, making it daytime..   I like it but it has four very thin supports for such a house. Try making these a bit more interesting because it doesn't look right, even though the hills give it some support too.   Let them tame a cat or a dog. Maybe do a small fishing contest, not too long because it might get boring. Practice a bit in fighting off mobs, start with zombies. Practice bow shooting.   Not sure about command blocks for new people. I've been playing Minecraft for 3 years now I think and I know nothing about command blocks, let alone kids from 5-12 years old.   I'd say try it?   I don't know what's gonna happen exactly but I think Dordrecht will go back and NEC will rejoin the Eredivisie   I think that's because he records a lot of episodes at once and he gets burned out after a few. That's the point where he should just stop and record some more one or two days later. I don't think he's getting burnt out or bored, he seems to still enjoy the game. It's just loss of focus after recording multiple episodes in a row.  edit: spelling   Oh damn it. Now mine says 4/10 instead of 8/10 because I thought it went up to 5.. Oh well.   It has a Material Energy quest map feeling to it too. Really like it! :)   Haha, vind het er niet lelijk. Ik woon tegenwoordig in Nijmegen, dat is wel een mooie stad!   I haven't seen #145 yet! Damn, he made a lot of progress :o Will do as soon as I get home, same for #149. Good to see the DPT back :D   Absoluut. Ik heb ruim 20 jaar in Wijhe gewoond (ten zuiden van Zwolle) en heb ruim twee jaar in het IJsseldelta stadion gewerkt. Het is een mooie club :)   Zal nu wel officieel zijn. Ben er blij mee!   I used to think it could be his first name (Jason) but then shuffled (Jsano), until I found out his name was Jeff.   I have my ups and downs here. I have weeks where I keep checking this subreddit, interact with people etcetera but I can also let go if it pretty easily, especially in busy times.   Oh, lol! Haha. xD   The detail on the crafting table! Wow!      dadbee cheering after the first race really cheered me up :) Great episode from the guys!   Pattern chests keep their content upon breaking.   You can bone meal the flowers that are two blocks high and it'll give you more flowers. Did you know?   Ahh. I was thinking of a 3 person combo there, my fault. Or like Chad and Baj maybe.. Maybe? Probably just me..   OMW?   Not really, though I think you can come quite far if you try to figure out the Mindcracker's regular upload times. Maybe ask this again on Sunday in the Weekly thread for small questions? :)   Even when you have a degree in 'normal programming', it can be hard to find a job later. I study bioinformatics which seems to be the future. People want you, you don't even have to look for an internship or job. Or well, maybe a little, but there's barely any competition going and there's a lot of work left.   I live in the Netherlands and I know it's been far worse in NY and surroundings. :P It's just that here, with just a tiny bit of snow, all trains stop riding..   I started my graduation internship this week and I think I couldn't have started it worse than I did. On Monday, we got snow and I got stuck in public transport. After 1.5 hours of standing still in a train in the middle of nowhere, the damn train turned around and I had to travel along by bus. I got in 2 hours late on my first day.. Tuesday was fine. Wednesday I've spent the day at home in bed being sick. Thursday I felt better so I went back there, they told me to go back home to get better. And today I spent my time at home too, trying to get better. I still feel rubbish and I called off for work in the weekend. Bye money.. :P Hope I'm no longer tired and cold on Monday so I can get a new fresh start!   Sounds like a nice friday evening :) Enjoy your weekend!   Yay there it is! :D   Do you know anything about today's episode? :( I need my daily dose of Millbee's MK8   Jsano's is too!   MK8 is both 100% skill and 100% luck, I think. You can't win (or at least end up at a reasonable position) without either one of them.   Get a stack of poisonous potatoes and you can freely trade your raw potatoes for baked potatoes   Ooh Cauli! Which ones? :D   Wow I just now realised how much the guys have been streaming. This is just for one day?   That Arkas banner, oh my!! :D   Like Millbee said, it was a good banana throw though. I wouldn't expect it when I was just driving around and suddenly throws a banana right in front of me while I'm about to take on the ramp.   Am I the only one who is annoyed by Pyro not picking random?   I'd be in for a good laugh and go with Chad, Generikb and BdoubleO. I'd love to see them together! xD   Kurt's ear   Hope all is well.   "Man, I'm doing the worst. Turned my screen back off!" - Cracked me up lol!   Millbee's daily Mario Kart 8 series, by far. It's the only thing I watch regularly.  edit: spelling   I hope it will be a spoooky_ghost level prank like he did with Aurey's barn   I haven't really been keeping up lately (exams and deadlines), who has pranked Chad?  Edit: never mind, found my answer in the episode thread. Asked too soon.   You know.. There's already commentary to videos. You could easily recognize someone by their voice as well.   Plus they're from earlier streams. People who really wanted to see it have probably already seen it live :)   Nice stats, I would definitely try to watch that stream if he were to stream on a (for me) reasonable hour :) I've been following this series for so long now, I don't wanna miss the finale!   Thank you :)   Hey! This is quite funny. I'm also Dutch, I also had an interview today for an internship and I also got it! And after that, I also hope to graduate this summer! :D  Good luck on your internship in a few weeks and good luck on the remaining bits of your thesis!   Oh, alright. That's pretty awesome if you ask me :)   [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnQBdB04F2Y) - **Guude** - Mario Kart 8 multiplayer: Guude steals not one but two stars from Coe! - First star at 5:10, second star at 12:28   Did he really only miss one day? I thought it was maybe 2 or 3 days spread over the past 2.5 months   True! :)   Oh man, just over a month left of this series in the current trend? I'm gonna miss it :(   They should do more of this "all random" when they pick the course, I agree with Millbee in that it adds a bit more excitement.   I don't know man, I got them from bags or found them around the map. I quit ME3 a while ago.   Hey, it's alright! You're doing great on them! :)   Happy birthday Anderz! And great work on the banner /u/aypreel !   Good to hear you found something.  	103
 This is why you don't propose to someone IN FRONT OF A FUCKING CINNABON   Wow, that's disgusting. Holy shit. I'm really sorry and I hope you're healthy and happy, and I hope the ignorant shit who said that to you comes to see things differently someday. It's 100% not your fault and I hope you can recover from whatever trauma might have been inflicted on you. You are loved and and strong and you have this entire subreddit's support 3   "Created by /u/monkeytits"   I recently started liking [Microsoft Yi Baiti Regular's](http://imgur.com/MQLc7wy) collection of lowercase letters. I was messing around in After Effects trying to figure out how to animate text, and I used Yi Baiti's lowercase paired with Gill Sans' uppercase for any words I wanted to emphasize, and I really liked how they looked together.      A kid in one of my classes does dip but spits it into a clear water bottle. It takes every ounce of effort not to gag audibly in the middle of class.   As someone who suffers from anxiety, I think this is probably the nicest thing I've read all day! You're a great husband for being so caring, supportive, and understanding. I often feel like my anxiety is a huge burden to the people I love because it prevents me from living fully and happily, and I worry that that's troubling to them. But you seem like a really patient person, which is exactly what a person with anxiety needs in a partner or a friend. You go, dude.   Quote aside, the leading on this is awful.               I fucking lost it. I've been giggling at that for the past five minutes. Every time I stop giggling my mind wanders back to that sentence and I start giggling again.   Yeah, I think that kind of behavior stems out of insecurity and shame. It's really easy to joke about your flaws to others to make it look like you don't really care      That gets me super bummed, too :(      My brother once used a hockey stick to behead my favorite barbie -- it looked like [this](https://barbiebeauties.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/img_3456.jpg), except she was tan and had brown hair. Unforgivable. I cried so much.   I'M NOT DRAMATIC YOU'RE DRAMATIC  *flicks cape around and plays an organ  But seriously though, I just really like history/ancestry. Whenever I go to a historical site that holds a lot of meaning I feel really connected to it, so I feel like this act of vandalism is more destructive than if, say, someone were to spray paint the walls of a decrepit building. There are people who dedicated their whole lives to preserving that landmark, educating people about it and the history surrounding it, and I think it's a really big shame that someone could so thoughtlessly destroy it like that. I don't blame the tour guide for nearly crying.   I mean, literally speaking, yes, that would be the climax   BBBBBOOOOOOOOOOooooOOoOOO^oooo000^0000   To be fair, eyebrows like that were super popular at the time   This hurts my heart. That probably meant so much to so many people, and represented a really rich and strong culture's history. How could one even punish the person who did this? I honestly don't think anything could truly make up for damage that severe to something that important.   Goats and lambs are two separate things, I think you're thinking of the word "kid"  	24
 Good hilarious or bad hilarious?   [The inspiration for this question](http://img.phombo.com/img1/photocombo/63/ch920621.jpg)   You could try [Tech Support](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/)   That's it. Thanks. And again, thanks to ASCIIBear. Honestly, that was a hell of a moment too.   No, that's not the one. It was a different time, shortly after that, I think. But thanks though.   I think they were both WWE Champion (Punk leaving with the "real" title, and Cena holding the "fake" title he won against Rey Mysterio), and they were on adjacent turnbuckles.  CM Punk raised his title, and his music played.  Cena did the same, and his music immediately interrupted Punk's.  They did this back and forth at least three times each, I think. It was a cool moment, but I can't find video of it.  Help a brotha out?   I don't know if any of you guys get as immersed in kayfabe as I do, but I sometimes see things during a given show that make me ask "Why would this person do this, if we think in terms of kayfabe?"  For example, the fact that Triple H always covered the head of the sledgehammer with his hand when he used it as a weapon. Outside of kayfabe, it's obviously because (from what I hear) he uses a real sledgehammer 99% of the time, and he uses his hand to cushion the blow.  But it's still obvious that he does so to the viewer, so it might take away from the realism... unless you can think of a reason he would do it IN kayfabe. Like, maybe he covers the hammer itself so he can control it better, since a sledgehammer is actually pretty heavy.  Something like that. Using kayfabe to explain things that make sense in real life (where wrestling is choreographed), but don't appear to make sense in kayfabe (where wrestling is a legitimate sport).  The wiki could be set up as a Q A, where Wredditors can edit the wiki itself to either ask or answer a question like the above.  What think, r/sq?   One minute later: Oh my God, she hates me.  Two minutes later: She's probably having sex with someone better than me :-(  Three minutes later: I'm going to die alone      He also used a Spear on an episode of Raw or SmackDown (can't remember which)   I just used brackets to show which phrase I was inquiring about-- ah, excuse me. About which phrase I was inquiring. ... damnit, that was a dependent clause. Am I even allowed to start a sentence with "..."? SO MANY QUESTIONS.  :P  Anyways, which of the two bracketed phrases is correct? I'm leaning towards the first, since I think "second most" would be using "second" as an adverb to describe the adjective "most," whereas "second-most" is an adjectival phrase that would describe the noun "subscribers."  Or, on that note, I'm thinking maybe both could be considered correct?   Not an entire promo dedicated to it, but if he's cutting a promo, and the crowd starts chanting Goldberg's name, he could quip something along the lines of "[sarcastic laugh] Goldberg *wishes* he was as talented as I am." And then continue the promo.  Would there be controversy, even a little?   I always get caught off-guard when a woman gives me an extremely firm handshake. I never know whether or not to do so before the fact, since I'm worried about hurting her hand.  Although, to be fair, I've never heard anyone say "Ow" in response to a handshake, man or woman.   You made Mike Tyson retreat with just a handshake. You might be Jesus.   I'm so stealing this.  Now I need to find people willing to shake my hand.   Why not?   You guys think Ricardo is marking out for Del Rio on commentary?   Pick your girlfriend up and hold her in your arms, then carry her to the bedroom.  Girlfriend: Wow, you're so strong...  Incorrect answer 1: **Nah, I'm not really that strong.** You just don't weigh much.  Incorrect answer 2: Yeah, I guess I am. **You're pretty heavy.**      More details about my resources:  * I have my own place.

I'm a lot better with my brain than my hands, but I'd definitely be willing to learn. The least I could do is try. Beggars, choosers, etc.  * I'm a very good creative writer, and I enjoy it.

Thanks.         I will be damned if I repent.      Here is the exact version of the cooler that I own:  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16834992522  It was working fine until recently, when it suddenly starting rumbling noticeably (I have it, and my laptop, on my bed, and was sitting next to it) and making a lot of noise. I opened it up to fix any problems that a tech dummy like me could find (dust, loose parts, etc.), and didn't find much of anything wrong.  The problem is persisting, however, and I can't figure out how to solve it. Any suggestions?   Agreed. It's very long, but it's not a run-on, and I don't see any grammatical errors or any incorrect syntax of any kind.      I don't know dick about the law, but I assume there'd be something to protect the employee in a situation like this:  * Employee: "Sorry I had to leave before my shift was over. I was severely sleep deprived and had to be hospitalized."  * Employer: "I don't want to have to do this, but we can't do anything for you at this point. You can pick up your final check on Friday."  * Employee: "You... you're firing me?"  * Employer: "I'm sorry, but I have no choice. I need someone who won't miss shifts or leave before completing a shift."  * Employee: "I ALMOST DIED, YOU SON OF A BITCH!"  * Employer: http://fuuu.us/18.png  There HAS to be a law against that.   Jesus Christ, dude. That is some grade-A work ethic.   Like others, I take a nap during the day after 4-6 hours of sleep at night. The only reason I really do this is because I like to stay up late AND wake up early. This is really the only way I could think to pull it off. I typically get to sleep around 1-3 AM and wake up at 6-8, then nap at around 12-1.  It doesn't feel any different than your typical 8-hour sleep cycle. I feel well rested each time I wake up, and I get to sleep pretty easily in both instances.  I've considered polyphasic sleep (because tbh, I really don't like sleeping), but I have insomnia from anxiety/depression, so I'd have to dope myself up on sleep aids multiple times a day. No, thanks.   Was it definitive that the reason he died was because of his consistent lack of sleep?   Thanks for all the suggestions, guys (although the single downvote is pretty perplexing). I'll be sure to look into all of them.  If anyone else has an idea, please let me know!   More details about my resources:  * I have my own place.

I understand the concept of Buddhist principles, Nirvana all that good stuff, but I still definitely wouldn't say it's something to live by.   I'm sorry... but BULL. SHIT. Suffering is not a conscious decision that we can choose not to go through. Suffering is an emotional response to pain, and if it was simple enough as "I don't want to suffer-- therefore I will not," nobody would smoke pot or take anti-depressants.  Emotional pain is almost exactly the same as physical pain. When it hits you, you hurt. When you hurt, you react. That reaction is what suffering is.   "If I don't want to do it, and I don't have to do it, it's not gonna get done."      So, basically, it's being Batman?      I think I see what Carlin is saying here, but I'm not sure. Anyone care to post their thoughts?   What sets us apart? What happened to make us so intelligent, and why didn't it happen to any other animal throughout its biological/evolutionary history?      Basically, I guess you could say this could be your best "Good Guy Greg/Good Girl Gina at work" stories.   STOP BREAKIN' THE LAW, ASSHOLE!!!!!!!!!   Well, this sounds like a healthy relationship.      I'm just sayin. If that was me, I wouldn't let some random guy sleep in my guest bedroom.  Unless he had beer.   And then you have to worry about the placebo effect, plus the fact that mental illness is different than physical illness. Anything negative that happens in your life can make it exponentially worse, even if the ADs have been working.  It sucks. There's your understatement of the common era.   If you actually manage to still take them as prescribed even while struggling with your depression, I salute you.      wut eez thees... kar-mah?

Maybe I don't want a frozen pizza or a "pizza kit"   And I generally try to avoid people like you. But your ignorance is so noxious that even though I'm probably never going to address you again, you still somehow manage to make internet douchebags look worse than they already are.  Congrats, brah.    NOBODY is allowed to deduct mileage unless they're self-employed, or earn enough and spend enough on specified expenses to qualify for itemized deductions.  I don't understand what you mean by this. I'm not great with financial concepts.   **I haven't yet been able to provide evidence to how immature Reddit is sometimes. Please continue to prove me right.**   I just asked a question. Chill out.   By the way, keep the downvotes coming. I haven't yet been able to provide evidence to how immature Reddit is sometimes. Please continue to prove me right.     So when you withhold the tip, not only is it as if you are not paying your waiter, you are ALSO basically costing them money.  But that's not my fault. I'm not doing anything fraudulent. I'm paying for what I ordered. Sometimes I want a pizza and don't have the money for a tip.  It seems like they're getting shafted by the government, so why is it my responsibility to counterbalance that?      Also, colorblind people: Don't look at the top of the browser window to determine if it's Malicious Advice Mallard or Actual Advice Mallard.    I went to therapy once they told me that this could be my baseline. That I will always be this way.  I say that therapist is a quack. There is no such thing as an untreatable level of depression. We can treat CANCER, for God's sake. I refuse to believe that anyone with depression, no matter how severe, cannot be helped significantly.   Apparently, CBT is supposed to help one cope with anxiety/depression/mood disorders/etc., and learn how to live a relatively normal life despite the condition(s).  From what I've read and/or heard, its general purpose is to teach one how to live WITH the condition(s) instead of eliminating it/them.  Right now, I'm losing a battle (and losing badly) between numerous anti-depressants and my anxiety/depression. Nothing's working. The only times I don't want to sob uncontrollably and crawl into a hole and never come out are when I'm sleeping. I rarely enjoy doing anything I normally like to do, so it's all but an impossibility for me to actually motivate myself to do something I *don't* want to do.  Point is, I can't possibly fathom living with this and not feeling psychologically crippled. Living a normal life where I don't neglect my own personal hygiene, sleep 16 hours a day, and spend all my free time alone in a two-story house, brooding in the basement with all the lights off since it's the only room that doesn't have windows.  Living with something that turned me into a prisoner of my own psyche is not something I can understand. It doesn't make sense and it doesn't seem possible-- as such, I feel like trying it would be a waste of time and money.  Could someone try to convince me otherwise?       Seeing D-Bry still lose his temper and attack Big Show, even though Big Show didn't want to fight, and watching him not understanding or accepting HBK's apology is still in line with this theory.  This is actually a really good point. I did find it odd that Bryan was acting like such a dick towards Big Show, backstage and in the ring, after it was announced that they had a match against one another.  But even if Bryan should actually be viewed as a heel, what does that make The Authority? Mega heel?    My question to you is this: why is it okay for Shawn to let his emotions get the better of him, but not Bryan?  It's not okay in the context of superkicking Bryan, but it's understandable in my opinion.  Bryan losing his cool and putting Michaels in the Yes Lock is less understandable because not only was he lashing out at the wrong person (Shawn isn't the one who's making Bryan's life a living Hell), but he essentially started the chain reaction during that moment.  1. Michaels politely and humbly asks Bryan to accept his apology, face-to-face, man-to-man  2. Bryan refuses without saying anything. We don't know if he's being a smart ass, or if he's just upset overall and not at Michaels. His lack of communication is key. Instead of just shaking his head, saying something probably would have helped. This is where the chain reaction of emotional turmoil begins.  3. Shawn Michaels lashes out verbally because he feels like Bryan is making a fool of him. No one else who cost Bryan the WWE Championship has done anything even close to apologizing, but Shawn felt like he was doing the right thing, and Bryan STILL acts rebellious when it probably wasn't called for.  4. Daniel Bryan lashes out physically, as I said (and I don't mean that sardonically), at the wrong person. Sure, Shawn said some things that maybe he didn't mean or at the very least shouldn't have said. But it appears that Michaels and Bryan are friends, or at the very least, have a close teacher/student relationship. It's not like Shawn is some random guy-- you'd think Bryan would have it in him to forgive him for everything from the superkick to the verbal tongue-lashing (which, again, was a result of Bryan's stubbornness).    to say that he humbled himself before Bryan, is, simply put, inaccurate.  The reason I agreed with HBK saying that he was humbling himself is because he was apologizing in front of millions of fans. Apologizing basically means "I was wrong. Please forgive me." Shawn Michaels is the legend of all legends. He could have attempted to save face, and not publicly admit that he significantly screwed up, by apologizing to Bryan in private, but he chose not to.   He basically told Bryan that he was not an "A+ player" and that he was not good enough to be in the ring with Shawn. That is not humble.  He only said that to Bryan after he had become frustrated with his attitude. You can't blame him. Sure, maybe Triple H and Stephanie have it out for him. Maybe Randy Orton isn't the rightful WWE Champion. Maybe all of those people hate Daniel Bryan and want to make his life miserable. Sure. But Shawn Michaels is not one of those people. As I said, his actions weren't out of spite or hatred. It wasn't Michaels lashing out at Bryan with the superkick as much as it was defending Triple H. Shawn would have kicked the hell out of damn near ANYONE had they done that to Triple H in front of him.  He was torn between his student and (metaphorically) his brother. That's an easy choice to make if you ask me.   I feel like this woman was probably a fan of the saying "Do as I say, not as I do."   As I said in the title, everything below is in kayfabe, even some stuff that is part of kayfabe and real life (like Shawn Michaels' rocky relationship with the WWF in the late 90s). I'd really like it to stay that way, if you guys don't mind. Please, no responses along the lines of "Because that's what the writers came up with," etc.  Now, in my opinion, it's obvious here that amongst the four people in the title, Daniel Bryan is the face, while Triple H and Orton are clear heels, and Shawn Michaels appears to be on his way or has already turned heel.  Michaels' pseudo-heel turn is what interests me the most. Shawn Michaels and Triple H are best friends in kayfabe. They're as close as the closest of brothers. So when Shawn Michaels saw Daniel Bryan assault Triple H (perhaps having NOT seen Hunter shove Bryan halfway across the ring), he reacted on emotion and retaliated with some Sweet Chin Music.  At that point, he probably realized that the decision was not the best one he could have made, but he also realized something else that was very important-- **the match was still going on, and he promised the fans that there would be a WWE Champion by the time the match was over.**  Orton took advantage of Bryan being laid out from the superkick and pinned him immediately. Michaels knew he had to count Bryan down or else he would have had to live with himself as having lied to the fans (or being mistaken, but he probably would consider that as bad as a lie).  The next night on Raw, Michaels explained to Bryan that he superkicked him because he felt the need to defend his best friend. HBK even explained why he reacted the way he did-- during Shawn's "darkest days" (when nearly the entire locker room hated him, he had severe drug issues, and he was just, simply put, an asshole), Triple H was the only person by his side. That is **extremely significant.** That type of loyalty (that Triple H showed) is the type you repay til death. Michaels probably feels like he owes Hunter his life, so the least he could do is come to his defense when he gets the sucker-punch equivalent of a hard knee to the face.  This, in my opinion, doesn't *justify* Michaels' actions towards Bryan at the end of the match, but it makes them understandable. Shawn Michaels brought up an aspect of his past that he probably doesn't like to talk about, just so Bryan could understand why he did what he did. He apologized, and offered Bryan a handshake. He refused.  At that point, Michaels got frustrated, understandably (in my opinion). He was correct in saying that he, Daniel Bryan's trainer, a Hall-of-Famer, and possibly the greatest wrestler of all time, humbled himself on international television and asked for only a handshake in return.  Shawn even did this, which may be me looking too much into this, but I can't help it-- **he took the Lord's name in vain** when he used the phrase "For the love of God!" after his emotions had overflowed.  I've followed Shawn Michaels' career extremely closely since his return in 2002, and I don't think I've EVER heard him do that during a promo, interview, etc (on WWE television). Shawn Michaels is very religious and very *serious* about his religion-- I doubt that he would do something like that unless he was extremely passionate about what he said, and more importantly, unless he meant it to the fullest possible extent.  Bryan's response? A feigned handshake whose only purpose was to set Michaels up to be locked in an extremely painful submission hold. Again, seemed (to me) to be the equivalent of a "sucker punch." Michaels could not have seen it coming and had almost zero chance of defending himself before the hold was applied.  In my opinion, Michaels was right that Bryan was being self-righteous and not showing Michaels the respect he deserved. Shawn Michaels did NOT do what he did at Hell in a Cell out of animosity or hatred-- he had neither towards Bryan (if anything, the complete opposite). He did it because in defense of someone for whom he'd probably take a bullet without hesitation.  Daniel Bryan apparently can't/didn't understand that, or has more anger issues than we realized (which is saying a lot).  Thoughts?      I'm looking at you, "Snickers wrapper for a condom" people.   I assume the male lion watches over the other cubs who aren't being moved?  I don't know anything about lion culture :-(   That is the most adorable goddamned thing I've ever seen in my entire life.   Maybe I shouldn't have used that exact phrasing. But, when observing and honoring the dead, they have parties and parades and whatnot. A lot of people in other cultures probably couldn't even imagine that on a day dedicated to those who have passed away.   Right, I wasn't saying that you should be offended by El Dia De Los Muertos, but just look at how their viewpoint is so much different from the typical American viewpoint. Some people would be extremely freaked out that people would actually have a party (in stark contrast to somber funerals which are the norm here) on behalf of the deceased.  Maybe this is his first time dealing with the death of someone close to him, and he never thought about the things you're saying.  And honestly, I'm not trying to condemn you or anything. I'm actually extremely intrigued by the dichotomy of the two contrasting mindsets here.    He should really put his hands on it like a grown up.  If by "it," you mean "his mother's body," you should reconsider. That would be EXTREMELY difficult for a lot of people. Two of the three people I was ever closest to (my mother and my cousin) both passed away in the last ten years. Each funeral was open-casket, but I never went in for the viewing. I couldn't bear it. I'm not even squeamish-- it just would have devastated me emotionally.  Now, that's just from a visual perspective. Imagine having to actually make physical contact with the body of a person you once loved, knowing that now it's nothing but a lifeless cadaver. Its nature and its lifelessness represents the fact that you will never, ever speak to this person or have them speak to you again. It represents their suffering, your suffering, and the suffering of anyone who will miss her.  The human body also loses body heat during death, which I'm sure you know. Touching the body of a deceased person, and feeling cold instead of warmth, would probably feel extremely eerie, since when you make physical contact with a living person, you can feel the warmth of their body. It would be spooky.  Like I said in another comment, I agree with what you're saying, but I don't think it's necessarily as black-and-white as you're implying.   I understand that what he said may have offended you (hell, it offended me a little bit, and I'm generally not like that-- maybe it's because I lost my mother at 13), but it might not just be that he's a disrespectful dick by nature. Maybe that's how they feel in the culture he's from.  A good example is the culture of some Spanish-speaking countries. They celebrate a day called Dia De Los Muertos (The Day of the Dead). They *celebrate* death. They don't look at it with the stigma and negativity that we do in America.  I'm not saying the OP is in that boat exactly, but maybe he just grew up learning that a person and the body that holds them are two completely separate entities and should be treated as such.  I guess maybe it's kind of like when someone passes away, and you don't know what to do with their belongings. You probably have to give them away or throw them out eventually, and that's not really viewed as being as bad as what OP said. But he (or she, I'm honestly not sure) might look at it the same way-- that his mother's body is merely her own property, and once she's done using it, it no longer represents her.  Know what I mean? I hope I explained that well. I just feel like, while I agree with what you say, it would help to try to think of what his thought process might be and maybe it might be a little more logical than you first thought.   I also love how Cole, earlier in the match, filled us in that Big E can't win the title if he loses by countout.  Thank you, Cole.   I think you did. But I don't know if I did.  Did I?   [Heels, faces, and Kane. Chokeslammed Miz for no reason after fighting off Rowan and Harper.](/spoiler)   "TURN ME AROUND!"   Thread title refers to the kickoff show, by the way.  ... this was a planned work, and it's because they fired the six people on the technical/production team (that Triple H talked about on SmackDown)?  Mind. Blown.   I've always wanted to wear a steel chain around my neck. For no reason other than the fact that I love the sound that thick chain-link steel makes when it rattles against itself.  But it's impractical. And kinda weird. The former, more than the latter, is the reason I don't do it. Or maybe the reason I haven't done it *yet*.      [additional generic positive reinforcement]!  Just kidding, bro. You're awesome for this. It's most definitely a step in the right direction. Overcoming depression is a journey, and a journey is a series of steps. This is a good first step.      I've been on public welfare for 2 years (and have been finding it extremely difficult to find work), and I rarely have any cash at all, and if I do, I can't spend it on pizza.   All I want is some pizza. Subsisting entirely on peanut butter sandwiches and tasteless cereal isn't fun. If anyone is generous enough to offer, I'll even reimburse you with interest when I get back on my feet.  Thanks.      Scumbag brain: Dude, don't listen to that first thought. You don't want to do anything. And if you try, I'll make you miserable.      Got any recommendations?   I like his character, but I just think he goes too far with it a lot of times. You can tell that JBL and Cole get into serious arguments about JBL not making sense or being biased, because Cole is annoyed.  Also, Cole sometimes has to talk over JBL to call the match. Color commentators don't call the match, but they're supposed to know when to shut up so the play-by-play commentator *can* call the match.   I agree that they can do whatever they like with their own life, but I wish suicidal people would have more faith in the fact that killing oneself is not the only way to end the pain.   I assumed that it would be more convenient, since the wireless network I have set up was on a Netgear router.  Or would I still be able to connect to that network with any brand of router?   Apparently, their football team is a fraud.      CBT = Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for those who don't know. I didn't know what it was until a week ago.  Anyway, I know that health care providers have a hotline, but I don't talk to anyone, so I generally don't even bother to buy minutes on my (pre-paid) phone. I'm not made of money as it is, so I try to save whenever I can.  Is there a website I can visit to find a CBT provider in my area that would be covered by my health insurance? I tried a Google search and couldn't find anything.  Thanks.   I think Account_Eliminator changed my original title (which was kinda long). I was gonna ask him about the name of the wiki being counterintuitive, but... I'm lazy.   These comments have taught me much about proper bacon preparation.  I thank thee, Reddit.   When you use the left click, Windows will decide for you whether it moves or copies, and sometimes, it doesn't choose the one you want, and you might not feel like going to the toolbar, selecting "Copy/Move to Folder," and then finding the destination you want.  Instead, just drag the file to another window exactly was you would with the left click, but use the right click this time. When you drag it and release the click, it will give you an option of "Copy Here," "Move Here," or "Create Shortcut Here."  Very handy, at least for me. I got sick of screaming "I DON'T WANT TO COPY IT, I WANT TO MOVE IT!" at my computer screen.   Isn't attempted suicide still technically considered a crime? I swear I heard that somewhere.      That's fair. I did want to make it clear that I don't know for sure, so I used the word "assume." People correcting me (no hard feelings to anyone) should realize that I'm not blind nor do I know anyone who is. So it was more or less an educated guess.  I can live with being wrong.   But those movies are actually professionally produced, aren't made up of 99% unrealistic dialogue, and are largely considered entertaining.  None of these applies to this rage comic.   Unless they're Matt Murdock   Not sure if implying cat is coworker.  If so... awesome.  If not... still awesome.   I get the feeling the OP watched the first 30 minutes or so of the Daredevil movie from 2003.    Not everyone who loses their sight has always been blind.  But the customer in the comic says that he's been blind since birth. "Seeing" should be completely foreign to him, and I assume he wouldn't use the word often, if ever.   Solution: Move to Hawaii and wake up drenched with sweat in the middle of December.   Uh... why would a blind person tell you "I don't **see** it"?   You're awesome.   You'd be doing me a favor tbqh.  Could you do your best to timestamp the videos to the time when the spot occurred, though?   But, simultaneously, she is much less likely to become mad with rabies.   http://data3.whicdn.com/images/23178357/homer-bush_large.gif  Question, though-- what are the rules regarding what's worthy of a Wiki and what isn't? I was gonna make another one for trivia of a certain wrestler; little things that I noticed about his character/history that I don't see people ever bring up.  Fair game?   Phew. I thought you guys were gonna come after me and break my kneecaps.  Seriously though, thanks for the heads-up.   I hope this type of post isn't against the rules. If it is, I apologize.  As for the Wiki, feel free to add to the list as you see fit-- adding/correcting listings, linking to videos of certain instances, etc.      It's definitely a thing. It's all a matter of where you live.  I hate when people say something "isn't a thing" just because it doesn't exist where they live. Your neighborhood isn't the entire planet.   I don't think he failed. Not being as popular in WWE as he was in WCW isn't a "failure."  He got more and more popular as time went on in WWE. The crowd was at least 50/50 against him at Backlash against The Rock, but then eventually he was very over.   An old wives' tale about how one could write something, print out a physical copy, and mail it to him/herself. This would allegedly be as good as an official copyright, and keep others from plagiarizing your work without ramifications.  I honestly can't remember why it was supposed to work.  **EDIT:** [Wikipedia explains it nicely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poor_man%27s_copyright)   The "poor man's copyright" myth.   _ Since when does anything in wrestling work the way it would in real life?  If you even look at a referee wrong in the NBA, you're gonna get thrown out of a game. Meanwhile, in kayfabe, WWE officials fear for their lives every time a heel gets a near fall.   That's another really good one. Honestly, a lot of Last Man Standing matches have had brilliant strategical finishes.   For those who don't remember/don't feel like watching, Vince McMahon put a clause in a PPV-match contract which stated that Triple H and Austin could not have any physical contact with one another until they met at No Way Out, or the instigator would be suspended for six months.  After both men went over the contract and signed it, Triple H beat the piss out of Austin, and everybody (including JR and King) was confused as hell as Triple H eventually laid out Austin with a Pedigree.  When Vince told him that he had just gotten himself suspended, Triple H revealed that he had never signed the contract (but Austin *had* signed), and thus Triple H was not legally bound by the "No contact" clause. On top of THAT, the fact that Austin had already signed meant that he could not retaliate against Triple H for the assault without being suspended.  Even Vince McMahon, the consummate evil genius himself, couldn't help but smile when he realized what Triple H had pulled off. "Cerebral Assassin" indeed.  This all led to Stephanie getting a Stunner the next week, but still. _      I think assaulting AJ would get him more pop than heat.    the fans on your laptop.  How do I do that?   Also, bring up device manager, and see if there are any yellow triangles beside anything  Only something called "Broadcom USH." Says drivers aren't installed for it.   My laptop fans or the fans on my cooler?   * [General computer specifications](http://2.imgland.net/zHOJep.png) * [Processor specs](http://2.imgland.net/VE9cpo.png) * [Graphics card specs](http://2.imgland.net/9qTfmE.png)  As you can see, the graphics card (which, having researched, I believe is notorious for overheating) all but flame broils my motherboard. Sometimes I want to watch movies or sports games on my laptop, but I can't, because it'll overheat to the point that the CPU Usage skyrockets to 100, and the processor struggles to perform simple tasks (much less play a video) until it cools down.  It doesn't just happen with 720p HD or higher. It'll struggle with 540p, or even 360p sometimes.  I clean the vents regularly, I have a laptop cooler that definitely aids in lowering the temperature (having noted the differences between using it and not using it, each for weeks at a time), and I still have this problem.  Is there anything I can do to make it so that I at least have a chance of getting through the first half of a basketball game without my laptop exploding?   What medication was it, if you know, that caused the cancer? I'm taking Pentasa and Omeprazole right now, and I just recently stopped taking Prednisone (it's a steroid, so they don't want people taking it long-term).   As someone who has Crohn's Disease, you have now officially scared the shit out of me.  Pun intended.   You sure the nostalgia of a Heyman/Van Dam alliance wouldn't garner some cheers?   Ah, that's the incident when he arrived at the PPV high as all hell, I assume.   Elaborate for those of us who don't watch TNA?   There are places you can download it after it airs (and you can even download SmackDown before it airs).   Just for clarification, everything here is occurring in the present. Current Rob Van Dam in current WWE.  Give it your best shot, r/SquaredCircle.   Will this stop random question marks showing up whenever I c/p YouTube comments into an AIM IM box?   Ah, okay. I understand.   I just purchased an Xbox Live Gold 48-hour code on eBay, and (in case you aren't aware) not leaving positive feedback for excellent service is strongly discouraged.  I didn't leave feedback despite getting the code within minutes of buying it, because I hadn't used it, since I was waiting for a friend to get his own Gold subscription. I explained this to the seller, promised to leave positive feedback as soon as I used the code, and he gave me a free one to use while I wait for my friend.  People are awesome sometimes.       Nowadays, I don't know how much unhealthy foods prevent people from having kids  No, not necessarily that, but cases where an unhealthy diet causes a person to die before they're able to reproduce.   I tried searching, and couldn't find anything on this sub.  Couldn't our taste buds have "evolved" to prefer foods that are good for us (vegetables as opposed to chocolate, for example)? The laws of nature state that a species which chooses to damage itself consistently (or cannot avoid doing so) isn't fit to survive, right? Wouldn't enjoying the taste of healthy food help ensure our survival?  It seems similar to a situation where a zebra wandered regularly into an area where a bunch of lions roam, for no reason other than that it enjoys being in that area. Eventually, after a whole bunch of zebras get mauled, the other zebras would get the idea, wouldn't they? They'd stop going there, they'd keep their offspring from going there so the species can continue on, etc.  I'm no biology expert, so if I have anything wrong, please feel free to tell me exactly what. Just be nice. Please?   That's goddamn amazing. At that point, I might consider those people more family than friends.   :-( Nope. The relationship (we were never official) lasted about 4 minutes. _  Obviously exaggerating :P, but yeah. She didn't feel like I was worth committing to, partly I guess because she didn't think we were compatible, and also because she was an extremely studious pharmacology major.  I don't resent her for it at all. I'm just a little upset I lost her. She was my dream girl, and I got her number accidentally.  That's like a downer ending to a bad romance movie.   I posted this a while back, but I love telling the story:  I worked at an "information desk" in a big building (basically a study/eating area for students, and a meeting place for the top university employees-- managers, execs, etc.) on a college campus about three years ago.  One day, an attractive young lady around my age asked me where the cookie shop in the building is. I directed her to it, and she thanked me.  After she left, I realized I should have made a move, and I hated myself for not doing so.  Then, I saw her later that day. I waved to her. She waved back and smiled. I motioned for her to come to the desk.  I asked her, plain and simple, "Could I call you some time?" She said sure and gave me her phone number.  One day while we were chatting about a week later, I asked her what kind of cookie she went to get the first time I saw her. She had no idea what I was talking about.  **Because she wasn't the same girl I had seen initially.**      My fave, that I heard recently:  "I'll be damned if I repent."      "I'll lay you out over some beef like sesame seeds."- Chamillionaire   I love you for getting the reference.   That must get boring.

That's tougher than looking before you sit!   _ At least if you don't look when you cross the street, a vehicle will usually stop before it hits you.  The toilet, however, gives approximately zero fucks.   And then even if I don't look, I check the seat with my hands (I know, gross-- I use soap when I'm done), and if I don't feel the seat, I don't sit.  There are lots of ways around this. You'd think women would be *better* at it since they always sit when they use the bathroom.      He was a face (I think-- I'm pretty sure he was still "The Viper"), and he was feuding with CM Punk. He came to the ring and the lights dimmed like they do for certain wrestlers' promos (The Rock, Kane, Undertaker, etc.). At that point, he cut a psychotic promo about, amongst other things, how CM Punk will sip his meals through a straw after Orton's done with him.  That's the only part I can distinctly remember. I'm also 99% sure it was on Raw. Does anyone have a link to the video of this promo?  Thanks.   The Celtics were terrible offensively and were almost just as bad defensively without Russell. I don't see how they could have possibly won without Russell unless there was a megastar in his place (and even then, they wouldn't win 11).   I assume that if people agree that Russell is GOAT-tier and Top 5/Top 3/whatever, they already know everything I'm going to post.   I wanted to know if people agree or not, and if they don't, I'd try to convince them.  Why the fuck would I waste 20 minutes composing a long post that (in the event that most people agreed with me) would essentially be saying "In my opinion, the sky is blue"?   The only reason I didn't write an entire CMV-like post is because I wasn't sure if it would be necessary, if people already agreed with me.   So if the rules change, you can't compare? That's just silly. Like I've said already, if you know enough about basketball, you'll know how to properly weigh the extenuating circumstances and judge a player properly relative to his era.  Russell played against worse teams/players, but accomplished things no one else ever will. Jordan's 6 Finals MVPs or five league MVPs or 10 straight scoring titles can or have been equaled/surpassed. I seriously doubt anyone is going to win 11 championship as the best player on his team, or have the type of defensive impact on the entire league that Russell did.   Enough what?  "Enough OP being open-minded and welcoming arguments and accepting that others feel differently"?  "Enough OP using facts to support his opinions"?  "Enough OP getting downvoted for no reason"?   Who the hell said you can't compare the games? I said I agree that they're NOT THE SAME.  Holy Jesus.   Have you seen the statistical defensive impact he had on the league, and more importantly, for his team?  Not only should the "In my opinion" fragment negate any thoughts of me thinking my argument is fact and indisputable, but if you look at the numbers, I'd say they favor "clearly has a case" more than not.   Make it clear for me? I just said that when you compare the 90s and the 60s, they're clearly not the same. When you COMPARE. I've also said, in many other comments, that it's very possible to compare across eras.  And I never said Russell was playing against "chumps." Again, I have said that he made Wilt Chamberlain look like a scrub compared to what the man was truly capable of.  Finally, Wilt Chamberlain was nowhere near Russell's level as a player. Only people who use stats and nothing else think that.  	170
 Yeah, I especially have a hard time with perception, I tend to fuck up bad on my personal relationships because of this.  And I have developed these fears over time, one lately happens to be opening my mailbox and getting some fucked up letter.   	1
 Good eye! It's probably not a coincidence either.   I think aquamarine would do well also.    Boodles, Noodlin? I especially like Noodlin.    Indeed he isn't. But still, that's gross..haha      The clothes look really good. Nice job!            [bending origins](http://www.fanfiction.net/s/3952682/1/Spirals_Beginning) this is a story that had an interesting idea to the origin of airbenders. There was a post here a few days ago      Since in the original series there was a representative from each bending discipline, do you think Jinora might join the group at some point? So far, we have three, all we need is an airbender. Right?   So you would learn martial arts, but it would be disguised as bending. Excellent!   Anyone love Ikki's response to Tarlock..always count on little kids to give an indicator of whether or not they're good. He seems like a scumbag   I have to agree with you. I think this is the case because we followed Zuko's progression as much as Aang's, but 1)Zuko went through more change personally which made him more appealing towards the end, maybe? 2) We all knew Aang would fight the Firelord; that was never a doubt. However, Zuko's fight with Azula was more uncertain throughout the series since Zuko's loyalties were in question all the time. So, it was more surprising I think when it came right down to it when it was time to fight her (not to mention satisfying to see her get her ass beat - the crazy bitch...). 3) Last thing is the personal aspect. They were brother and sister. They knew each other and had a connection through their shared past (twisted yes), but Aang and Ozai were not personally invested in their fight (yes, Aang probably was, but Ozai definitely was not).    It wouldn't be the first time he was accused of being magical      NOPE. NOPE NOPE NOPE.    tearbending...   I think it is well established that Korra has negative traits thus far. I read some interviews with the creators and they said that Korra was made to be quite flawed. Obviously this will lead to some serious character development. But to answer your question I think her positive qualities are determination and passion for the safety of her friends and the preservation of bending, and her best friend is her polarbear dog..that's gotta count for something, right? While she may be going about things the wrong way right now (three episodes in), I think she has good intentions and will find the right path.    We know that Sokka lost his sword in the final battle, but in Sokka's Master, he didn't use the whole meteorite when he made his sword, so he could have made another...right? Just speculation   poor unfortunate soul...  	22
 Don't blame yourself for only being able to afford to rent one bed in a shared flat. A lot of this problem is due to the society around us and is not of your doing. In the UK in the 1960-1970's a single labourer could afford a house for their family. They may also have scrapped by but they had more than many do now. That is not your fault. Now it takes two good salaries to have the same as my parents generation did. Again, this is not your fault and being angry about it is only a natural and rational reaction. I and many others are also angry about this situation. So much so in fact, that in Scotland where I live we just had a referendum to leave the United Kingdom. 45% of people hate the situation so much that they no longer want the political union. To me it sounds a little like you are in that group but don't realise how many other people feel like you do.   I had the same idea that women want that self-assured man with a good job. Many do but that is often because they can't see past the glossy images that the media sells them. Again this is not your fault. That however doesn't solve the issue of loneliness that maybe you have but it may help rationalise it.   Meeting a good partner is hard and you may need to turn over many rocks to find the diamond. Your lack of experience could actually be a selling point. My partner is impossibly jealous at even the slightest hint that I had a past relentionship - regular arguments for 4 years. I actually think this is inbuilt into many people. That makes you a catch as any partner would not have anyone to be jealous of! I like Star Trek and in one episode the chief engineer says "Their is no roller-coaster as bad as marriage". I know it is impossible without the experience for you to make a good comparison but many people feel trapped in their relentionship. They would often like to be in the position you are - single; however that is only possible to really understand with the benefit of having been in a relentionship.   When I was in your position I met a woman. After I got to know her she said I was literally shaking when I first met her and she thought it was cute. The relentionship didn't work out but it shows hows odd things can sometimes work in your favour.  "barely able to function in a world full of people doing adult things" - I think that adults only look like adults because they are taller than children. I think that people look different than how they feel. That means that other people see you as an adult even though you don't feel like one. In return you see them as adults even if they don't feel like one! The saying is "The only difference between men and boys is the size of their toys".  Many people don't know what they want and all you can do is try something and see if it fits you.      Nope, your not retarded. Your story shows that you can communicate well and as Followingtom says you are a hard worker and generous to your family. That is a quality to be proud of and a good woman will realise that.  It seems that you stayed so that you could talk to this girl. I am 44 but at your age I often tried to get to know girls in a similar, subtle way to you. In my experience it doesn't work. You need to ask them out. Maybe you can think of it as going out with a friend rather than a date. After all most good relationships between couples are actually just good friendships that eventually go a stage further.   Once you know if she likes you then you are more in control of your life. If she doesn't then you wouldn't need to do the overtime any more. If she does then you can skip the overtime and spend time with her instead.   I liked a girl and I was down the pub with her and a few friends when I was about your age. I loved her eyes and and while keeping my eyes firmly fixed on the TV due to embarrassment I said 'Wow - nice eyes!'. She thought I was talking about the TV and not her and I didn't have the courage to tell her - even more silly was that I knew she liked me! That was an opportunity missed and I never spoke to her again. I wonder what my life would have been life? My point here is make a decision to either ask her out or not. That way you won't have the regret of not trying.  Some people have rules that they won't ask a work colleague out as it could cause difficulties. That is fine as well. It will take guts to ask this girl out if that is what you want to do. You just need to decide how you want to play it.   Maybe you could find some other activities as well. Do any of the sports centres have activities you could engage in? Maybe a local cycling group, board game group, martial arts, guitar lessons or even night classes. You may meet people there that you would make friends with and through them you could meet more people.    Having a pact with your friend sounds like a good idea. I like walking and often go on my own. I use the time to rant about all my problems and how much I hate other people. Can you still go on the walk and talk to yourself? I do it all the time. I imagine that I am talking to the people I know while I walk. I use their voice in my mind to keep the conversation going. If you do that then maybe you can tell your friend about it. You could tell your friend that you enjoyed the walk with them even though they weren't there. Maybe it will cheer them up and make them laugh - they can comment that it should be you in the psych ward and not them! It you make them laugh then you will have done something good.   Regarding the problems interacting at the party, don't be to hard on yourself. I spent years with people who didn't like me. I wasn't very good at talking in groups bigger than 1 other person. I was good at the skill set that brought us all together though and I don't think they liked me for that while at the same time being socially unskilled. The point is that there will always be people who you don't get along with - that is their problem and not yours. It could also be that they are also struggling with something.   My best advice regarding conversations is to speak your mind. I don't mean to say 'I want to kill myself' to a stranger. I find that in a conversation it goes like:  Person1: hey how are you? You: Good you? person1: I'm good  at this point your mind is either blank or you can only think of silly things to say. If your mind is blank then try to grab something, anything at all!  You: You look happy Person1: Er ... lol, yea sure You: How come? Person1: It's a party and I get to drink! You: Yea, drink helps me forget about work. Person1: What do you do?  and there's your entry into a conversation. From nothing to something silly/embarrassing ('You look happy') to a personal conversation about what you do.  For me this was a difficult thing to learn. Conversing is a skill like any other. The person you spoke to ended up walking away anyway so what have you got to lose by saying something stupid?   I hope that your friend gets better soon, and just because they aren't here doesn't mean you can't imagine talking to them while you walk. I also hope that I wasn't teaching you to 'suck eggs' with the conversation pointer. Apologies if so but then I figure that any conversation is better than none!   Try to remember that this is the hardest time of year for many of us. The expectations of being happy and enjoying the festivities can be over whelming. I don't know if it is true but someone told me recently that Christmas was the time of year with the highest suicide rates. If you can hang on a little longer then the festive 'fun' will be over and forgotten. I think there are more people feeling the way you do that you realise, they just don't say it. I hate this time of year myself and also struggle with it.  So many people say New Year is time for a new start. It isn't. It is just another day in a continuum but with added pressure forcing us to show pretend happiness. I expect that most of the people filled with joy are actually pretending. They will get back to their reality shortly and the forced pressure to enjoy this time of year will be gone. Maybe that will ease your burden a little if you can hang on for just a while longer.   I don't know what country you are in but organisations in the UK like the Samaritans are trained to listen. Even if you just phone such a group and hang up without speaking you can look at that as a first step and congratulate yourself that you have done something very difficult. If you can say hello to them, even better! They will probably start the conversation with you. Don't worry about making a mess of such a call, they are not there to judge you and they exist only to listen to people who are desperate. The Samaritans are volunteers and are there because they want to help. You won't be putting them out or wasting their time.   I used to when I was younger but it has changed now. For me the problem with living at night was that it was impossible to hold down a job in my area of expertise. This is the reason that I am always trying to sleep only at night.  I also found it also makes having friends difficult as they are on a different schedule. I found that it also gets very lonely (and sometimes cold if you can't afford heating) at night when there is no-one else about.  I haven't managed to succeed yet but I try to stay in a 'normal' routine now. Sometimes I get lucky and can hold it for a month or so before it it gets difficult. I then have to 'reset' things to a 'normal' pattern which is very annoying and sometimes difficult.    I was 27 when I first went to the doctor and I also agree with the others.   You need to tell the doctor the truth about what you are going through or it will reduce the changes of getting good help. It is difficult and embarrassing to talk to a complete stranger but remember that they are trained to give support to people in your position or refer you to someone that can. You are not the first to go to the doctors and discuss such issues and hopefully the doctor will understand that you are struggling. I would expect that doctors have learned to be non-judgemental of their patients so try not to worry about what they think of you. I have been in tears in the doctors office before now when I was finding things difficult but that doesn't matter to me now. If they don't try to help you then it doesn't matter what they think as they are a bad doctor, if they do help you then it won't matter that you were embarrassed. Maybe you would find taking a friend with you who understands a little about what you are going through useful.   If you have the energy then I would also advise reading up on how others have tried to help themselves. The doctor will do their best but in the end you are the one who is most interested in getting better. Personally I find that high dosages of magnesium are often helpful in elevating my mood. I have a theory as to why here http://goo.gl/C0nbY3 (increases neurons and the binding strength between those neurons and serotonin). It isn't 100% effective but it seems to help significantly.  I am also using L-Tryptophan (serotonin facilitator) and I am experimenting with CBD (Cannabidiol). They are all available from health food stores and Amazon.  Regarding meeting new friends then maybe there is a local activity group that you could join? meetup.com is the website that I use and it allows me to physically meet people who have similar interests. In fact without that site I would have no friends.     I agree with mylittletarget.   Don't beat yourself up to much about what you can't do. Give yourself permission to take time out for yourself. Give yourself the time to begin to get better even if progress is very slow. I just took two months off and am just today starting to think about getting back into my usual routine - you aren't alone in feeling the way you do even though it sucks to be there right now. Sometimes life will throw you a curve-ball and all you can do is go with the flow. Don't compare yourself to others because they probably don't have your problems.   If this is a recurring issue then think back to the times this happened before. Realise that eventually things did get better last time and maybe they will this time as well.   Maybe try to give yourself only one task a day or even every other day. Maybe it is going to the shops, doing the laundry or even just having a shave/wash. These things can seem like mountains at times. When going up a mountain it is best to go slow in order to conserve the energy you have. Give yourself permission to treat yourself if you can, a double treat if you accomplish your task for the day - maybe an extra chocolate bar without feeling guilty.  I am being presumptuous but it sounds like maybe your were raised by foster carers. Could you find a forum and read about how others have coped with the issues you are having? Knowing that you are not the only person who has faced this problem can be a useful perspective to have. Maybe finding people who discuss similar issues to yours can be one of your tasks for the day.  Good luck.   Thanks for all of the great replies. There is a lot more to mining that I had initially anticipated and your answers have helped clear my head. It is much appreciated.   Thanks for the reply Scrapper89.  When I first started looking into this the DRK calculator was giving returns of about 300 coins annually. The last few days it has been suggesting returns of about 190.  As I could pick up 150DRK for about £1,000 and that is the same as the cost of the rig then the trouble to set it up should be for fun and learning rather than profit.  Increasing the block reward from 5 to 12 increases the annual return from 190DRK to 458DRK. That return would certainly make it worth the effort. However:  http://drk.poolhash.org/graph.html  Suggests that the average reward to date looks like 8-ish. With a 7% block reward reduction occurring in 9 months (?) time I assume I could expect the reward to be down to about 4. If so then that gives a reward average over the next 9 months of about 6. For the rig I am thinking about then that would return about 175DRK over the next 9 months - and then a serious decline. Have I got that right?     	9
 I took it for a small number of months as well... Now I feel trapped in a fog of apathy.  Withdrawal was awful but I knew that the medication was doing nothing but poisoning me.  My father is a retired physician (cardiologist) and I must say that having some of the "most accurate" knowledge of Western medicine at one's fingertips is not always such a blessing.  If anything, the few psychotropic drugs I have tried—zoloft (sertraline), celexa (citalopram), and effexor (venlafaxine)—have done nothing but worsen my apathy and general desire to stop living.

 The scissor scene at the end is what got me   Das the stuff maine, das de stuff   I think its totally legit dood   I might sound stupid, but Le Interieur (probable typo there) really got me, I wasn't scared but I had this gut wrenching feeling after I watched it.  Also A Serbian film, sweet baby Jesus was that creepy   Oh yes, that scene haunted me for quite a time, after watching it I had the most unsettling drive back to my apartment.   Nailed it, Dany is quite unlikable because she gets what she wants because of Dragons and hot male fighters who are willing to do anything for her.     lol, sorry im not a movie critic   I didn't like it at all! It wasnt a good remake IMHO and it was dumb, quarantin 2 was even worse.  Then again everyone is entitled to like different things    Ahhh, I was confused then since the two movies happen in the same exact building   Arent you supposed to be studying Sam?    Wat  	11
 I don't know the lore but here is a [link](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Steel_(Midwest) ) about the MW BoS, of which I would try and be a part of, living in Missouri!:D   What was their fireteam name before(assuming they become S-IV's) they would have joined SpOps?      Technically, that whole team could actually come back as S-IV's. Rookie would probably be a last choice. Romeo and Dutch would be among the first.   Okay so I finally got bored of my Xbox Fallout NV so I downloaded a few mods for my PC FNV and it's already 1000x better than Xbox. Now, because I don't own a mouse, I use my Afterglow Wired 360 controller. Alot of the time before I start adventuring, I will tdm for shits and giggles. My only problem with this is, I have to unplug my controller, type it in, and the plug in my controller again. Sometimes however, the controller f***s up and I have to restart everything. I really hate forgetting to turn it on cause of my controller and then dying at an inopportune time and not having quicksaved. Anyone know a mod or how to fix?  TL;DR Is there any way to use keyboard and controller at the same time?   This belongs in wtf or lolwtf haha   I was going to but you called the Forward Unto Dawn the Pillar of Autumn. Pillar went down in Halo 1 there bud.   lol you go /u/OpTic_Niko I work at a small hometown game store and we sell the figurines for Used $3.50 and New varies. I generally wait for people to bring them back in or for my paycheck. And as it stands, my collection is still VERY small being only 4 characters lol   Top Picture: So there I was, saving Deputy Beagle from the Bison Steve on my PC for the first time and BAM, THERES TWO OF HIM?! lol I rescued both and that was even more interesting      This honestly was the main reason I got Honest Hearts. I saw this one time on my quest to get all of the uniques and I was so excited to get it cause it was lore rich which I love.   Child Killer. Just because.   **EDIT**:Because the bullet system fails for me changing this up a bit.  **1:**A USB version of the chip Chief is holding in the "Halo 5" teaser (AKA [this](http://pxlbyte.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/halo-5-1000x561.png)).  **2:**A flat-bill hat with an orange or black Mk. VI visor on the front decal area.  **3:**A keychain Monitor with light up center.  **4:**(I know its really far fetched and actually has been produced but) A lifesize Mongoose.  **5:**Nerf Battle Rifle and SMG or Nerf Energy Sword.   Agreed. I had never heard of this till now.   Is it the first mission or the city? Some people get these confused very easy. The first mission is Dare's crash site. The first "mission" is walking around in the city. If all else fails however, you might have to delete the save.   I will be getting on later today and I have a few friends and we would be more than willing to help.   When you finish, please message me. I run /r/ODST and I'd be more than happy to add this on there.   eBay or etsy   Better than anything I could do. Visor center is a bit too far to left but everything else looks fine   Which op was it that Lucy and (I can't remember names to save my life) were the only two alive and her last words before PTVD set in where "How do you know we're not dead? Like this is an honest question      Is it just a random give? Whoever happens to be chosen?   Mid-west= NOT FUCKING MANY   I can imagine the Truman would dry up or be supremely radiated but the woods around would be ingenious to hide it. I agree on the small town raiding but theres not too many small towns I think you could hit and run. I know a few 1000 pop. towns nearby but still.   Vault 42. Everyone would fight over glow sticks lol   Yeah! I thought about it for my state as well cause I live near (within 100 miles) of Whiteman AFB which would be a major target considering thats where ALL the Stealth Bombers come out of. But yeah, the enemy wouldn't just attack the populace cause if they forget the military, we can counter. They don't want that. So they wipe out the populace AND the military and they have it pocketed.   I live in Missouri(middle of the US) so I would probably haul ass to either Columbia, a college town no doubt infested with either chem fiends or survivalists, or to St. Louis for survival. I should go to say, St. Louis would probably be a target considering it is a symbol of American progress and freedom.   With Texas having a good amount of military bases in it, It would be the target of at least 1-3 nukes. Mostly in populace centers like Houston, Austin, and San Antonio. I don't think it would have been ungodly damaged but there would be quite a dent in the main places.   Y'know, it's little things like this that I hate for making me feel stupid. I guess I never noticed the zip. In all my damn days, how I didn't notice that I will never know. Thank you! Now I can start running FNV on my laptop again.    When I download it, its always in the wrong file format. I'll try again with it. And I'll check that.   I HATE NVSE. Everytime I download or try using it, it never works right and its just. Arg.and I run 4 GB of RAM (3.61 Usable)   Oh I'm sorry. I didn't realize we were having a pissing contest.   Okay, so I have had New Vegas on my laptop for quite sometime but never played more than 15 minutes because it is just so ungodly slow. So, being the Fallout geniuses you are, maybe a few of you could help! General stuff about my computer: Windows 7, Dell, I also have Skyrim, Fo1, Fo2, FoBOS, Amnesia, Arma 2 OA and a few other minor games. Running no mods on the game yet.  Any help would be wonderful!   UPDATE: Thanks to /u/croock3 suggestion of windowed, I can run as smooth as Xbox. Also, wouldn't run right because of wrongly installed mods.   Marksman Carbine and All American are perfect duo's.   Thanks! lol so far it has been. My cake day isn't for another ~7 months but birthday still counts!   Was it possibly in /r/fo3 or was it for sure here? I will start going back as far as I can!       I would love to do this! I have a clip of a double kill with spartan laser on my file share!    I get more than agitated when all that litters the floors of the maps are BR's. Literally, the only thing everyone is using. I've had a few deaths I wanted to go back to check just because every shot some people had seemed to always be headshots. Watching a few, you'd swear there were aimbots(I know theres not. 1/15 shots would miss.) Either way, I can't wait till next week when it's not as big a deal that BR is everything cause next week is SWAT which I am okay with.   Yeah, but having parental permission isn't!:D   I knocked my two long Vidmasters out of the way (Endure and Annual) and both took me 90-120 minutes which was more time then I want to admit I've spent on any video game.

I will post a few in the comments to show what I mean:) Thanks to all who help!   Well, I formally apologize now. I have honestly never seen nor experienced this but I had heard it before and was also told that it was a glitch. Sorry!   Alright, scoured some forums. Not a mod, not a reward, just a plain ol' glitch. [Sauce](https://forums.halowaypoint.com//yaf_postsm833620_posts.aspx)   I have never heard of this. Now I have something to look into. I'm assuming still that it has to do with bungie day or something of those reaches.   Don't listen to him. What /u/PseudoArab said is correct because I even have one. There was an ODST one, Halo 3, CE, and Marathon(?). You got them for, as he said, linking with Bungie. Each required something. Quite a few people still have them.   UNSC. Most, If not all of the UNSC's ships were suited for battle. Now I can't talk for Star Fleet so I will let a trekker take that one for me.   That just has creepy written all over it. Noping out of that one.   If you could give me samples for my sub /r/ODST that would be wonderful and I would get back to you as soon as possible.   This was before the Arbiter had turned on the Prophets. Also, before he was even the Arbiter. Most of the Covenant that were left on Reach by the time of Six's death were just there to glass and finish it off. While Six did go out with a bang, it's highly improbable he is still alive.   Troop4921 its in the description.   Says you don't exist.   Thanks. I'll boost DLC doubles cause that requires the least players.   I think in about 15 minutes I'm jumping back on and working on DLC   I vaguely remember the MC+Cortana mission.   This is the only training exercise I honestly remember. I mean there was the one where Kelly killed her trainer from the Reach LE packet but this was always a favorite. It goes to show that he does have a heart and wouldn't let bad befall any of his troops.  	57
 I can relate, The Office quotes make up probably 25% of the words that come out of my mouth... Nobody ever gets it. Ever. My head is filled with inside jokes and ridiculous sayings that only I get    I misread the title as "soup" and was so confused upon reading this comment   Eats the rice...   The fact that there are so many experiences and people and opportunities out there waiting for me in the future.    Empty febreeze bottle. I would use the trigger to gauge ones eyes out, and then once I'm finished stick the end of the spray nozzle into their brain through the mauled eye socket. I would then begin squeezing until brain fluid and matter begins spraying out of the nozzle. I'm not sure how efficient this murder would be but I'm positive it would be extremely painful.    Hypocrites. Which is hypocritical, considering I can be a hypocrite occasionally. I guess I'm my #1 pet peeve.    What helps me is the idea that we were put here for a  purpose. We  were meant to live, and every day has the potential to better your life. Being depressed is not your purpose in life, it is merely a problem. And every single problem we face is given to us to we can learn and grow from it. There are many many things on this earth that you will never learn, see , or experience if you end your life.  Stay strong, and remember that this disease is not all you are. 3   Simply apply lotion and rub. Boom, no more sticky fingers :-)  	8
 Income equality doesn't mean both the CEO and the cashiers make the same amount. It means their income goes up the same amount.  If the CEO sees a 5% increase in pay, so should the cashiers. If only people at the top see their incomes go up, the people at the bottom have to make do with less and less. More money ends up in the hands of the richest people.    Do Reddit liberals in /r/politics honestly think Bernie Sanders can win a national election?  No, but I'm voting for him anyway in the primaries.   FMU?   I have never seen an issue so perfect to be neutral over.   DNA tests not done by professionals are inadmissible in court.  Even if the father can't get a DNA sample from the child, he can still request that the courts order one if he has reason to believe he isn't the father.   USA, Ohio.  Not comfortable giving county. I never get any more specific than state online.  This was also back in the late 80s.   I just looked at my birth certificate. Both of my parents' signatures appear on it. They were also unmarried at the time.   To be fair, is it really pocket money if you're ordered to only spend it on food? That's not what pocket money is.   I refuse to buy jeans anywhere but Goodwill. $6 jeans, yeah!   Months? Eww, eww. I wear jeans for two days tops before washing them.   True, but if you want to know before your missed period, a more expensive one with a sensitive hcg reading is a must.    Suave gives me a horrible rash though.   I bought my purse for $4.50 at Goodwill.   My hair would be a mess of grease.    Depends on the food item.   If you can prove via DNA shortly after birth before you sign the birth certificate that you aren't the father, you're off the hook.   You only might be ordered to pay child support if you acted the role of a father towards the child for a period of time, even if it isn't yours.   Not sure what Vasegel has to do with it, unless you know you can't be the father because of it. That would prompt you to order a DNA test.   Several breeds have been raised as food forever, such as the Nureongi. They were *always* food in Korea.   What do you mean?   You can lose everything even if you have insurance.    He seems to be doing okay. He's quickly gaining on Hillary in the polls.  Sadly, I don't see Sanders getting the nomination, but many Americans like him.   Why?   Dogs are considered pests that over-breed and cause havoc in many places. India is one.   Even if it was 100K years ago, humans evolved to be the way we are now long before dogs evolved. We created them, but we didn't evolve with them. Our evolution was already "done" before we created dogs.  Also, we didn't create dogs to be our pets. We created them as work animals. Some people back then may have viewed them as pets, but overall they were work animals, not companions.    Damn. Where do you live?  My cat had that issue more than once (plus an extended vet stay each time) growing up and I'm pretty sure it didn't cost nearly that much because if it did my parents would have just put him down.     My cat ate the cheapest shit you could find (my parents were responsible for buying her food from early on since I got her when I was a kid, and by the time I got old enough to afford to buy her food she wouldn't touch anything but the stuff she ate for years) and she lived to be 18.  She never visited the vet except for routine stuff.  I'm sure this isn't the norm, but it happened. My new kitten gets better food.   Tampons and pads.  But I use a cup now, so it's moot.  Also: Tide laundry detergent (smells so good and cleans so well), shower supplies   Falling and hitting my head.   We all know SRS's feelings about a "financial abortion" option for men. Their argument is that women are just exercising their rights over their bodies, but men are abandoning their children.  Okay, let's say that someday artificial uteruses become possible. Fetuses can be easily transplanted from a real uterus to an artificial one in a lab. Let's say abortion is still contested in many places and personhood amendments are still being pushed.   As a compromise it's suggested that abortion be made illegal, but transplanting fetuses into an artificial womb is made free and is easily attained. Even publicly funded. Pro-life people get their way (no more murdering babies, as they see it) and women still have complete control over their bodies.  Now, once the fetus becomes full term three things can happen. One: Both parents sign it out and assume responsibility. Two: Both consent to adopting it out. Three: One parent signs it out, and if the other doesn't want to, they're ordered to pay child support to the parent who takes custody.  This makes it possible that both men and women might end up being financially responsible for a child they didn't want and never had any way to escape paying for it for 18+ years once conception happened.   Now, the fun part: What's SRS's reaction to this proposed law?  "OMG, men are always wanting women to assume the role as mothers no matter what else she wants to do with her life!"  "I know, now women might end up not reaching their full potential as members of society because they have the responsibility of paying for a child they didn't consent to."  "Doesn't anyone in this patriarchy care that some women who were raped might end up paying child support to her rapist?" (The way SRS currently doesn't care if this happens to men)  "Of course, now we're back to parenthood by chance, not by choice. We're always taking choices away from women."  "What if a man intentionally gets a woman pregnant so she has no option but to pay him to support a child he wants but she doesn't? Does the woman have no recourse?"  For the record, I'd be against such a law. I don't think anyone should be made to be a parent if they don't want. But we all know what SRS would do. Have fun!   Many musicians have done their best work while stoned, so is music a crappy thing to study?   I think the joke is that being drunk tends to make you more insightful in some ways, like being high.   I was mocking them.   Pigs tend to be smarter than dogs. Do you eat pork?   Mice are self aware. Is it wrong to kill one?   As someone who has kept chickens, they can and do form bonds with humans.   Dogs evolved 34K years ago at the earliest. Humans have been around for over 200K years. We were around for quite a long time before they were.  Many cultures ate them then too.    ...and?   http://www.thelocal.se/20130110/45536   Rape is a first world problem.   "Meh" on progress!   Any man who's been raped. Doesn't matter by who.   Family planning is part of that "don't breed them" plan.   People under 18 have no representation in government. It's reprehensible to discriminate against them like that when they have no recourse.  If they're working a job, they deserve the same pay everyone else working that job gets.   People under 18 deserve the same amount others are making for the same job.  It's extremely shitty to do that to a group of people who have no representation in government anyway.   Same for me.   Having sex.   Why?   Is it okay to cut a cat's fur with scissors if the cat is dead?  Because my cat was dead when I did. *sniff*   Damn nature you scary.   But I failed kindergarten (reading skills were bad) so add six to mine.   I've have a little more respect for women's studies if it actually taught critical thinking and reasoning skills. Instead it seems to turn out SRS-like people.   You claim talking about it on a private subreddit is bullying, if we mentioned it to your faces you'd *really* complain about bullying.   Actually, yes, all Muslim countries that circumcise girls also circumcise boys.  There's only one place where only one gender is circumcised...the west. And Israel.    They aren't oppressive at all if it's what you want. Women can make decisions without it being social conditioning.  I'd *love* to be a housewife. I hate working a job and find housework much less miserable. I'd even be okay with my husband being in charge to go along with it because I don't care much about making those decisions either.  The less complicated my life is, the better. It has nothing to do with my gender. If a man wanted to be a househusband for the same reasons, I wouldn't blame him.    I also hate that all the women's subreddits are a huge pro-choice circlejerk, and anyone who has anything to say other than "abortion yaaaaay you go gurl" gets downvoted to hell. Not all women think abortion is the bees knees; everyone should get a say.  I'm pro-choice, but this is why I think the argument that, "If men could get pregnant, abortion would be in the Constitution" is the biggest load of bullshit I've ever heard. Not everyone who is against abortion just wants to control women.   Why? I never got the point of make-up.   Which could very easily be the entire reason she was decapitated. If you can't ID the victim, you aren't going to find the guilty party.   I sometime fantasize about punching people that I hate.  I'm obviously dangerous and a psycho.   The thought of something being shoved into my cervix...*twitch*   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis_Jane_Doe  The St. Louis Jane Doe is an unidentified girl who was found murdered on February 28, 1983 in St. Louis, St. Louis County, Missouri. She has also been nicknamed "Hope" and the "Little Jane Doe."[1] The victim was estimated to be between eight and eleven when she was murdered, presumably by strangulation. The victim had also been decapitated and raped; the brutality of the crime has led to national attention.  Reading about how [Vernon Brown](http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/brown967.htm) killed his victims, I believe it's very possible she was one of his victims.  This case has always got to me because I always have a hard time understanding how a child goes without being identified. To think she might not have had family looking for her.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzNt6YfGNX4  Here is a video that shows the only photo I know of of the body. It isn't graphic, it's only a photo of her hands tied behind her, but  knowing the context makes it 100X worse.   Can't she take in sewing or washing?   I dislike being naked.   IUDs sound horrible.    I'm just always so flabbergasted when people who are doing things they're not into feel the need to tell me my way is bad or selfish or unfair or THE LITERAL WORST.  I give blowjobs even though I dislike them and the fact that you don't...totally doesn't interest me.    That I'm not allowed to request or receive sex while I'm asleep.  This too. It drives me nuts. I told my boyfriend he's allowed to have sex with me when I'm asleep, drunk, high, whatever. I don't care. And he has. Every single time I mention it here, a few people at least always insist I've been raped. Rape is sex without consent. I gave consent long before when I said it was okay with me.  If I don't care, why do you? If I did start caring, I'd say something to him.   Getting your underwear in a twist over gendered insults.   Are you aware that men get paid more than women?  On average. Not for the same job.  Are you aware that the work women do is consistently devalued not just on the individual level but on a massive scale that sees industries start to pay less and less as women take more and more jobs in them?   Citation needed.  Are you aware that computer programming as an industry gained not just prestige but MASSIVE wage increases when men began to move in and take the jobs that were previously held by women?  Citation needed.  Are you aware that there’s a huge wealth gap between men and women?  23 cents on average. And not for the same job.  Are you aware of the pink tax,  whereby products intended for women consistently cost more than products intended for men despite costing the same to produce and despite women as a class having far less money than men as a class?  Products for women tend to have more going on and cost more to make. But we all know women are so brainwashed and helpless they can't just buy the men's products, right?  re you aware that women are socially sanctioned for not owning a wider selection of clothes than men, and that women’s clothes are more expensive?   Have you ever seen what a man's suit costs? Also, thrift shops have a lot of clothes for women and not much for men. My wardrobe cost a lot less than my boyfriend's.  Are you aware that women are socially sanctioned for not wearing makeup, something else that costs a lot of money, or shaving much larger parts of their bodies than men, which causes us to go through our (more expensive) razors/razor blades faster than men?  I have never worn make-up and I have never heard anything about it. Also, I know of no job that isn't sex related that requires women to shave. Jobs that require men to shave? Quite a few.  Are you aware that women’s hygeine products are more expensive and that we’re socially sanctioned for not having long hair, something that requires, again, specific and frequently expensive products to upkeep?   I know of no job that requires women to have long hair. However, many jobs require men to have short hair. My boyfriend had to cut his long, beautiful hair because of this. Also, many hygiene products are unisex if you think women's are that expensive.  Are you aware that these social sanctions don’t end with social ramifications, but can actually make the difference between a woman getting hired, fired, or getting a pay rise, because women who don’t perform femininity in socially accepted ways are considered less “professional”?  Citation needed.  Are you aware that in order to have sex without ending up solely responsible for a child, women who are capable of pregnancy pay huge amounts of money for birth control and/or abortions, which aren’t covered under many insurance policies while the pills cis men need to get erections is covered much more often?  Because court mandated child support no real! A woman will always end up solely responsible! Also, aren't birth control pills required to be covered now as part of Obamacare? As for expensive abortions, that really is an issue.   Are you aware that a man is more likely to be hired if potential employers know he has children, but that a woman is less likely to be hired if potential employers know she has children?  Which is why employers can't legally ask this question.  Are you aware that women have much less available money because we start off being paid less by our jobs and we’re expected to pay more as the rent for existing in the world as a woman?  See above refutations.   Are you aware that despite all this, not all feminists expect men to pay for our meals on a date? Are you aware that not every feminist is even interested in dating men? Are you aware that not every woman is a feminist, and the women you’re dating aren’t automatically trying to abolish gender roles just because they’re women?  Listen here why I list reasons you should pay for my food because I have no money while I insist some feminists don't want men to pay for their food (which is true).  Are you aware that you are looking at a population of people who face significantly higher rates of harrassment, abuse, and rape  Men are far more likely to be victims of assault and homicide, but when is that ever mentioned among these people? They only mention it when women are more likely to have something bad happen.  a population who is paid less and expected to pay more, a population who is tightly restricted by gender roles that expect us to do unpaid emotional and domestic labour for men like you who see it as your due  Because men don't do housework ever.  and your first fucking question is why our very top priority isn’t making sure you don’t have to pay a little extra on a goddamned date?  "Pay for my food, damn it! I'm oppressed!"     What's wrong with this quote, exactly? He's just saying if enough people don't like Reddit's changes, they'll find something better and Reddit will go under eventually.  Pao's rule goes, but she has to keep her users happy to stay successful.   The last thing I want is to tell people in dangerous jobs its okay to get high at any time if their job is dangerous, at home or at work  How is their being high at home dangerous at all no matter what their job is? They aren't doing their job from home. As long as they don't go into work under the influence, I don't care.   If you come to a dangerous job hungover, they usually send you packing. Same should go for weed, legal or not.  But you aren't fired Monday because of a can of beer you had Friday after work. You shouldn't be fired Monday because you had a joint Friday night. That's none of your boss's business.  If you come to work hungover on anything, you should be fired. But just because you partake when you're off work doesn't mean you come in high or hungover. Hell, I got drunk last night. But I wasn't drunk or even hung over coming into work today.   Yes, and for the most part I see nothing wrong.   Who mentioned forced abortions?   It's referring to a "financial abortion" which would have to be decided very early in the woman's pregnancy.   A man wouldn't be able to suddenly walk out while the woman is giving birth.      You can accept that someone is circumcised and still think it's mutilation.  My boyfriend is circumcised. I pay plenty of attention to his penis and we have fun with it, but I still think it ought to be illegal to do it to a child for any reason other than medical.   Every single developed country besides the USA has mandated sick leave, and businesses still exist and do well.   Here I am, sitting in America, with no paid sick leave.   Because in countries with a high minimum wage due to collective bargaining, we see mostly automation, right?  There's no employees to be seen in any McDonalds in Sweden!   I have to say this is in a large part true, but that doesn't really mean anything. You still have to care for people even if they require more than they give. It's part of living in a society.   Why?   The boss doesn't have to give 12 weeks off. Just one unpaid day to give birth is mandated.   They have to give you one unpaid day to give birth.   Drugs.  The doctor gave me wonderful fast-acting pills.   Nope. No mandated vacation time in America. Your boss doesn't have to give you any time off.   Unfortunately, the 1st amendment specifies religious freedom. So, these fundamental bigots can write their bigotry into law.  The 1st amendment species religious freedom for individuals. The Establishment Clause makes it unconstitutional to put religion into law.   I'd have been so tempted to push that guy over.   Couldn't social conditioning have anything to do with it? Women have always been told it's best they stay at home with the kids and the fathers have to work, so it's a hangover from the past influencing those choices. You'd have to show me something women are overall better parents.  And your source shows that the number of men staying home by choice to care for the family is increasing and the number of men who do it because they're ill is decreasing.   Turns out, it's a legit whale watching community that's over 2 years old.  HAHAHAHAHA!  https://archive.is/nsZKC   HAHAHAHAHA!  Love it.   Your leave pay isn't as much as your regular pay, so if you want to try to survive on that with multiple kids, be my guest.   Not here in America.   If the person's mouth is open, it would be a lot easier.   Any citations for any of this?   Most women aren't strong enough to break someone's jaw? I think you're overestimating how hard it is to break a bone.   I am thin, but eat like shit and don't exercise. I do it by not eating a lot when I do eat.   Normal. I'd like to keep it that way. BMI of 20.   What if a man slaps a woman without a lot of force? Is that the same as a woman slapping a man hard?  I remember a man on Reddit mentioning his girlfriend broke his jaw, and the response was, "A woman broke your jaw? Are you some sort of weakling?"  Women are perfectly capable of causing serious harm.   That completely depends on how hard you hit someone.  I remember a man on Reddit mentioning his girlfriend broke his jaw, and the response was, "A woman broke your jaw? Are you some sort of weakling?"  Women are perfectly capable of causing serious harm.   Yeah and clearly we're talking about a human being capable of breathing.  But it isn't, and won't for a good long time.  Baby trees are called saplings, which very much are trees. In fact, the seed itself is what results from pollination so your analogy isn't even looking at the right stage.  Saplings aren't the same as sprouts. And my analogy is in the right stage. Seed = blastocyst that must be implanted after the sperm and egg meet. The sprout would be the fetus. Sapling would be the child.  It's a human being, period.  Citation needed.  Stop trying to belittle it so you can easily dismiss it.  Even if I thought it was a human being, I'd still be pro-choice because you can't use someone else's body against their will even as a human being.  Abortion legality has nothing to do with morality, but you've gotten so drawn in to that debate with pro-lifers that you've decided if it must be about morality then you'll just eliminate the part that brings morality into question: personhood.  Or maybe I just don't believe it's a human being?    From my estimation, FPH was approximately 60% skinnyfats who don't exercise or eat well themselves (for whatever reason) despite the supposed focus on health, and about 40% former-fatties/reddit-inspired gymrats who can only keep themselves from gaining it back by shaming themselves and others.  *Many* people on FPH admitting to not exercising much or eating well. This wasn't some well guarded secret. In fact, it was used to make the point that portion control was most of weight loss.   The focus on health was a subset of FPH. Not everyone there cared about working out.   I loved FPH. I'm not mad. I'm amused.   I agree with you, but I downvote anyone who says, "I'm going to be downvoted, but..."   As someone who frequented FPH, harassment was actually against the rules. You had to blur out the identifying info from any screenshots you posted so others couldn't find them as well.  I have no doubt some people probably were harassing fat people on Reddit, but doing it as a group from FPH could get you banned. I remember reading that rule on the sidebar many times.   I frequent that sub. My response was, "Heh, get ready for a whack-a-mole game Reddit."   TRP is a hive of stupidity, but I've never understood the desire to ban people you disagree with. Grow up.   Any source for this?  The mods wouldn't have made it against the rules if they were going to do it. What would be the point?   I might need someone to alert me to what the new FPH is. I have trouble finding it sometimes.   The breathing movements mean it would be if not for it's environment. I don't know how you can't see the fallacy in your argument.  The definition of breathing isn't, "Taking air inside the lungs and expelling it, or would be if in the right environment." It's, "Taking air inside the lungs and expelling it."  I didn't say anything about human life, I said human being. Nice deflection though.  It isn't a human being any more than a seed with a sprout is a tree.   Breathing means taking air into and out of the lungs. A fetus isn't doing that.  Is it human life? Sure. But so is a blastocyst and it isn't a person.   The mother is breathing then. The fetus still isn't.  Breathing movements aren't breathing.   This men's rights activist?   This was actually against the rules, and anyone who did so would have been banned.   And then afterwards have 3-4 kids to raise, which costs a fortune.  If this is an issue, then why are birth rates falling even in countries that have mandatory parental leave for parents?  Having kids just for parental leave isn't practical and costs you a lot more in the long run.   Trolls are making it here now?   26 and it still hasn't happened.  Living is freaking expensive. I go to school and do work study.   I...see nothing morally wrong with this.   I was on medication that most likely caused the fetus to abort.  If a fetus is a child, this is involuntary manslaughter and I'd be charged.  That's why it makes no sense to call abortion murder.   This MRA is teaching you that it should be up to the individual parents who works and who stays home with the kid.  So there, repeat something different that a MRA taught you.   So...most of the world besides America?   Your leave is only a percentage of your pay, so good luck trying to survive on that with multiple kids.     Your leave is only a percentage of your pay, so good luck trying to survive on that with multiple kids.   Pretty sure it's here because it's obviously made up.   Is it okay to force someone to do it against their will though?   I am very much against forcing a child to hug or kiss anyone.  Way to show how much you disrespect your child.   Was my miscarriage involuntary manslaughter?    The right to an abortion is the 14th amendment. It's as much of a right as the 2nd amendment.   All fetuses are living things. All blastocysts are living things. All cells are living things.  None of those are breathing.   Was my miscarriage involuntary manslaughter?    Was my miscarriage involuntary manslaughter?  	126
 Can you recommend any?    I just was forced out of my OCD closet last week. There are plenty of people that I have not told. There are plenty of people that I will probably never tell about my OCD.   I hid it from my family and closest friends for four years. Mainly, I thought I was schizophrenic instead of an OCD sufferer. However, I eventually found the courage to tell a friend.   This is my advice to you: everyone does not need to know. Don't be ashamed of it, but also know that you are taking a risk if you choose to place yourself on public display for OCD. Also, know that there are people who understand. You will meet plenty of people who simply do not understand.    I made good money, though   I'm sorry but I sold it on Ebay :(   My favorite shirt is a button up shirt that is made from jean material. I got it from Levi's. It's very versatile. What about you men?    Straight flame   This website is incredible.    I can definitely relate to this. I have a sister and she was definitely allowed to be more emotional than myself.    (i.e. Did they validate or invalidate your emotions?)   I pee on my possessions to mark my territory. Including my wife    See Coldplay live. See the Northern Lights. See Salar de Ayuni. Basically, there are a bunch of places I want to travel.    Anywhere along the inner thigh. Not even near the privates, just anywhere in the inner thigh region   Beauty and the Beast   Allowing another person to see the uglier sides of me   I disagree. If you do not come forward with an honest answer, the other person is going to spend a significant amount of time thinking of every potential thing that could be wrong with them. The person deserves honesty if they have given you honesty.    The City by the 1975   Kids by Childish Gambino    Literally this. Many girls on Tinder just want attention    I've had OCD for 6 years now and I just told my parents (not by choice) for the first time, last week. It really is difficult because you never know how they are going to take it. One thing that helped me was printing out some handouts from the website. OCD is really difficult to understand for someone who has no experience with it.    I can see the argument that male affection has declined among men and I think I would agree. However, I try to challenge this stereotype. I'm a heterosexual man and I will hold my guy friends hands or give them hugs. I think those gestures are signs of friendship, more than romantic relationship.    Step back and shoot   How long did your OCD start before you told them?   Long story short, my parents had no idea that I have OCD   Depression. I had a psychiatrist appointment yesterday and I couldn't drive myself. So, I basically had to ask my mum to take me to my psychiatrist appointment. I had no intentions of telling them, ever.   Later that night, my parents questioned me about everything. I tried to explain it to them and they are trying to understand, but they just don't get it.   How did you explain it to your parents? Any advice on what I could do? They blamed themselves and think it's their fault. Any suggestions?   Long story short, my parents had no idea that I have OCD. I had a psychiatrist appointment yesterday and I couldn't drive myself. So, I basically had to ask my mum to take me to my psychiatrist appointment. I had no intentions of telling them, ever.   Later that night, my parents questioned me about everything. I tried to explain it to them and they are trying to understand, but they just don't get it.   How did you explain it to your parents? Any advice on what I could do?       I've had similar experiences. It's definitely scrupulosity and it definitely changed my life    I was delusional for a few years of my life and I thought I was schizophrenic. Then, I was told that my intrusive thoughts were not voices. Afterwards, I was diagnosed with OCD   Depression   As soon as you started reminding me of my dad, I knew it wasn't going to work    This movie hits me in the heart, everytime I watch it; especially the ending.    I can quote this movie like it's my job   23/ 2.5 years with some on and off    I completely forgot about For You. Dang it!   Yes, the live Yellow intro was ICONIC   This topic hasn't been brought up in awhile, so I would like to hear everyone's opinions. What songs would you include on your Top 10 Coldplay list?   I had to think about this for a long time. I attempted to include some personal favorites, while simultaneously choosing all of the songs that I believe truly represent Coldplay's best work. Here are my ten:   * 1) Strawberry Swing * 2) Swallowed in the Sea * 3) X Y * 4) See You Soon * 5) Yellow * 6) Trouble * 7) Amsterdam * 8) Easy to Please * 9) Lovers in Japan  * 10) Charlie Brown   Alright Coldplayers, let's hear it!    "Everyone I know says I'm a fool to mess with you, Everyone I know says it's a stupid thing to do. I had your love on call and yet my day was so full. And I did not know what to do, so I ran away from you."  I Ran Away was reaffirming when I ended my long term relationship.    There is a probably a tie between my favorite B-side: Crest of Waves   I Ran Away   I used to fall asleep to Warning Sign, every night    Ahh I understand.   Mine is   1) AROBTTH  2) Parachutes 3) X Y 4) Viva 5) Ghost Stories 6) Mylo Xyloto    I love the whole 7 minutes of it    Yes is so underrated   I understand your reasoning. Could I ask your rank of albums, then?   I'll give you that actually. Ink is very childish.    This hasn't been done in a few months so let's hear it: how do you rank Coldplay's albums from best to worst? Also, what's your favorite track on each?  For me, it's   * 1) A Rush of Blood to the Head: In My Place  * 2) Parachutes: Shiver  * 3) X Y: Swallowed in the Sea  * 4) Viva La Vida/ Death   All His Friends: Strawberry Swing  * 5) Ghost Stories: Another's Arms  * 6) Mylo Xyloto: Us Against the World   Mylo Xyloto was horrible but I strongly disagree that Ghost Stories was a horrible album. I think Ghost Stories is a more mature Coldplay. Not to say that their younger works were immature, but I think AROBTTH is full of young energy. Ghost Stories seemed as if they mellowed out a bit.    Now I understand   Drop it like it's hot   FA?   Same here, except make my depression worse   Have you tried anything else? Just curious    I do not have girl parts but I definitely do appreciate the insight    Well, I was going to ask my psychiatrist if I could try Zoloft next. This is good to know   I really want to switch from Luvox because of the side effects. Mainly, my sleep schedule has really been affected. Has anyone had any experience with Luvox? Any advice?    Definitely scrupulosity    I still have this problem. I used to pee myself and as a result, I have this ritual of keeping a piece of toilet paper in my pants. If I am anywhere in public without the piece of toilet paper, I consider myself done for the day.   	54
 Yeah I'll definitely give that a go. I definitely feel like I have a creative mind but just nowhere to release ideas onto and it's frustrating me. I just don't feel like I have a "thing" to enjoy or relax me.   Haha sport has the opposite effect on me! I'm overweight and seriously unfit even though I've done gymnastics, ballet, dancing, yoga, cycling, running...you name it. I gained weight a few years ago and despite starving myself within an inch of my life and increasing my exercise I haven't lost any weight in two years. I'm now eating normally and doing Pilates 3 times a week on top of a job where I can't sit down and I've actually gained.  I wouldn't willingly exercise though. I find it boring.  	2
 Amazing how so much of the universe is captured in a single shot. Thanks for sharing.    Right, that is true. However, they did not own as much personal information before as they do now. I suppose what I'm asking is, as more and more personal information becomes collected and stored, and available to be revealed to the public, how might society change?  	2
 and Maseo's stunt double in the Katana fight, it didn't look like him    or maybe he eventually ends up in the Lazarus Pit and begins to like red again, and becomes a supervillain.    Not gonna lie, I burst out laughing when I saw his face. As if Felicity could do anything, but that speech he gave her....my grodd....it was amazing.   I think she becomes Mia Dearden, just because her middle name is Dearden and she was called Mia in Corto Maltese. I hope she can deal with Oliver's absence though. :\   If this is the end..... all I can say is "I loved you Diggle, and at least you didn't die first."   The military men were Olicity shippers that worked with Eobard Thawne, they knew that in the future, Ollie would get laid. They needed to keep the timeline intact.   If this episode's Ra's Al Ghul was a YouTube video, there better be no dislikes. It's almost as if he had a change of heart, and he saw their pain and didn't want them to suffer. He didn't even kill Sarab.      If you put the translate to Spanish to English, and type in Eobard Thawne, it comes out in English as Professor Zoom. If you put the translate to French to English, you can put Barry Allen, Slade Wilson, Laurel Lance, and get Flash, Deathstroke, and Black Canary.  andnbsp;  I haven't found out the rest yet, but I'll update this post if I find more, or if you guys find more.

This episode was worth committed suicide over. Not fucking Zayn Malik. I don't know where this show is going but my stomach hurts and I feel like crying right now.   HUGE SPOILER: Tyrion joins the League of Assassins and becomes the next Ra's Al Ghul, then he kills Piper Chapman, right in front of The Flash!   http://www.watchfree.to/tv-29bc93-Arrow-tv-show-online-free-putlocker.html   I heard it's legal, but it's illegal to distribute it or something like that, I'm pretty stupid when it comes to real life stuff.   1. Diggle 2. Slade 3. Felicity 4. Sara 5. Deadshot 6. Oliver 7. Ra's 8. Nyssa 9. Lyla 10. Wildcat   I have no DSLR Camera or anything like that, I have no lighting, and I have nobody but myself. Are there things I can do that don't require actors or setting up stuff to film?  Note: I'm starting to get into VFX so I may not be so familiar with all the different terms and programs to use.    LOL me too, he likes "WTF she's alive, wait I can't look angry, Oh Hai!! :)"   Too Late M8 -- https://instagram.com/p/0_tGz2DTDU/   Wasn't there another crossover episode, I swear I saw Lance and Detective West in a promo.   I love the Vi one, Riot needs to come out with a boxing glove skin for Vi.   alright, thanks. i hope none of Team Arrow dies ;~;    Season 1, Episode 1, first 30 seconds.   andnbsp;   I beg to differ, my good sir.   I'm not a huge IMDb user, but in Episode 21's cast.... literally nobody dies. Is this confirmed? or just put on IMDb and will be changed once it airs or once episode 20 finishes.   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4006598/?ref_=ttep_ep21   inb4 Oliver gets news that Walter died or that metahuman dies. -_-   I think this season is more about how Team Arrow evolves, and less about Oliver as The Arrow. That's why it's so emotional, because the rest of Team Arrow has so much more humanity to them compared to Oliver.   Black Arrow as in Diggle in a green suit, or Dark Archer? lol    it's a shame he might die next episode :(   It's most likely Roy, but I like what /u/Fishtosser123 said    Diggle will die and be reconstructed by Palmer as cyborg   i like that idea.   I like that theory, this show is about the origins and the journeys of many heroes/villains, (e.g. Green Arrow, Deathstroke, Black Canary, Deadshot, still kind wish they had Sara league of assassins flash backs to show her time away from Starling, but maybe that will be a spin off series.) If Deathstroke got his suit, and Green Arrow got his beard at the end of the 5 years, then I don't see why we can't see [this Deadshot](http://i.imgur.com/wFN7pMK.png) plus it's a metal suit, maybe (just my theory) Ray Palmer invents a fire resistance flak jacket for him, and he joins Team Arrow for a couple episode, but ultimately returns to his villainy.         Is it over, because im new to the game, and i just made an account like a few hours ago and it didn't say anything about maintenance.     	34
 Honestly I'm not even sure why companies would want to do this.  People aren't stupid, and if customers feel like they're being ripped off or cheated then they're less likely to want to support a company in the future.  And if they aren't doing something shady, there are ways to correct misinformation that *don't* feel like a coverup.  The "coincidental price increase because leaving early access" games have handled this pretty well.  The ones that haven't, though - illegal or not, it just seems dumb, from a customer respect/trust standpoint.  	1
 I guess it's British slang? I didn't realise. It means cool, alright. It's something that's did in passing though like, 'I like the new chart song' oh you do? Safe.    No ignore me, i'm going to take my tiny dog for a walk and stop being a grumpy bum.    All looks so delicious! what a babe. Surprise snacks are the BEST kind of snacks   Thank you :) i'm starting to look forward to Thursday and being able to talk everything through with someone   Thanks I think so too, I suggested we talk about it every 6 months. So then there's a time frame but also no pressure.   I know that nobody can help really and that most of these things i'm going to have to deal with myself, i just wish there was a magic genie that would fix everything for me whilst i sat back and drank gin LOL. I'm off to the shop to get my hubby's favourite food. So i'm hoping that cheers us both up!   Thank you :) i'd really like a text buddy, but i'm in the UK :(  I was seeing a therapist, and i'm seeing one again on Thursday after a 6 weeks break. So i'm looking forward to that.  I was doing fine today, i got up early, walked quite a long way to get my hubby's favourite dinner. When i told him though he replied 'safe' and it made me cry so now i'm back in bed. Maybe tomorrow eh?   I think that's what I'm most scared of though. That I will get counselling and come to the realisation that maybe this relationship just isn't working. I love him so much, I've never felt like this someone. I didn't want children with anyone before him, we went to school together we dated. Few years ago and it didn't work out then we ended up together. Maybe I'm stuck in the idea it's some rom com ending, we are meant to be and meant to live happily ever after. I don't want to let that go.   He came home with red roses today, I don't know what I did to deserve them but I can't stop smiling.  However, he said we are really low on money and our pay days are about three weeks off, if I was to spend the same on something i love like nail polish he would be really angry. I know that sounds selfish but I don't mean it that way, I mean, both make me happy, but if we are low on money then we are low on money aren't we? Don't get me wrong they are so beautiful and i was feeling so long, they cheered me up.   I don't really have anyone to vent to, my best friend is Russian and very to the point, she doesn't think he's right for me, she LOVES him and thinks he's a lovely guy, she just doesn't think he's right/good for me. She just turned up at my house when I tried to kill myself and she said she'd never felt so broken when she sat in the room with the psychologist whilst I told them why I did it. She's scared that I will struggle again and he won't be able to handle it and leave again and I will try and kill myself and she won't be around. She said it's her own selfish reason as well because I'm her best and only friend in the uk so she doesn't ever want to lose me.   My mother is poison and my father is an alcoholic, so I don't see any of my family or siblings. I tried talking to his mother and really felt like we were close and she would help me, then she broke up with me for him, packed all his things for him and stood in between me and him and said awful awful things to me. I wasn't fit to be a mother because I was so depressed, I needed to pick myself up and 'stop being like this' that I was making him miserable and he shouldn't have to come home to me like this and a house so dirty. Then he left me on the stairs, they both just left me on my own when I'd told him that morning I wanted to kill myself. Afterwards after he had come home, she invited us to a few family things and I didn't want to go, when he asked me why I told him about his mother, he said he couldn't remember and said he would talk to her, it took two weeks and another argument with me calling him awful names, told him he was like his father, even called him a cunt, he talked to her but is now angry at me because I'm angry  at her and not comfortable around her.   I literally agreed to stop trying for a baby for him, I would still be trying now because I'm so scared I might lose my chance, but I don't want to start taking the pill and mess up my cycle and condoms make me very sore after a while, he's also very large so it happens quicker. We agreed to not have unprotected sex for a week in the middle of my cycle and I said I would try condoms, then he got grumpy at me because I didn't want to try condoms that month and would prefer to not have sex, it was also hard for me to use condoms when I was ovulating, like an extra kick in the teeth. I got really upset and cried and he said he was sorry and wasn't thinking, but it still upsets me.   That's the other thing as well, I can't bring up anything because he says it's in the past and we are moving on, but it's all happened since January, that isn't the past is it? It still feels really fresh and still hurts an insane amount.   I know all of this sounds like I've answered my own questions about our relationship, and trust me I could go on and on but that's it at all, I really do love him more than anything in the world, even my dog who is my child and who has been my constant since my divorce. Since I was 18 actually. He's my world. I don't want to figure out we aren't working, or give up, I don't want to break up, I just want help, talking to him didn't help, doing it online so I don't shout and call him names doesn't help, writing it all down and telling him doesn't help, ordering him, shouting, screaming, calling him awful names. Nothing works it just makes me more of a minister because I'm calling this lovely guy all this horrible things when he's so calm and never shouts at me.   All his friends say they don't like how I talk to him and he says there is no need for my anger or shouting and he just wants us to be perfect and never argue, but I feel like he drives me to it,  I start shouting even if we aren't arguing because I never feel listened to, I feel like I'm shouting over my own mental broken brain and if he wants this perfect relationship but then why isn't anything changing? Why isn't he? He's telling me I need to stop being angry and calling names, but then nothing changed and I build up to full rage again. What do I do? What do I need to do. I'll do anything but I don't know where to even start.   I've full on rambled now, but once I started talking I couldn't stop. It's not often I have people listening to me    I was expecting so much from Dazzle Camouflage. Not gonna lie, a little disappointed it's only stripes   I'm 26, i've 'started afresh' a few times, left my controlling much older husband when i was 20, then left an abusive partner. I can't hit the refresh button this time though, because there's nothing to refresh :/ So i feel like i'm stuck in a rut.   All i seem to do is observe my body, but i think i try and figure it out TOO much, i get angry and i'm like, is that depression? pms? sometimes i think i have to just know that all it is, is anger.  YES! that's exactly it, i've always felt weak, because of my childhood, i build myself up and i'm this strong independent person. Then i got depressed and tried to kill myself, now i feel so broken and weak, i hate how my boyfriend looks at me sometimes. I hate people knowing i'm struggling.   He says i'm the powerful one in the relationship, i wear the trousers. He told me he wasn't strong enough to deal with how depressed i was. So now i'm starting to feel so low again i'm scared, he's not strong enough for this and can't handle it, so what do i do? i don't want to lose him, but i can't look after myself and someone else too.  I'm sorry you've gone through so much 3    Yay us! :)   It's 4pm in the UK here, i didn't get up until the afternoon :/  Change always helps me too, but i'm not really sure what i could change at the moment. Whilst i LOVE my new job in a school, it's a new job so i'm having to make a super impression. To be honest my biggest pressure at the moment is my relationship. Counselling next week though after a 6 week break, so i'm just preying that starts to help me again. That's my main goal as well, i had a really shitty childhood, so i want to illuminate stress and give my child the best and happiest life they could have. My biggest kick in the teeth is my family is mainly females, and they are all as fertile as bloody cats, they stop taking contraception and BOOM bun in the oven.   Huzzah! glad i helped in the man crush hehe! it's like we're having a sleepover and talking crushes, this chat has super cheered me up (SUPER which means it's like cheered up but with super powers)   Nah, I find that most men have a 'if i was gay i'd totally let him touch my butt' I find that a lot of the time it's Nathan Fillion.  Girls get it too, like i see some women and i'm not sure if i want to be them or be all up on their grill ya know? Kat Dennings does it for me heh she's so feisty and busty.   	14
 Eating fast food.  Guess my weight!   But seriously. Something about biting into a piece of fried chicken, or a juicy hamburger and fries .... I know, I know. Emotional eating is terrible. But I can't help it for now. At least it works : )   I personally really love New York. I used to go there two or three times a year when I was younger. Age 8 I moved to Canada and it took me a while to like my city. But you know what, Montreal is one of the best cities in the world to me. Maybe not as eventful as Toronto (we're always compared) but it's still good enough. And it's cheap! I've found, in a "rich/hipster" area near downtown, a studio apartment for 300 dollars a month. What a bargain! Especially so close to downtown!  Now I'm in Germany and I'm looking forward to going back to Paris for a month! I can't help but love this city as well.   Oh and since you're considering Chicago, do go there! It's apparently like New York, but a bit smaller and way cheaper (and cleaner!) Unless you hate winter. But then don't consider Canada at all (apart from Vancouver I guess) if you hate harsh winters : )   I'm in Germany right now, and I've been to seven other countries (or eight, if you count a layover in London). I want that number to be ten! Honestly I don't know. My last few trips have made me realize that as much as I love foreign countries and cultures, I'm not so much of a tourist. I would, however, live a year or two in each of maybe twenty countries I like, if I were rich.  Good luck, by the way!    Ha no worries I know I won't ever be in a relationship. I'm asexual and I havea personality disorder. The odds of finding someone at this point are pretty much zero.  No regrets. Slight disappointment but all is good : )   Meh. I'm 19. I may die alone, never kissed, never in a relationship.   Fine with me. Or at least, I'm trying to convince myself of that.    Oh cool! It honestly looks like a neat place to live in. In airports or airplanes, there are so many adds to incite people to move there. If I wasn't so in love with 'big' cities, I would totally go there! The scenery is lovely.    Hey! Where are you from? : ) Or at least, which province, if you rather not share the city?    My day is coming to an end, and I guess it was okay. After about 23 hours without eating, I finally ate something and that alone made me feel awesome. I'm trying to fight cravings right now but I can't resist ... so I'm thinking about giving in tomorrow.   Also, I saw a [picture](https://41.media.tumblr.com/1c6b1dbde3643ef9054d538db3501315/tumblr_mtjqhcjo3a1qmkgojo1_540.jpg) of my home city and I really miss it. I decided to street view it a bit and now I'm pretty much in tears. I've been away for three months now. There are some cities, like New York City and Paris that just make me very emotional for some reason. Montreal, my home city, is just the same. I love it so much!    Just wanna say this, intelligence has nothing to do with substance usage. I went to "one of the top five best high schools" in my city, and everyone but my group of friends and maybe five other kids never touched drugs. I may be one out of three who has never touched alcohol. And I am willing to bet I'm one of the least intelligent kids.  It's usually peer pressure, or this idea that teens should be doing this at that age.   Happy to see SHINee mentioned! Though I honestly think their best song as of right now is "Dream Girl" (I'm on mobile sorry).    Doesn't count if you sleep through most of it : )   Sounds pretty cool, especially when many people sung it together. I think that's the charm with the USSR Russian version. It's just powerful to hear so many people who (maybe? at least they sound like it) believe in their nation.    The only reason why I like the [Haitian National Anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQk3aqml2c8) is because there are ten versions to the lyrics, one for each work day, and in both official languages (creole and french). I don't know what happened during the week-end, but during work days, you have to stop in front of the National Palace and sing it while they raise it. At school, we had to sing it, too! The official National Anthem is all five parts together. Generations before me have a parody in creole of it, because they were so sick of singing it every single day. It's really funny. I wish I could find it.    Besides, I love the Russian anthem as well. Amazingly powerful! [This version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U06jlgpMtQs) from the USSR gives me chills all the time.   It's nothing big, I just live with other people and I'm too anxious to leave my room when they're all awake, so I wait at night (usually past 8 pm, most are in their rooms). I'll definitely go grocery shopping as early as possible tomorrow morning. Maybe buy bread and peanut butter.    Definitely! Or else I think I would have fainted by now!    Ah, I used to be the same. Always snacking. I hate hunger as well!    It's not really a choice? Well I guess in a sense it is but. Bleh. Stupid anxiety stuff.    Thank you. I was wondering if my body was being dramatic (I'm overweight and used to eat all the time, so maybe it's just extremely weird for my body to not be fed as often).   It's really stupid, but I am not at home. I live with a host family overseas. I have free access to their kitchen, that's no problem, but lately I've been feeling a lot of anxiety around them. So much so, that I wait for most of them to be asleep to leave my room and go find something to eat. I'm not making much money, and today is Sunday and in Germany, most things are closed.    Thanks for letting me know. I was wondering if my body was exaggerating, since I'm overweight and maybe I've become really dramatic or something. I don't know.    Same here. However I have nothing. Absolutely nothing (but water).    Sorry this sounds like an odd question, but I haven't eaten in 22 hours now. Actually, lately, I've been eaten way less often than I'm used to, and almost every day I feel like I'm on the verge of death. I don't know how normal it is.   Symptoms usually include a really bad migraine, feeling like head is too heavy for my body, burps (not uncomfortable but I guess worth mentioning), ringing in the ears, and an overall feeling of weakness. But I feel like 22 hours is very few for this type of reaction?   ** By the way, it's not that I don't want to eat. I'm the biggest food lover in the world. It's just that the circumstances I'm in I've led me to eat less than usual, sometimes not at all for a full day.   "You're worthy of my time." I still sometimes doubt the person who says it because of self-esteem stupidity, but at that moment, it felt really good to hear that and to believe it for a microsecond.    I'm fat, and I want to lose weight and be healthy and blablabla. But the problem is I do a lot of emotional eating, and I don't seek help to fix it. Simply because I'm afraid of failing and feeling more like shit. Cuz nothing beats eating when you're feeling down (for me).   Apps!    Oh man. I hate interviews. I've had a few in my life, and they all went terrible. The worst has to be when I applied to work in a convenience store. I was answering the situational questions, thinking "Yeeeess, I'm killing it!" when it was my turn to ask questions. Then I asked a question about how they handle people robbing (since she had previously mentioned that kids from the neighboring school steal snacks almost on the daily). She responds: Well, TEAMWORK (she says it loud and slowly) definitely makes it a lot easier.   Then it dawned on me. Throughout my interview, I did not mention teamwork once. Situational questions were answered with me basically saying: "I'll do this, then this, then this." instead of "I'll talk about it with x, then go help y, and advise z."   I'm naturally a loner and during interviews, my brain shuts off. I can't think so I guess my truest self surfaces. Sometimes I wonder if I'll ever get a job.    Most pictures where he's with his daughter, he looks like the happiest man on Earth.   Ah now I understand. Sorry for misunderstanding, but I wasn't really expecting people talking about relationships, since that's one aspect of life. I meant life in general. Like how you feel about yourself, your mood, your motivation to go on, etc.  But anyway. At least I know you're not like that first guy.    I used to think the same thing, until I got on the bus one day, some random guy sit next to me and I didn't even think about it because what the hell he's a person like me, then he started touching me inappropriately. Now I fear sitting next to most men. It's been about four years and I'm slowly going back to my old self, though I do find myself making myself as small as possible or putting my backpack on my lap, when I'm sitting next to men. It's a thing you can't help. Like you wouldn't eat popcorn, at least for a while, if you almost choked to death while eating some.    I don't it has anything to do with children discovering things and whatever, since from a very young age, children lead pretty monotonous lives. Yet the days still feel really long.   Depends how you see it. If you think there is such a thing as an absolute zero of caring, and you're there, then yes. You couldn't care less. If you believe there is +care, a zero, then -care, then I could care less makes sense.    What? No one would tell a fat person they're too fat? Wanna exchange lives for a couple of days?   Look. My question is not so complicated. People always say "it gets better". "It" being life in general.  First comment is some dude complaining about how shit women are. Second comment is some dude saying women are useless to him.  So what is there to conclude? Explanation #1: He saw the first comment, got salty, and wrote something similar about how women are shit. Explanation #2: He didn't understand or didn't care enough to answer my question.  I guess you fit explanation #2 if you insist, but explanation #1 is not farfetched.  Still, why the hell are you replying to this question if that's not what I was asking?    Maybe I'm too old school, but I don't think that when it comes to love, you should actively look for it. Or else it's most probably artificial. By that I mean you'll date the person under a specific condition that is most likely going to be broken. Just wait?    Ok first of all, what does that have to do with my question then? Second, I'll quote you "They're good for". Who uses this to qualify humans, except the few bitter anti-women neckbeard whatever men I've seen on Reddit?    Omg, OP's comment history is incredibly sad! What is wrong with the man?    Have you read your comment? Here.   the only thing a woman can bring to a relationship now that I can't get elsewhere with less of a hassle is sex. And unless the sex is mind-blowingly good, **it's not worth tolerating all the other shit she's going to bring along with her to get it.**  In other words, you mean the only good thing about women is sex, and they become worthy of your time if they're good at it. You're not even saying "In my experience" or "My exes were shit". You just took 3.5 billion people and just put them in the same "Good for sex and nothing else" category.  Thanks, mate.    I am American, but raised by Haitians in both Haiti and Canada. Haitians are not shy people, and I don't think the 10 years I spent in Canada might have done this to me.    Back home in Canada, a couple of people and I were coming back from spending an evening in a café downtown. We all live in the West side of our city, one of two parts where the metro doesn't reach, but there is an express bus from one of the metro stations to the mall in our region, and we all took it. At the mall, we each take different buses, but since it was night, there were only two buses per hour. So instead of waiting, I took the express bus (which has a line that continues until the most western point of the city), and the closest stop to my house is 15 minutes away if you walk, less than a minute if you take another bus. But I was too cold to wait. So, I walked.   It was so quiet. Very few cars, and it was extremely dark. I listened to music and just slowly advanced in the snow. Somehow, I wasn't freezing anymore. Well, the cold became comforting. Life, during those 15 minutes, felt amazing. I was finally at peace with my thoughts somehow, I felt really light and good about myself.  Then I walked into my driveway and everything went back to normal.  I miss moments like this.    Yeah I try too as well but when it's everyone ...   I understand. I don't really believe in auras or energy or whatever, but it's so odd. It's not my face, I believe. I mean I'm no beauty but I'm no Grinch either. I also wonder if you would feel the same way. Probably.   Not directly, but the host father has said that people naturally feel uncomfortable around me, but that they usually wonder if they've done something wrong. I come off as odd and uncomfortable. To this day, I don't understand how. I dress normally, no fancy haircut ... I'm just quiet. I don't think quiet people are so rare that meeting one is now considered odd.    I'm tempted to say "forever", but my first memory of such a thing was the first time I spent the night away from home. I think I was 8 or 9. A cousin of my mother invited me and five other children to stay at her house for Christmas until New Year's. All week, they were just uncomfortable, and I thought: "Good! I'm not the only socially awkward person here!" Then the day I was supposed to leave, I went to the basement to say bye to them and they were having tons of fun!   I also remember when 4 years ago I went to Mexico for a student exchange program thing. Same thing. The girl who was hosting me, I thought she was naturally shy and awkward. Well, no. She is when she's around me, not when she's around other people. Then we went to a party one day and I tried to be sociable and whatnot. Some guy had guitar hero and I wanted to try. The second I took the guitar/controller, everyone but maybe two classmates left. Then when my turn was over, everyone came back.   And the worst is, those people were never mean to me. Ever. They've all been helpful, caring and friendly to a certain extend. But they're just uncomfortable or less happy when I'm around.    Cold rainy days are perfect days for watching TV and eating junk food! Or reading a book while munching on carrots. Whatever you're into!   It's just the perfect day to just laze around and do something that "cannot" put you in a bad mood. It really depends on who you are. Some people like walking in the rain. Some people like sitting in front of their window and look at the rain. Seriously. Rainy days are the best!    No that was just one example. And it's not because she kept asking me stuff, and it wasn't annoying at all. I just mean that when I'm around people, they're not at their happiest. Ever. But when I'm not, like when I would walk way behind them, it's like they felt way better. My presence feels inappropriate.  And what's funny is that even the baby notices it. He's a really happy baby, not shy at all, and he laughs all the time. But then when he looks at me (I'm no stranger), he just stops laughing or smiling. He looks at me like I just ruined it for him. Then he looks at someone else and immediately starts laughing and smiling again.  I just have a bad aura. Some people translate it as "always unhappy" (which is not too far from reality), others as "always uncomfortable" (which, also, is not too far from reality). But the core 'problem' is that I feel like I shouldn't be around people.   Oh lord I used to get into intense arguments because of frozen bread. I despise bread in the freezer or the fridge.    Meh. I have no social life and I hate parties. I also hate alcohol so I'll never get drunk in my life. I guess I'm good.    Not quite. I feel like I can easily ruin their happiness.  For instance yesterday, I went out with the family that hosts me (I'm in Germany for the next year with them). They're a couple with a baby, and yesterday we went to visit the mother's brother, who's married and whose wife is pregnant. At first, it was okay. They talked, we ate. Then they wanted to go out. I just naturally started walking behind them, as I usually do when I'm with people. Mostly because I like being alone in my thoughts, and I don't like attracting attention. But yesterday, they were having a jolly good time, and I felt like I was like a black smoke, so I should just stay behind them. A black smoke full of negative energy or something, and they should avoid me. And you could tell, they were worried. They kept asking me "Do you want this? Or this?" For a full minute (which is long), the mother kept asking me if I wanted to eat, go shopping, look around, drink something ... for a full minute! And she was so desperate to get a "Yes" from me, but she never got it. I think I slightly ruined her day.    Sometimes I wonder if I should get into drinking ... not that I want to be an alcoholic but so many people seem to find comfort in alcohol.  But I hate alcohol. So I get "drunk" on fast food and orange juice. Guess my weight!    Hey! Honestly lately I've been feeling like my entire aura is foul and I don't think I can fix that.  By aura, I just mean energy. Like whatever other people pick up when they're around me.    Honestly, I'm feeling the same way. Life isn't something I was meant to have. I cannot find anything worth my time. And like you, I don't mean like "My time is too precious for this". Quite the opposite. I'm useless and I have no motivation nor reason to change that. Life just feels. Eh.   Until maybe a few hours ago (well, my opinion on that changes quite often), my life goal was to be a mother. But it is the most selfish thing I can do, which is bad. I know, having children is selfish in itself but only the decision should be selfish. The rest of your life should be devoted to raising your child to be a HAPPY and healthy person. But I think my state of mind is too improper and unpredictable for a child to be raised by me.   I should have been a rock.    Well, great. I'm very vocal about how it doesn't change our lives so why should anyone care about what others like or what makes other people happy.   I was wondering about people with an overall shitty life. Not people who've been unlucky with ~~women~~ relationships/love.  Yet another person who sees women as a thing that should make their life better. Sorry to say this, but with this attitude, I'm glad you're having a hard time.   I was thinking about life in general, not just relationships. Also, sounds more like you were unlucky. You, the individual. You can't make it a men vs. women thing because if you want to go there, older ladies who happen to be single have no luck unless they're rich or find people with an old lady fetish. Because men like to go for your girls. And I do mean girls.  If you want love, you'd have to change your attitude towards women. Because, fun fact, they're people too. And not just things to fulfill your love/sex life.    What would getting rid of them change?! And Norway still have their Royal Family as well. Why are other countries way more unbothered by their Royal Family than the UK? It's only because in the UK, they have a celebrity status, and people everywhere either publicly or secretly hate celebrities. Especially those "rich for no reason" (most famous example of all time: Kim K.). Just let them be, man. If all they did was to have been born with the right combination of genes, then good on them. Because being from the middle class and lower sucks. So, happy they won't have to know this.   Listen to something boring. Not boring as in "Ugh. Please be done already!" But something that will not overly stimulate your mind. Like white noise. It's repetitive, nothing unexpected happens, it works great. What also may work is watching workout videos for beginners. The kind you see on TV early in the morning. The movements are simple enough for your brain to not go "WOAH WHAT JUST HAPPENED!"  Ok I don't know if you were asking for advices on how to fall asleep, but here. Enjoy :D  Or you can always drink milk. Some say warm, others say cold ... I say cold.    Sounds like your grandparents really care about you if they're willing to handle this type of event. So go and enjoy yourself. At least enjoy their presents. Maybe to you it's boring but to them, it's the most they can do to show how proud they are of you.   Sorry. English is not my first language. Care to explain instead of just pointing it out?    Super Mario Bros on the DS. Even if you finish your game, you can give yourself the challenge of unlocking all the worlds, or collecting all the stars, or as many coins as possible.      So I don't know where you live, but if you're in Canada, take the "Canadian" pizza from Pizza Hut. Meat on meat on meat, oh and mushrooms. To die for.   I think the equivalent everywhere else is "meat lover". But if you like mushrooms, yo. Just go buy some and put that on the pizza. Amaaaaazing!    First of all, you must not visit Germany enough to know that they have kept many Nazi built buildings as symbols of "Let's remember we were shit, and let's never go back to that." Example: Wolfsburg Main Train Station.   Second, [just tourists alone "reimburse" the cost of the Royal Family](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/07/is-the-british-royal-family-worth-the-money/278052/). And on top of that, [The Queen herself has helped many charity groups she's the patron of raise more than a billion pounds](http://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2012/jun/11/queen-charitable-support). A billion!   Look, if you don't like the Royals, fine. But if you truly think not having them would save Britain (financially), well no. * They are not The problem. Whoever is dealing with your economy is*. Is France better than the UK? Not really. Is Sweden or Luxembourg a shithole? I don't think so.    Maybe I will find no one? But today I've been seeing a lot if "I'm a living proof that it gets better" or things along those lines, so I wanted to hear from people who are living proofs of "it depends".   Again, like I said, they're symbols. Like many other buildings have negative side to them, a negative story. If you go to Germany, you'll find many of those, the only difference is that none of those symbols are humans, so they cannot better themselves (which the Royals have done).   Now, the Monarchy knows the history they have, it is why they give out more than they get. It is why Royals are required to work for the state (The Queen helped out during the Second World War! And Prince Harry was deployed, I believe, twice in the Middle East. His brother did something in the army as well, I don't remember what). Not only that, but they give millions in charity, and they don't just sit on their thrones and sign checks. They actually go and help in person. Talk to people, share and help. Obviously the Queen doesn't do that anymore. She's 80+ years old. But the younger ones travel a lot, usually as symbols of something deeper. Kind of like a remember of "Hey, we got your back." Obviously countries like Canada, Australia or the UK barely see this since they're 'rich', but Jamaica and Lesotho for example do see a difference because they have something like the Monarchy that has their back. Obviously it's not perfect, we're humans after all. But it's better than nothing.    Same if you destroyed Big Ben and made it a hotel. Same if you destroyed all those churches and made them as hotels. I mean. You could get rid of anything historical and just build new apartments, or hotels, or whatever.   Like I said, they are symbols. Symbols that people decided to preserve. They just happen to be humans.   ** Whoops. Big Ben is the clock. Not the entire building.    Nah. But even if I were, I don't see the problem. If you're talking about the tax you have that is given to them, I was subject to that too. Lived in Canada for 10 years. And it literally was cents.    I used to do both because I thought one shower a day was nasty, then I became lazy and showered in the morning only because I thought not showering before leaving the house was nasty, but then lately I've been showering at night ... Because I want an extra hour of sleep. I really can't fall asleep early, so I rather shower immediately before bed (midnight) so I can wake up at 7 instead of 6 or 6:30. However I work 'at home', so whatever. If I have to go outside, I still shower beforehand.   Btw when I say nasty, I mean I would be nasty if I did it. I used to sweat a lot, and not showering twice a day meant hell until I found a good deo, and since it's still cold and I don't sweat at night anymore, I wake up smelling fresh now. Very happy.    Sometimes I wish I were a toddler that ends up being adopted by Prince Harry. Just because he looks like he would be the most terrific father ever.   I still don't understand why so many people hate the Royals, when they're no different than descendants of CEOs or celebrities. Actually, they do more. They still have to go to school, they still have to serve the state. And they all did, and the younger ones still work. They're just a symbol. They literally bother no one ... I really don't get it.    It's not really a song (since it has no lyrics), but I really enjoy this piece by the xx. It's called Intro, and it is literally the intro to one of their albums. The original version is less than 2 minutes long, but some people have made longer versions (seamless edits are the bests!), like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4UtBYUMVJk), which is two hours and forty five minutes long. There used to be a ten hour version edited the same way, that got deleted (but thankfully I had downloaded it before it got taken off YouTube!)  If you want actual songs, I think most songs by Coldplay work well. What's funny is that it depends on your mood. They're good songs for when you're sad and want to stay sad, sad and want to be happier, happy and want to stay happy ... etc. [Clocks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbI1FpLd4Vk) is my personal favorite.   There's also Weezer with Island in the Sun. Sorry I can't seem to find a good version on YouTube. You probably can (I'm in Germany and most videos are blocked).   Last one that just screams "feel good", literally, is [Feel Good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plvpV9p0ywg) by Gorillaz. It's very different to the others (no calming rhythm), but somehow, hearing "Feel Good" makes me feel better. But I guess it is not for everyone.  Enjoy! : )      I once wrote miaou as a conclusion to a writing test I had in high school (we were given a topic and we had to debate). I literally skipped two lines after my solid argument, and I added  Miaou.  As ashamed as I am, I still can't help but miaou when a situation is awkward. As if that helps.  Edit: pardon my French. Meow **   Why are people so pretentious in this subreddit? I thought it was /r/earthporn, not /r/photographyporn. Of course with a professional camera, this would have looked stunning but it looks great already. Do y'all see the Kilimanjaro so often that you feel blasé when you see an iPhone picture of it?   Cool picture!    I have for a few months. Honestly, I did it because I wanted to take care of children, but people have become very picky with who is allowed to take care of their child (age, experience, formal education related to childcare), while this volunteering responsibility I got only a police background check. I was 18 when I started, so of course I had no diploma to show any formal education I could have had, and at 18 you're still a kid, and of course, compared to someone twice my age, I have no experience. I have never gotten in trouble with the law either, So I chose volunteering. Loved it.  Basically, I had to take care of children while their parents took some time alone. Those parents, usually single women, were often immigrants or very poor people, so they needed that help/deserved it. I was supposed to look after two children for three hours a week, but it would sometimes last 8 hours, since the mother would go to school and stuff. I didn't mind.   My biggest regret is not being creative enough with the children, and the fact that I easily give up when I fail. It's my biggest flaw in general, but I think if I were just slightly more positive as a person, they would have been very happy. For instance one of them was really unhappy when I took her out, and because of that, to this day I fear going out with a child. I also wish I had more money so I could take the children to different activities. Staying indoors when you're not so creative of a person can become dull very easily, especially for youngsters. But I would do it all over again. Any time. I would do it for the rest of my life and full-time, if only I was guaranteed to at least have a roof over my head and food to eat.    Reproduce? No way. But I was doomed with a natural love for children. I always think about adopting children (many of them), but then I remember the kind of person I am. I suck. I'm a terrible human being, living a terrible life, with terrible thoughts 24/7. Forcing someone else into my world would be abuse.  I am trying hard to get myself to not think about children and being a parent, but it's not working. And anyway, I have no real purpose in life, and I thought being a parent would be one. If it's not, I could die right now.    I feel the same. I feel ignored and meaningless, but I also don't want to be talked with because the other person is bored, has nothing better to do, I'm paid to be nice, etc. It just reinforces the idea that meaningless. So say, if the plumber comes over, I am not having a conversation with them because chances are, it will be one of those "I have nothing better to do/I'm bored/I'm being polite" conversations.    I think if you like your space, a cat would be better. If you still somehow want some kind of attention and even affection, a dog is awesome. Dogs can be sometimes invasive, but in the most loving and genuine way.    Ha. I have been living with a host family for three months, and to this day, I really hate going downstairs when they're here. Not because I don't like their company (they are the greatest people I ever met), I just still feel like I'm a stranger, and my presence is inappropriate, and just coming down to their kitchen "uninvited" would be rude. Which is really stupid because if I'm allowed to sleep in their house, I guess I am invited to go to every other rooms. But yeah. If they're in a bedroom, there's no way I'm going there. If they're in the kitchen/dining-room/living-room, I'm staying in my room.   It's currently 4 pm, I am starving, but I would much rather stay in my room all day than go downstairs.  Stupid anxiety.    I'm sorry. I have no idea how this thing called "being sociable" works, but being corny, trying to be funny in real life doesn't work. She would probably laugh or answer to be polite (and that's kind of her job), but that's it.   Starting a conversation is extremely easy. Very few will blatantly ignore you. Starting a meaningful conversation that will lead to something, anything, that's tough and it takes some serious skills.    Yeah. The thing is I want to learn by hearing people talk, since I have no one to talk with. And it's easier to write than to speak in a foreign language, since you have time to think, ressources to check, etc.   Tv could be helpful, but I guess not German TV.   Pretty sure most Reality TV shows are scripted. But I guess it depends on what the scripting does. In those videos I've linked, the people are real, their actions are real, the outcome of the shows are real, but the people are often asked to do certain things a certain way (usually dramatically), just so it can be a little more interesting. Like Gordon Ramsay is extremely dramatic in Hell's Kitchen because no one would watch if he wouldn't yell.   Now if even what the people feel and say is scripted ... I'm out. I've seen a show like this, I don't remember the channel (maybe VOX?). Some lady was crying because she wanted to see her family after they had moved or something. Then "all of a sudden", they come out the door and no one was waiting for them, but somehow they had mics on them and the lighting was perfect, perfectly stabilized cameras filming the 'unexpected entrance". Then the lady says, in the most "I failed theatre class" way: "Ich liebe ... Ich liebe dich." to her granddaughter who was like :/. Then the lady started fake-sobbing. Oh lord. No thank you.    After spending some time watching Germany's "Wife Swap", yeah. It's quite different from what I am used to. I think (North) Americans need constant stimulation, so you can't literally film someone doing the same thing for more than 5 minutes, unless shit happens every once in a while (speaking of Hell's Kitchen. They cook for maybe 10-15 minutes straight but every 2 minutes, Gordon Ramsay gets pissed).   I like show is featuring families, because if you have children, chances are your lief can't be that empty. But then Wife Swipe ... The children were like. Background decor. The show was about the mothers more than what they do with the families. I like uneventful stuff but damn. German Reality TV is VERY uneventful. (Maybe it gets better but 17 minutes before the end, nothing had happened so I stopped watching).   Man. I wanted to watch German TV just to hear the language as much as possible but everything so far have been so boring to me.     Thanks! I've been looking for streaming websites as well! : )   Yes, I do mean something like 'Aching Kontrolle' but that show specifically, I don't really enjoy it. I guess I like shows where people cook or shows where people take care of children, or shows where you see families.   Documentaries are cool but since I don't understand German, I don't feel comfortable watching a documentary yet. It's something I watch when I want to learn about a topic, so guessing what the narrator is saying would remove the joy out of it. : )   Is it like American late night nows? I'm not really a fan, to be honest. This will sound weird but I don't like shows that purposely have humour in them.    Thank you! I've actually checked some and the few shows I'd find interesting are not free! A little upset, to be honest : (   Here's the thing. People aren't dumb. They know that they will only get attention if they start rioting. Have you heard of the many (and I mean, many) peaceful walks and protests? I personally only hear from them on social media pages run by Black people only, usually Tumblr or Facebook. But the riots? Oh. Now that's everywhere: Reddit, Twitter, the news, newspaper ... even where I'm sitting, in Germany, I heard about it. But no one talks about the ten peaceful protests that happened before.  There are two kinds of rioters. The "Are you listening now?" and the "Lol better use this occasion to get free shit." That second category is often the one people see on TV, and surprise! They will put the "Are you listening now?" rioters in the same category!   In Baltimore, there were just as many White rioters as Black rioters. Many of them took pictures of themselves looting stores, taking free beer and chips. And in those pictures I saw, they were literally all White. All just taking beer and chips. But do you hear about them? Nah. Who cares. The media needs something shocking. Something that will make viewers or readers hate those riots, spark the inner-racist in some.    Hello!  I am a North American who was spoiled with North American TV. I am now in Germany and I have yet to find something I like.   I must admit, I am losing interest in TV in general, but I do enjoy some shows, such as [Supernanny](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drlDiTfpiZA), [MasterChef](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZxD-g0dO_M), [Hell's Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wBVtCkueIY), and a Korean TV show called ['The Return of Superman'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mitSlhDMCQE). I do not like series, movies, or any type of fiction.   One thing from Germany I thoroughly enjoyed (and I've watched it multiple times) was [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Uoh3bE6-0U) I found on YouTube. I really enjoy reality TV, especially the kind where all the cameramen have to do is follow people around. No real plot, no plans, nothing extraordinary.   Thanks in advance!   Ha, I just came back while another page while loading but it's fine. : )  Thank you so much! What a great subreddit!    The first top comment is a sarcastic one about how Black people mishandle their situation, when this video features at most 8 kids, but still, they represent our entire race! Second top comment (deleted now) was about someone having terrible experiences with Black people, and then you have a couple of Asians replying about how they're staying away from Black people. Third top comment (deleted) was what I meant when I said people always talk about how "Black culture being problematic and they need to go". Fourth top comment is okay, I guess, I don't want to think too much into it. Then fifth top comment is about a guy who can't help but find "those people" idiotic. Sixth is sarcastic and making fun of the fact that Black people nowadays are sick of always being called criminals. I stopped there.    I live in Hannover right now. I do get some stares, especially since I am wearing breads and [it looks like this](http://getfiercestyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/yesnatty-com.jpg). Btw, that is not me. The size and the quantity seems to attract attention. No big deal, really. I have not witnessed racism towards Asians either, but then I've been here for only 13 weeks.   I think "Black culture" is way too broad because you have different 'types of black'. I am originally from the West Indies. Within the West Indies, there is a huge different between ex-English colonies, and ex-French colonies. I don't know how different ex-Dutch colonies are though. And then, you have Africa, which is so diverse that I don't know where to begin. I think African-Americans have their own culture though (and it is rich and interesting), but then once you immigrate to America and you're Black, you're seen as the same as African-Americans. People as confuse consequences of black segregation and black culture as well. Sorry I am terrible at explaining.    I am American but I never lived in the US. I lived in Canada, the Caribbean, and I am now in Germany. And, I think you are right. Race is less of an issue here. At least, in Germany it is. Of course, you have some racism towards other groups but it's more like people muttering insults under their breath because "a damn immigrant cut them off today." But you don't see people openly discuss it.   I try not to think about it either, but sometimes it hits me. Today was just a bad day from the get-go. Seeing this did not help.  But thank you for the comment : )   Sure! [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/33w6dj/reporter_robbed_by_black_youths_while_covering/) is what led me to writing this. I didn't read the YouTube comment as they were predictable, but yeah. The Reddit comments are not better.    Thanks a lot. That was so well written. Today was just a bad day but from now on, I'll try to just keep my head up.  Thank you again! : )   I don't have much a problem in my day-to-day life with racism. Usually they're at the same level as YouTube comments: Very stupid and easily forgettable, but too many can get to you. People are too chicken to voice 'smart racism'. Actually, I am lucky enough to have lived most of my life in countries where people are afraid to talk too loudly (Canada for 10 years, Germany now). But still, you know the racism is there. People you see on the streets go online to denigrate you and your entire culture, country or race.   And I may be moving to Southern America next year ... yikes!    I try to stay away from it as much as possible, actually. But sometimes, I just wonder if people's opinion are changing. In that particular case, I read the comments in hopes of having someone say "It's not because they're black, it's because they're poor." type of comment. It was there, but many people disagreed. Some Asian guy replied and said "Yeah, Blacks are racist, so I'm raising my children to stay away from them." Fucking great. A thousand upvotes.  Thank you though. Hopefully it gets better for everyone.    Ha. I happen to be both. And the worst part is most people think they're doing something right. And the majority just agrees with them. How is the situation ever gonna change if the majority (who also happen to be the loudest) is against you?  I guess I will unsure from them. Small subreddits are really great!    Hey, this AskReddit thread didn't even get to my front page. I still looked at it and ... yeah. What a terrible mistake. What I have is from the the subreddit 'Videos', and there's this video of a bunch of kids, who are Black, who then steal from a reporter. I didn't watch the whole thing, and like the idiot that I am, I read the comments. I always do. Usually, I just check the first three to see if people are being racist or not. Sometimes they aren't .... it's usually in small subreddits, I must admit.   Yeah they shouldn't get us down. Today was just a rough day, and to see this didn't help. Worst it, tomorrow I'll see the same. And the day after tomorrow, the same. Etc. I don't know when that will ever end.    Every time I come on here, I am constantly reminded of how most people view my race as dangerous, stupid, pigs, disrespectful ... At least once a week, this reminder gets to the front page. What's even more annoying with Reddit is that people act "smart" with their racism. On youtube, you see the usual "fuck those n-word we should lynch them", which is easily ignorable (thought it gets to you after a while). While on Reddit, people write so formally about how "Black culture is problematic and people who 'practice' it should be eradicated because it's helping no one.", then they get gold, thousands of upvotes, thousands of replies with people just agreeing. Then you have the sarcastic comments about how "Oh yeah, and the *real* racists/idiots are white."  I don't know. I really wish I were not black sometimes. I'm tired of living in countries where I'm seen as inferior no matter what. One group of idiotic people who happen to be black just ruins it for us all, but an entire idiotic nation with people who happen to be white has nothing to do with the world population of whites.  It really sucks.   ** This subreddit is sincerely the best. All the thoughtful, beautiful and uplifting comments really made my afternoon that much better. I don't know how to thank you all. I am seriously at awe at how amazing of a subreddit this is, all this because of amazing human beings like you all. I am very lucky. Thank you again.   After reading all of your nice comments and having a good cry (I'm sorry I sound like a cry-baby, but it did help), I am on my way to buying my favorite food of all time, and I will watch my favorite show until the night. I am feeling so great. Again, it is all thanks to you!   Oh, yes. My daily dose of "Remember, kid, people will hate you because you're black." Just what I needed on this fine Sunday evening.   I bought this! To be honest, going through the pages a couple of times is fun. Then you just store it somewhere until to make friends to show it off to.    I'm from Canada, so I'm used to it being free. 124 euros sounds hella expensive to me :/   I know I was agreeing with you ... I said I don't know how bad it is objectively, though subjectively it is really bad, but I'd probably not be the first person to get treated.    For some reason, I really don't like random words on tattoos in general, so the "Damaged" is just too cheesy for me. However, the "HAHAHA", I'm sold. For some other reason.   I am in Germany. I don't know if there are any clinics I can just walk into or not. Either way, I think I will wait the few weeks. Today wasn't too bad of a day. No large "booms" yet (I slept through the day because of the headache though).    I don't know how legitimate it is. Obviously next to a pregnant lady and a kid with a broken arm, I think I can wait. But then at the same time, I would be a pregnant lady with a broken arm next to someone with a really hard headache, I would think that I could wait.  Ha. It's really bad. Comparatively though? I don't know :/   Honey glazed is the bomb! And sometimes I would add pure honey on top of that ish! It's amazing!    I have big boobs unfortunately, and I cannot go braless even if I wanted to. Actually, I don't even like the feeling of not having something support me. I have terrible bras though. I got fitted once in my life, and honestly I hate those well-fitted bras simply because it still feels like my boobs are swimming in a sack, when I want them to be tight and not move an inch. And ... back problems. I'm at a point where I can't walk for too long without at least carrying a backpack.  I am very envious of you, but also very happy!! :)    Interesting? I don't know, but vanilla ice cream with cheerios is honestly the best thing I've ever 'made' and tasted. I bet it's super common though. I just didn't have milk that night, so I used the thing closest to milk that I know of.   Lately, I have been feeling like I'm basically about to die.   I have been having daily headaches for as long as I can remember, but about four months ago, they had stopped. Well, they came back last week and this time, I honestly feel like I am dying.  The right side of my face usually is where I feel the headache, and when I push on my neck arteries, it really hurts my temple, and it feels like something is about to explode there. The headache is like a constant background noise, with loud booms of sound every few minutes or so. They are destabilizing. Sometimes I can't even keep my eyes open, it hurts so much.   I recently moved to a new country, and I still don't have insurance, so I must wait a couple more weeks before seeing a doctor. I just wanted to share this, in hopes of finding someone with the same/similar symptoms.   (ironically, right now, I feel nothing).   Thank you all for your answers! At least I know death isn't on its way :)  	106
