    Hi all, 28yo here. The small company I work for is rolling out pensions on 1 February (where they match our contribs to a certain figure still TBC). A recent windfall means I also have 10,000 to put into this in some form, but would it be better invested in an ISA instead of sticking it in what I can only assume will be a fairly standard pension? As background, I already own a home and have some money tucked away as emergency funds.                                                         Assuming, that is, it will work with current Wii U consoles. Intrigued to hear your thoughts, and if you think Nintendo would ever sell it separately at all.               This is like a Clockwork Orange scenario, you can't just not watch movies anymore or They will tie you up and force you to. So which do you go for?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            	104
 I use to be the same way. I always looked forward to sleeping right after school just so I can escape and enjoy my dreams. That was one of my highlights of my day.  It's all on the people you meet and befriend, it's crazy how one person can change what you look forward to.   I have the same thing happening to me. I try to do what draken273 mention and detach myself but, its a hard thing for me to do when you keep thinking of being able to please this new SO. Foreplay is a must and just try switching up. If you're feeling like you're about to get there, stop and concentrate on other areas of your SO: lick her nipple, grab her breast and kiss the neck. Just think of finding a way to stop and compose yourself without your SO losing her momentum.   That's what I have to offer as advice but, I also think it's all in your head. With me and my Ex we went at it for I would say average length 20-30min. But know that I'm with this new person I keep thinking about being able to please her and it just affects me negatively. For my situation at least, I think I just need to get that thought out of my head and just be in the moment; not worrying whether or not I'm going to last long.   Hope you find something that helps, and don't forget to add updates for others   That was really awesome and inspiring just seeing a group of people showing up to help.    Anyone else wondering if those pens are purchaseable......?   thanks for the link, the other songs were badass as well!  Got a bit saddened when I saw that they're from Italy. Small chance of being able to see them play :( hahaha   That was an excellent post! Glad to have found something different that is actually good. Really random but the song was pretty sick!    I feel dumb for doubting the initial sound. The song was awesomely chill, going to look up more, thanks for posting this!  	7
       And what's the latest on the NAU?                                                            Does anyone have any DIY plans? Can I use a kerosene-driven motor? (We're off grid.)  I figure I can salvage an old refrigerator by cutting a hole in the top for his head and then sealing the gap around his neck with rubber from salvaged retreads (along with duct tape to make a good, tight pressure seal.)  Also, is it feasible to combine this setup with a composting toilet? If I can avoid opening the fridge door more than once a year or so to hose out his filth, I'd *really* like to avoid it. (I'm very self-reliant and it is going to be a *real* pain to aim the hose with one hand while manually pumping his oxygen bag with the other, especially with him hanging there by his neck/head like a baseball bat hanging in a rack.)  To be frank this is a **lot** more hassle than an rugged individual like myself is used to. What I really need are Volunteerists to preserve this young man's life. If you *insist* on compensation, I can throw a few Bitcoins your way once in a while.                              Does the Castle Doctrine apply? Should I "Stand My Ground"? Can I blow her away?                        Ted in 1977, to *High Times* magazine:  "I got my physical notice 30 days prior to. Well, on that day I ceased cleansing my body. No more brushing my teeth, no more washing my hair, no baths, no soap, no water. Thirty days of debris build. I stopped shavin and I was 18, had a little scraggly beard, really looked like a hippie. I had long hair, and it started gettin kinky, matted up. Then two weeks before, I stopped eating any food with nutritional value. I just had chips, Pepsi, beer-stuff I never touched-buttered poop, little jars of Polish sausages, and Id drink the syrup, I was this side of death, Then a week before, I stopped going to the bathroom. I did it in my pants. poop, piss the whole shot. My pants got crusted up."  Ted in 2013, to the media at a Las Vegas Gun Show:   "But here is what is wrong with America today. We have a president, and everybody better write this down, and memorize this. The president of the United States goes to the Vietnam Memorial Wall and pretends to honor 58,000 American heroes who died fighting communism and then he hires, appoints and associates with communists. He pretends to pay honor to men who died fighting communism, and then he hangs out with, hires and appoints communists. He is an evil dangerous man who hates America and hates freedom. And we need to fix this as soon as possible."    2013: The Year of Linux on the Desktop.         Just wondering.            Once or twice a day . . . well, you know.  Also a fair amount of unexplained beachballing.  Any suggestions?                     Because they are the only time Ron Paul has been truly honest about what he believes.   What are your sincere opinions on the "Tea Party," End-Timer Evangelicals, and the general "if lib'ruls is fer it, I'm 'gainst it" Archie Bunker-types that have come to dominate/define the Party?  Do you have any reasonable hope/chance of reclaiming the Party, or will it require a major political realignment for any sort of sensible, reasonable Conservatism to take hold?   What are your sincere opinions on the "Tea Party," End-Timer Evangelicals, and the general "if lib'ruls is fer it, I'm 'gainst it" Archie Bunker-types that have come to dominate/define the Party?  Do you have any reasonable hope/chance of reclaiming your Party, or will it require a major political realignment for any sort of sensible, reasonable Conservatism to take hold?           They seem to lose all interest in children post-birth, to say nothing of their persistent contempt for the mothers.  Why? Is it similar to the fetishization of puppies and kittens, which often mutates into the neglect and dispossession of millions of dogs and cats?  What happens to the "Respecting a Culture of Life^TM" crowd after "God's Littlest Angels^TM" are launched into a world of neglect and abuse that these "pro-lifers" have created for them with their toxic, regressive politics?      ***RESIGN THE NRA.***  Then, vow ***never*** to give them another penny of your money, ***EVER***.        Why isn't he on the Sunday morning news shows?   [Make sure to check the list twice!](http://www.latimes.com/news/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-sandy-hook-shooting-victims-20121215,0,1042668.story)               Was everyone able to get along, or did your crazy right-wing relatives roll out the bizarre conspiracy theories?          I wonder if it's because I posted this?  http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/over-lution.jpg   I'd love to see this shitware driven from the face of the Earth. Can I safely ignore it, or is it a valid "security update"?  Better yet, can I delete Adobe Flash entirely from my Mac? Any special steps? Since we're in an HTML 5 world now, I don't see the point of even having it.  Thanks in advance                              Bloggers would report the strange, disturbing, morbid and often profane search strings that searchers had used which led to their webpages.    Is there any current equivalent?                  They just don't get that they've violated the "Non-Spamggression Principle."  If they had just left everyone on the Internet alone and gone about their own business, everything would have been just fine.  But after millions and millions and millions more of provacative, deliberate, and direct violations of the "Non-Spamggression Principle," they forced our hand. A man can only take so much Spamggression before he stands up for himself and fights the PaulSpam Machine.  We're just defending ourselves.         Discuss.   Discuss.                        WHOO-HOO!!!  Many of you are on the road to Tampa right now! Let's see your pictures! Post links to your blogs! (Starbucks and McDonald's have free Wi-Fi so you can check in from the road.)  How many vehicles are in your Ronvoy? I hope you all brought your signs and are posing for lots of pictures at roadside attractions to spread the message of Liberty!  Can't wait to see you all! Where is everyone staying? Tell us your stories!   If I wanted to/were available to talk, I would have called rather than texted.  Why do people insist on doing this?      Goodbye Florida.      Once the seniors of Florida find out about Paul Ryan's plans to dismantle Social Security and Medicare, it's even more over for Mitt than it was before.      Please post where you're from and how you'll be getting to Tampa (plane, bus, Ronvoy, car, etc.)  If you're going by car, some of you may be on the road already. Are you keeping a blog of your travels? If not, start! Post links here so we can all see them!     After all, Hitler's followers were able to successfully plan and carry out rallies in support of their candidate.    Are people getting excited out there?  This event has so much potential to make the Liberty Movement even more well-known. Thank you Dr. Paul for making it all possible!      Does anyone know the new shortcut?   The Libertarians should form an alliance with the Church of Scientology and get SEA ORG on the job.   Have you bought your tickets? How are you getting there? The lineup of bands and speakers looks pretty awesome. Are there any hotels offering special Paul Festival rates?   Was it when you learned of the Ron Paul Newsletters?  Was it the Moneybombs begging you for your "worthless fiat currency" rather than gold?  Was it when you realized he'd been a longtime compatriot of American White Nationalists?  Please share your stories.   Please share your stories.      It's been almost a year since Perry organized "the Response" to beg God for rain in Texas.  Is he going to do it again?   Just as Bill Clinton distanced himself from the "Jesse Jackson" wing of the Democratic Party by criticizing Sister Souljah's Black Nationalist lyrics, Mitt Romney's criticism of "ObamaCare" [a deliberate, derisive term the American Right has sought to implant as strongly negative in America's id] was designed to get the NAACP booing at him, thus strengthening the resolve of his own Party's Obama-haters. This will get Mitt Romney donations and volunteers, as well as convey a much wider message.  The Republican dog-whistle: "if *those people* think 'ObamaCare' is good, *you* should hate it, because *'morbidly obese welfare queens in new Cadillacs with 8 kids with 8 different fathers buying vodka at the liquor store with Food Stamps'*."  Just think how many thousands of times Fox News and American Right SuperPACs will run this from this moment up until the election, reference it in their blogs, and AM-spam it 24 hours a day. Look at what they did with the "New Black Panthers" clip, for example.  To deny that this was a calculated move on the Romney campaign's part would be as foolish as denying that Bill Clinton's "Sister Souljah" speech was meant to clearly separate the modern Democratic Party from any association with the rhetoric of the Extremist Left of the late 1960s. (It's important to note that most people had never heard of Sister Souljah before, or since.) Both were messages sent out to/clearly received by their respective intended multiple audiences.

 Sorry about that! Deleting the story. It worked on my Google news page and actually still does.   As the saying goes. An apple a day keeps the Doctor away.   Also, here is the peer-reviewed journal entry (free): http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.f5001   Here is the peer-reviewed journal entry (pay-wall): http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1240420  EDIT: Free version in .pdf format can be found here: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.5869v1.pdf   You're right. However, most people I know, friends and family have bought houses close to work or/and in good neighborhoods. I don't think we in Holland have adopted the American way of buying a house an hour or 2 away from where we work. Also, from my understanding and I could be wrong here, there are a lot of houses for sale in undesirable neighborhoods.  So, I think we the Dutch choose to pay more and thus compete for scarce property.  EDIT: Here is some data from the Dutch Association of Real Estate Agents http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Europe/Netherlands/Price-History       In 2008, house prices fell by 5.3% (-7.5% in real terms)     In 2009, house prices dropped by 1.5% (-2.4% in real terms)     In 2010, house prices rose slightly by 1% (-0.7% in real terms)     In 2011, house prices dropped by 3.8% (-6.2% in real terms)  As you can see, the drop per year is not really dramatic percentage wise.   Just an FYI: The title of this article was changed after I submitted the story. I took a screenshot from Google search showing the old title http://imgur.com/1l9h34R.   Houses are scarce in The Netherlands and the pressure on prices has mostly been upward which is what keeps the house prices from tumbling rapidly. The cost of buying a house eats up a large proportion of income for an average Dutch citizen which is part of living in the Netherlands.  Volkskrant did a story about the Dutch economy. Here is the English version of it "10 misconceptions about the Dutch economy" http://www.dutchnews.nl/features/2013/08/volkskrant_10_misconceptions_a.php   If the U.N. confirms the Syrian regimes use of chemical weapons, there are better ways for the U.S., U.K. and their allies to respond instead of bombardment, which would likely kill more non-combatants as we've seen so many times in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Thanks, Chezzik!   Software patents are a problem. The only beneficiaries of software patents have been lawyers and big corporations.

It is never a waste of time to keep reminding people that UK's second most read daily newspaper is a despicable racist rag.

They then put handcuffs on the first woman and left her lying in the street for several minutes.

EDIT: Here is a short post from AFP http://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/portugal-beats-recession-export-led-233733208.html  The recovery was driven mainly by exports, and shrinkage of the economy on a 12-month comparison was halved the data showed.

It's a very common, but now outdated definition of Eastern Europe i.e "Eastern Bloc" or "Communist Bloc"   I find it quite unfortunate. I was (and still am) hoping diplomacy would prevail.

I am not sure how much Fabian Picardo knows of North Korea. In any case, comparing Spain to North Korea is quite insulting to one of the worlds greatest nations. I was hoping diplomacy would prevail here and not cheap jabs.   Here is the peer-reviewed journal entry (pay-wall): http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nm.3262   I lived in Marbella for over a year. I would go once a month to Gibraltar to buy cigarettes since they were much cheaper than in Spain.   I remember the always crowded border crossing with Spaniards going over to shop and the hundred of tourists visiting. It would be a terrible blow to Gibraltar's economy.  I have a hard time believing this will even be considered by the EU let alone implementing it.

From the article:  Agents are not allowed to authorize violent crimes under any circumstances; the most serious crimes must first be approved by federal prosecutors. Still, the department's Inspector General concluded in 2005 that the FBI routinely failed to follow many of those rules.   That was supposedly Putin who is Russia's president.

For two good reasons: Paris already knew. And does the same thing.  The World is able to prove that the Directorate General for External Security (DGSE, special services) systematically collect electromagnetic signals from computers or phones in France, as well as flows between French and abroad: all our communications are spied. All e-mails, text messages, telephone records, access to Facebook, Twitter, are then stored for years.  If this huge database was used by the DGSE who officiates as outside French borders, the case is already illegal. But six other intelligence services, including the Central Directorate of Internal Intelligence (DCRI), customs or Tracfin service fight against money laundering, including the data that draw interest daily. Discreetly on the sidelines of the legality and beyond serious control. Political know perfectly, but the secret is the rule.  This French Big Brother, brother of U.S. services is illegal. However, its existence appears di ...

 I'm fairly sure Clark was supposed to be Jesus, not God. Neither really made sense to me though - I always saw him as Moses.   I want to say Stane, but his relationship with Stark wasn't developed enough and he turns into a Saturday morning cartoon villain at the end.     [It's a great one as well](http://imgur.com/a/L7zDu)   Neutral. The funny guy is always neutral.    I'd argue he's had some of the greatest artists - Miller, Maleev, Queseda, Mack, Lark, Aja, Samnee, Rivera and Romita JR (in his prime) to boot.   Stan Lee's was only really mediocre. Not his best work.   That 2Pac/James Brown mash-up! I love it. Shame it was misused in the actual film.    It was too early for this. The IMDb scores haven't settled yet.    From Dusk Till Dawn   Watchmen - a panel by panel adaption of the comics with the depth of the characters taken out and replaced with poor acting and an emotionless ending. Anything remotely clever in the movie is pegged from the comics, but there was cleverer stuff in there that they ignored. I dislike Snyder's visual style very much and the movie ended up looking like one of the numerous comic imitators of the 80s. Gilliam was right - it was unfilmable.   Nope, just look at the plethora of good Stephen King movies.   I think the final battle was flawed, but only because I found it ridiculously boring, not because of excessive property destruction. I would have liked to have seen Supes saving people though.   Y: The Last Man - it is my go to comic for proving that comics aren't for children or cape enthusiasts and don't have to be dark and edgy to be great. The characters are great and binge reading it reminds me of binge watching a season of an excellent TV show. The dialogue is smart and quippy and the plot - whilst a riff on a Mary Shelly novel - is quite original in this modern age.  I'd easily recommend it other one of Bryan K Vaughan's other works like Saga - which continuously falls into the trap of "we're allowed to do anything, so we shall."   It doesn't really get great until the Omniman twist, so I'd say read a bit beyond that.    Daniel Craig working with Chad Stahelski and David Leitch of John Wick   The dialogue is probably the only thing bringing it down or me (although I'd rather there were more Fantasy element).   His review of the Raid disappointed me as well.   First Class...   Iron Man 3 - I already enjoyed it the first viewing, but I didn't realise how great the character work in that movie was until it was pointed out to me.   I loved him in the Walking Dead.    Animal Farm (1954) holds up really well. It's not as good as the book, but is very faithful and as a result retains the intellegence of Orwell's writings.   After watching it, I get so many more references.   Toy Story 3 - not sure which is more emotional, the toys all accepting death as they enter the incinerator or when Andy realised he's too old for his toys and gives them away.    The dogfights in Serenity are absolutely beautiful, but his dialogue - whilst I am a fan of it - won't match SW's tone at all.   3.8   Ferris Bueller's Day Off   Another fun fact: Mysterio tricked Daredevil into thinking a newborn was the devil and it drove him nuts.    I'm quite find of a run from about a decade ago where he became a teacher.   The open ending gabe me an Empire Strikes Back vibe.    Emily Blunt   Unfortunately. Jeph Leob at his worst.   It's a toss up between Moon and Dredd. Both are underrated gems.    Physical.   Have you grown sick of it?  I love it, but I'm a but of a Matthew Vaughn fanboy so...   Oh.  I thought /u/JosephFurguson meant a comic. I love his comic work.   What work of his was rejected by Marvel/DC?   I'm not sure. For me, it's a toss-up between Fargo, True Detective and Hannibal. I wasn't a big fan of Fargo's convient ending TBH.   In related news: I hear Kelly Sue DeCormick is getting a TV show.    I don't get the "style over substance" argument. Film is a visual medium - style is substance.   To everyone who complained about her lack of action in the last act I say: she was pregnant. It would have been so difficult to make her do anything substantial.   It was probably a reference to whatever movie Star Wars nabbed it from.   Lord of the Rings - hear me out. I wasn't really enjoying it from the get-go, but I was watching it with a group of friends who kept insisting the next part of the trilogy was better. The films did get progressively better, but they still weren't *that* good. I was largely bored and uninterested in the characters, the only thing that really interested me was the lore. As a result, I felt like I wasted 9 hours on mediocre movies (and I know I could have skipped the last half-hour of Return of the King). I appreciate the love and hard-work that went into making them, it just didn't click with me.    It's cool. I was just saying I'd find one of those series getting a movie more interesting, the same way I'd find a Good Omens movie more appealing than a random YA novel that was enjoyable, but not that great.      I never thought Marvel had anything to do with the comics I mentioned - I was making a point about CBMs in general.   I agree with you on everything, but generalising CBMs. I agree that some people are getting tired of Superhero movies, but I bet those people would kill to see more movies like Sin City, The History of Violence and V for Vendetta (even the Zack Snyder movies I'm not a fan of).  There are so many great comics I'd rather see get an adaption than a C-list Marvel hero - I say this a massive Marvel Comics fan. I'd like to see Maus, East of West, Saga or Y: The Last Man come to the big screen before Ant-Man.       Prometheus doesn't even have a bad score. It's not as bad a movie as people make out. Still not great though.  Edit: I'm not too found of The Good Wife. Can I blame Ridley for that as well?   I actually think his writing is better when he has another creative (not writer) who can match him. I think Brad Bird is just the guy who can give us that. Though the trailer for Tomorrowland did nothing for me, Bird has made it my most anticipated film for the rest of the year (more so than Star Wars or Ant-Man).   I prefered the Goldeneye N64 game, but Sean Bean was great in that movie.    That movie looks kinda cool.   I agree that they had some great films, but the Craig films are so much more accessible for a modern audience. I love those movies, but most of them are quite dated and may seem kind of silly. I think that might off-put people. If they really enjoyed Casino Royale and Skyfall, they should backtrack to the Connery and Moore films (I don't like the Brosnan ones - the dialogue in them is pretty poor).   If you must watch any two, watch Casino Royale and Skyfall. Casino Royale is a well-crafted thriller set to a backdrop of an extremely high-stakes poker game and Skyfall is a beautifullly shot thriller  about a man rebuilding himself after a great loss. Both have great action setpieces and surprisingly decent character work, but what makes them really great is watching the world around Bond change and grow.      That's not remotely true. The anti-Marvel circlejerk is just as bad - maybe worse - than the pro-Marvel circlejerk. I don't even like those movies, but it annoys me to see them hated on it that way.   Do you have a photo of your Justice League?   Demon in a Bottle, Extremis, Armour Wars, Doom Quest and The Invincible Iron Man by Matt Fraction.   IMO, Glover is completely wrong for Miles. Not only is he far too old, but personality-wise, he's much more in line with Peter. I get that he's an actor, but I think Peter would be a much more natural fit.   It's been pretty unpopular the last few years. I can only think of two points in this century people cared about them and that's when Mark Waid and Jonathan Hickman wrote them (I wish more people read the Dwayne McDuffie run)   Every cameo could be our last. We just have to make the most of them.   Thor: The Dark World. That was a fucking pretty movie.    Try following [this](http://www.comicbookherald.com/the-complete-x-men-reading-order-guide-modern-marvel-comics-era/) on Marvel Unlimited (only reasonable way to do this). It's missing several notable series though. NYX, New Mutants (volume 2), New X-Men (volume 2) and Mike Carey's run on X-Men and X-Men Legacy come to mind. Other than that, it's pretty comprehensive.   Nope   Agreed.   Yep!   Nope.    * Neo-noir flavour * Borderline heroes/antiheroes * Subtle, but meaningful political messages   I watched John Wick with my Mum and she was in tears when the beagle died.   The Birds   Or Matt Fraction's.   All the Iron Man films are great at this.   Well it's not looking good for either of those two in the New 52 either. Superman is a Superdick and Batman is... Well...    A more personal event. Now that these movies are so successful, they can experiment more with different genres. If the Avengers were tasked with saving people from a giant wave, how would that affect them. Would they experience survivors guilt or would they keep moving onwards?   Good idea.  RemindMe! 1,100 days   Nope, but that was a very fun movie.   Jason, Heracules, Argus, Asclepius, Iolaus, Medea and Orpheus are just a few members of the forever rotating line-up.   Yes for the Incredibles, and no on Kick-Ass. I actually think it's his worst movie, but I still really enjoyed it though.   I don't think I can give an explanation that can rival some of the other users on this thread, but can I recommend John Ostrander's Suicide Squad run? It has a different team to the movie, but I think that's the vibe they're going for. It's surprisingly good and worth a read.   That'd be pulp fiction at its finest.   16 and it is a toss up between Matthew Vaughn and Brad Bird, but I have favourites for both.   Saving Private Ryan.   Not a movie, but the play Journey's End is a brilliant depiction of it. Read the script if it's not showing as it's fantastic.   You saw him get tired after doing a lot of running. I liked that.   It is Phase 2. Some officials have said so.   Why wouldn't you include Ant-Man?   I think Quicksilver died because of licensing issues, not becauee he'd be too OP for Civil War.   Probably because they're poor ensemble movies. Even First Class, only really gave decent focus to three characters.   I'm confused as to why people think he's confusingly redundant. It probably has something to do with the fact he has no powers, which is to ignore the fact he's the team's tactician and has fought (and defeated) gods by himself.   [Unless it's the one where he releases a miniature version of himself from his palm. That one's awesome.](http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/newpower3.jpg)   Yeah, Supes is Invincible, but that doesn't make him boring - bad writing makes him boring. The best Superman stories involve moral conflict over his actions or the impact his presence has on other people. The bad ones just have him punch stuff for 22 pages.    That's disappointing. This is probably my favourite bit of the movie, yet they've revealed it before the majority of their audience has watched it.   The Winter Soldier has more relavance to the plot of Age of Ultron if that influences your decision.   Plotwise, The Winter Soldier is miles away from the comic arc, but it perfectly nailed the comic's tone.   If the same script for Inglourious Basterds was interpreted by the actors slightly differently, that movie would be terrifying.   Goodfellas, Casino and The Wolf of Wall Street   Interstellar and WALL*E   I read it this weekend and loved every page, except the ones with Tom Foster.   It was kind of forgettable. It was just a really heavy-handed excuse to get people to side with the Hulk. World War Hulk is a great story and worth a read (along with Pak's other Hulkcules works).   World War Hulk   So we'll find out who Danvers is played by this tike next year, probably. I'm excited to see more Josh Brolin. He's a fantastic actor with a great screen presence. Even in his more minor roles, he's almost always the most memorable character.   I hope they do more Marvel Colours books. They were the best retellings Marvel has done. I hope they do an Iron Man: Silver or a Fantastic Four: Purple.    Is it me or are Iceman, Spider-Man and The Human Torch all the same person?   In the comics, weren't the Chitari just a Skrull crime family?   Yes and I'm saying Marvel Studios, Warner Brothers, Fox and Sony need to mix it up much more.  You can either make Wonder Woman a boring, female Superman or you could create a Game of Thrones-style fantasy world for her to inhabit and have her face a more personal threat.    I think the big problem here is that there isn't much on screen variation between movies. They're mostly pretty similar. If you read the comics, you'll know there's so much more that can be done in the genre than is being done in the films.   This has happened in TV. Before The Office, having a laugh track was the norm and now shows with laugh tracks - typically - aren't considered as great.   I think it's crucial to show superheroes actually saving people. I think it's kind of a "save the cat" moment. Age of Ultron does it surprisingly well.   The few friends of mine who read comics IRL thibk it's great. I think it completely slowed down the Bendis era (my favourite Avengers run), but set the Avengers in a interesting direction afterwards.   The whole DnA saga deserves a read. I'd say he should Definately read Thanos (2003-2004) and Annihilation a read first.   [Here's a pretty decent reading order](http://i.imgur.com/FUM3v.jpg)   Astonishing X-Men. It's written by Joss Whedon (writer-director of Age of Ultron) and drawn by John Cassaday (who Disney had enough faith in to allow him to draw Star Wars). It features lots of quirky one-liners, great characters and a very similar team dynamic. It's 24 issues, then a Giant-Sized special.   If you have Netflix, I recommended giving Firefly a watch. It has far more in common with Age of Ultron than you'd think (beyond Joss Whedon). It's 14 episodes, then a two-hour movie.   Edit: I feel the need to explain myself - despite, the fact no-one has explained why they disagree with me. Astonishing X-Men is the comic equivalent to Age of Ultron (which I've seen). It includes heavy themes, but handles them with genuinely funny humour and has a well-balanced cast of characters that is so perfectly Joss Whedon. There is no comic that comes closer to replicating the feeling of Age of Ultron in my opinion and frankly, it's better than a lot of other comics recommend here. Yes, it does star the X-Men, but it should still excite you so much more for the film than reading the (equally great) Hickman run as it's closer to what you should expect from the film.  The same goes for Firefly.    Or the first to show what a bad mother fucker Thanos is.   Sorry, but I think Fox own the Phalanx.   It's an Archie Comics reference, yes.   Shaft, starring Michael Cera.   Throw in Spider-Woman and you've got a badass team.   I thought she was 19 in the Ultimate Universe.  	116
 I'm puzzled too. It was at +10 one second. The next it was at -14. Either way, I'll happily take the downvotes on behalf of /r/motorcycles. I don't know a single rider that isn't extremely cautious with their driving. I ride to avoid traffic, but I also ride for the exhileration. At no time do I mesh those two desires. If I want to satisfy my craving for [power](http://www.instantclarkson.com/) I go to a long stretch of empty road near the airport where I live. I even dated a girl that loved the whole motorcycle thing and pissed her off every time she rode with me because she wanted to go fast and I refused.    Spot on. I've had a handful of crashes, all but one of them have been because of someone else in a car. The one that wasn't, I ran over a nail that popped my tyre. I've got a theory that a lot of road accidents could be avoided by less restrictive speed limits, and the same logic applies to riding vs driving. In a car it's easy to switch off because of the feeling of security a car provides. If you're on a bike, you're acutely aware that you could go flying 50 feet in the air and land in a ditch if anyone makes a wrong move. Now who is going to be the more cautious driver?   On behalf of bikers everywhere, we know. The last thing the majority of riders need is a lecture on their own mortality. The majority of us are respectful and safe.    My ex's exes were a Rockefeller and pro basketball player. Jokes on them though, because I'm the one she fell in love with.

I'm guessing the principal is that by not trying to make the software perfect, you get it out early and keep developing it from there?   Yessssss. Exactly.

Your ebullient use of the English language aside, my point was that it was clearly not the most amazing content, but the story behind it connected with me in a way that I could appreciate.  Could it be that the things people find interesting differs wildly between individuals?   I was more thinking of the post where OP used his dead father's last fiver to get a beer when he was legal. It was just a picture of a beer and a fiver, but as someone who lost their father as a teen, I appreciated the post. Begging for donations is different.   Unless that girl was Elle Woods. Then she'd dump your candy ass.   Wait. I thought this was photoshopped. Is it not?   Nothing humble about it, except I can't afford to go any of those place.   I've dealt with an unfair amount of tragedy in my 27 years. Don't have a problem with this at all. Whatever helps.    Was in an emotionally abusive relationship for a while. Got out of it when I realized things weren't getting better. Turned out the entire time we were dating she was living undiagnosed with MS, which played a big part in her craziness level. Anyways, this won't be a popular opinion, but I think it takes a particularly weak person to internalise the emotional abuse they're getting. Both men and women. I couldn't ever take a word she said seriously because she was so clearly trying to say the most hurtful thing she could imagine. Why would you give a person like that the time of day? Why let their comments affect you? It never made sense to me.    I dunno, living in a major tourist destination, I could probably make my way around europe and america crashing on the couches of girls I've hooked up with. Tourists love the local boys.

If you're having content problems I feel bad for you son, I got 99 problems but reposting ain't one.    Building a stadium that gives your team an advantage over the visitor is standard practice among most sports. A lot more of the new stadiums in English football do this, not to mention everything they do with the pitch to get an advantage. Also, it's not against the rules. You can't get busted for smoking weed then point out the guy that's drunk and say what he's doing is worse.   Probably because their shitty O-Line ruined what could have been a top 5 QB   This is pretty common practice in a lot of sports. Wembley Stadium in particular. Playing fake crowd noise is not.   Technically according to [cat law](https://youtu.be/WGEGy21Yk9U?t=45s) you're right. The apartment is his now. But cat law differs slightly to human law. Kinda like bird law.

I'm pretty cynical about most things, but I find it very hard to imagine the American military has come to a point where valour is no longer a core value.   I'm ashamed to admit I got the year wrong, and somehow forgot about Palace making Suarez cry. My LFC Hater badge will be on the desk in the morning.    Shit. Of course it's that match. That would explain why I spotted this. I watched it at least five times out of pure schadenfreude.    I kiiiinda checked, but I'm about as confident as Rhodri Giggs at a family reunion. The only match between the two sides I came across in 2014, the score was 1-2. The 2013 fixture ended 3-1.   Fair. But I was thinking in terms of content and the reddit community as a whole. Google+ and Facebook users don't get a goddamn fucking ridiculous doge meme on a NASCAR, then it into the All Star Race. It's shit like THAT that keeps me here.

I think Reddit is far past masquerading as anything other than what it is: the most influential website in the world. This happens with a lot of cultural movements, of which Reddit can certainly qualify. They start out with upstanding value systems that people gravitate toward. But the more people gravitate, the harder it becomes to uphold those ideals. Reddit gets more and more popular, requiring more and more money. In order to keep making that money to service the users, values are sacrificed. Goes for political parties, religions, you name it. I'm disappointed but wholly unsurprised.   This is my friend's business! Big up Evan!   Sorry, but no. Boston.   I dont know of many F1 drivers that haven't practiced from an early age....   Thanks. Definitely going on my letter to Santa.

There's no way I could afford flying out to a driving school any time soon.   No, unfortunately. Her apt complex doesn't allow pets :(   THAT I can understand. Obligatory brush with death story:   My days riding 50cc scramblers saved my life a few years back. I was going too fast around a blind corner and there was a van parked in the road. I swerved to avoid it but another car was coming in the opposite direction. I hit the brakes hard, locking up my rear which put the bike sideways, skidding straight toward the car. The moment I realized I was going to hit it head on, I let go of the rear brake and the bike popped up and straightened out, grazing the driver's side of the car and sparing my life.   Oh dear god no. Definitely not planning on jumping straight into an F1 car. I want to take a proper course and everything. And yes, I drive every day, but only ever under 60kph in beat up Opel Astra. Doesn't exactly hone your driving sense.    Unfortunately not. I live on a 21 square mile island where the speed limit is 50kph. Having a burp in an F1 car is high up on my bucket list though. I'm dying to know if I have the balls to give it some real welly.    Alonso might disagree there. Or Stirling Moss........   That makes a lot of sense. Sounds similar to MotoGp. I guess what's tripping me up is just a general lack of knowledge for how it feels going fast on four wheels. I've always gotten my kicks on two.    I feel like that's probably a good thing. I've only ever seen a fedora worn well in magazines.    ? am I missing something?      Looks like he's about to dingle his dangle on the rim...   I used to be SUPER into swords as a kid.

Same thing applies, although it's not so much crying over really horrific shit, more the slow, painful realization as you slip deeper into the rabbit hole of life that nothing is going to change, and there's nothing you can do about it. That said, we do see some pretty awful road fatalities. I didn't think journalism would teach me what a kneecap looks like.   They were actually the OG truthers. Well, them and the sinking of the Maine. We've just forgotten about that particular conspiracy theory.   Exactly. I never understood this about fans wanting athletes to be upstanding moral paragons of sportsmanship. Players dive. They flop. They do anything they can to win. It's up to the people making the rules to ensure the integrity of the game is maintained despite this.    I mean... That's kinda exactly how America started   Or... y'know.

 James Shields? Or maybe Cole Hamels?   The guy's got some sick stuff, that's for sure.      Yes, but they're the only ones who can really do anything about this problem.    I'm amazed at how many minor league chances he's gotten. D was a great pitcher once, but....   Ruben Amaro should have cleaned house a year or two earlier when those older guys still had real value. Then again, he might have had an owner who told him not to sell. Their loss. I hear their farm system ain't great either, so hopefully Phils fans enjoyed their run...it's gonna be awhile before they're back again.    The Dems would be smart to go with Rendell or someone new. Sestak is a re-tread; maybe he deserved better and could beat Toomey this time, but I'd go another direction there.   PPP's polls lean to the left. Whenever I see one, I always mentally add a few points for the GOP candidate. They're more accurate that way.    They won't allow transactions with ghosts.   One of the BitShares assets would be good. Or Nubots if their bots are turned on.       Intolerance and religion seem to have a close relationship much of the time.       Gorgeous. According to landscape artist Francis McComas, Point Lobos features the "greatest meeting of land and water in the world".    I was hoping everyone would tell Boras to stuff it. This just encourages him to continue his ways. Apparently, they work.    I'm not convinced it's a winner. Why have the Democrats, who naturally hold that constituency, turned away from the politics of poverty? They've become the party of the middle class and modern working people. The poor have nowhere else to go unless they're right-wing Christians or choose not to vote. I just don't see these country club Republicans as having a whole lot of appeal to those groups.

Ah yes, the poster child for poverty in America: Willard M. Romney.    I'm half joking, but I do recall reading somewhere that he owned the Oklahoma team that affiliated with the Dodgers, where did set off a game of musical chairs, though I'm sure it wasn't the only factor by any means.    It's all Magic Johnson's fault. He owned part of a minor league team that affiliated with another team and they moved it to the Dodgers. That set off a ripple effect and the dominoes fell all over baseball.     I never thought he'd show up there at this point.   Rick Perry couldn't name all three branches of government.    That "push" and "pull" description is right on target for Windows 8.         And the last Padre time actually PLAYED in an All Star Game was four years ago.    Terrific!      Has anybody noticed the Senate is in GOP hands now? Confirming liberals is tough or well nigh impossible. Obama's throwing forward some people he thanks have a chance.    Is NuBits backed by collateral?       Whenever a president takes international actions (of almost any sort), he is criticized. This group of Republicans couldn't even find Paris on a map. An astonishing number of House GOPers do not even have passports.    He's definitely biased. But he documented this pretty well, I thought, using NXT's own block explorer. As someone who has held NXT myself, I'm truly interested in knowing whether it is a decentralized currency.   I don't think that tampering with the First Amendment is the way to go. If we had publicly funded elections (or crowd-funded ones), and the voters actually held all candidates/campaigns to the expectation they would honor this, then there would be a public consensus to shame anyone who spent more outside of this system.       Is that why they get scared into voting for people like Ted Cruz?   Foxes guarding the henhouse. I feel very sorry for Texans that they're stuck with this guy...and so are the rest of us.

However, the privatization schemes are the direct results when you get conservatives to rule.

I think the article is bit misleading because a lot of people that I know have not replaced watching TV for different hobbies.  I think people have switched to watching videos online as part of Netflix, Hulu Plus, and Bitorrent (which is illegal).  Also, people use DVRs now and watch TV at later dates.  The Nielsen ratings do not capture these statistics and therefore, they are understating how many people are actually watching broadcast or cable TV.   It is probably because it is now legal, so cops are going to look for it more often.  The cops are probably expecting that there will be spike in the recreational use of the drug because it is easier to access now.

I just do not get it.   I do not like all of the social conservative talk.  I personally favor same-sex marriage and I hate all of the "family value" when it comes to homophobia especially when same sex couples are trying to form family units that the social conservatives value.  I can totally understanding when it comes to abortion when abortion is considered to be "abortion of convenience" and there is real no health justification for it.  I am beginning to oppose abortion in all cases where it is considered to be a "abortion of convenience" instead of health reasons or the women has drastic circumstances that make her to get an abortion. I am pro-choice but only for health cases or the mother is dire circumstances where having a child is not considered to be a feasible option.

Please PM me if you are interested if you want to contact him for a gig.   Even though he did the right thing.  It is still a major felony to illegal use your credentials to access information that you did not have access to.   I am sorry, that makes his crime a felony.   (http://www.peterleeson.com/Does_the_Market_Self_Correct.pdf)   The reality is that market does not "self-correct". It takes both investment from both the government and private sector to grow business.    How is the private sector supposed to "self-correct" a horrendous labor participation rate?  If the market was to "self-correct" the labor participation rate, we would still see significant downward pressure on wages which would lead to greater inequity in the economy.  Greater inequity in the economy eventually leads to reduced consumer spending .  It is all a vicious cycle that will not end until we do something about income inequality.  Until the government changes the tax laws to incentivize companies from stopping hoarding cash, you are not going to see any future investment    That is invasive form of privacy violation.    Go the Four Star Theater on 12111 Valley View Street, Garden Grove, CA -  (http://tinyurl.com/k35pzwt)  The movie plays for $4 tomorrow.   It is an election year. So  it should be expected that they would not be in session as much.   I think it is showing that sequester properly work.   How about the United States?   I think there is a place off Garden Grove Blvd and Harbor BLvd. It is called Mary's Hair Salon and they charge like $6 dollars and give real good #2 haircuts. (Note:They are not opened on Sunday)  (The address is approximately is 12101 Garden Grove Blvd, Garden Grove, CA 92843     They would even do this to white women?   The GOP surrenders its war own on Obamacare and agrees to massive tax hikes on the super wealthy.   Nope. Just at a meeting.   Maybe, that is why the AOL exec is firing a large part of the workforce on Patch.   Who is going to believe this guy? Not me.   If the bus runs later than 15 minutes, than you need to find an oral complaint with the OCTA about that specific route coming late. If runs more than 15 minute late three times in a month, then you need to file a formal written complaint. with the OCTA.  If it runs more than five times late in a month, then you need to physically appear at the next OCTA board of directors meeting and write a formal written letter to the OC Register about the bus system running late.  (And believe the OC Register is willing take to report any story about the governmental inefficiency)   I hate the route 43 bus going south at night. It is always damn late.  Also, the 56 can be also infamously late if you take it certain times at night.   Maybe you should go to NA before you decide to get some pussy. There is a lot of personal flaws within you that the steps would clean up.   You can try to Sourceforge.  They are always looking for people to help out with coding projects.   Wow, I stay busy all day with answering ads.     Another method that I use to get news fast is type into Google: is "Twitter" + the name of the news source that you want to get.  The Twitter feed is real fast way to scroll through the headlines to get the stories that you need to know.   use this link to get your news http://reddit.com/r/news/new http://reddit.com/r/worldnews/new http://reddit.com/r/politics/new http://reddit.com/r/science/new http://reddit.com/r/technology/new    With this Congress, I bet we that we fall over the cliff because nothing that Obama will do will make the teabaggers happy.   Good shit!   This is just pure jackassery.   He is a crook who bankrupt the city for so his and his cronies could get rich.   Yep, how about 30 years in jail for that offense.   What is so sinful about caffine? There is a lits of "pious" Christians who are coffee junkies.   Go on Craigslist.  They are dumping the I-Phones like crazy.   Solution: Take the 83 to Disneyland if you live near Main Street.   The war that never ends.    Look, the Greek government has  a terrible record on tax collection. Seizing private property is merely a way from them to collect the unpaid tax revenue from wealthy private individuals.  Part of the reason why the Greek government is in so much debt is because the government has a horrible rate of collecting taxes from private individuals and governments.   It seems there is a never ending struggle with the Muslim Brotherhood and the Egyptian government.  The government just has no idea had to legislate a free speech law that allow the Muslim Brotherhood to have  press freedom, but also properly restricts their activities in order to protect the Egyptian national security interests of the government.   Oh wow! They are bunch of creeps in Cali doing 400+ years to life for crimes for worse than these guys did. If these guys were in the US, they would be on death roe.   A year on jail should teach them a lesson    What a nut bag! Our money spent on oil directly goes funnels crap like this.   Go to LA Decom tonight. It is $25 and there will be a lot of people spinning music. In addition, you can probably hear about some cool afterparties through word of mouth.    My roommate is a good mechanic.  PM me and I will you give his contact information.   Creepy   It is her failure to understand the consequences of her disease and failure to seek out. I think one of the major issues that should have been brought up at sentences was whether there was attempts to get her into a treatment program. If the evidence shows that nobody personally intervened to get her into treatment, this would be a major migitation factor. Once an alcoholic has been offered the opportunity to get treatment, the responsibility is on them to get treatment. It is also their job to remain sober. However, untreated alcoholism without the chance of treatment to me is a considered to be a major migitating circumstance on a criminal case   This is considered to be a torture and deserves a life sentence.   Good idea. It would be good to have somebody to clean up the county jail mess.     The one thing I dreaded about the Santa Anas is sweeping up all of the leaves off my landlord's drive way tomorrow.    If you take the toll road, it will be expense.  The toll road is very helpful for cutting time from a commute from Costa Mesa to Dana Point at night. I remember it shaved a lot of time off my commutes.   I hope she wins, but it is long shot.  It depends how much of the vote that she can get from the Latino, African-American votes, and young, white voters.  If these groups turn out in high numbers despite Texas voter ID laws, she has a possible shot of winning. She needs to focus on these groups than trying to win the middle-class and upper-class white votes.  In Texas, winning a majority of white vote for a Dem is  just not to going to happen for a long, long time.   Perhaps, it will teach us not use nuclear power anymore because nuclear power is just too risk with potential pollution from nuclear power accidents   What we need is better methods of behavioral-modification therapy than relying so much on drugs.     The tea party will be pissed off and be full revolt. You cannot negotiate with those hostage takers.   It is stupid legislature that does not allow people to have a break on their driver's license once they have been clean and sober for a long time. After ten years clean, it should be off your record for good.   I would definitely choose Costa Mesa because its close to a ton of bars within walking distance and very close to the beach.   He is a cruel idiot.  Doesn't he understand the globalization has caused significant youth unemployment?   There is $2 movies at the Main Place.   Here is a reason why socialism that does not work.   I wonder if the end of nuclear power is upon us.   Should he just get life in prison or term of years less than life? It just seems to be some sort of political revenge by the ruling party and this guy had  a secondary role to the crisis.     He draws his (very small market) from using resentful language towards the conservative right.  Just like Savage does except for Savage gets a far bigger audience than Malloy gets because conservative talk radio appeals towards far more people and is more fiscally viable than left-wing talk radio.     For conservatives, Mike Malloy is the Michael Savage of the left.  He takes no prisoners and makes no compromises with conservatives.  Michael Savage is just as bad as Malloy.     Is bad enough that she needs to get some help like outpatient treatment?   YOu mean this fire  http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/09/28/small-brush-fire-erupts-on-hillside-in-san-juan-capistrano/   Look I am white guy that has lived or goes through Santa Ana almost every day. I shop at the local Walmart over Harbor and McFadden.  I use to live off Euclid and First and go downtown all the time.  Never once I was threated.  Sure, my phone was stolen when I left it on the bus, however, that would be expected in any major urban portion of the OC where people are struggling.  Personally, I believe that most of the danger is largely dependent on who associate with Santa Ana.  If you associate or family with gang-bangers or drug-users, you should expect your fair share of violence.  However, it is my  experience that there is little violence as long you do not associate with gangbangers.   If you read the Republican talking points, you hear about them bringing insurance across state lines.  Yeah, like letting big healthcare companies move their insurance to the least regulated states.  That is such a dumb idea.   They also have gone after Bank of America pretty bad as well. But nobody has gone to jail for the financial crisis? My question:why?   Why cannot the principles of free market be used?    Kinda of dumb.   I just think Common Core is a stupid approach to take away the individual district's ability to design and make the lesson plan to wishes of the voters.     Why is this nation try limit free speech? Please.  Most people who support gun rights are not criminals and do not want go out kill massive amounts of people.  It is the insane people who are the people that ruins the right of legitimate gun owners.   So you want violent criminals to get out less than 85% time served?  That is major driver in why offenders stay in jail so long.   San Clemente. Little beachside community that is pretty good.   What is the current status of the dog?   At least the Tea Party group is unqualified   Yes, they are unfit to govern.   Do you have any accounting positions?   You can also try Labor Ready to get work.   If you need a quick job, go to AGR on 1540 E Warner Ave  Santa Ana, CA 92705.  It is telemarketing, but it at least it will pay the bills for the short-term if you can sell well.   There is a lot of factory jobs out there.  There is a Global Cash Call that has a customer service representative position available.  Just call the OC One Stop in Westminister to find out when they are hiring.   Mission Viejo Lake is another good spot or any place in Mission Viejo is good because there are tons of hills in Mission Viejo.   Santa Ana River Creek Trail is a good spot.  You can run for several miles along the trail.   Personally, I have no problem with this execution.  This guy killed three people already and shows no remorse for human life.    Maybe, that will expose the scam that is Pat Robertson that we knew all of these years.   I think that Obama is getting a lot of pressure from the neo-conservative camp to do something on Syria and he wants to follow Clinton's footsteps in terms of limited intervention in foreign entanglements where whole-scale massacres of innocent people.  However, the Iraq War has permanently discredited the US use of force in foreign entanglements even the if the use of force was limited.  If Obama wanted to truly intervene the proper way, he should have gave arms to rebels a long time ago and sent special forces as advisors for training the rebels. I think that is better use of military resources than limited strikes that could potential escalate the war.   That is just the military zealots try to agree on a policy that is fail to implement.  I am sorry, but the Iraq War now has limited this type of intervention because you fools screwed up in Iraq and the inherent risk of the US bungling up another major operation is too high compared to have the benefit of what effect to Assad that it would have.   We need to allow property owners to fully compensated for their property.  The government is not trying to save the land for environmental reasons, but rather it trying to use the land for border protection. In those cases, the government shall compensate the owner of the land at least 50% of the assessed property's value.   Do these goons every understand the concept of "privacy" in international affairs?  It just seems all they snoop around in other people's business and do not allow foreign governments to act in privacy especially when their actions do not result in a national security threat to the US.   When I was working the government, they did not state that you needed take a drug test and that was DOD about eleven years ago.  However, I am not sure whether your organization would drug test as part of that individual organization's policy for drug testing.  However,  a public trust clearance does ask you whether you used dope within the last seven years as part of the questionnaire.  You could always and get away with it, but part of the reason that they put you through the background check is to verify your honesty.   Amazon Goddess!   She looks like pure white trash, but hot white trash.   IT just seems a scapegoat in order to really distract people from criticising the government and lead an uprising against Putin.   He must be high on some kind of drug. Only addicts do stupid stuff like that.   Are you single WO boyfriend?   The high-speed train to nowhere.   This is complete BS, Obama!   More example of the imperial police state.   There are plenty ways to learn how to hustle.  You just have to have the willingness to do so.  Hustling in this case means hustlings to get a job in your profession which means you try to sell yourself to other people within your profession even if it is technical field.  I do not hustle for jobs because I am a little bit fearful, too hesistant and I got to deal with my recovery as well.  In addition, I have to rely on the bus system (which is fairly reliable where I live, but takes a long time to get around on).  I am starting to realize that I have to hustle for a job, but I have to break my fear and willin   Nope.  Still like Hotel California   At least, you in a country with socialized medicine and country that cares of its people better than this country does.   Most Gulliable.   Drug Dealing   That is funny.  Most of the religious people that are still very religious in my life tend to be quite moderate to moderate conservative in their religious practices.  They might have some political beliefs that  I cannot stand, but in most part, I do not know that any of my friends are real social ultraconservatives that are portrayed in progressive websites.   Getting a damn job in my field, no matter how low the pay is and getting off unemployment.  That would be the best thing.     Telemarketers    Drunk Driving. Many times.   You Cannot Do That on Television on Nickelodon, Thundercats, and Looney Toons (lots and lots of Looney Toons)   It comes from the AP.   how this is spam?    That is a violation of free speech.   Repeal Truth In Sentencing laws and bring back parole for first-time violent offenders.  That is one way to reduce prison population.  Bring back federal parole for drug offenders and non-violent offenders.    That I have autism and that I need to learn how to manage my disablility and to avoid alcohol for the rest of the life.   I guess that I need to start to keep an open-mind to conservative principles.    What ever happened to division called internal affairs?    Rat bastards!   Personally, I knew people who in my social network who spew anti-Obama stuff, but I personally are wonderful and very nice people.  A lot of Christians that I know are very spiritual and really love God with all of their hearts.  I think that the media poisons the debate and makes charactures out of both liberals and conservatives.  Unless you know people personally really well that hold those views, sometimes the sterotype persists especially when you spend all of our time hanging out with one type of people.  People follow the echo chamber so much (including myself) and do not realize that reality is far different than the echo chamber that exists on the left.  Not all of right-wing and left-wing talk hosts reflect the craziness.  There is a lot of thoughtful conservative talk radio hosts (like Michael Medev) or Thom Hartmann who is a liberal talk show host.  I think Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes are very thoughful people as well.   Not everybody that you hear on the radio is bombastic, but the people are the bombastic tend to drive the highest ratings and advertising dollars.  The funny is that the most crazy guy on the left, Mike Malloy, gets rejected even though Mike Malloy is often right.    I do not understand why people learn to calm down and not have resentment.  As a member of UU, I might disagree with the FRC policies, but the people of the FRC are people with families and love our country.  We have radically different views over the abortion and other policy views, but we should never disrepect one another.  .   How backwards do these people get?    Okay, let's return to the day of purtians.   Do these guys realize that endless war is what led to the Sequester because they blew up the defense base budget by spending on wasteful wars?   The first step is drop possesion of all major drugs that is under 10 grams to a simple mismedmeanor from a felony.   She was very rude and disruptive.  Personally, I agree with Code Pink stands, but I disagree with their tactics which I find quite annoying.   Why do you have to judge somebody just because the person like booze? Not everybody that loves to drink has a problem with booze.  Instead, AA tells us that we should not judge people on whether they want to drink or not.   This belong in -news seciton.   If I were a judge, I would throw out the case and state it was excessive sentencing because the offender did not engage in the production of child porn.  Since the counts only involved the viewing of child pornography without any prior offenses, the sentence is unjustfied and the person needs to be sentenced to a term of years not to exceed 20 years and subject to lifetime supervision as a sex offender.   He should be jailed 25 to Life for his crime.   The Supreme Leader just wants a stooge to be in power and he cannot tolerate any dissent even it was from a fellow conservative zealot.   Well, flooding the market with inflated money will have its consequences.  Bernarke did it at moderate pace and therefore, we have not seen the effects of the tidal wave yet, but Japan might reap the consequences of excessive liquidity in the market.   What happened to hope and change.  Instead, this administration is bent on increasing the power of executive government that is similar to the Bush administration.   Just give them weapons and stay out of conflict.   In the US, that could get you a life sentence. That is very generous sentence considering how many people that he killed.   Why is adultery is still a crime?   These are the same people who try to pass a law that it made it easier to increase the influence of religion over the government.   If the victims want truth-in-sentencing, develop a state sentencing commission and then create significantly lower sentences for all crimes except for child rape, aggravated forcible rape, and first-degree murder.  Offenders would only get 15%-25% off their sentences and  victims would know exactly how long the offender is serving in prison without seeing a huge increase in overcrowding because stiff sentencing requirements.  In addition, people that commit serious violent habitual felonies more than two times are locked on life sentence without parole subject to governor's ability to commute the sentence to a terms of years if the prisoner shows extraordinary merit and rehabilitation of mind,body, and soul   There is needs to be a state-wide law prohibiting cities from shutting down dispensaries.  Until the state creates mandatory requirements from each city in terms of regulating dispensaries, this issue will keeping going on.  It comes to unfounded fear about crime and illegal activity.  Cops should stop raiding marijuana facilties and instead of spending time trying to bust people who drive stoned.  The fact is that you should right to smoke unless you get behind a wheel and cause an accident.  Driving while impaired is far bigger problem than people just trying to smoke to relieve some tension or pain in their body.   Read more  at http://www.dailypilot.com/news/tn-dpt-me-0519-fatal-crash-20130518,0,5383089.story.  It was a fatal crash.   The OC/LBC area.  The only problem is that housing costs are real expensive. Otherwise, OC is far more cleaner than LA and has plenty of good shopping centers (especially Fashion Island and South Coast Plaza) . Plus the best beaches in Socal.   The only other downside of OC is that a lot of people are snobs and quite conservative in politics.    Don't live there any more.   Stupid GOP problems in South County.   What a nutbag!   Good, he is a very evil man who undermines the entire pro-choice movement.  I hope they nail his ass and give him the needle.   Wasting resources on issues that do not exist.  They should have tax cheats that dodge tax loopholes than groups devoted to free speech.   Isn't that enough to give him life and end the case.   If you make more than the President, there is something wrong with this issue    This obviously is turning into a political witch hunt.   Because it dilutes talent and we get perennial losers teams that have no talent.     More Austerity measures? Isn't the track record that austerity does not have any positive short term effects   If she wants to continue in rehab, she should be taking Tanex which is alternative to adderall.  Believe me I was hooked on adderall for years, but I went on Tanex and no longer was hooked.  All rehabs and sober living approve that drug and does provide a mild buzz especially at 2MG and 3MG.   Nice bong.   Why should they even care?  If they are covered and shielded their nudity away from the bible-thumpers, they should not care.  The reality is that people need to get over trying to impose their morality on external forces that they do not control or have no harm to.   Well, than she should just commit suicide her in cell if that how is she feels about life because I would not give her the death penalty.  I give her as they state in West Virginia law "life without mercy".    The best way to get hold of the EDD is to e-mail them.  I got a response back within one to three days of e-mailing the EDD.  (https://askedd.edd.ca.gov/asp/frmEDDCOMM.aspx)    Just classify marijuana as a Schedule 2 drug like Adderall. Than, the government can tightly regulate the proper use of the drug and prevent sham prescriptions.   Try the wanted section on Craigslist or the barter section.  You might some people that would like to give away some rocks or willing to barter something in exchange.   Try to meetup.com to meet people.  There is a lot of different groups that do stuff and a good way to meet friends.   That is why we need more active, regulatory regime that provides the flexibility to employers, but also cracks down on those who break the rules. Right now, we have neither one of these things.   Not all people believe in big government. He should said to people beware of those who make false statements or believe in conspiracy theories.     That was a good laugh.   I rely on my intellect to try to believe in God.  So far it has not worked well and my intellect tells me that God might not exist.   I do not support freeloaders who take public transportation.  The reality is that the public transit system needs it revenue and it is not a "free" ride.   Believe me. I was in jail last week and we had five suspects come in last week that ended up in the drunk tank.  They do enforce those drunk checkpoints   Schools First is a very good one.   The weather is cooling down significantly. By tommorow, it will be cloudy and the weather should aid in stopping the fire.   This guy was my DUI class back in July 2012. Trippy!   There is still the local news and OC Weekly to rely on the news, and KPCC   	194
       Appologizes for the lack of 720p.  I blame Saul. This was the first video I let him edit...and he obviously screwed it.  Privileges revoked.           	6
 Save your bacon grease and use that instead of oil. That's how my grandma taught me and I won't do it any other way.   Sucks about Anakin but Hayden's Vader was always a little bitch amirite? And Ryan Dunn was a genuinely cool guy. Met him at SEMA Show in Vegas outside on a smoke break and mentioned to him my gf (now wife) were fans of CKY (pre-jackass) and she was good friends with his cousin. He told me to call her up and he talked with her for a few minutes, told her to say hi to his cousin and to make sure we come by at their next reunion coming up. Then we just talked about cars and what we saw at the show. He died I think sometime the next year and was genuinely sad. Plus he was vilified in the media for the crash. Sucked all the way around.   Yeah Kevin James' entire career is based on being the every man schlub loser that people identify with. Who the fuck does he think he is?   Prime example of why there will always be demand for cars.   Natural. Selection.   Eating a steady diet of government cheese and living down by the river... Van         I have even heard that his essay series on "The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem" actually inspired Hitler to take action and create what he called "The Final Solution" with the extermination camps. It's quite insane. But how about that new Ford GT EH?!   I have a mid 2010 Mac Mini with 8GB RAM   SSD Hybrid with a 27" ASUS monitor. Fast and cheap as hell.  	10
 I work in an R D lab... You're right, it probably is the custodian performing an experiment and settling the over/under debate once and for all.          If you don't have one, make a duplicate of your car key. You'll want to let it run for a few minutes before you drive off in the morning. Nothing sucks more than locking your keys in the car at 5am when its -10. Also look for a place with off street parking if possible - this is key if you're moving to the Portland area.  During heavy storms all cars must be removed from street parking to clear the road for plows and it can be a major hassle to find a spot.    Not going to lie, I'll throw in some Austrian Death Machine for a laugh or two. But if we're talking about just sweet jams that put us in a good mood - I've been digging Vildhjartas Mastaaden album.       Howdy! Just curious - how do you all typically store your iaito after practice, specifically, the sageo? Does it differ from post dojo or post home practice? I'll usually wrap a neat loop around the midpoint of the saya with a slipknot as we wrap up at the dojo, but I'll do a cho musubi after home practice. The difference is mostly time. What do you all do and why?    Last night was date night and I surprised the better half with a show in Portland. Vivid Motions production [Thug](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXF_rui1ZWM). It is a 'dance theater' that tells the all-too-real story of a kid in Portland who grows through death, abuse, and mental illness. It was absolutely stellar; If you're looking for something to do this weekend certainly check this out!   $2 margaritas at Molly's   New Hamshire is Shall-Issue to residents. Unless she filed for State residency I don't believe that they would have to issue one any way. I grew up in West Lebanon/Hanover NH (Where Dartmouth is) and it is surprising rough in certain parts; big heroin problem. A few years back some junky was calling for pizza deliveries and robbing the delivery drivers at gun point... on Dartmouth campus and throughout town.    Senior year of high school I asked my best friend to go to prom with me. She said 'yes' so I started making plans and when I told her what time I'd pick her up she was shocked. It turns out that she said "if my current date falls through, then yes"... I had two days to find a new date and successfully convinced my best friend that I'm an idiot. We didn't go to prom together, but, we've since been together for 8 years.   Not about to open the link while sitting next to my SO; BUT after seeing all of the hatebreed mention with no luck has anyone checked crowbar or kingdom of sorrow?

 I've never even heard of own3d, but I'll have to check it out when I get a chance. Thanks   What did you use for streams, twitch.tv?   I know what you mean about the game mechanics, because that's where I'm at now. I just suck at the champions xD   Oh, I try that. A lot. And since I have so much free time I basically get a good understanding of the champs in a week from all the games I play. For example, I bought Rumble when he was on sale a few weeks ago. First few games sucks until I really figured him out, and then out of nowhere I started getting games where I could go 24/7/9 (which is a billion times better than usual). But after about 4 games of that I started declining again until he was just like any other champ that I would play. Although I'm sure there is a champ that I'd be able to be good at, I also don't have the patients for it. When I do bad I tend to get demoralized pretty quickly to where I just stop trying to play whoever it is. And after writing all that, I'm realizing my problem. I'm not patient enough to do this champion roulette. I just need to extend my patients for a while until I solve it. Thank you mystery summoner, I think you just indirectly solved my problem for me.  TL;DR- I'm not patient enough and I need to work on it. Thank you.   Any idea on how I do that without getting flamed at every game?   Well /r/leagueoflegends, I've been coming to you for most of my LoL questions for a while now, and I have another. I've been playing LoL for a year or two now. In that time I've extensively tried every position and a large portion of the champs, and still can't find anything I'm good at. I'm not horrible anywhere, but not good enough to consider it to be my thing. Should I just give up at this point? Because I don't really see any options when it comes to laning positions and champs   Not to mention his ability to summon fruit. You'd never go hungry.   I probably end up getting the armor pen then for harassing, thanks for that   so do you think I should grab armor pen runes?   Oh wow, This is great actually, and it's from two days ago. Thank you so much   I actually went on there a little bit ago, but I really didn't know how to navigate through. I'll go check that stream now though, thanks   Hey guys, I have a few questions. Well I usually play a solo top bruiser, and I was thinking about going for Renekton. So first of all, is he a viable top lane champ? I know loads of champs are pointless these days, so I figure I should know that before I get him. If I do though, is there anything I really need to know to play him successfully? I've looked at his moves and everything, and I know that having over 50 fury gives them special effects, but is there anything else about him that separates him from the other bruisers? And finally, is there any certain item(s) that I definitely need to get? I know some champs have items that mesh perfectly with their moves, so does he have anything like that? Thanks (:   thank you   thanks   Stupid question, but when I see a comment on a /r/leagueoflegends post, They always have this little thumbnail of a champ. How do you set it?   shit, I better start using that   Also, does playing with your screen unlocked really help that much? Because everyone else seems to do it but I never really tried   Oh I know that, I'm just saying that i know how to play the character when I'm in bot games and all, but it doesn't transfer over to normal pvp at all   I watch some games, but it's generally just the tournaments. I'll definitely check this out now though, thanks!   Alright /r/leagueoflegends I need your help. I've been playing LoL since the beginning of season two, so by now you'd think I would at least be somewhat good. Well I'm not. So basically, I need some tips on how to seriously improve my pvp skill. When I play bots I'll go like 36-4, so I would think that I can at least go like 15-8 or something against real people, but I just can't. My average score is probably around 7/11/13 no matter who I'm playing. That being said, I tend to either play support or solo top. So is there anything you figured out while playing that seriously improved your game?    Just finished watching that episode 20 minutes ago XD   That may be the best thing I have ever read XD   Well, that's simple enough. Thanks guys (:   Everyone -___-  	24
 Haha! I don't know! When I wiped off all the sauce, it stained his face that color. The camera makes it look more yellow than it actually is, it's really more orange. Wish I would've thought to take a pic BEFORE! He looked like he had a busted nose!      Indeed! A must see, must tag, if you're ever driving through!      What the hell is coming out of his crotch???   I just found out I have a sister a year ago, I'm 32 and she's 28... I would NEVER refer to her as my half sister.   Bigwords.com is a comparison site. It lists all the sites that has that particular book in stock and how much they are selling it for or how much they are buying it back for, including half.com. It insures you are getting the best deal possible.      As someone who deals in the used textbook industry... There is a website called bigwords.com, it lists all the textbook cos and there prices for the books you need, new and used, as well as sell back prices. If you keep your books in good condition, you can sell back your books with free shipping for waaaay more than the local bookstore. There are also some sites that have stores near campus that you can print off your invoice and walk in to the store to get the online price or cash. It saddens me that most college students are unaware of this.   I love it when they do that!!!      I was actually on that exact ship in October. It was a real shit hole before it became an actual shit hole...   That was so sweet, it almost made me tear up... Almost... :)   Leonidas, thinking about how the hell to get that damn jacket off...   Weird.   this belongs in /r/wtf... because WTF?????      What's a writter?   All the time!!!   Oh he gets allllll the ladies...      Repost...   I wanna pull on it's tongue.   Why would I have to pay for a threesome?   Apparently they think they are just that awesome...  	25
 I agree with Krugman about being suspicious about bipartisan social program reductions to what are referred to as "entitlements," but the term should broaden to include subsidies to industry, transportation and energy sectors. Labeling government funds for these industries as subsidies wrongly places the funds outside the narrative of deficit reduction, particularly when energy companies are enjoying record-breaking profits on a yearly basis.   More evidence of the United States' failing infrastructure.   If you want a true understanding of the financial black hole that is Lockheed Martin read *Prophets of War* by William D. Hartung. The F22 aircraft debacle was just a forewarning for the American taxpayer.   Sure, let's go ahead and add another war to the growing collection, because the American public certainly won't notice it. And think of all the jobs we could create by sending off troops to fight another unpopular war. A steady supply of dead soldiers would drive the unemployment rate down as new recruits joined the ranks. Damn that Obama for not seeing the light on Iran.   Blaming the tragedy on an act of 'sabotage' would provide the factory owners with a defense against prosecution or restitution. Does this mean another factory owner schemed against the 'sabotaged' factory?   After another viewing with special attention given to the archetypes and the director's explanation I've come to the conclusion that it ultimately didn't matter. From the minute the second lever was pulled, offering a blood sacrifice for a death that hadn't occurred, the final outcome had been determined. The director's explanation that in the rite the whore dies first, and the virgin last, but the order of the rest is left ambiguous. But it's a rite, and that means any step missed or taken out of order nullifies it. The big giveaway is when he pulls the second lever and both worlds experience an earthquake.  But leaving that aside, she fit the role of fool better than he fit it. In fact, of all the characters he was the least fooled of the group, and constantly called into question everything that was odd. His friends' odd personality changes, trying to stop the diary reading (drawing a line at the latin), finding the elevator - he recognized all these things. He could even be considered the virgin because of his uncomfortable reaction to the "whore" when she climbed on top of him.   Well, now you have me doubting myself, and I'll need to re-watch the movie to know definitively. My understanding was only the virgin could survive, and if he/she died, they had to be last.   Yes, but the girl wasn't the virgin, because she slept with her college professor. Her archetype was completely wrong.   I found the filmmaker's manipulation of longstanding societal sexual and drug norms especially interesting and funny. Just prior to all hell breaking loose, the controllers are popping champagne, while the girl, which they assume is the virgin, takes a horrible beating. The stoner is both the virgin and the hero, protected from manipulation by his weed. Sigourney Weaver tries to talk the girl into shooting the stoner, still believing the girl is the virgin, whose death the controllers are ambivilent about. The stoner as virgin was a smart twist to the story.   You are welcome. If you want more hidden film gems, give me a holler.   You're so right. The world would never see a McCain or Graham trying to push their political careers by "glomming onto what he thought would be a media-grabbing event." That takes no political courage.   [God Bless America](http://www.1channel.ch/watch-2732540-God-Bless-America) (2011)  [Detachment](http://www.1channel.ch/watch-2732095-Detachment) (2011)  [Boy Wonder](http://www.1channel.ch/watch-2366373-Boy-Wonder) (2011)  All three are recent films and speak to the contemporary sociological climate.   This is an example of political courage on Grayson's part; we need more of this from our elected officials.   Poor Egypt, it traded one dictator for another.   Let's begin with Meredith Vickers' role in the film, which is foil to David, the son her father never had, but remains imperfect because he doesn't possess a soul. She doesn't believe in the mission, but it offers her an opportunity to gain her father's respect, while also providing the means to out perform him. She, like her father, is obsessed with surviving, evidenced by the surgery machine, and her own living pod, which can operate independently of the ship. When the ship is threatened by possibly infected returning crewmen, she is willing to turn a flamethrower on them. As the ship begins its final push to intercept the "Engineer's" ship, she opts for an escape pod, knowing it only buys her a few more hours of life. When she discovers her father made the trip, she's lost her authority and any chance to out perform him, and all that's left is out living him. In the end, she had to die, crushed by the embodiment of her own disbelief. She dies soulless, like both David and her father. Of the three characters, David is the only one who really believed in the mission.   While part of Graham and McCain's plan may be to push the Republican agenda against Obama, I believe their true goal is to call into question budget cuts that will affect the military. By characterizing the incident in Benghazi as a threat to national security, it builds a case for avoiding Defense cuts which would hurt both men's constituency, as their state's have a heavy footprint in the military industrial complex.    An ad hominem argument for an ad hominem writer.   No...what I'm saying is the court system can find no reason to continue the recount, and Republicans will continue to find any straw to grasp upon to cast doubt on election results.   The conflation between West and California is absolutely relevant because it's being reported by multiple media outlets. If Fox News is your main source, they can twist those numbers around any way they like to an unquestioning viewership. I would've been ever more satisfied with a thorough Florida recount in 2000.   I predicted earlier on reddit that West would use the courts to keep power just a tiny bit longer. His inflammatory politics are the reason the Republican brand is toxic in California.   Another death caused by the ignorance of religious ideology.   The political right's ideology is so toxic it's made the word "liberal" sound positive.   No water = no city.   As the child of a mixed-race couple, I believe Obama's bubble of entitlement is quite a bit smaller than that of Romney. Whether the population wants to recognize the fact that race plays a significant role in societal branding, Obama's heritage forced him into the role of outsider, a position never occupied by Romney, the ultimate insider.   Hence, my original assertion that the short answer is water.   Romney's class lives in a bubble carefully constructed by handlers so that it reinforces a sense of entitlement that is completely undeserved.   You admit that it was built on a minor river, but ignoring that for now, whether or not its a major or capital city, its location was dependent on the availability of water. Many cities outgrow water sources, L.A. is a good example of this, but it still remains the common denominator for the success of an urban population.   The short answer is the availability of water. Every major city resides next to some body of water that supplies the population and allows for agriculture. "Maps of time" by David Christian explores history from a big history perspective and identifies water as the most important factor for the development of major cities. It is also our most fought over resource.   According to all the news reports I've read West chose the district to run for.   West is the epitome of the far-right extremist who refuses to believe that their losses aren't the results of a conspiracy. I predict he'll take the matters to a sympathetic court, thus tying up the results, allowing him to remain relevant for a few more short weeks.   I've read Colonel Roosevelt, the third book.   Go free-market capitalism. "I love being able to fire people."   There's a famous story of a hike along the Potomac that included Roosevelt, Gifford Pinchot, and a French ambassador. Realizing the would have to swim across the river, the three men stripped nude but the ambassador kept his white gloves on. When asked by Roosevelt why he kept the gloves one, the ambassador said, "One never knows when one will meet a lady."   Good call on Roosevelt - he hated being called Teddy - because he was truly a giant in the fitness arena. He judged American manhood on its fitness, and overcame severe asthma to build a fit body. He was a good, if not great boxer, and rode horses for days at a time on cattle drives. He once threatened to "kick the balls" of a political colleague in the NY Senate, and knocked out a cowboy who called him four-eyes. He single-handedly captured and returned a cattle thief to the local sheriff, and during the 1912 election campaign suffered a gunshot wound by an assassin but still spoke for 1.5 hours before going to hospital. He also spent time hunting in Africa, and is the only American president to have ventured into the Amazon rain forest; he almost died on the expedition, and the jungle's effects remained with him for the rest of his short life. He was also our most mentally fit president who devoured books at an amazing rate. He is our most literate president, having written 21(?) books, and won the Nobel Peace Prize while in office for brokering peace between Japan and Russia. It's sad that the Republican Party doesn't recognize him, eschewing him as an independent instead, because he was truly a president who cared about the people.   sure... the origins of the urban crisis - thomas sugrue and  arc of justice - kevin boyle   I can't believe no one has mentioned the policy of "Red lining" developed by the National Association of Realtors. The NAR issued guidelines designed to exclude African-american families from a community; also known as covenants, these rules included binding contracts signed by homeowners that declared the family would not sell their property to AAs. "White flight," assisted by the automobile, led to white middle- and working-class families moving farther from urban centers, and the development of suburbia. The rumors mentioned by the interviewees were fomented by the NAR because its members wanted to retain a monopoly position in setting housing prices. If class mixing became the norm, NAR representatives (realtors) could no longer charge customers inflated prices to maintain a white community.   When did Israel begin speaking for the US in relation to Palestine?   Hands down, the correct answer to this question. He was known world-wide as the individual who organized the feeding of war-torn nations after WWI. A really smart individual, Hoover was completely unprepared for a life of politics.   Supply-side economics, Reaganomics, trickle-down - they're all flip-sides of the same coin. David Stockman, the granddaddy of this movement, publicly admitted it was "voodoo economics" during a magazine interview, and stated it was the only way to sell the idea to the public. Dutch Reagan's greatest ability was as a shill, whether working for GE or the GOP, selling the idea of tax cuts for the wealthy to the blue-collar electorate. Sadly, this policy allowed industrialists and bankers to keep a majority of their profits, while moving their operations overseas to a cheaper labor market. Labor unions, the only real engine of change for the average working American, have been effectively rendered impotent.   Hence the reason we throw salt over our shoulders after spilling a bit if it. An evil spirit caused the spill, so tossing salt into its eyes blinded the spirit, allowing you to walk away and leave it behind.   My understanding of the population growth issue is that the proposed policies would provide more information about contraceptive use and abortion among the female populations of third-world countries. A more educated and informed female population, they argue, will allow them to better decide when conditions are appropriate for beginning a family.   "The things that will destroy America are prosperity-at-any-price, peace-at-any-price, safety-first instead of duty-first, the love of soft living, and the get-rich-quick theory of life." Theodore Roosevelt  He also warned against the "wealthy criminal caste" who profited from inside deals.   oops..."own words".   My photojournalism professor, Ken Bisio, used to take our class up to ghost towns in the Foothills. Most people visiting the area don't realize the extent of mines that cover the region, with tunnels stacked on top of one another. There's also a bee-hive of tunnels that run underneath the state capital building. Access is limited because visitors have sometimes gotten lost for days in the tunnels.

Seems like the dailykos is guilty of doing the same thing CNN did in posting a sensationalized story. Reading the updates, it seems the author is doing quit a bit of backpedaling.   I would be greatly surprised if both campaigns didn't have staff that targeted social media by generating buzz through planted articles about their opponent. CNN has recently faced criticism for writing/publishing positive stories in support of Bahrain's government, and Fox News is a cheerleader for Republicans. I believe social media enhances the opportunities available for campaigns to attack opponents.   Romney is hoping a zinger will do for him what it did for Reagan, who dismissed worries about his advanced age by promising not to "hold his opponents inexperience against him."   I searched that list trying to find some commonality with Romney and just couldn't find any substance to the man's ideas. He's offered nothing but vagaries when asked to explain his policies.   Good call on the phrase, and it's the system U.S. automobile manufacturers utilized to sell more cars. Engine systems were designed to fail after x amount of miles, and American drivers just accepted it. However, when the Japanese entered the U.S. market with better reliability, American automobile manufacturers were forced to adapt or fail.   I won't pay to see a Stewart/O'Reilly debate, but I would pay for a Stewart/Taibbi vs O'Reilly/Hannity.    This is just one example of the intolerance that leaves me despising all religions.   You don't understand the role of a historian. It is to ask those questions, and follow the evidence where ever it leads the historian. That evidence is collected from a number of fields, and can often lead to controversy, particularly in a subject as explosive and narrow minded as religion. The Romans played a role in jesus's execution and constitute a relevant part in the narrative.    You've missed the point; jesus marriage is relevant to roman history because the "resurrection" takes place while he's in custody. Romans followed strict rules in dealing with dissidents and the family during burials because of the threat of martyrdom and its effect on the population at large.   Then we misunderstood one another. This professor's thesis is valid, and even more so because it has a basis in truth. Religion is predicated on NOT being able to prove that some union between the divine and humanity took place - take it on faith is the common mantra. My professor based his thesis on decades of historical and archaeological study conducted by scholars that are vetted and peer reviewed. The biblical record, when challenged, limps along behind its mantra of faith, demanding the blind, unquestioning obedience of its followers.   It is a thesis that carries the same academic weight as a virgin birth by a woman impregnated by an all-powerful being.   It is no more a "fun fan theory" than is the likelihood that a child was born of the union between a virgin woman and an all-powerful being to create a god on earth. The irony is that the "fun fan theory" is the more probable actuality between the two scenarios.   What I always find disconcerting about analysis of biblical text is the disregard we have for the evolutionary process of christianity from a jewish sect to mainstream religion. Any argument regarding jesus's marital status is immediately suspect and subject to derision. A contemporary self-identifying christian would hardly recognize a 1st century christian, and they certainly wouldn't possess the necessary courage to die for it as did early christians. That christianity adopted much of the essenes's beliefs, especially baptism, is readily accepted by many roman history scholars, but remains a point of contention with religious fundamentalists.  The downvotes remind me that religion has no use for objective/subjective historical studies.   I took an undergrad Roman history class with a professor who told students on the first day of class that if they were christians, his lectures would offend them, and encouraged them to have an open mind. Invariably, he said, at least one student would complain to the dean and demand he change his lectures. In his lectures, he stated that jesus and mary magdalene were married, and offered as proof the biblical accounts of the Roman execution and the handling of jesus's body. Romans, he said, were very strict in the handling of dissident's bodies, and would only allow immediate family members or the wife to view the body. Roman leadership constantly monitored local attitudes to keep the masses in check, and restricting access to the dissident's body was one of those measures.   Savages...all I could think was London Bridge.   Dwight Eisenhower warned Americans about the dangerous nature of the military industrial complex.   Kissinger would call FDR's actions, Realpolitik, but I'm angrier about the US keeping the information hidden for such a long period of time. Anyone would might have found closure in regards to relatives or friends has long since died.   Thank you, sir, for giving a very good example of the Republican voter; I, however, am an independent voter and offer analysis of the parties' messages to the nation. My generalization of Dems as inclusive is based in part on the conventions participants. Undeniably, the Republican convention participants presented a majority "white" conservative demographic, and on one occasion acted less than inclusive by shouting down a Republican Puerto Rico speaker. The Dems convention participants, on the other hand, offered a clear example of the "melting pot" mentality so proudly offered on the symbol of American freedom - the Statue of Liberty.  As for blaming Republicans on the credit downgrade, I'm going to repeat what I wrote earlier - Americans are not stupid. They also won't forget the Tea and Republican parties' roles in killing jobs bills that could offer American's employment.   You present a good point, and one I have heard but hadn't thought about; thank you for pointing that out.   Johnson's political and media footprint is difficult to track. If you have plausible links, or can point me in that direction, I'll be happy to do a workup for him, as well.   This is simply not true as I offered examples that support these thoughts. If I'm missing the Republican message, it's because the message is garbled.   Well, if we're going to extrapolate this out to include yourself, in a real world sense you'd probably be my boss somewhere and, depending on your abilities, I'd consider you a good/bad leader. As leader, you'd offer feedback to guide me in my duties, but if you constantly changed the rules, or adopted a do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do attitude, my work environment would be pretty unbearable. At this point I've got a good feel for what Obama believes and I don't agree with a number of his policies; my greatest complaint with Romney is his cardboard-cutout political identity. Unless he can offer me substance in his position, I'm going to believe "the devil I know is better than the one I don't."   I included them because they impact his policy decisions and speak to his understanding of the income divide that haunts this country, while also being indicative of Romney's character as a person and leader.   I've voted in every presidential election since Dutch Reagan. I voted twice for Reagan, once for Bush, Sr., Clinton, Bush,Jr., Kerry, Obama. I weigh the pros and cons of the candidate and his/her party, however, the current iteration of Republicans have gone so far right that it stresses my ability to follow. I don't believe those individuals following the current political climate and the parties' platforms are going to find much fault with my analysis. If you find my view alien or "democrat" it is because we come from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and that's okay.   Thank you, this was helps me understand the ideology a little better.   Wait, aren't Buddhist monks touted as a peaceful and inclusive bunch?   What, no outlaw Josey Wales? He does share a connection to Reagan after sharing the screen with a orangutan in Every Which Way But Loose.   I would make the same argument about the american dollar.   You, sir, are correct. So would Dutch Reagan.   I never really paid attention to his political career before and had forgotten that he was a mayor; thank you for that. I tied his ideology to the first film he directed, "A Perfect World," and its message of authority's overreaction to the misunderstood individual. Directors generally make a statement through the scripts they accept and by their film's motifs. My impression of Eastwood stems from the liberal nature of this film.   This means he falls into the same category of leaders as Pharaoh. Does this leave him susceptible to a god complex?    The Russian blockade of Berlin was the result of France, Britain, and the US decision to institute a currency change that would devalue the Soviet's currency.   In other words, Mitt Romney.   So he actually believes he'll be a god in the afterlife?   I'm particularly interested in whether Romney has performed exaltation or endowment ceremonies, both of which speak directly to his character.   Warren Olney interviewed several strategists on his "To the Point" show and they said Ryan's speech was intended to reach the "low-information voter" or the "information adverse voter." This group, they said, won't care about fact checking, and both parties are trying to capture this demographic by utilizing over-the-top arguments and lies. Ryan's association of his grandmother and mother with Medicare and Medicaid speaks to this crowd, according to these political strategists.    There are two articles on my reddit front page that address the worry about whether journalists and their publications should simply parrot the Rep/Dem message while fact-checking organizations decide the veracity of the facts. During studies for my journalism degree, professors consistently insisted on objectivity in my writing, and that I backup my reporting with facts. Taibbi's writing is not objective, but it is substantive as he provides verifiable evidence. If forced to compare Taibbi to another historical figure, Will Rogers or Mark Twain jump to mind because they voiced opinions that spoke to their listeners/readers. Much like Rogers or Twain, Taibbi understands and voices the outrage experienced by the average American in relation to the contemporary political and economic situation.    Here is the citation for the quote: Troy, Gil. The Reagan revolution. New York: Sterling, 2011. pg19.  Troy is a pro-Reagan biographer who touted this quote as one of Reagan's strengths. He also stated that Reagan was against civil rights, believing states should be in charge of their citizen's rights.   I love the insane colors the squid emits when the bass is dropped.   Always keep in the back of your mind that the same allegations were made against Iraq.   Well, thank you again for the suggestion.   I appreciate the input, however, you began the statement with the qualifier "presumably." Does this mean you've never published before, because I'm asking for concrete advice on how to assure the paper's publication?   I've written a paper that I would like to see published that compares the relative merits of two republican presidents. How do I get this paper published?   This story also has a very concise listing of Syria's air-defense systems and its capabilities.   Standard oil used the same argument when it was crushing the labor union movement at the turn of the 20th century. It blamed all the unrest on the worker while ignoring the company's role.   These conditions existed between industry and labor in the U.S. during the period from 1880-1950. Industry hired their own police force in addition to the local police. Henry Ford's thugs were known to be particularly brutal, as was the McCormick family's security. The pollution factor was also a problem during this period until the EPA began regulating industry. It's sad that Shell can do such harm to African nations.   I share your frustration with the sorry state of America's social system, and it's my major complaint with the Pro-life bunch in that any empathy for a child dissipates when it exits the womb. After that, it's the mother/father's responsibility to care for the child, regardless of the economic/social environment. Poverty is no longer confined to the urban landscape, as suburban cities are now experiencing the economic contractions and high unemployment. IMO the conservatives that agitate so strenuously for anti-abortion are also the ones that would cut social services because it encourages people not to work. I don't know one person who wants to be poor just to collect government assistance or health care. The poorest members of our society don't have the ready access to birth control, and may not even recognize they're pregnant. Having a child drastically changes the future economic options for parents, and if they're already in bad financial shape, the child will pay for it. I guess I'm angry that conservatives concern for children appears to stop at the womb.   If you tell a lie loud enough, and long enough, it will be believed unless the media exposes it.   I wonder if the public will see anyone at Standard Chartered prosecuted?   The article states that the group has no power to implement change, so it's basically wasting money the poor could use for food on a meeting to bitch about how much the poor need food.   NO WAY!!!! WELL WHAT DO YA KNOW!!!! HEY EVERYBODY, WE LANDED ON THE MOON.   Ahh, George Carlin would be proud of you. "It's not shell shock, its PTSD, a much less ominous sounding, dangerous thing."   So the contemporary U.S. is, by your definition, a fascist state? Corporate entities now represent America's interests, and the Supreme Court granted them personhood. In your representation of unions, you state the NRA "grouped workers into unions," however, in reality, unionization was a grassroots movement. It really began with the Wobblies in the late 1900s, but without government support, the movement went into hibernation. To aver that the government grouped workers into unions doesn't jibe with the research I've done the movement.  edit: I also meant to address your statement was not the same as the NRA, but it was an extension of the program. Now, the Supreme Court decided that portions of the NRA were indeed constitutional, in which case they were extended under a new program name.   My understanding of the Wagner Act is that it allowed the National Labor Relations Board to monitor union elections and assure no foul play. Prior to the Wagner Act, "workers could be beaten by supervisors and fired at will, and management determined the length of the workday and speed of the assembly line. (Give Me Liberty - Eric Foner p.813) As for the Works Progress Administration, it built 500k miles of roads, 600 airports, stadiums, sewage treatment plants, while also developing histories and guidebooks for all 48 states. The arts portion also painted murals in buildings, and compiled an oral history of the remaining slaves still alive.(Ibid, p818)  Now, that's my understanding of the Wagner Act and NRA. Before this conversation progresses any further, would you please give me your understanding of Fascism? And, perhaps the source from which you quoted, just so I can understand the context of FDR's words.   I believe the issue depends on who's doing the judging. For example, Theodore Roosevelt was extremely popular with the people, but the Republican party and industry considered his policies a disaster. When he declared large portions of land under federal jurisdiction in order to form the many national parks we now enjoy, Republicans and industry (railroads, lumber supply, mining) were enraged. By attacking the trusts, TR basically knee-capped the Republican fundraising machine. While historians still recognize the value of TR's policies in relation to the nation at large, Republicans still ignore him, or label him a Progressive.   Wow...you studied a very different version of FDR and the New Deal than the one I know. Especially in regards to the Wagner Act, because labor unions at one time benefited the working class. It helped build the strong middle class that is now in decline because unions are discouraged. And in no reading of FDR's New Deal policies have I found any narrative that credits fascism for its structure.   IMHO, this women reflects the prevailing attitude of conservative christians. My older brother is a Church of Christ member in Tennessee, and he believes the LGBT movement is a plot by satan to conquer the world.   Where's the (Not Satire) guy when you need him?   that was my second guess, but after finding such an apt dictionary definition, I decided to go with it.   I checked for the definition of surd and found it's:  1. Phonetics . voiceless ( opposed to sonant). 2. Mathematics . (of a quantity) not capable of being expressed in rational numbers; irrational.  noun  3. Phonetics . a voiceless consonant ( opposed to sonant). 4. Mathematics . a surd quantity.    I see nothing wrong with credentials; it is a requirement in order to teach at most universities. I have to ask myself, "From whom would I rather receive historical information: Professor Lawrence Baron or Mike the carpenter?   Wow...how did you find your way into the askhistorians subreddit?   Thank you for the link but this is just a reiteration of all the explanations I've read. My interest is in whether a real investigation took place and if so, where are the records and have they been independently confirmed?   While teaching, I required students to read the book as a means to understand the deeply personal price AA's paid for trying to reach the "American Dream."   Sugrue and Cohen trace the environmental factors, but both authors focus on the social and economic development of both cities. I offered the OP these books because they fully explain why the two cities went in different direction.   An attempt to explain Chicago's success and Detroit's decline is simply too restricted by the forum on reddit. I've listed three books below that explain in chilling detail the different routes both cities followed, and why Detroit languished. Vampire offers a general explanation but the books below delve into the social, class, and race aspects of the two cities. You may want to read Arc of Justice first because it is an easy and entertaining book about an African American man's dream to own a home, and white society's effort to crush that dream. Thomas Sugrue's book is for an academic audience, but it explains the socioeconomic blueprint for Detroit's urban decline. Sadly, this blueprint also explains the decline in what is now popularly known as the rustbelt. Finally, Cohen's book explains why Chicago grasped onto the New Deal programs which allowed the city to flourish.   The origins of the urban crisis : race and inequality in postwar Detroit - Thomas Sugrue  Arc of justice a saga of race, civil rights, and murder in the Jazz Age - Kevin Boyle  Making a new deal : industrial workers in Chicago, 1919-1939 - Lizabeth Cohen   Stephen Colbert's photo makes such a kick-ass statement.   Why is Gardiner watching Jersey Shore?   DO NOT LET FACTS GET IN THE WAY OF A GOOD STORY. I reject your reality, and replace it with my own.   Here's what I think really happened: The guy comes into the restaurant after having smoked a boatload of weed. Stoned and hungry, he orders and eats most of this dinner. He takes a big wad of dough out to pay the bill, and asks for a take-home box. He puts money on the bill, pockets the napkins, and throws the money (which he's mistaken for the napkins) in the take-home box. He thinks, "do I really wanna lug that take-home box on my errands? Nope, I'll just leave it here."   Let's just concentrate on the act itself. RR took classified film, copied it, and made it available to two individuals. BM took classified video, email, and audio information, copied it, and made it available to the public. Both acts were  ideologically driven and occurred while serving in the U.S. Army, and neither action was sanctioned. You can be an apologist for RR, but there is no doubt he committed the same offense as BM.   Semantics.   Shucks...I was really looking forward to seeing the results from my search of "reagan mutant titty gasoline".   Did anybody else expect [this](http://www.nba.com/lakers/roster/11players_mettaworldpeace.html)?   I've viewed some good answers below, however if we constrain the answer to "Cold War" and "communism", I can offer another opinion. First, I'm defining communism as antithetical to capitalism, and a one party state governed by a single individual. Second, the Cold War is defined as the reaction to this struggle.  According to J.L. Gaddis, the roots of the cold war stretch to the brief American military intervention during the October Revolution. The distrust Stalin had for the US began during this period. Americans were seen as interlopers that embraced a capitalistic predation in order to control the masses. This is the view presented by George Kennan's Long Telegram and the beginning of US containment policy.  There is another much deeper element to this story however - the conflation of socialism with communism. In America's labor history, socialists play a very important role; they were great organizers and understood how to speak to the masses in relation to economic inequality and unfair working conditions. Socialists also created some very gifted writers. Often they recruited within the movie industry, a maven for creative writers. The socialist's impact on labor did not go unnoticed by the feds or Wall street. This conflation between socialism and communism was an ongoing process that accelerated during and after WWII.   The cold war really caught fire with the House Committee on Un-American Activities in 1947. Former Hollywood notables (Ron Reagan) claimed the movie industry was rife with communists, resulting in HUAC and the Hollywood Blacklist.  On the government side, Joe McCarthy began a witch-hunt in the State Department. The American public had good reason to believe there were communist spies everywhere. During this period the feds uncovered the Silvermaster Group and the Rosenburgs, while the Brits nabbed Alger Hiss. McCarthy's hunt finally ended when he took on the Army; the backlash ended his political career, and alcohol took his life.  There you have it...I don't feel like typing anymore.   There might not be anything fishy going on at all, but that's no reason to stop making perfectly good conspiracy theories.   If you decide to pursue a graduate degree in history, the seminar on historical methods is usually required in the first semester/quarter. Hayden White, Karl Marx, Leopold van Ranke, Jacob Burckhardt, and Immanuel Kant are usually included because they represent different styles of historical research. White's thesis in *Metahistory* is that when a historian writes about an event, they use a historical method of writing such as Marxist, post-modern, revisionist, Annales, big history, and so on. Contemporary historians can identify the writer's method by studying the linguistic properties utilized. What Mr_Quacky alluded to "when historians write 'History' with a capital H" is that the winners in a conflict will write the history of that conflict in a manner with which the reader identifies. By studying the historian's use of language, the reader is able to identify the objective vs. subjective argument that is the framework of the underlying narrative.   Lately I've posted a number of stories that relate to North Korea, but being banned without posting to the subreddit did throw me for a loop.   The governments got to keep those prisons filled. I envision a future where prisons are offered to political lackeys, much as a fiefdom was given to loyal knights.     He's correct on a lot of levels, but especially in relation to branding the "other." Racial politics and branding span the entirety of U.S. politics; Jefferson was smeared by his opponents for his affair with a slave. More importantly, most Americans are so limited in their knowledge of U.S. history that they believe race was defined in the white and black dichotomy. In *Wages of Whiteness: Race and the Making of the American Working Class*, David Roediger writes about the different layers of whiteness, with Irish and East European personages falling under the umbrella of the "negro." Home ownership became the main vehicle for this group to earn their "white" designation. Owning a home implied a person was trustworthy, hardworking, and stable.    OOOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooooooooooooooooooooopppppppppppppppsssssssss   How strange...most of the historians that I know possess a sense of humor.   "The little fella was immediately snapped up by Geico," a spokesperson for the insurance company reported. "That little green bastard we're currently using has become really annoying."    Go to [this](http://www.archive.org/index.php) website and do a search for "Westinghouse" and you'll find some very nice primary source videos of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century industrialization.    I'm with IvyGold on this one; I've seen more violence from the Brits in soccer videos.   I've got two books that may help you:   *The Middle East Today* by Don Peretz. It's a fairly thick read but the first half of the book explains the Ottoman political system and how the various Middle East nations were carved from its remains.  *The Ottoman Empire: 1700-1922* by Donald Quataert.   "Hi...you don't know me, but that's because I didn't use Twitter, Facebook, Google, or any of the other identity/information collection websites. How's that Big Brother thing working out for you?"   I just finished researching T. Roosevelt's background and involvement in the Spanish-American War. Events leading up to that war mirror the incidents of 9/11 and WMD as pretexts to war. They even had a term for these war enthusiasts - Jingoes. *The War Lovers: Roosevelt, Lodge, Hearst, and the Rush to Empire* by Evan Thomas offers a really succinct account of the S-A war and it's like reading an account of present day events.   Arthur did pass the civil service act but it had no teeth. As Washington civil service commissioner, TR put in place a testing system and expanded the number of positions under the civil service purview, removing tens of thousand of patronage jobs. As for "managed capitalism", if you could offer a definition of just what this term means in your world I might be able to better respond.    The system he wanted to build increased, not decreased, cronyism.  This is simply untrue. TR changed the Civil Service process to include an exam to qualify that the applicant was indeed fit for the job. Before TR's changes, civil service positions were used by politicians as a means of reward for their friends. He changed civil service by replacing a system where jobs were sold to the highest bidder with a merit system based on examination. His trust busting campaigns also earned him scorn from contemporary wealthy scions and his own Republican Party.   Actually, TR consistently railed against crony capitalism and the influence of corporations in the election process. He possessed the political courage to rebel against his own party, a quality that is seriously lacking in today's politician.   You've given a really informed explanation; I would just add that the line between the two is often blurred when studying about race or religion.   Well, considering a large majority of cowboys were black or mexican, I imagine they spoke with their local dialect. Their terminology was very specific to the work environment, appearing exotic to the uninitiated.   If you want a really interesting and detailed account I suggest *Creating an American Culture, 1775-1800: A Brief History with Documents* by Eve Kornfeld. You'll learn about the collaboration between Noah Webster (dictionary) and Ben Franklin to create alternate American spellings for British words. The book contains writings from Webster using his radical methods; when originally published, his writings were ridiculed by the American public. There's also a section on Benjamin Rush, the father of the American education system. His ideas influenced the teaching of American english to post-Revolutionary students.   The major reason the South voted Democrat centers around the wide-spread use of voter suppression methods to restrict black voting. The Republican's waving of the "bloody shirt" and its moniker, the Party of Lincoln, resounded among black voters but the Southern Democrats used legal/extralegal intimidation to keep African-American voters at home on election day. Voter suppression remained a problem well into the 1960s, culminating in the "Freedom Riders" who actively worked to register Southern AA. Sadly, some of those who participated lost their lives to the cause.  Lyndon Johnson's welfare legislation was intended to help AA transition from a position of poverty with the Great Society programs. Johnson said, "You do not take a person who, for years, has been hobbled by chains and liberate him, bring him up to the starting line of a race and then say, `You are free to compete with an the others,' and still justly believe that you have been completely fair."  When Nixon arrived in office he began dismantling Great Society programs, a trend that has continued with every Republican president. Because AA are especially sensitive to the need for a strong social safety net, they tend to vote Democrat now.   While a graduate student at SDSU, Christian's book was assigned to our class in a historical methods seminar. Because he taught at the school, our class had the added bonus of talking to Christian about his book. He's a wonderfully entertaining historian with a real gift for prose. Christian has since left SDSU to move back to his native Australia.   If you want the Soviet's perspective, *Operation ANADYR : U.S. and Soviet generals recount the Cuban missile crisis* / by Anatoli I. Gribkov gives a first hand account.   These photos are marked as Getty images, but the majority are from Jacob Riis' *How the Other Half Live*. Riis' photos are considered instrumental in forcing the U.S. government to address urban squalor.   You really didn't need to add the disclaimer. Conservatives would view your answer as too liberal.   Shane   So...what's the punchline?   Can't you just taste the sweet irony? No one can complain that evolution doesn't have a sense of humor.   I have a similar outlook as the post, however I ask myself, "Will I remember this event 5 years later?" If the answer is yes, I give the matter more attention. Otherwise, the event doesn't get to rent space in my mind.   I'm not casting doubt on your argument, I'm merely stating that the majority of the US doesn't equate the skin color "black" with the biblical story of cain and abel.  edit: I should qualify that statement by stating "in my experience".   Your argument about the mark of cain being that of skin color is a southern religious myth. I was told the same thing while growing up in Tennessee; as I moved to other areas of the US I learned this idea was a racist retelling of the bible story.   [Here](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/the-rape-of-nanking/) is a link to a documentary of the Rape of Nanking.   Lithgow also played the serial killer 'Trinity' on season 4 of Dexter. I love Colbert's "inside jokes."   Christian's argument is that the ability to increase productivity enough to sustain a large population was absolutely necessary to the formation of a civilization. An example of this can be found in the multitude of indigenous tribes that formed in early North America. Lacking access to draft animals for the plowing of land, indigenous Americans could only produce enough sustainable foodstuffs for a very small population. As a result, the impetus to join together into larger communities was almost nonexistent. The only North American example I can think of is the Anasazi (Chaco Canyon) and it fell long before the Spanish arrived.    Gotta give some love to M. Jordan, he's trying to reclaim the Hitler 'stache.    The Russian winters stopped Napoleon and Hitler. Very nice find.   The really exciting part of this link is that the National Review is a conservative right wing website. It seems fear of PIPA and SOPA crosses party lines.   I phoned the number provided for Maria Cantwell and the staff that answered the phone said that Cantwell had publicly come out against SOPA and PIPA on Dec. 17. He also stated that she was presenting her own bill in the upcoming sessions.  edit: I called Patty Murray's DC office as suggested by paulser, and left a message on the machine.   According to David Christian's *Maps of Time: an introduction to big history*, the important factors to civilization's formation were: a temperate climate; abundance of tameable animals (cattle, llamas, chickens) that could feed and work for him; access to consistent water supply; enough land to absorb population growth.   You might also enjoy Clint Eastwood's remake of Shane - Pale Rider.   IMHO Shane, The Outlaw Josey Wales, and High Noon are all classic gunfighter films.   A very nice find so kudos to you. Ford was such an enigma - he refused to enter/exit his home's front door because he didn't want to disturb a nest of birds, yet he was willing to employ brutal methods to stop unionization.   *Stalin's Russia* by Chris Ward. It's a book written for historians so at points the narrative will seem dry.   Seems at least one of his ideas got a shitload of people killed.  "Maury, knowing a whale to be a mammal, theorized that a northern passage between the oceans that was free of ice must exist to enable the whales to surface and breathe. This became a popular idea that inspired many explorers to seek a reliably navigable sea route. Many of those explorers died in their search."  To clarify my counting system, a shitload of people is around 1-500 people, after which we move into buttload country (500-5000) and beyond that is fuckload. Let's not bother talking about fuckloads.   I was thinking of something more along [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:We_Can_Do_It!.jpg) line.   Good call...The Fog of War is a must see.   Without a doubt IMHO the best single volume history of the world is written by David Christian - *Maps of Time: An Introduction to Big History*. His book explores the planet's history, and explains why certain civilizations advanced while others remained static.   I would have no problem with Obama giving back the NPP, but wasn't one also given out to several members of the Manhattan Project?   It's fairly dry reading but J. Gaddis "We Now Know" gives a fairly accurate view of the Cold War from both side's perspective. "Inside the Kremlin's Cold War" by Zubok and Pleshakov is a more detailed study of life behind the Iron Curtain.   I spent four years with for/against the U.S./Soviet versions of this program. There's a good reason the U.S. required retrieved photos vs using bandwidth; the Soviets utilized frequency bursts to transmit their data. If the U.S. monitored the Soviet missile launch sites, the type of booster vehicle used by their space agency gave U.S. monitors a clue to the type of Soviet satellite being launched. The booster information also gave a clue to the satellite's orbit and with this information it was possible to intercept their satellite's transmissions. By using a capture/retrieval method, the U.S. assured this project remain relatively secret.   This article is satire and meant to be funny. If it offended you, perhaps a sense of humor is necessary.   MA in U.S. urban, race, and media history. I have a strong understanding of race and its impact on the American urban landscape. I also have an in-depth knowledge of Hollywood film history and its use as a vehicle of history.    A simple message for the simple minded, but I don't see the ad as promoting war with Iran.   And who determines the combatant status, and is the process open to public scrutiny?   I'm asking myself the same question. Did I post such lame links that the powers that be decided to invite me to submit here (AGU) where frivolous posts go to die?    I read an article on Reddit about OWS being labeled a terrorist organization in London. I have no doubt that the U.S. government will follow the Brit's lead, and with the possible indefinite detention of American citizens, OWS protesters could simply be disappeared.   I would also add to Taibbi's list term limits for elected congressional officials. This would allow more Americans the opportunity to participate in its democracy, rather than having the same old tired wealthy families deciding the fate of our nation.   This article was posted in the worldnews and truereddit subreddits but was quickly downvoted. Does reddit have a pro-israel contingent that downvotes articles that they perceive as negative?   I'm already doing that; it's even sadder that I have to hide my degrees.   I completely understand the author's dilemma, and her logic in the solution. I also understand why she'd want to finish a degree with Duke. I've spent a lifetime collecting degrees, but none of them come with a pedigree. Really, who would a HR person rather hire, someone with a BA from Metropolitan State College of Denver or from Duke University? Do I want an employee from Austin Peay State University or from Vanderbilt?  I also shared her belief that an education could lift me out of extreme poverty. In today's economic climate, an extensive education can also exclude an individual from a job's consideration. Employers believe that individuals with graduate degrees will jump ship the minute a better job appears, so they pass on them.   A new generation of brown shirts.   This is an example of a politician who doesn't listen to the public.   Is there a subreddit for ironic/hubris posts?   The natives are getting restless.   The American spies were bad (Elizabeth Cohen), but the British spies were even more productive [(Kim Philby and the Cambridge five).](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Philby)   And quickly put it behind us. More entertainment, please.   My bad, this link is a click-through post. I apologize in advance.   I'll hold a door open for someone 20 ft away and they will usually rush forward to keep me from waiting; just as they approach I let the door go and walk away.   I would imagine it something more like, "Maggots? On my meat? DESSERT!"   I hate to upvote a mox news story, but people should know he wants to make poor people's kids a source of cheap labor.   "Poor little feller, he probably kept up for the first half mile. Well, I'll go back and collect the carcass off the road."   I predict:  With its supply lines cut by Pakistan, the U.S. pulls out all troops by July 2013. Seeing a power vacuum in the region, Pakistan exploits its ties to the Taliban, creating a puppet state. China and Russia extend support to Pakistan in an effort to offset the U.S.'s presence in Asia.   That is totally my bad; I didn't realize that I was doing a self.post and really meant to link to this [article.](http://redd.it/mrc6k)   I'm sorry if I've given the wrong impression. The article is a convincing counter argument that Wolf's story wasn't completely true, an opinion that might not sit well with OWS.   I don't believe protesters should just carry the American flag, they should wrap themselves in the flag as if it's a shawl. As a photojournalist, the imagery of kneeling protesters wrapped in the American flag and being beaten or pepper sprayed would be a dream photograph. It's a win-win situation because the cops will look horrible defaming such a powerful American symbol. It'd be priceless to see how Fox news would spin any violence directed toward the protesters, and Jon Stewart's Daily Show would eat it up.   Judging from the post's title, I thought this would be an article about Kim Philby's bunch. A very good article, though, about a portion of atomic history of which I wasn't aware.   My point exactly.   I see the OWS as a blend of the Populist and Progressive movements. Progressives, such as Jacob Riis,Upton Sinclair, and Teddy Roosevelt, saw the economic effects of business trusts on poor and working-class urban/rural Americans and were appalled. The Populist movement was hampered by what the average American considered the socialist and anarchist threats. These fears of a eastern European horde immigrating into the U.S. resulted in the 1924 Johnson-Reed Act that restricted southern and eastern European immigration. This movement also had strong nationalistic tendencies, which I see as a direct correlation to the contemporary Tea Party movement.  	199
             It does seem like a break even exchange, but who knows maybe a new venue is exactly what each player needed. I could also see Saiko landing with Carolina or maybe Tampa                                                                                                                              Wasn't Calgary on track to have a team before the floods up there derailed everything?            the NASL site will also have a stream                     let's treat this with a bit of skepticism until the league makes a clear, decisive statement. Hartford is really dodgy when it comes to construction   this could all just be bluster. A bit like the "New England Force" promotion that never became anything of note. But it would be great if it were true.         Really good piece, thx!   Fucking glorious   either one, we know what you mean. but they team has a cute video to familiarize folks: http://www.mnunitedfc.com/news/detail/lang/EN/uuid/xk6nrcjhfz04187qeroqw1nya/rules-of-soccer--explaining-the-beautiful-game-simply#.U7cAdfldWSo      oh, and NASL offers a cheap online stream for all teams in the leage   Every MN United home game is on local tv, keep an eye out for them   I too feel rather squishy and uncomfortable about it. a couple of years ago I wrote a piece on the evangelical soccer clubs here in the US (http://soccernewsday.com/usa/a/198/faith-based-soccer). It's murky waters whenever religion comes into play but I think there's definitely a place for it because, ironically enough, truly faithful athletes are less hypocritical in their play   conduct. At least, that's my take   I will back every Queen song used                                          that's sweet bit of trivia   I hope the article didn't seem too rambling or spiteful, thanks for reading   For some they are one and the same   I toyed with putting Borges in the squad as a playmaker for Maradona but then thought that might be too meta...or silly...   Aw, man, I really enjoy this club. Love to see them in NASL                                 I like the sky blue it's a nice connection to the Kicks   Thunder but I do wish that the blue was darker, closer to the MN Stars/NSC Stars blue                  there is less violence in this show (first season at least) than any of the major network dramas                     I think it will, #3 will come out June 11th. But I agree with you, there's a lot happening on each page unlike the more direct narrative of Saga. I wrote a review of the first two issues for The Stake, if you're interested.    I've just gotten into Saga as well. I've found the new series Shutter to be similar   It was nice to know Takada was in the mix. From the stream, it sounded like most were dissatisfied with Daley's lax attempts to get back to defend                     Basso is the only player here I've seen play--he was with USL's Harrisburg City Islanders the last few years. Nice to see him picking up with a higher division, not a bad defender   it's really negotiated in each case. a team can loan a player for a set time (month, three months, six months, whole season) and with a clause that they can be re-called at any time or not. The USL is operating more akin to MLB's minor league system wherein players are movee up and down virtually at will of parent club         I'm sure it's coming, lots of stuff in the queue    thx for this Bree!   you're completely correct--the league is huge (especially with the new wave of expansion) and often information/stats comes down to the individual teams themselves. what's unfortunate it that there's a lot of work to do but not enough funds to hire folks to do it--getting better though.   huh. that's weird. wish I had better info for you but I'm sure they'll sort it out for ya. the folks Ive talked to have always been itching to help   I've not had any problems. You've gone here:http://mnunited.row27clients.com/   I've got some concerns about this 'reserves' squad. They've pummeled Eau Claire and I fear that it will only be a keeping fitness club for the first team and not quite the development club I was hoping    NPSL isn't too good at posting real time information or updating its site, it's an area that they really need to improve upon   here's the roster according to the NPSL: http://www.nationalpremiersoccerleague.com/teams/64214691/65998048-64214780/TEAM.html   not my article, but I thought it worth sharing because there could be some fun discussion about how good/bad the list was. At least you locked down the fuck-face troll angle.                  Midfield was poor all around. I don't know if I'd hack that much on Manny, but the plan for the evening was definitely misguided  	137
 It's already out here!I loved it!   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEtsMqBfSyg   I got very excited with the guest in the season 3 finale.       Why are people commenting they haven't seen it yet?   I went to the midnight release last night where it followed the first Avengers and Winter Solider. Watching it in this order definitley improved the experience and there are some little things I definitley wouldn't have noticed if I hadn't seen Winter Solider directly beforehand.  It seemed everyone's problem with the movie would be too many characters but that wasn't a problem for me. My only gripe with the storylines were one pointless tangent that sort of comes back. The movie is structured very similarly to the first Avengers except for the beginning. The movie also had an extremely unexpected ending for me.   It was also very very funny.   I'm glad we.. uh.. managed to get it up here.   Lot's of Huell Howser videos on youtube for you.  [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImpGsMenmSs) one is probably the best and there is a reference to it in Huell Howser's last episode.   That cat video is obviously just a sketch ucb comedy made. You can see their watermark underneath the everything is terrible one.    Oh wow I just realised how similar the plot seems to be to Dan's pitch. I hope this one has Superman going on holidays to a beach.   I feel like press conferences are the new dances at Greendale. We've had three this season so far.   Tanks but no thanks.   No this is definitely it. They must have forgotten the whole Changnesia thing.   Read the question again there mate.   The phase never truly leaves you.   But our head mod lives in England, doesn't he?   Really, let me try mine *********    We play Countdown here in the UK. No Rachel Ryan though :(      At least it's not here where there is only rain 24/7.   I need to start playing The Sims.   Time Bobby Farts and Procreation   It keeps getting posted every 2/3 days.   I've never had an ad that was more than 30 seconds long and unskipable.   Yep first season is well. One of the first movie homages in the series. Marge has the choice between bowling and Homer.       I used to love Scotts fake games so much. David Cross doing Hollywood Facts is one of my favourite moments.  "Have you seriously not realised this is a bit, David?"      At what point did you find out the show was going to be a Netflix Original? Did this change your role on the show much?         I stopped watching season 1 but I forget where I was. Can I just jump into whatever episode appears interesting to me or is there a strict continuity in later episodes. I remember the first few episodes being quite form free.   It's all about whether you click on it or not.   I'm going to say it was this, especially considering she played Paul's wife on it.   I mean those early youtube videos you used to watch again and again.   It's 5 seconds and then you get to skip it. Who gives a shit what the ads are for if it means money for the creator. Uninstall Adblock.   I'm glad to see these changes          Suh-real humour.      I con't belieb dat.   I con't belieb dat.   I con't belieb dat.   I con't belieb dat.   I con't belieb dat.

 I'm not sure if this is the place for this, but about a month or so ago, my brother's girlfriend broke up with him. Ever since, he's taken it incredibly hard. He's utterly inconsolable and it seems no one can really get through to him.   I've tried chatting with him about it, having had my share of lady troubles in the past, but it's no good. He had once confided in me while they were still together that he saw them as being quite serious. I played it off as him being a high-schooler and thus given to such fancies, but it's obvious that he cared deeply for her.   I don't want him to continue being so depressed, Reddit, as he's exceptionally bright, his terrific grades have begun to falter somewhat, and he's got a full ride scholarship that I fear he may be jeopardizing.   Help me get my brother through this, guys.   A few months ago, it was not uncommon to be able to find Makarovs at J G, Cheaper Than Dirt and others for sale at a fair price but now I can't seem to find them. What happened, gunnit?                           For me, it has to be 922r. What practical purpose could it serve to limit the amount of foreign parts you have on an arbitrarily defined "assault weapon?" I think the rationale is to prevent the importation of military style weapons, but there are a plethora of US made parts that render this purpose moot. It's absolutely retarded.   Does anyone else agree or can you come up with a worse law?                  I don't even have much idea as to where to start with this, but I suppose I can just ask my questions here and hope for answers.  1. Are there any other Communists in this general region?       a. Are there any Communist organizations in Georgia?          b. Are there any [/r/Communism](/r/Communism) readers in the state?    2. What is the best way to spread Communist ideas in such a traditionally anti-Communist region?  3. What is the best way for one in such a politically isolated area to contribute to the cause of the Proletariat?   4. Finally, is there any suggested reading for someone in this dicey political climate?   Thank you for your time and consideration, comrades.               An e-gift card to Papa Johns can go a long way and I now have food for the rest of the month thanks to my generous benefactor.   Thanks to a current deal, [I got three medium pizzas and a 2-liter of Dr Pepper.](http://i.imgur.com/UyoVO.jpg) I fully intend to pay this forward once I get my pay on the 1st of next month. So from the bottom of my heart, thanks Fapocalypse_Now.   Doo doo butter.                                                            I consider myself a liberal and I have for quite some time. The Left's advocacy for egalitarian treatment for all, social services and better living conditions while advancing human rights is just common sense, to me, and the Left seems to be the only end of the spectrum concerning itself with these noble goals.  However, I have noticed that the one right that progressives by and large tend to ignore is firearm rights. So, my question, being a left winger who is also a firearms enthusiast, is this: why are so many progressives anti-gun? Aren't firearms the last line of defense people have against their government?                        I'm looking for a job for my fiancee. We're willing to move absolutely anywhere and could really use the job. She has a four year degree from UC Berkeley in Molecular and Cellular Biology and can happily furnish details on demand.             Hi, /r/Atlantans! I'm engaged but in a long distance relationship and next month, my lovely fiancee is coming to Atlanta. I myself try to get to Atlanta every chance I get, but I am not in town often enough to know any of the good restaurants to which I could treat her and I don't know which ones would be accessible for my wheelchair. Further, we are somewhat strapped for cash as college is very expensive and most of our spare funds are spent on airfare whenever we can get it.  Therefore, I would like /r/Atlanta's advice. What would be an accessible and reasonably priced, yet delicious and memorable dining experience to which I could treat my beloved?   BONUS: You might remember us if you went to the Dragoncon meetup. We were [these](http://i.imgur.com/YynFY.jpg) people.      I'm in a wheelchair and there don't appear to be many couples' cosplays involving wheelchairs. Does anyone have any suggestions?                                        Basically, I'm asking for volunteers. I have successfully mapped from the end of the blue line to my village Leningrad and would like volunteers to help me make it a bona-fide road. Any takers?   In the process of ghetto rigging it, I totally felt like the Doctor; especially once it pinged back on. I think I may be watching too much.      With the recent transgressions against the peaceful protests, the brutality of the corporate police and the unwillingness of OWS moderators to allow discussion of anything but the most bleeding hearted pacifism, I think a new platform is needed to discuss - purely hypothetically and without any limitation - how we should proceed if the peaceful protesters continue to be ground into the dirt by police.   Sure, it's just Atlanta and Oakland now, but what next? Do you really think Bloomberg will let the protesters stay on Wall Street for long? I do not advocate violence, but surely we've enough freedom left in this country to spread the word that we don't have to be docile little bitches for our corporate lords, right?            My fiancee and I just watched [The Fantastic Four](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omKd_bUQlXo) - the 1994 unreleased film - and it was the most hilarious thing we've seen in quite some time. Do you guys have any truly awful films, and does anyone else like to do this?                              I don't even know if this is the right place to ask this, but I was wondering if anybody in the area would like to buy my old Soviet Army uniform.   It's in perfectly good shape, but I've got bills to pay and I bought it at a point where, well... I didn't have bills to pay. It's of 1980s vintage and hasn't been worn since the Communications Bureau in Ukraine divested itself of it.  Pics below  [Front](http://i.imgur.com/QUr12.jpg)  [Sleeve](http://i.imgur.com/Zcumv.jpg)  [Liner info](http://i.imgur.com/ouXFT.jpg)  It includes the jacket and pants. The jacket is sized 51 centimeters at the chest and the pants have no sizing information, but should fit anyone who can fit into the jacket. I am selling it for $125, but the price is negotiable. Let me know if you're interested!                            So, I'm disabled: a through the knee amputation that requires me to use a wheelchair. Here's the kicker, though: I love urban exploration and have always wanted to give it a try. However, abandoned buildings tend not to have working elevators and since they're generally very old, they almost always lack ramps where they're needed. So my question is this: can anyone think of a way to go urban exploring while in a wheelchair?   Miscellaneous, helpful information: I am fairly mobile outside of my chair, though it's restricted to crawling and that's not wise in crumbling ruins, and my chair is manual so I don't have to charge it or anything.   I know this is an unusual question and I'm honestly not expecting a miracle here, but if anyone has any information at all, I'd consider it a boon. Thanks for reading!      I've not really posted here much, but my fiance has; so bear with me if you don't mind.   As you are all, I'm sure, acutely aware; the night is the absolute worst time of day to be missing your lover. It isn't so bad during the day, because I can text or call her and she texts and calls me. At night, though, as I try to sleep, I feel her absence very keenly - as though a part of me were missing. After noticing we were both on Google+, I texted her and we chatted for a while on Skype and she missed me as horribly as I missed her. This is a common course of events.  I want to know, /r/LongDistance, if you have any tips to alleviate our longing for each other. Is there anything we can do or - perhaps - send each other to make our beds feel less empty at night?       I don't know if this is related to Minecraft.net or a problem on my machine, but this morning, the launcher wouldn't let me login. I shrugged it off and waited a few hours until noon. I tried again and the same thing happened. It is now 18:29 and I have tried for a third time, to no avail. I've already updated Java so I don't see what else the issue could be. Any tips?  **EDIT: PROBLEM RESOLVED** Downloading the new launcher has fixed everything.                   We were the obnoxious making out couple at the meetup. I was dressed as Adama and in a wheelchair while she was the sexy lady in my lap.   Our camera was awful and we only got a few pictures, but I kinda wish we had more pics of the convention, so if anyone wants to help me find pictures of ourselves, I would appreciate it. She didn't cosplay, but I did on Friday and Saturday as an East German soldier and Commander Adama respectively. If you can help, I'll thank you forever!   Just an idea I had thought of for this subreddit. Feel free to shoot it down, but I'm in Con Drop mode so hear me out.   What if we had flair for this subreddit and it was what we want to cosplay next year? Reactions: go!       Anyone want another meetup tomorrow? My fiance and I had fun.  EDIT: FUCK IT, I MADE ONE.  6PM SUNDAY Marriott, 10th floor lounge. Be there or you hate reddit and might end up getting robbed by Andy Warhol's ghost.  Trufax.         Now I can't get back to sleep. :(            I'm getting into town on Thursday and I was wondering if anyone else had anything planned for Thursday evening. A lot of my friends won't get in til Friday, so I was thinking it might be a good idea to see what my fellow Reddit congoers are doing.   I have noticed, when looking at pictures of countries outside of North America and Western Europe that there seems to be no care given to public access for disabled people. I am very curious as to why this is the case, as at some point in the future I would love to travel.   I know this is a very broad and general question, but it seems like if the United States - as backwards as we are in accommodating those outside the mainstream - can make laws mandating access for handicapped persons, other countries might do the same. I would love to hear what anyone might have to say on the matter.               There was a picture that was presented twice, the first time being pirates storming a ship with something to the effect of "We're here for yer booty." And the words: How most people view piracy.  The image was again repeated, the second time saying something like "How it really is" with the pirate captain stating "We be here to make copies of all yer cargo." Of note was a toothless pirate scab saying something to the effect of "Where be the amputee porn?" Or something. Anyone got this?  SOLVED BY THE RENWALLZ. THANKS, THE RENWALLZ.                                                                                       I was there last Friday celebrating my birthday and I have got to know... How on Earth did it take me this long to go there? That was so awesome. Are there any other Lips fans on /r/reddit?           	153
 Someone threatening my family.   Unless you are able to make up new words, you will be using words others have used regardless. It's normal, keep writing.  For the record, I made up the word 'bapple' you can't use that one.   I am a 6f tall, shaved head, goatee'd face, tattoo'd 220lb white male...you want to talk about profiling? I can't even cross a border with my kids in the back seat, they will search the car and ask my kids if I am their area dad.  Profiling works both ways here.   I finally had Amazon price match one of my works to free...and that single book is averaging around 250 'sales' a month.  My other works sell comparitavely slow, anywhere from zero - the low teens per month.  Of course, my promo time has been drastically reduced as of late and that is effecting my sales. As well as the fact I am working on my next release.  As far as patterns go? Yeah, if I self promo a ton, I sell more works, if I am silent, so are my sales.      Heap-O-pot-imus   If you need a second set of eyes, let me know.   You have to click that tab.  #headdesk#  You are looking at the banner add.   This is a better explanation than what I would say.  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20060928230555AAePl7a  And it's much easier to paste a link on a tablet!   Actually, we trained for everything.  I trained my students for handling a drive by shooting.  When they got to the basic exam, it was a breeze because the basic scenerios were so easy com paired to what we practiced.  And yes, we used a weight, now remember that 50lbs on dry land is not 50lbs underwater.  We also taught students self defense in water, how to disable a panicked victim as well as how to get out of the grasp of someone who is trying to drown you.  I may add, I am a Canadian, our training has always been harder, my classes were harder than that.  One of my students has even gone on to be an Emerg DR in our local hospital. We still stay in contact.   I trained lifeguards for about 9 years of my life, you could have saved him with the right training.  But you don't have it.  You did your best, and are alive today because of that failure. I would say keep trying to find the woman, even if it is to only exchange a note, or a picture. It can greatly help with the closure you need.  You did the right thing.    I already did that one...sorta...I used solar radiation instead. :-)    Ferris Beulers day off...always a good watch.   Until we found out they used real animals and killed a couple dozen while filming, this was one my kids loved to watch. Not any more.   Found it! They messed the math it seems, best not make the same mistake.  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0708764/goofs   It's a drain. I don't drink from a drain pipe either.   Married my wife 7 years ago, but this year hasn't been lucky in the least.   My wife and I have been together for 9 years. This is our seventh anniversary and it was supposed to be a special one. 7 month 7 years on the 7th.  We had planned everything out, but about two days before we left, the whole family got sick. And I mean, SICK. Chronic fevers, persistent nagging dry cough, sore throats, ear infections. Plumbing went south, the whole works. So we are sitting with the kids and contemplating just packing it in 3 days early, and driving the 9 hours back home to just suffer there.  We forced ourselves to do a hike yesterday. And paid for it at night. It was one thing off a list of about 6 things we wanted to do.  It took us almost a whole year to save for this trip, we get one a year at best. And now it's a wipe.  This sucks on so many levels.   Samples?  Hit us with the first frame when you get it, would love to see it.   While I can't answer all your questions, I can tell something like this was done on star trek TNG. Perhaps some research into the science of what they did might help you.   My wife, my kids, my family.   The sun came up this morning, It will again tomorrow, These times an be tough, but you will pull through.    Ahhhh! ooohhhh.... hmn.   My wife was 20 when we met, I was 31. What you are doing is perfectly normal, and a smart decision.  Your father...is your father. You will always be his little girl. I say this while looking at my 7yr old daughter watching my little ponies. One day, your dad and I will have more in common. Remember this and things will turn around for you.   From what you have said you are already -okay- with it. It's just the option of having a place to run to should you need it. Thats's easy to fix, find another place you can claim as yours for a few minutes/hours whatever you need.   Library.  Coffee shop.  Another friends place.   Always options. You will be fine.    The publishing game is truly one of the most ass backwards businesses...  You got me there. I would argue this if I could even think of a way to...  It just takes a single look at the rise of indie titles to see how the tides are shifting...even if slowly.   Losing control of your work isn't what you should be looking for in a contract. I know this goes against all common sense as an author, but you can decline a contract...If your publisher doesn't consult you on changes, makes all decisions for you, and treats you like the janitor...find another publisher. There are lots out there, and if your work is good enough for one, another will be interested.  Of course, on the other side of the coin, if this is all fine with you, hand over your labour of love, kiss it goodbye and start pushing a work that may or may not be what you started with.  Oddly enough, almost everyone who has responded to my comments are making great points for going Indie. I hope the OP is still reading them.    My publisher does no marketing...  That line alone makes my mind scream - find a better publisher! -   Other than the advance, there would be no reason to even use them.   What other field should I pull my advice from if not the range of my own experience?  I class any traditionally published author as lucky, whether they have to push their own work or not.  I do believe many publishers are encouraging their authors to push their own work, after all, more sales are better for everyone. Yet, sometimes the time could be better spent creating more works for the masses that are waiting for it with baited breath!  (All readers still wait with baited breath right?)   I guess it would depend on who you are trad pub through. I have many author friends that actually are told to write and leave the promo to the people who are paid to do it.   There is some, thing, on the, wing... ( sorry couldn't help it.)   If you have unlimited time and energy, I say go indie.   If you are human, shoot for traditional.   This coming from an indie author...you spend %90 of your available time trying to find more ways to promote your work, and much less time actually writing it. If you expect quick cash from indie, think again. You really have to work for your sales and even a small lapse in promotion can make a big change in the trickle of sales you might have.  Of course, some indies do great.  Just not this guy...yet.   Up vote from a guy with a goatee and has nicked the edges of more times then I can count.   Okay, so straight out...I assume you are barely over 18 if at all, but when you were (are some day?) Have you ever felt an attraction to any younger woman, at all. Yes or no will suffice.   And the exact opposite is implied by yourself.  You seem to think that even though you never thought like this ever, (really?) that everyone else must not think that way too.  Or you willing to admit you are human now? Unless...you are the 18 yr old in question, then your reluctance to admit human nature makes much more sense.      No...I said in my experience...   You are including the world.  And now at the age of 40, I know that this is still true more often than not.    You mean to tell me that you weren't? Or you aren't a man...please. Lie if you like. Whatever makes you happy. I controlled myself, like many others, but to deny the fact, that's just sad.   Or she has a few of her friends over to have a -talk- with him...or not...just speaking as a dad of a soon enough to be teen daughter.  PS: I was an 18 yr old boy once, we can't be trusted...even though I was raised with morals, I still knew what I wanted.   Being on the front page of Reddit... oh wait, that wasn't a dream!    Filling your child's mouth full of candy won't change what your children think of you later. Stick with being a responsible adult instead OP.   Do a good dead for 3 random strangers...  Hey, that sounds like a movie I once saw...  Grants on the good karma!   All works on Amazon are a hard sell as an indie author. Do the shore sell better than my full story at 96k? No, but no worse either.  When I released them, Amazon had no option for distinction, they were just e-books.   Books 1-4 of the jumper series are all independent, yet best read in order. Book 5 ( in the works) pulls all the characters Introduced in the first 4 together, with resolution. Books 1-4 are 10-14k each, and 5 is slated around 42k long...after I have released 5 I plan on doing a full collection. Perhaps 6-12 months later.   Basically, if nothing is happening, why does your reader have to know it? Is what the character eating important to the story line?  If it doesn't progress the story, consider cutting it all together.   Very Welcome!   Hope you enjoy it, and the book too!    He was doing it, koodo's alone for just that.   And front page in 22 minutes. Don't know it that's a record or not, but dang...       I took a different approach.   I have 1 story, broken into 5 parts. I released each part as it finished (10-14k) and am working on the final chapter (roughly 40k, and by chapter I mean...ending)  While they are away with edits, I work on other projects, and am almost ready to release another 42k story.  It's not that hard if you don't mind having a couple irons in the fire at the same time.   I don't want your gold, hit up my books on Amazon instead and buy some of my books, cheaper and we both win!      Once you get enough works out, you can drop one to free. That way you can always count on a couple numbers on your Amazon page. Works for me anyway. Might not get paid, but not as depressing as that brown bar.   Raising a child is a decision. I too have had to make the same one, but from the other side. While to this day I still wonder what might have been, I regret, yet don't, my (our) decision.  Did you do what's right?   No idea.  Did I?  No idea.  I am glad that you were smart enough to think before you made it, and not do something foolish...yet :-)   Enjoy your life, plenty of time for children later on if the opportunity comes again.   Be very clear on your POV shifts, be it with new chapters, larger line breaks, or using dialog tags. Readers are easily confused if you don't make it clear.   And what was the point of this? To try and drag someone down? Maybe...just maybe...they won't try again.    I think it might be flooded...   Don't thank me. It's all you.    And with the smile he gave you, your beauty only increased. Enjoy your day, you are gorgeous.   Or don't take any breaks and plow ever forward. My first work I took breaks and never finished it. Some people write better all at once, never stopping.   Well I would be honored if you decided to grab one of mine some day.   **********-********-**********-*********  I used a number hider so you have to use your memory. :-)    I can make up stories inside my head and people pay to read them.   Bah...Amazon is always missing my books...when will they ever learn.   :-)   (Hey, I did hit the top 100 a couple times already this year! Just not for long...)    You are still breathing, Your heart is still beating, You haven't given up yet. Keep moving forward One step at a time. You can start with sharing your art. I, for one, want to see it.  I wrote poems when I suffered with depression. They are gone now, but they helped me with perspective. Art doesn't have to be everything to everyone. It just has to speak, someone will listen.  Now I write books. My angers and fears are found in thier pages. My art gives the escape when I need it.  Don't lose yours.   Speaking as a man that dated those girls, you are much better off.   And koodos on the writing! That too is a hard road. Let me know if you ever want to swap a story.   Really? With the username gingerkid1234 you ask this?   "Think"   That's odd...if you pm your email, and choice, I will email you it tonight.      In the malls, book stores, coffee shops...   Great read, I honestly had no idea, and I consider myself rather well read...Thank you!   Hmn...And yet I see more people reading in public in the summer time. Maybe Canada is backwards in this...or we all hide when it snows...   I have heard it can help...course...it doesn't "always" help...   It's funny how easy it is to say, just do this...yet in practice it can be so far from easy.  Reviews - Check, plenty of great, and honest, reviews on my work. General concencuss is that -I are a good writer- ;-)  Covers - Meh...I have them. Could be better.  Categories - I cross genres a lot...did the best I could  Marketing - Limited budged and time. Every minute pushing is a minute not writing, working on the balance constantly.   All my works are still available via Amazon, and they have finally (took over a year) price matched one of my works for free. Unless you live in Canada, then it's still full price. Figure that one out...    This time of year?  Never thought of book sales as having a best "time". What would be the best for pushing my next work that's coming out?  December?   No, my works are still available...and yes... under KDP Select, they willl "push" your work for you and submit it to others via email and the like...  I can't say they are, but I can't say they aren't either. You have to be pretty naive to think that in today's world things like this won't happen.  Is it happening to me? No idea...no way to prove it either way.   In short, I have been self publishing for over three years. I have used KDP to give away and do some small promo's with my works. My best month was last December when I put a really large push. I had over 5000 downloads of my works, all free.  Since that time I have seen a steady drop until this month where my books are almost at a dead stand still again.  Amazon sent me a letter that I had to remove my works from other markets, as they were in conflict with the rules of KDP. (They, Amazon, have changed the rules so many times now since I started, I just ignored them until caught. Yes, I know, my bad.) In response I told Amazon to remove all my works from KDP and they agreed.  As of that day, I have not seen a single sale of my work.  Have I been blackballed for not playing nice with Amazon? Has anyone else seen results like this?  What are your thoughts on it?  (For some reason Authors have a very hard time coming clean with actual numbers of book sales. I don't have that problem, but I can understand if you wish to be vague about your own. It's your choice of course.)   You killed my father! Prepare to die...   A law enforcement officer is not exempt from laws. They will be ignored though if you ever decided to try and press a charge. The officers have no magic powers that make them able to do things any safer than the rest of us.   Google how many times a police officer has caused a car crash and you will see what I mean.   Stop and look inside the next cop car you see, they have so many gadgets inside it's a wonder they can see outside the window. This photo might have been a fake, but I have seen many officers use a cell while driving.   Keep it minimal, unless those doors REALLY matter...   If you find yourself using the word -I- all the time, drop it. It's the best way to avoid poor first person writing.   No-one wants to read  I walked to the store. I opened the door. Inside the store I looked for the poptarts. I paid too much for them, but I like them enough to do it anyway.  Of course, sometimes -I- is unavoidable, but use it sparingly.   It only took five beats from the moment he jumped, but those seemed an eternity.  One.  The wind punished Aiden, shoving, and wrenching at his ruined clothes.  Two.  His arms stretched out, the magic built around him forming a bubble in time.  Three.  The scene of potential death burned itself into his memory, even with eyes closed.  Four.  In an instant a tunnel opened, seemingly to pass through the air itself.  Five.  *****  Aiden and Jess were only working on a science experiment to prove that the speed of light could in fact be broken. What they didn't expect is what would happen when they actually did it.  Time itself factures and Aiden is thrown forward into a future where humanity seems to be gone. Plants and animals survive, but the planet is in ruins. Through fate and a little help of magic returned, he manages to find a way to jump into his own past, and attempt to correct what he broke.   With each jump back Aiden unknowingly pulls someone else into his future. Those lucky few also find themselves with new power to go with the changed world.   9: And the government does not listen in on your cell phone calls...oh wait...

At 40 I suddenly feel much younger, thanks!   Old man? I just turned 40! Guess that's like 120 in Reddit years...   I am still stuck on step 23...   You can skip step 7 and just change it to -swear you will never write again-   Oddly, mine would be around the 10 mark as well. And I never want to read it again...okay maybe one day, but one day long from now.   It was a dark and stormy night.   True, but I do give him points for the attempt!

Some mornings I feel like it, but no...not 89.   Welcome, life is a journey, and sharing it with some one else can make it even more rewarding.   The ring of the phone faded into the back of Tara's mind. It was an older phone, heavy, with a rotary dial, and in a shade of light green that was once popular. The color had always reminded her of pea soup, the kind her long past grandmother used to make. The ringing would stop if she left it long enough. It always stopped, and she always ignored it.   Sitting in an old chair, its cover ripped and stained, her arms stretched out, she felt the coarse material under her. Her skin was only a shadow barely seen. A window showed the only light in the room, the faint glow coming through it. She pulled the darkness in close around her, a comfortable friend.  The weatherman had been right about the rain, for once. The steady dripping against her windowsill comforted her in a way she couldn't explain. It tapped out a rhythm matching the heart beating inside her chest. The two intertwined, leaving Tara unsure where one started, and the other ended. The weak light from outside showed the tiny rivers of water cascading down along the glass, hoping to join their brothers and sisters again in a sea of lost friends. The tears they made in their brief visit to her world reminded her of those that fell down her own face. Untouched by humanity, they left only faint traces, as they too escaped to join new friends of a different color, pooling on the floor.  The cold Tara felt was not from the window, or from her dark room. It was a chill from the inside. Others had told their last story and she had drunk the words. Always thirsty for the knowledge they released before the end. She knew this feeling would come, a familiar friend and a welcome one.   Eyelids became heavy for a moment, blurring the window before her, its surface still heavy with rain. She longed to see the heavens one last time, but the streetlight outside stole the night sky from her, the dark clouds blanketing the sky. The faint glow from the street lamp pierced the rain on the glass, creating a million stars shining in front of her eyes, before her slow, tired blink wiped them clear. A smile broke on her lips touched with a blue from her spreading inner cold.   Fingertips painted a slow river of glistening red. They dripped down in a rhythm unlike the rain, painting a poor canvas stretched across the floor. She thought the drops were falling slower than they should. They landed at random, uncaring whether they matched the patterns created around them. A drummer, who played his own beat while the rest of the band played on.   She took a deep breath, and felt sudden warmth. Tara had done all the research, and they hadn't gotten this right. Her fading mind enjoyed the sensation. It spread from inside, like that first sip of a hard drink, a falsehood that promised comfort, but never delivered.   Her eyes were heavy again, and her vision sprinkled with hints of diamonds, the window a blur. The phone rang again, a distant sound, farther than the blood, farther than the rain. They faded as the darkness took over.   The rain stopped.   Listen to each other.  Don't expect some one to change for you if you aren't willing to change for them.   Take some time for yourself every now and again.  Talk, about everything, always.  Never, ever, end a day while still angry. Even if it means staying up all night.  Remember what you fell in love with in the first place.  Know that people change as they grew older, the trick is to be try and change together, and enjoy each others changes.   My wife was 20 when we met, 9 years later and we are still going strong!   I have given myself tingles...but not cried. Least, not yet.   Find a writing partner. Set goals for each other and have incentives to get them accomplished. Exchange your work with a set deadline to keep the pace up.  If you don't have someone to work with, and you are left working alone, perhaps you need to get into a set routine. -This- is your writing time, and you make it so every day. After a few weeks it will become habit and your problem should be solved.   I have a close circle that has access to my works in progress, as well as some -teasers- I have been known to toss up on twitter and FB from time to time.

Chevy...any Chevy and we have the parts for it on the shelf. Imports break the least. There is a reason Chevy almost went bankrupt and Ford is the #1 seller.   Slurm!   My biggest struggle is exposure. I can write, people tell me they like it (even strangers!) Yet, I can't seem to break out of the couple of books a month in sales. I blog, I tweet, I hop...yet finding readers takes so much time, I rarely have enough to write.   	110
       I meant to write 540i, not 545i   - Just about anything with a rare manual (such as Jaguar X-Type, Mercedes W140) - Any obscure JDM sports car or sport model that was never exported (such as Toyota Mark II GT Twin Turbo, 1990 Mazda Cosmo) - 70's-80's American luxury cars (such as Lincoln Continental, Pontiac Bonneville Brougham) - Anything with some sort of connection to an iconic car that may increase in value and decrease in accessibility (such as 1978 Buick Regal Turbo Coupe, BMW E34 545i with M Sport Package.      I'm imagining that passing on the left in an RHD is kind of like passing on the right in an LHD. Is this correct?       They get most of the coolest cars and variants from their own manufacturers, but the inspection system or Shaken, is brutal on modified cars and older cars. The inspection also becomes more expensive as the car gets older too.               Peugeot certainly has a better chance of (re)entering the US market than all those random Chinese car brands that will occasionally announce plans to sell cars in the US but never do.   Chevelle SS wagons were only made from the factory for 73'. For all other years only non-SS wagons were available. This is a case of automotive gene splicing.      Wanting the real deal instead of a similar looking import could also be the reason why so few Europeans buy Lexus.   [Here is] (http://www.auto-types.com/images/_autonews/2011-Volkswagen-Passat-USA-side-view_86.jpg) my [rebuttal](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d6/Chevrolet-impala-2006.jpg). It's mainly in the profile. The Passat you linked the image of is the rest of the world model, which is different from the US and China model, known internally as the Passat NMS.   It seems confusing for me to imagine the company executives talking to each other about how a car is "too American for Americans", but your probably right. Although, the current Volkswagen Passat (US and China model) resembles a previous generation Chevy Impala more than any other VAG car and people buy that.   The following wouldn't look out of place on US streets in their respective eras. I would imagine that a car that looks more similar to the domestic competition would sell a bit better.

Not sure how popular they would be, since in most of the first world countries that already have them, such as Australia their market share is low, dealer networks are small, and people have learned that they are crap.   A large number of Chinese cars on dealer lots would be a red flag (pun intended).                  Can't sleep clown will eat me   Years ago back in middle school a classmate told me a story about a girl who decided to go out at night and sit on a tombstone, after being told that doing so would wake the dead. While she was doing so, a tree branch fell on her. This scared her to death because she thought the branch was one of the undead grabbing her. Is there any truth to this, is it a popular urban legend, or just something the kid made up? I'm thinking it was probably made up since I can't find anything about it after doing a google search.         The diarrhea of sick people               Dirt   For example, if someone went back in time to assassinate Hitler, would it be "our" Hitler who was killed, or "somebody else's" Hitler.    I said "like nothing built today".   Someone fucked his sister.            Daily driver of pleasure car? Either way it's nice to see someone out there who is enthusiastic about these cars and wants to keep one of their own on the road. So many people write off these boxy full size domestics as dowdy and uninspiring, but they do have a unique character and presence like nothing built today, except for perhaps a Toyota Century.            Perhaps, I'm sure that years before the JDM craze occurred some US soldiers stationed over there probably purchased local cars and imported them back home when their service was over.      Ten years too late            So Justin Bieber, Blair Witch copycats, and Real Housewives.      Ill start with the original Infiniti Q45. The quality, ride, performance, and reliability were all fine enough for it to compete with Lexus, Acura, and the Germans. But they were never able to get the grill right for it to have the same appeal for most buyers.      Americans need a brand with a luxury reputation to view a car as prestigious, but in other countries a single car in a large brand's model range can be. This is why the VW Phaeton, Mazda 929, and Toyota Crown, which all had or have a luxury image in their home market failed here. In other countries, people are able to understand that not all Mercedes-Benzes are luxury cars (E-Class taxi, A-Class hatchback), yet some cars from brands that also sell economy cars are (Toyota Century, Hyundai Equus). Does the fact that Volkswagen sells Golfs too actually make a 12 cylinder, hand built, $70k Luxo barge any less luxurious or advanced than the A8 which shares much of it's same technology, materials, and mechanicals.         I think the average transaction price of Land Rover as a whole is probably higher than the average transaction price of BMW or Audi.         I'll  say it's this, based on name recognition and perception of prestige, but your free to organize them in any way you think is fit.  Exotic  1. Bugatti 2. Ferrari 3. Lamborghini 4. McLaren 5.

Kia         Candle Cove   I am asking if there are isolated communities where the locals are either extremely hostile and antisocial towards outsiders or where inbreeding, alcoholism, drug use, mental illness, eccentricity, religious fanaticism, or a combination of these qualities results in a sizeable number of residents whose appearance or behavior makes people who don't know them fearful, whether they should be or not.      In America, yes. But in more homogenous countries such as Japan, Albania, or Nigeria it must be an event that takes place much later on for most, at least in person.         I faintly remember part of it from when I was a little kid.   As biological males, these "female" athletes should probably clobber the teams made up of real women with their larger muscles, larger bodies, and testosterone.   I've read about Oniontown before, but the legend is far bigger than the reality and most of the stories are embellished here say.   By this I mean they don't have and never had a birth certificate, social security number, or other documents.   Are they future serial killers or just imitating hunters?   I decided to look at the prices for G25s in my area and found plenty within the 25-45k mile range that were nearly all selling for prices in the mid teens through low twenties. This seems like an enormous bargain for a 2-3 year old luxury sport sedan with average mileage that looks a lot like the current model (renamed Q40). Besides the smaller engine size, is there anything that turns people off from these cars and keeps prices low?         Was looking at the MBUSA website and scrolling through their models. An E63 coupe was not listed. This seems confusing to me, as there are AMG versions of the C class coupe, CL, as well as the E sedan and wagon. Shouldn't an E63 coupe be built since coupes are typically associated with sportiness and the CLK which it replaced was made available as an AMG in the past?   This thing is ungainly as fudge. Lincoln Towncar Grill, Cadillac Seville? doors, cartoonish proportions.  - https://www.flickr.com/photos/lderen/15207609572/ - https://www.flickr.com/photos/lderen/15208005725/in/photostream/   Old people who drive slow or have forgotten the rules of the road driving pretty much anything, but when I notice a Mercury Grand Marquis, Lincoln, Buick, or Cadillac DTS, I'm usually on alert. I try not to honk at them.   It could be worth more money in the future, but there is no way of telling for sure. People are now asking stupid money for Datsun 510s, which when they were at the age a 91' Accord is now were just old, low value imports quite like yours.      Hyundai makes a better Mercedes alternative today than Ford tried to back in the 70's.   I thought of this question because yesterday I saw a 90s era 9C1 Caprice being used for patrolling by my county's PD, complete with the old style paint design. I was quite suprised that they would still be using a car in their fleet that had been discontinued almost 20 years ago, especially since most of their other vehicles I see are relatively new.   Somebody doesn't want you to recognize the backdrop.      What about a game show, Win DeNiro's Dinero. Kind of like Win Ben Stein's Money.   Studebaker   For example, even the sporty Mercury Marauder and Chevrolet Impala SS were only offered with an automatic. Also worth noting, in 1971, GM eliminated manuals from their full-size cars, as they didn't sell well enough, even in the most bare bones of Chevrolets. This surprises me because back then manuals were probably more popular than they are now, and many people whom had grown up driving big cars with manuals like it was no big deal were still alive.               Not that I have to, but most people immediately junk a car when it stops running, I think you could get more money by selling the parts off it. Especially when scrap metal prices are low.   How do writers name movie, TV, book, play, etc. characters? Some are funny names, some are realistic, some are based on the names of the actors who play them, some are based on people known by the cast, some are meant to match the appearance of the character, and many are a mystery.

The expressionless   Most recently, a hooded figure in the corner of a hotel room during sleep paralysis. I also sometimes see ones of different shapes and sizes, walking slowly, occasionally with faint red eyes in the dark of night while awake, though more often when I was a child. One I remember well at age 7 or 8 appeared to have the shape of a large man with a small head I saw while I was living at my granddads house. Seeing them as a kid was terrifying, though they left me alone and stayed on the other side of the room. Seeing them today isn't as scary but still unsettling.   BTW, these shape shifters aren't the only shadow figures I've seen.   Starting when I was 15, at a few times while experiencing sleep paralysis late at night, I have seen figures walking into my room or standing just outside it who appeared to have the shape and features of one of my parents (though it is a bit harder to tell in the dark). I would ask the one I thought I saw, (once my mom, twice my dad) if they walked in on me last night when I woke up in the morning, they said no each time. The last time this happened was about three months ago, but happens quite sporadically. The last time it happened I thought I saw my mom walk in for a couple seconds and also could hear the voices of strangers uttering unintelligible speech coming from downstairs, as well as thunder that wasn't actually happening. This was the most vivid of these dreams, the two others were just sightings of what I thought was my dad with really nothing else strange going on and my feeling of being "awake" was not as strong. Around the time of that last dream, my mom also said she had a very realistic dream where she saw a shadowy figure that she thought was me standing to the side of her side of the bed.

I personally would rather see Woody Allen and GG Allin perform together, but GG is dead.   When I was between the ages of 5-10 I would often see shadowy figures, red eyes, and strange faces or creatures in my room when it was dark that weren't really there. When the lights went on these would disappear or become completely innocent items, but I was often too afraid to move. When the closet was left open, it would be worse. My mind still occasionally plays tricks on me in the dark, but now I know better.      In what area (town, city, neighborhood, etc.) do you seem to see the coolest cars when you go there?      1971-76 GM full size cars. These are big, big land yachts like Buick Electras, Olds 98s, Cadillac DeVilles, and Chevrolet Caprices. Fomoco's Lincoln Continentals of 70-79 are also very nice.      - W222 S65 - W211 E63 - W124 AMG Hammer - C126 560SEC - W108 300SEL 6.3          Nice survivor Grand Prix! A shame it didn't get much love over on r/classiccars.   I don't like thinking of people with disabilities or deformities as creepy, even if that may sometimes be my gut reaction.   Not that creepy by itself IMO, but it vaguely reminds me of Dren and would probably be terrifying in the dark or as a silhouette.   A is suicidal and happened to be held at gunpoint. When this happens, A does not comply, as he figures this is his opportunity to get killed without having to do it himself. B, is the gunman, his gun turns out to either be fake or empty of ammunition. After this happens, A, decides to run and hide. He calls the police to report being held at gunpoint by B and soon decides he no longer wants to die. What would the odds of this happening for real?   The Mercedes-Benz CLS shooting brake is another great car we cant get in America.   Full size, RWD, V8, American cars and four door hardtops.   Which were the five that cost under $400 and which one of the ten under $700 likely cost the most when new?      Would this fall into the uncanny valley? It's like looking at artificial life forms or aliens that have shapeshifted to look human.   I imagine him looking like a combination of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and GG Allin.   80's and 90's Acura Legend = modern Honda Accord   This beats the guy a few towns over from me who owns like 6 80's Oldsmobile Cutlass Supremes.

How would someone who has been isolated from the outside world for a decade or more, such as an ex con, kidnapping victim, or prisoner of war adapt to the times when they re enter society? For example, if somebody had been confined from the outside world for 20 years and were released today, they would likely be bewildered by the changes that have taken place in technology, world affairs, their own family, and other things. Would such a person have to catch up with what has happened during all this time they missed or end up "living in the past"?   Sorry if I caused any offense with this post. I am an American who has never been to Sweden and have only second hand knowledge of car culture over there.   V8, 4WD, tow package, heavy duty cooling system, heavy duty brakes, heavy duty battery, 160 amp alternator (standard model has 105), and available spotlights.   Corolla or Saturn   If you want to bring it back in at least 4 years under the 25 year rule, it will have to currently be 21 years old or older, which limits you to cars from 1993 or earlier, assuming the current petition to decrease the rule on personal imports to the US to 15 years is not successful. If you choose a newer car that was also available stateside, you can legally import it, but will have to drop more than it's worth into making it conform to North American regs. There is also the two more extreme options of importing a car under Show   Display (most of these are very rare or expensive and cannot legally be driven over 2500 miles a year) or getting a job that will entitle you to the benefit of Diplomatic Immunity. Otherwise you may be at risk of getting the car seized and possibly crushed by the DHS like they did with a number of Land Rover Defenders last month.   3500 sounded reasonable until I saw the miles. Very few of these cars are left without everything from the Pep Boys catalog added on, abuse that goes beyond normal wear, and a significant accident or theft history.   A used Chevy Tahoe with the Special Service Package can be picked up for about that or lower with below 80k at a Police or Government Surplus auction.   Perhaps a Chevy El Camino or Jeep Comanche. The El Camino is pretty simple, should get better mileage since it's car based, and will hopefully be cheap since they were last built in 1988. The Jeep Comanche, last built in 92' is also older and probably on par with the Baja in terms of rarity, but is based on the XJ Cherokee, which is one of the most reliable and sought after Jeeps of the recent past. The XJ is popular among off roaders and were produced from 1984-2001 in large numbers, so finding replacement parts and aftermarket support should be easy.   Porsche Cayenne (used), Porsche Macan (new)   These cars are part of the Raggare subculture, but most Raggarbil are customs or pristine classics, these clapped up superbeaters are comparatively small in numbers.   I have heard a lot about the American classic car culture of Sweden (Raggare). But one element I find strange is pilsnerbil. Drivers of these cars cruise and blast music while their passengers drink booze (I think this is legal over there). They are mostly 50s-80s sedans, such as full-size four door Chevrolets and similar GM cars with an exaggeratedly beaten appearance (similar to the look of the [Trailer Park Boys shitmobile] (http://imcdb.org/images/272/588.jpg)). They are typically primer painted, have junky looking interiors, mismatched wheels, graffitied slogans, hastily applied customizations, and duct tape repairs, but are mechanically well maintained. This seems like a confusing take on rat rods with a hint of bozosoku added.

    It's not available in paperback form yet (or hardback either).   Obviously an orchestrated campaign against him, though I'm not sure who is behind it. Here's Mike's view:  https://j4mb.wordpress.com/2015/01/25/spoiler-reviews-on-amazon-com/  Update, i just realised the forward is by Erin Pizzey, someone who's done far more for domestic violence victims than anyone else on the planet. So these feminists are attacking a book fully endorsed by someone who should be by far their biggest hero.  Update 2, A quote from the feminist behind the campaign to leave all the negative reviews:  "Someone gave Mike a toothy blow job and now he hates all women. Heres a shining example of some of his work available on Amazon. Ive already written a review, sarcastically titled Good Book, Bad Fonts. **Lets Internet justice the guy who would like to legislate that less efforts be made to help girls into STEM careers.**"            And the Democrats are equally gleeful if it's innocent white men locked up.         If the republicans would happily introduce half the J4M B policies then how come they're almost as hostile to the idea of equality for men as the Democrats? Ideas such as male disposability, MGM and locking up innocent men are all equally popular within both parties   This just in - advocating for the rights of boys as well as men makes you a sex offender.      Protesting against mutilating a child's genitals against their consent = creepy  Taking a knife to a child to violate them sexually and cause irreparable damage to their genitals = not creepy      Are Scientologists obliged to murder anyone who tries to leave the religion?            Certainly some good arguments there, but I still think it's better to deny traffic to any misandrist sites.  Personally I sometimes link to such sites if comments are open, whereas I'd always use an archive were that not the case. I really see little or no value in visiting a hate site if can't even debunk the lies of the author.            Well in a free market in a democratic country with freedom of speech, then if enough readers wish to see such content, and if such material is profitable, then it's the Sun's right to publish it (not to mention and the reader's right to view it should they have the funds to purchase a copy).  If feminists want to campaign against harmful media outlets then the worst women's gossip magazines are a million times more harmful than page 3 and much of the harmful material is outlined and advertised prominently on the front page. Page 3 is completely the wrong target, proving the campaign is misguided at best, or a stunt, or simply anti-sex prudish feminists attacking men and employment opportunities for attractive young women.   Page three models are forced into appearing in the paper against their will? If that's the case I suggest you call the police and report such evidence to them.      Makes a change from the huge numbers of mother and latest boyfriend killing a man's child I suppose.         Journalist who has been writing in various newspapers in Ireland on men's issues (and other topics) every so often for a decade or two. I don't pretend to have a complete picture of his career, I realise he's certainly not perfect, though still has done some good work over the years.   He mentioned a (different?) interview regarding the issue of rape where he raised the question of both parties having sex and both being so unable to drunk that they'd be unable to consent. Apparently the feminist refused to answer the question, claimed it was offensive and walked out!   That's a strange interpretation - it's the feminists who are trying to stop these women working and he's against that.   What a fantastic radio show, being from the UK this is the first time I've heard of Niall Boylan but he puts most UK radio and TV hosts to shame. He was civil throughout, fair, completely honest and open and had a more than impressive grasp of all the issues too.  Surely destined to get a show at a bigger radio station before too long?      I now have a new favourite radio presenter and his name is Niall Boylan.      Note that teh BBC didn't allow a debate here, they just let Mike state his case and then predictably give the feminist the final say (and make nasty insinuations about Mike's private life)      The same organisation that wrote this report is actually notorious for its discrimination against men. it not only bans them from many fund-raising events, it refuses to properly fund prostate cancer research.  Their reasoning for this is that prostate cancer research was neglected in the past and thus our understanding of it is still relatively poor because of this. Thanks to this discrimination of the past, there isn't likely to be a breakthrough any-time soon, so they're not going to fund current research at the same level as they do with many other cancers (such as female specific ones).  They're literally discriminating against prostate cancer patients today simply because they were discriminated against yesterday: http://therightsofman.typepad.co.uk/the_rights_of_man/2012/08/cancer-research-uk-neglecting-prostate-cancer-today-because-it-was-neglected-yesterday.html   Point two makes a bit of sense, as for the rest, it's absolutely incredible, particularly point 1 which turns reality on its head.      Article is open for comments         A woman actually won silver at the Olympics when the genders used to compete together. I expect the men must have raised their game somewhat since then, but it shows what's possible and such a feat could never happen in almost any other event.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Murdock     Well it wouldn't be a "top team", realistically I should think a really great women's player might manage in maybe the 4th or 5th tier.  Obviously we'd never ever see any female defenders, goalkeepers, defensive midfielders etc, but a skilful play-maker might cope at a low level.  People do tend to under estimate the gulf between male and female athletes. For example Martina Navratalova is without doubt the greatest female tennis player of all time and she openly admitted that she could only beat men ranked 200th (or lower).   There have been huge changes at the Telegraph over the last 6 months or so. All sorts of important staff leaving (or being forced out) and reorganisations etc. This has been covered on and off in the Guido Fawkes blog.  The men's section is great (and actually quite a new development) but other than that it's a pretty awful paper now.  I guess their strategy is to chase readers by trying to move toward the center (as occurs with politics) and to try to seem relevant by going along with the mainstream and abandoning any of their values or principles.   If it's based on merit then there wouldn't be a single female in it (or there might be just one on the bench if the worst nation there had a severe injury crisis, a small population and the very best female player in history).  I'd certainly support merging more male and male competition, though it would first make sense to do so in events where there's less difference in ability (e.g. shooting) or at least non contact sports such as athletics, swimming etc.   Channel 4 doesn't even try to hide it's bias these days. It's such a shame what they've become, used to be a really interesting channel back in the day.      Mike is actually only anti-radical feminism. He's ok with the feminism of say 1960. His argument is that for the last 40+ years the only type of feminism of any consequence has been radical feminism, hence it's ok/necessay to label himself as anti-feminist at the present time.   Mike is very much improving in his media appearances, this was from back in August and he does seem more focused on men in his 2015 appearances.  It certinaly woudl be great if people gave feedback, not just on Mike's debating, but perhaps more importantly on the manifesto itself.   Mike seems to be better at handling these debates by the day. Really enjoyed this one, some real passion from him and made some excellent points.      Don't see a men's rights angle here other than the daughter getting twice the compensation of the son.  Would be a men's rights issue had she not been jailed, so in this instance it's nice to see a woman actually getting an appropriate sentence for once.   The problem is that suicide isn't something that happens in isolation to the rest of a man's life. If we actually sorted out the horrific injustices and human rights violations caused by the family courts, divorce settlements,  false rape accusations, and dealt with crimes such as male genital mutilation and domestic abuse of men then we'd probably eliminate half of male suicides overnight.         Dreadful article, but well worth seeing the comments.         Try this: https://web.archive.org/web/20131218171247/http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/24th-march-2007/16/read-the-small-print-before-the-next-comic-relief   She was bad at times, but some of her questioning was actually rather better than what Mike usually deals with. For example, her question contrasting the preference theory with the J4M B shared parenting one was almost worth asking and there was slightly more intelligence in her through process there than your typical feminist.  Many of the articles or discussion about J4M B are basically pure abuse, derailing or complete lies about the manifesto. She at least did none of these very much other than at the very beginning.   Charity in question is "Paws for kids" which is highlighted in the 4th paragraph      http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/24th-march-2007/16/read-the-small-print-before-the-next-comic-reliefl  Two weeks ago, in these pages, Rod Liddle memorably attacked what he called the fascistic smugfest of Red Nose Day, deploring the way in which we obediently shower money on charity just because were told to by people on the telly. Rods piece made me wonder where this 40 million actually goes. The answer, besides the charities mentioned above, seems to be a remarkable number of organisations advocating womens rights. There was the Womens Aid Foundation, which was given 112,447 for its campaign against domestic violence. Bassetlaw Womens Aid separately received 66,174 for the battered women of Bassetlaw. The Family Welfare Association received 114,501 for its domestic abuse service in Leicester  which, contrary to its name, doesnt offer a service beating up members of your family on your behalf, but helps the beaten-up. There was 43,000 for Womens Integrated Services, Harrow; 65,726 for the Migrant Womens Network; **and even 77,236 for Paws for Kids, which takes in animals when abused families enter refuges  in other words, it keeps battered womens bunnies in fresh carrots.**   It is a similar story with the 60 per cent of Comic Relief funds which are spent in Africa. There was 797,310 which went to the African Womens Support Group, 500,000 to the International Community of Women Living with HIV/Aids, 120,000 which went to the Womens Development Agency in Ghana, 25,000 for the Inter-African Womens Development Organisation, and so it goes on. Even the neutrally named charities on Red Nose Days list turn out to be involved rather more heavily on the female side: Childhope UK, which received 857,314, turns out to be spending most of the money on the street girls of Bangladesh. If Red Nose Day can be summed up in one sentence, it is: shave your nipples and save a fallen woman.  I am sure many of these charities do a jolly good job, and I wouldnt wish to make light of domestic violence, but it does rather beg the question: **why do all these womens charities, which you never see rattling collecting tins or placing adverts in the national press, feel the need to disguise their fundraising in the pratfest that is Comic Relief rather than appealing directly to the public? Are they worried that if the British public realised where their money was going they would be less inclined to be so generous?**               The white Ribbon campaign sis actually far more discriminatory than even this guy suggests. Not only do they hate male victims, their only interest is the extremely narrow field of "men's violence against women".  Obviously that rules out male victims (both heterosexual and homosexual), but they're also marginalising any lesbian victims of dv, not to mention children. What makes this particularly bad is that many studies find lesbian relationships to be more violent than any other and we all know of the many children murdered by their mothers, fathers, step parents and mother's boyfriends.   Worth remembering that the BBC have used the public's money to employ this extremist feminist as a presenter.            I posted the ITV link previously but it seems to only work for UK viewers. This video is on youtube so will work for everyone.      and why the party exists!   What s now the UK's third biggest party started off as a single issue party, with just as narrow as focus as J4M B if not more so. Not only has UKIP enjoyed massive success, it has also forced issue to be debated and forced other parties to come up with competing policies in their areas of concern.  In even forcing a discussion of the harm caused by feminism J4M B is already achieving something that has largely been completely impossible in the mainstream media.   Well the context we have is a court system that completely marginalises fathers teh vast majority of the time.  Thing may be as you describe, but the odds are very strongly against that possibility.   Well it will be on youtube before too long, Mike puts all his stuff on there eventually. Here's an alternative link, though it also requires a postcode.  http://www.itv.com/thismorning/hot-topics/britains-most-controversial-politician One workaround may be to ensure that your browser isn't sharing your location with the site.   Mike was on national tv today, on a show with with at least a million viewers.   I had to enter a postcode to watch the video. Seeing as it is hosted on a Scotland based site then any Scottish postcode should work, I chose "G2 4PP"  For the benefit of viewers from overseas, appearing on this programme is a big deal. It's probably the UK's most popular breakfast tv show and both the presenters are very high profile. **There will have been at least a million people watching.**  Update, done a little searching and seems he's also been on LBC (London's biggest radio station) and also Notts TV. I expect a BBC appearance is going to be pretty inevitable too.      Certainly more per hour.   Direct link to comments: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/men/thinking-man/11347194/An-anti-feminist-political-party-is-depressing-news-for-men-and-women.html#disqus_thread      Thanks, though as expected it's tiny and hidden away. Still better than most of the UK media though I suppose.      I'm aware of a one second glimpse on Newsnight. Can't find a single example anywhere on their websites either nor on any news bulletin. "Many times" really has to be a serious exaggeration.      **Update, just read up on the law, basically all donations under 500 can come from anywhere. Only amounts of 500 and above are actually classed as donations under UK electoral law:**  http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/102280/sp-manage-donations-rp.pdf  So, as long as you're not planning on giving J4M7B more than $750 then there isn't an issue and you can donate immediately. Here's the link to do so:  https://j4mb.wordpress.com/donate/     (post was incorrect)    We should all support him.  Not to mention the other gentlemen standing as J4M B candidates. Ray Barry in particular is a brilliant speaker and hugely compassionate individual.   Jo Swinson   He hates feminism, not women.   I think he slightly overdoes the controversy at times, but 95% of it is actually very useful and pretty genuine.      Yes it was pretty much impossible for a lot of young men to afford car insurance in the UK. The EU ruling means that's no longer the case. Insurance is still often very expensive for young and inexperienced drivers, but at least the additional huge surcharge for being male has gone). Our "equalities" minister opposes this change and wants to make driving for young men completely unaffordable again (which effectively forces quite a few to break the law by driving uninsured).   Seems that the victims wouldn't testify, something quite common in domestic violence cases. Not really the judge's fault if witnesses are too scared to appear in court.   In case people are wondering, the vile misandrist feminist is Green Party politician Beatrix Campbell:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrix_Campbell   This is the same "Equalities" minister who only favours equality when it benefits women. For example, when the EU ruled that car insurance premiums should be based on the merits of the driver, and that punishing men for being male was sexist , then she openly opposed the ruling!  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-life/9764984/Womens-very-unfair-Christmas-present-car-insurance-price-hike.html      I generally regard the BBC as biased cowards, though to give them credit they did at least show the cover on Newsnight. I can only guess that these cartoons are slightly more palatable to the Guardian/BBC management due to the the fact that Charlie Hedbo is left-wing. Still, a much welcome move and nice to see these two to actually be acting in a commendable fashion on this topic for a change. However, there's still no image on the BBC website.  A quick Google search shows quite a few US outlets publishing the image, such as CBS, Yahoo, Business insider and ABC.  The Telegraph only has the text, which is better than nothing and certainly preferable to both the Mail and independent who have nothing whatsoever.   Some pretty nasty feminist "academics" work at Warwick (or at least did a few years back when I read about them) and some of Harman's kids went there (and got special treatment). Therefore it's particularly surprising for this paper to come from an academic at Warwick.         The problem is that they make these same standards ridiculously low in order to try to accommodate female officers. 5.4 on a bleep test isn't really any sort of real fitness test. It's just a race to the bottom really.  Furthermore, in some ways such a test probably favours smaller and unfit females who can repeatedly change direction more easily than large muscular men who might also be carrying a few pounds.   Another way of looking at the figures is that rougly 1 out of every 12 females was unfit for duty compared with 1 male out of every 83.      Try this youtube link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yOvTgi2bRgY   Complete nonsense, there are a great many political organisations out there and misandrist groups who are classed as charities but clearly do more harm than good  (or at least do enough harm to cancel out the good).      The best argument against such disproportionate funding is the introduction of the HPV vaccine. That's going to make it an much less significant health concern in a few years time. Funding of research should look at medium or long term projections, so it's likely to be particularly wasteful to throw so much into research of something that is now largely being vaccinated against.         The feminist behind the "Freedom Programme" is Pat Craven, she appears extensively in this clip I'd saved from 2009.  From the video description:  "A good deal of exposure - far too much - was given to Pat Craven of 'The Freedom Programme', whose contribution echoed her organisation's website http://freedomprogramme.co.uk in portraying a parallel universe in which victims can be assumed to be women, perpetrators can be assumed to be men. In common with many women running organisations focused on female victims of DV, she showed not an ounce of compassion for male victims, not recognition of female perpetrators. These women are so driven by visceral hatred towards men as a class that they can't even bring themselves to PRETEND to care about male victims.  Ray Barry is the leader of Real Fathers for Justice, and will be standing for J4MB in Broxtowe at the coming general election. His media performances are always impressive - whether on television or radio - and this is a particularly good example. His contributions start at 5:23 and 15:42. In the first contribution he presents data from the British Crime Survey, showing the consistent figure of 40% of victims of DV being men, which Pat Craven blithely says she doesn't agree with (!) then changes the subject by turning to Cristina Odone."            How about not linking to this trash in future please?               A far more pressing issue in education is the inability to recruit male teachers, particularly in primary schools. I wonder if he also supports discriminating against female staff too? (and would be willing to state as such).         Can highly recommend the order-order blog for the most part. Non UK readers might not be aware that the blog rivals newspapers in terms of the traffic it receives. Also it is considered essential reading for every politician so it's great to see feminist hypocrisy exposed to huge a large audience.       Firstly, he discounts the fact that some women aren't permitted to use mixed gender spaces due to religious and cultural restrictions  Those same restriction also apply to men of that religion though, and no religion has vastly more females than males.   Secondly, he assumes that a gym membership fee somehow equates to a fixed number of hours of usage of the gym.  it's not hours of usage, it's about access. If the council were truly taking gender issues into consideration they'd see that men die earlier than women and thus exercise is crucial in combating this disparity. They'd also know that men work longer hours than women and commute longer distances and therefore have the most severe restrictions on when they are able to go to the gym. If the gym are then making this problem even worse for so many men, then it's discrimination twice over.   If he's not going to sue for his right to use the kiddie pool   Actually some pools have banned fathers with children from kiddie pools in the past but not mothers. I'd hope they get sued too.   I remember seeing the woman behind this "Freedom Programme" about 5 years ago on the BBC. She was completely obnoxious, in denial about male victims of abuse. It wasn't an interview they were doing, just a debate, yet she plugged her stupid business at every opportunity as if it were a cure for cancer. I'll see if I can find a clip.            He was banned for expressing concerns about his son's education. Schools are notoriously anti-male and it's noteworthy that they'd illegally ban him from the school rather than actually address his concerns. His concerns pertained to a child with a particular condition heavily associated with being male too, so that's a third possible level of relevancy.  Hard to tell exactly how much of an men's rights issue it really is without more detail though.   You forgot the link.                        She has already been forced to withdraw two different posters by the ASA. Pretty scandalous that Northumbria police are lying to everyone and using taxpayer money to spread these lies.   I can't link directly to the news article because Reddit doesn't allow Express links.         Good point, but you can still remain anonymous in the offline world to some extent, and it's often a good idea to guard your privacy anyhow.  Posters can be put up at night, PO boxes can be used and pen names or pseudonyms aren't going to casue any issues in most circumstances.  Alternatively, just ensure you are always recording your activities and then your safety will also be much increased.   Baird is a really nasty piece of work, it's great to see so many people working hard to hold her to account and expose her lies and misandry.  it's notoriously hard to get the UK Advertising Standards Authority to make sensible decisions when it comes to men's issues, so to have multiple successes is really impressive indeed.   The issue is to get "out there" more, even if online. For example there's 1,000 other subreddits out there, the majority of which are run by decent people or at least have users who favour genuine gender equality.   I think the point Mike is making is that one can waste an awful lot of time engaging with feminist idiots and the same goes for talking in echo chambers. Ultimately we need to be more focused on achieving more concrete goals and while I don't agree with all of his points there are some incredibly valuable tips there. Online activism is just as relevant as other types, but it's also true that it can at times be pointless - for example if hardly anyone is reading a blog or a post.  Our message and arguments are becoming much more widely understood and accepted online these days, so it's now more important than ever to move into more traditional mediums too.   This is one of the best articles on the J4M B site IMO. I think we all need to spend more time on effective activism and less time being diverted and having the message controlled by feminists.   Non-Guardian link: http://www.9news.com.au/national/2014/12/30/13/38/queensland-woman-arrested-over-end-of-month-murder-and-alleged-murder-of-four-children   Actually men are faster at distances such as you mention (the Channel is "only" 20 miles or so). Women only start to outperform men at ultra long distances, more likes 50 miles plus.  Ultimately there isn't so much difference in swimming ability and the key issue is survival. Women have the advantage here, and it has nothing to do with being able to float. What kills people in the sea (particularly this time of year), is the cold. Women's extra body fat gives them quite a significant advantage. Some communities in Japan have use female divers for exactly this reason.   You seem to assume that all Labour critics are fans of the Tories and vice-versa. While I'd certainty vote for the later over the former, I still regard most of them as idiots, and I'm proud to say I've never voted for either in any election and never intend to do so in the future.  In most policy areas there really isn't much difference between Lab/Lib/Con. While the ideologies can be a little different, they all now tend to have very similar approaches to all the main issues, all favouring their friends in big business, surveillance, censorship, PFI, the EU, mass immigration etc. You write the above as if we'd expect the Tories to have a totally different approach to spending to Labour. If Labour outflanked the Tories with buying votes with unsustainable and unpaid for spending, then it's quite hard politically to oppose such madness. Anyhow, your thinking is the opposite of reality, and we should in fact expect any two (or three) parties that were so similar ins o many areas to have essentially the same/similar (stupid) spending plans.  Put simply, the fact that your opponent is equally as incompetent and stupid as yourself, is not defence for reckless actions, and the Tories certainly aren't really to blame for much as they didn't actually do the damage themselves (merely being guilty to failing to oppose Labour in doing said damage). Furthermore, the Tories wouldn't have quite the same access to the books as Labour, thus might not have quite have appreciated the scale of the problem quite as soon as Labour would be able to.  Your last paragraph is also nonsense. For example there was at least 1 Lib Demo who predicted the crash and called out labour on it. I'm not sure what UKIP's position was but I'm sure they wouldn't have supported much of anything labour did so they probably hold the high ground too or at least don't deserve condemnation. The same probably goes for the Greens, and probably also any old-school genuine Conservatives.   The state they left government finances in does "wreck the country" though. And not just now, but for generations to come. Even the interest we're now paying on all the debts is now enormous and it's not as if we've been left with much to show for it either and despite the recent cuts, they've barely made a dent into the problem.  Furthermore, wrecking the country is also about far more than mere money and economics, and Labour are guilty of wrecking multiple aspects of our society.   Some good points so far, although more suggestions for actual policy ideas or just subtle tweaks would be useful too.  I think a few people slightly misunderstand where J4M B are coming from here. From the look of things, they're not in the business of biting their tongue and glossing over uncomfortable issues. They're certainly getting noticed and the manifesto is quite impressive in its use of sources and academic studies to make a case.  I think the sort of feedback they're looking for more than anything is in relation to actual science/statistics, not to mention people suggesting solutions to issues. Therefore if you do have comments it would be wise to back them up with sources/stats, otherwise I doubt you'll change anything.  J4M B do seem fairly radical in their positions and I don't see any problem with that - for the most part that's entirely necessary at present (for example , the moderate fathers groups achieved almost thing for some 30 years until Father4Jsutice put father's rights on the map). What J4M B do need to ensure is that every single argument they make is  intellectually bomb-proof, every proposal is entirely feasible, and that the document si completely consistent and considers any possible drawbacks of the proposals.   Link to a recording of the actually BBC radio 4 broadcast that debunked this myth: http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00k9p0t  And here's some info on the BBC's website: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/more_or_less/8051629.stm     Daniel Andrews certainly is scaremongering, his stats are a complete fabrication:  https://robertwhiston.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/27/   Daniel Andrews is lying. The BBC have totally debunked his "statistics" about domestic violence being the leading cause of death and injury to women under 45, it's a complete fabrication:  https://robertwhiston.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/27/   Even the BBC have totally debunked that leading cause of death and injury "stat" (though only as a result of them broadcasting it first and people complaining).  https://robertwhiston.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/27/   Yes that "leading cause of death and disability for women in 45" is utter nonsense, probably based on a UN report which was then based on nothing. Furthermore, i don't recall Australia even being mentioned, even in the usual lie, so they've added an extra layer of bullshit on all the existing bullshit!  Even the BBC have debunked it, here's the full info, enjoy: https://robertwhiston.wordpress.com/2011/06/03/27/   No it's fine, as I said Mike needs to link to proof. I'd only have disputed your decision had his post been more water-tight in proving the allegation.   Well he challenged her publicly live on BBC radio, suggesting she retract the lie and I also understand UK libel laws have undergone some reform in the last year so they're not nearly as open to abuse as before.  I suppose the page really have linked to the source that proves it to be a lie, but other than that there's surely no issue in calling someone a liar is it's clearly a factual statement (and particularly they've been informed they're lying yet still continue with said lie).   They're discriminating against male students despite the education system blatantly favouring females for the last 40 years, with the gender education gap in the UK at a record high.  This is just a smaller example of the problem, and Brunel univesity hands out 22,000 to certain female students now!   There's one Reddit account who's sole purpose is to "expose" the fact that I have a concern in men's issues. That's all he does. It's quite flattering really though also concerning that our opponents have that much time on their hands  (and nothing better to do).   welcome to Reddit/mensrights!   It's interesting to read all the different offences she's committed, goes to show just how far feminists have to go to get in trouble at Wikipedia. I suppose at least when people finally had enough they eventually did the right thing.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airline_sex_discrimination_policy_controversy   Note, this doesn't' seem to have been updated for a few years and Virgin recently bowed to pressure and ended their use of the policy. I'm not aware of any other changes though.   Have you prosecuted any false accusers?   Will they be allowing people to choose non ethnic minority drivers too, such as in places like Rotherham?  The recent Muslim rape epidemic of 1,400 children there has led to many customers requesting white drivers, and for good reason too seeing as not only was the taxi industry was directly linked to many of the crimes, but also almost none of the rapists have been arrested and the crimes was largely ignored and covered up by the local politicians and police.   It's actually rather unhealthy for men to keep their legs closed together for too long because the excess heat results in a lowered sperm count. So in other words this iseffectively a feminist campaign to damage male fertility.   it is satire   Goes to show that simply getting a few more male teachers into schools won't solve anything. If it's a misandrist environment then the only male teachers who'll want to work there will be  the very worst kind of male feminists (or clueless idiots who don't' realise hat they're getting into).  The culture of these schools needs to change fundamentally. Would a song with "girl" in the title also be condemned?   Wait, so the MTA are going to run a campaign about this next year? is bad enough to tolerate insane feminist ideas, but to actually join in beyond belief.    I don't think you'd appreciate it if this subreddit was suddenly filled with posts about FGM either.  Would have much of a problem with that and i think you've inadvertently identified the real issue here. If anyone brings up FGM in a discussion about MGM the almost unanimous response is that its completely wrong, a violation of the children's rights, should be illegal and the perpetrators prosecuted to the full extent of the law, just as with MGM.  Now if feminists could actually bring themselves to say the same thing about MGM and if they were to be as inclusive as us, then there wouldn't be so many MGM comments because their sexism and incredible double standards wouldn't have to be challenged. That is the issue at heartt of this problem.   Sorry but that's bullshit. Either it's ok to mutilate kids against their will or it isn't.  Victims of FGM would actually be better protected too if governments made the genital mutilation of children illegal, right now it just gives the impression that the cultures who mutilate girls are being discriminated against and that those who mutilate boys are unfairly privilged and above ethics and the law.   how dare men bring the issue of circumcision into a discussion about circumcision!   They might not realise it, but at least the readers will   Try telling that to the hundreds of millions of of victims of MGM   and it's not as if MGM is used as a punishment and to try to stop boys masturbating...   Still a few sensible and pro-equality comments left uncensored on the second page of the comments of teh Guardian article. Please take the time to upvote them if you're against mutilating children's genitals   No need to start your own group, just put a few posters up instead.   Vandalising property is not a "protest" and it's blatantly obvious that he's a victim of quite severe harassment, again illegal.  I see you're quite anti-Islam, but i don't see religion as relevant here. Any perfectly sane and educated libertarian, Conservative or egalitarian would support the thrust of the article, and that wouldn't mean they didn't oppose some of the deeply unpleasant aspects of Islam and condemn the many problems it causes.   What possible consequences can their be for writing such an article, there's nothing wrong with it? Why would the cops or university have any interest in anything that he wrote when it's all so tame?  The only hateful and intimidating comments in thsi sage were those found on his door, yet you seem 100% fine with them, yet completely against the content of the article. If you want to see him expelled then the only logical punishment for the actual perpetrators of the crime would surely be a long period of imprisonment?   Your post makes no sense. On one hand you argue he has the right to write the article, yet then you contradict yourself in wanting to see him expelled, therefore suggesting he isn't allowed to write it after all.  To make matters even worse, you want the victim expelled instead of the actual perpetrators of the crime! "Arguments" on this thread from U of M almuni such as yourself only go to show how his article hit the nail on the head and was clearly not only justified, but much needed.  It's also worth noting that some comments here look fairly similar to those of the perpetrators of the crimes.   We have university political controversies on here all the time, for example the recent attempts to ban UKIP.  If anything this is more notable, as it's an example of blatant and sexist hatred of half the population by the person running the union.   They usually use "J4M B"   No comments yet and only 3 upvotes? This is a pretty historic document, the first ever political manifesto concerning the human rights of men and boys.  It's early days , so hopefully everyone is still reading through it. Anyway, perhaps we can use this thread to highlight the best parts of the manifesto and point out any errors or omissions.    Who else is even talking about it?  Well no one right now because it's old news that everyone knows about, but it was huge at the time, mainly because of Milliband and Clegg both wearing the t-shirts. I'm no fan of Cameron but his refusal to wear it became a stroke of genius when the Mail broke the story about the workers  pay and conditions.  The didn't make the story up either, they actually invested in the investigation and sent journalists out there to see what was going on. If the journalists are now banned from the country then it looks like they've struck a nerve.   The Daily Mail broke this story, without them this huge controversy wouldn't have seen the light of day. They are effectively the go-to source for anything about this issue.   If it's a shitty article then please don't link to it. You're basically encouraging them and promoting their misandry.   It's not completely fair to blame cops and judges either, they don't operate in a vacuum, and it's those who  create the social and political environment whereby cops and judges thnk they needs too (or can) hand out pussypasses.  We should be most angry with any politicians pushing for unequal treatment and spreading feminist lies about women in prison. And we should be even more angry with feminists/female supremacists who spend their time trying to pressure politicians/police/judges into making imprisonment a male-only phenomenon and ensuring women are exempt from punishment in the justice system.    The average intelligence for both men and women is dead on equal  Studies either show dead on equal or very slightly higher average intelligence for men, though nothing significant.   Also, the degree to which men outnumber women at the high end is slightly greater to that at the low end.   I'd rather the govenment got around to the far more important and far cheaper task of actually fixing the rape definition in English law. In the long term that's going to be worth far more to male victims than simply fundng a handful of services. Furthermore, while some people might object to their governement handing out money to charities, almost no one can oppose them in fixing broken laws so they become fair and sensible.   there's also the issue of the Guardian describing the accuser as a rape victim in their previous reports. I complained to both the BBC and Guardian about their reporting but only the former backed down and corrected all their headlines and reports. Full info here: https://hequal.wordpress.com/2014/11/08/victory-bbc-backs-down-over-dishonest-rape-victim-headline/  Many thanks for sharing this and for the excellent points above, although please try not to link to the guardian if there are alternatives available.   A few years back senator Anne Cools was the keynote speaker at a conference in Ottawa concerned with helping battered husbands. Feminists were in attendance in the audience and severely disrupted the event through shouting and assaulting attendees. There are numerous videos on YouTube of what occurred, here's one of the most viewed: https://youtube.com/watch?v=qodygTkTUYM  	199
 ps your flooring is dope    Nice one man! love the tv in front of the trainer lol. I have a similar setup for those long seshes!   You need to start living my friend    I feel like this is when a large tv becomes useful    Ayy you just read my mind.   I also think its more just to do with all the similar titles lately. Nice setup man!    Alright, fair enough. He's not driving under their bedroom windows at night, I get that.  Just a weird teacher with some questionable social media practices.    At the basic level you are right: don't post shit you don't want others to see. But the issue here is more what an incredible display of unprofessionalism it is to monitor your students online presence unsolicited. And the fact that OP is clearly not aware of how negatively his actions are actually being perceived by anyone whose opinion is actually relevant to the scenario.       Wow nothing personal but I kinda hope you get fired. Sounds like you're not exactly cut out to be teaching kids when you yourself aren't finished being one.  You said you take "pride" in being in the know about your students, when in fact you are just monitoring their presence online without their permission or the official request of anybody. The fact that you admitted to needing to find out "who liked the girls ass photo" already betrays your creepy personal agenda.  Justify it however you want but you teachers who stalk students are the fucking worst.   I initially read it as a female teacher telling the story and still thought it was creepy as fuck. He literally applies the word "stalking" to what he is doing to his students. Nobody asked him to do that shit. At best he's well intentioned but needs to get a life, at worst he gets kicks out of following his students lives and still needs to get his own.   lol nice one! love the shadow being cast by your collectible    fuckin' dopee    Seriously does it go back hundreds of years because of cultural tradition, or did it just start with a couple of furry animators and kind of snowballed from there?  I just find it so strange that bestiality is typically regarded as one of the most taboo forms of pornography, yet humans who dress and act (and in some cases even want to be treated) like cats are noticeably becoming more and more mainstream and acceptable, especially in Japan and amongst Japanese pop-culture enthusiasts. Why is this?     Sometimes when I feel shitty about not going out I remember this is some peoples idea of a public outing and I feel much better.   Yeahhhh   lol ever heard of a bag? you must be one of those dorks with saggy weighted down cargo pants    just described my sleep habits    lol I like how it's barren... Romans don't like snow  edit: nvm I think I see people just the resolution makes it hard to tell    I feel like you haven't actually seen one then    1   2 will always hold a special place in my heart. Still played 3 but didn't love it. Age of Mythology is still the shit too, bust it out a couple times annually for some comp stomp        Club mate! luckyyyy. Can't get that shit at all in Canada.     Triple reddit?    How do you run three monitors off of one laptop? is there any lag?    I feel like shopping will never become 100% online because sometimes there are things you just don't want to wait for. I don't mind buying the odd jacket or whatever online but i'm not going to have a wardrobe shipped to me. If there are people like that out there that is weird..    Here in Edmonton we still have ridiculously over the top malls. Case and point: West Edmonton Mall.    West Edmonton Mall is actually one of the few exceptions with a ton of attractions left. It still has an ice rink, amusement park, water park, arcade, iMax movie theatre, replica ship in the middle of a big flooded atrium that you can book for parties, and multiple mini-putt courses. Plus a hotel, nightclubs, casino, bowling and several sit-down restaurants. The only thing missing is a strip joint. But yeah besides that all our malls are pretty cookie-cutter. H M, VS, Starbucks, etc.   West Edmonton Mall is actually one of the few exceptions with a ton of attractions left. It still has an ice rink, amusement park, waterpark, iMax movies, random boat in the middle of a big atrium that you can book for parties, and multiple mini-putt courses. Plus a hotel, nightclub, casino and several restaurants.   Also idk why but I like chaotic battle stations like this as opposed to clean ones. Clean looks nice but also like they just moved into the room and then took the picture. I like a battlestation that's clearly been lived in and has evolved to fit the space rather than the other way around.    I'd love to have a tv parallel to the bed like that for those lazy mornings...    I gagged    Is the wife is cool with you splitting your time between your marriage bed and a gaming shack?    Do you work at home? What kind of job would you need Rokit 8's for?    My dream is to one day have enough desk space to have a perfect clean triple monitor setup like this....    Those are some odd choices for discreet weapons    I see a controller but no speakers o.o    2 decks is so last decade    So much asian in this pic    Nice setup but it seems pretty spread out for live production   :(    "make you" as in give you away. If someone undercover is "made" it means he's compromised. Poor word choice in hindsight.     Back in the late 2000's almost every phone had terrible interference and sometimes you'd be sitting in class (middle school at the time) and when a text came through the radio interference would make you and the teacher would come take your phone away..   I actually thought it was Felicia Day for a second...   Yo man your wife looks like Felicia Day... lucky guy. *edit...Forgot this was posted in a sub specifically for women, assuming now that OP is in fact Felicia Day lookalike..    Reminds me of "Sorry" a Wurmple I got from OT: Ashes Mom    Sorry if this has already been posted and sorry for the quality of the video (There are newer uploads but the original is the only one with english subtitles - plus the shitty translation adds to the humour imo)  Anyways one of my earliest and best stoner memories is getting high for one of the first times and then stumbling across this video with a friend. Since we were both kinda nerdy we understood most of the references and sound clips, and it just made for an awesome random experience when I was young and new to the herb. Germans and I would get along apparently.       Alright cheers mate!    Oooh yeah, that must have been it. I don't think you can get the primal evolutions in it and I had mine holding the mega stone. Want to try again?   Yeah not working :( says "There is a pokemon that cannot be traded in your party" even though it's not in my party in the first place.   Here lets try again, if it doesn't work i'll just send over whatever. Weird though, I literally just traded it    Weird it's not letting me trade him all of the sudden...    Awesome! Last one I need. Any particular mon you want?   Thanks!    Sounds good   Got it now, thanks for the offer though. :)   yup! Any dex entries you need in return?    No, thank you! :)    K sorry got distracted! Added you though.    kk! Add you in a sec    How do people usually go about doing that? Just let me know when you've caught it on here so we can do the tradeback after I guess.    Sure man    [tradeback] Yeah so i'm just looking for these last few to complete my dex. I've given up on a semi-living dex, just interested in having the little pokeball next to em' now.  LF: ~~Milotic~~, Huntail, ~~Rhyperior~~, ~~Jirchi~~, ~~Glalie~~, ~~Froslass~~  I have all of the OR exclusive legendaries and all of the starters available for dex entries. Thanks for the help! I could never have even got this far without this subreddit.     I don't but if you still do I definitely could. Also I hate to be petty but I accidentally traded you my everstone lol   	64
 I went on a Holy land trip last year and this was the only site after the Sea of Galillee where I really felt the Bible alive. Maybe it was because the Garden Tomb has a tour guide thats Christian. Idk lol but its much easier to imagine that this is where Jesus was buried.    So what do you do when someone you love stops loving you?  My ex and I faced this issue and thankfully we were just boyfriend and girlfriend at the time so no issues with kids etc. But there is a lesson to learn. How do you get your partner to love you again?  At that time, we decided to continue on but we eventually broke up. But if this situation ever happened in a marriage then it would have been a huge issue. So how do you keep on going assuming that you really want to keep on going?  ---    **tl;dr**: how do you keep on going assuming that you really want to keep on going?      Happy palm sunday :)   I imagine this is easier to do between Canada and US   I agree with what you are saying except for the fact that countries like India or China would never have been exposed to Christianity without actualy missionary presence.   Also, dont forget we're supposed to go to the four corners of the earth.    Yupp. I love it! I wish i had started earlier.   Im appalled at the amount of cursing thats going on in this subreddit.   That said as a christian guy that just signed up for krav maga gym. I welcome this with open arms.  The church has def taken away masculinity from man. Everyone just acts sweet. But man of God need to start being man of God!    Out of curiosity, what really drives the success of a missionary?  As in what factors best attribute to the success of a missionary on a mission field?  The quantifier (my guess) would be people converted and/or churches built?  Are there any studies that have been done.  This curiosity emerged because i was wondering if missionaries are more effective in a place they would love to be in (say maldives / bahamas etc) vs a place they would not want to be in (iran).    You should read the book "once an arafat man". It wont convert you but it will give you the perspective of someone that has, plus its a great read.   This!  Yes, god did perform miracles on earth when he was here. However, he also said that we would be able to do even greater things.  And we have! Just think about the heights humans have achieved today. We have created robotic legs and arms (boston scientific), faster transportation, better health overall (just last week polio has been removed from india), and well many more.  The point is that God does still create miracles except now he uses the goodness in man to acheive these things.   I know you're on this subreddit to troll. Needless to say, yes your question has been pondered by many but know that God doesnt necessarily want to change us from our weaknesses but rather uses other means such as the goodness of man or the change of behavior / thoughts to use our weakness as strength for his sake.   Any good flstudio tutorials?  I bought the package few years ago and have no idea what im doing.   My desire would be to create progressive house tracks / edm   Explain!!    Im actually considering a move to cali. Can you elaborate a little more on the elitist atitiude. What exactly did they say to you? Etd   Theres a biryani tour? Lol whens the next flight to India.   I'm a programmer.  That said, i think we are going to have to make it affordable or even free. Sure we could make money out of this but I think we would have alot more indian guys and girls if it was free.    And thats why you're not a CEO jk  But a guy that can make JS in 10 days can also think sharply, create and manage concepts, and drive the companies focus a particular way.   Though that doesnt always workout if people skills arent there.  But if you have some people skills then i think ull be fine.   Its at the Temple Performng Center tomm. However all tickets are sold out.  It might be live tomm though.   Sight And Sound Theaters produces stunning NY style broadway shows that are biblically based. Must see!   Anyone else going to TedX this friday?   Now thats a detailed response! Love it. Thanks   This kind of worries me because this could have Russia create a defacto monetary market, similar to bitcoin (or maybe upsell bitcoin). And basically create a one-world currency eventually leading to the mark of the beast, aka 666. Hmm.   Is there a list of these kinds of emoticons anywhere?   Theres one in philly too. Haha where all the skyscrapers are.   Best sky I saw was in Chichen Itza, Mexico.  Right about the Chichen Itza temple was a naked eye view of the galaxy. First time I saw it. I thought it could only be seen from space. Lol mind blown moment!!  I love star gazing. I live in Philadelphia and its so hard to gaze at stars. I have to drive an hour or more north to see a good collection of stars. Even then nothing compares to Chichen Itza!   Any where in US where you can see the milky way galaxy?    Anyone have any idea why a chunk of the US (i guess mountain zone) is unoccupied unlike rest of the country  Unless of course its because its uninhabitable because there are mountains. Lol.   Capital Kings, or any techno for that matter.  Most techno songs should be just instrumental.   I've worked in asp.net and have worked primarily in java dev for the last few years.   But im looking to get into these two jobs. Probably asp.net mvc more since i used to enjoy asp.net web forms.   This is someone elses site. I just started krav last week. And so far it seems consistent with what I am learning.      zulu?   They should really warn people on arrival about the costa rican departure tax. Lol thankfully i knew.  But a side story, i got pulled over on my way to the airport from manuel antonio. Lol after a lil bribing i was able to go on my way. Which is where the airport tax came in handy. Told the cop i needed to leave for airport and needed money for airport tax. Got away with paying $50. I think he wanted $100. Though people at the airport said i could have gotten away with $20. Lol.    Looking to dev in asp.net mvc or spring mvc. I was wondering if there are any startups looking to have someone on staff that would dev for them using these technologies?  Also, where does one post about a possible startup idea one has and pretty much assesing if its worth it, etc.   As someone who has lived in another nation. Let me say that the problem isnt that NSA tactics alienate us but rather the fact that US Economy is tanking.   In reality most nations do respect USA and people would still love to move here. But our internal politics and disrespect for each other is ruining our image. And the wars that just took place didnt help.  But people will overlook all of that if we can be the positive nation and a wealthy nation that innovates and continues to provide peace as it has. But we will also have to show case it. We will have to show the world that bipartisan government can work. These constant fights between two political parties and the greed in Wall street needs to stop and change so that America can start moving forward again. Currently only the Wealthy are moving forward. The middle class and poor are having a hard time maintaining a job.   Has anyone else tried these and anyone know why they arent available everywhere?  My gym used to have these and then they stopped selling them. But they were great for workouts. Kept me going for 2 hours at a gym. Otherwise I would get very exhausted during workouts.  http://www.melaleuca.com/ProductStore/ProductDetail.aspx?sku=4204   By later he means when PS5 is released.   This is the main reason why tourists must go to Toilets in Mexico. Its called montuzemas revenge lol.  Mainly occurs because their water contains too much extra salts / chemicals to keep the water safe to drink. However our bodies havent adapted to that.   I second this. This would completely not go well in the Indian culture.   Which cruises have Indian food?   I had the same thing happened to me. And I learned a very important lesson. Always!! Buy a road hazard warranty.  I bought 4 tires 2 years ago. 2 of them went flat within the last 3 months. I got them replaced for $18/tire with an extension of the warranty for 3 years. Aka when the tire goes flat in 2 years i will have warranty to get a new tire for only $18 more.  This is through discounttiredirect.com.  Also, u dont have to pay the $18. They can ship the tire for free. Only thing is that u would lose out on the extended warranty.   I thought you meant the show. lol   Where are you coming from?   Thanks! Sermon recorded anywhere?   So the new mobile share value plan looks tempting.  Currently I am paying $181 with taxes for 500 minutes with Rollover iPhone + Unlimited Data + unlimited text iPhone + 3 GB Data + unlimited text Basic Phone ------------ Total = 181 with taxes and a FAN discount of ($18)  Mobile Share Value Plan ----------------------- Since we've had AT T before Feb 2 10 GB Data Plan $100 1 iPhone $15 2 iPhone $15 3 Basic Phone $15 ============= Total $145 + taxes - FAN Discount (23%) Guesstimate totals : $120 (basing that on  ((145(1-.23))*1.08) [(total - discount)*taxes])  Did I get the above correct? (not sure what the exact total would be....)  Now based on that it would seem that I would be saving roughly $60/month or $720/yr.   If the above is true then what are the catches? And is it worth losing the unlimited data plan. Though I usually don't go over 5gb, its still a plan I would love to have to avoid any exuberant data charges down the road.  Please explain in the simplest terms below so that everyone can understand it. Thanks.      Sometimes you can find this on their online webisodes  	45
             Actually in Washington state at least you can fight another person consensually as long as each party agrees that it's consensual, except when there is reasonable suspicion of it being a domestic dispute.  At least, that's how I've had that RCW explained to me.                                             OMG you're the best.  I'm ashamed I didn't recognize that, though   Wait wait am I correctly seeing a tattoo combining the yin-yang/rebel alliance/galactic empire symbols?  That's the second-best thing in this photo.   The worst part is that it's a repost? Or that TIL never *actually* learns?         Oh god bad memories from that movie. The one for Lust was awful.   Let's all calm down, old sport.   I'd believe it. Americans are pretty famous for bandwagoning, y'know. (WWI, anyone?)   Ah no apology, it's confusing regardless of any language barrier.   Uh, no to repealing it or no to keeping it?  Double negatives really suck.   NO MERCY.   "So edgy Dianne Feinstein's trying to ban it."  Ugh, can we just agree to leave gun-nut politics in /r/progun?   Quick! Save yourself and put an /s at the end!!   I'm Spartacus!   Yeah that was unexpected. Maybe he/she's in remission or something?   People aren't stupid, we just need a little tort reform.   Basketball?   top two.   In the minds of most Americans, yes, unfortunately.   *sighhh*...thanks Belgium, you guys did good today.   Yea no kidding. Americans dig an absolute crushing victory, not a tie at the last minute. If anything this will decrease interest in the next match.   IT WAS YOUUUUUUU   GOD FUCKING DAMN IT   Oh my god Oh my god 4 minutes ok we can do this   stop stop stop don't speak too soon damn it!      Remember they need to get approved by congress. That shit ain't easy, Supreme Court justices are always gonna be moderate unless one party controls the government, which is unlikely given the redistricting. And even if the democrats somehow gain control of both houses miraculously, when do they really ever have their ducks in a row to confirm a real progressive justice? The coalition is too broad for that.   How many times do I have to do that? For gods sake, I've already deleted my account once to start fresh and customize my subs. The small, nice subreddits I find keep getting bigger and already I'm seeing some of them decrease in quality.  I wish I could just *enjoy* it. I don't mind a little work finding new subreddits, but it seems to be an endless cycle. Too much work.  *good example of this:* ELI5, ELIAMA, which both used to be pristine, awesome places. Now they're used as soapboxes for neckbeards and armchair revolutionaries, as well as racists (recall the recent "ELI5 Why gypsies suck" thread).   No.  Zinn's one (slightly crackpot) side to a multifaceted story. The senate was an unelected body meant to provide (in theory, mind you) a bulwark against an overreaching federal government and semi-autonomous regional governments.   Of course the framers were concerned about tyranny of the majority, as they should be, but the senate was not designed *only* to be a check on majority rule, and I disagree with his idea that "the framers" acted as one body that was exclusively interested in protecting their interests, and that that's the primary role they saw for the government. The framers were not a unanimous bloc, they had a lot of ideas for the roles of government, and they all disagreed about many of them. You can't make such blanket statements, things are more nuanced than that.  I can't stand people running around waving *People's History of the United States* and spouting these things as if they're the only way to look at it.   /r/polandball!   oh. I get it. That's really bad, man.   /r/ladybonersgonecuddly for not just double, but *triple* the karma   ^^and ^^compliments, ^^cutie ^^;)      DAE reddit funnier than 9gag? We're so much FUCKING FUNNIER AND DON'T YOU DARE DISAGREE WITH ME.  [L]edit: thanks for the gold :)  	53
 So does the supercharger double the money that's supposed to come out then?   Each time I money shift in my car, no money comes out but instead my car turns off and there's a lot of smoke. Am I doing something wrong? My mechanic says I've "blown the engine" but no money comes blowing out like it should.   While my problems are much less significant, I had to put a splash shield on a Sentra, which should take .2 hours, and it took me a solid 2 hours because aftermarket splash shields just don't fit no matter what you do.   I've always wanted to be an endurance racer, maaaaaaasive upgrade    We've been through a lot together and it's the least I could do.   I'm hungry like the wolf for specs right now   I see what you did there  Edit: Words   For some reason, this one really hit me in the feels. You know what they say, a dog is a man's best friend.   240z long noses are absolutely stunning, almost like a mini E-Type   I couldn't agree more, I gotta find some time to actually get a decent picture of my 944 to post on here.   Haha, every now and then Hoobastank plays on my local Alt/Rock station, but either way, absolutely gorgeous RX7. I love the idea of a sleeper RX7, even though the RX7 is already fast as it is.       I don't wave, I flip the lights in my 944 and I don't get anything back sadly.   Well yeah know that, but I'm talking about with paper work or stuff like that, I don't know the slightest thing about importing cars.   Did you buy yours new? I'm just wondering how you can legally get a Noble into the USA. I see them on eBay all of the time, and if I wasn't a broke high school student I'd love to buy one hahaha. I really want to import an R32 Skyline GTS once I'm older, but I'm scared that I may screw something up and have it get impounded.    Congrats, I can see why you won the award. The M12 and M400 are such sexy cars.    Wow... I really can't believe I didn't think of that, then again, that's what this subreddit is for, thanks!   Okay, thank you very much. Looks like I'll have to run out to the store for next time.    I'm not exactly sure if this is the correct place to post this, but it's nearly impossible to take the rims off without chipping the clear coat and paint off of them. It has the early offset phone dials, so the lugs are set pretty far back. I use a 19mm deep impact, and no matter how careful I am, the lugs spin really loose and bounce around everywhere taking clear and paint off. Is there anything else I can do to prevent it? It's a track car, so I regularly take the wheels off, so the rims are starting to look pretty gaudy now.    How could you hate it? I think it's amazing.   I bought a manual for my 944 on eBay for $10 (I think) and it's on a CD. You can rip it as many times as you want to all of your electronic devices which is handy. Especially I'd you have a smart phone that can read PDF files so you can always have your manual on the go in your pocket. I couldn't find an online manual for the 944, but I have no clue if there is an online one for the 924. Anyways, congrats on the purchase, hope you enjoy it!   Gotta agree, Lime Rock Parks has some pretty damn good food on the infield. My friends step dad races at the vintage festival, and we always go down, grab some food then watch the races on top of their trailer. And since the restaurant is on the infield, you get to see all of the cars drive by in between races.   Massachusetts   No, that was the Burma special.   I learned my lesson. I have an 1986 944 and it's absolutely fantastic, and the way it feels is just unexplainable. But that being said, like everyone else is saying, maintenance is a chore due to high prices of parts. And not to mention, timing belts... I did plan on buying a mk3 supra before I stumbled across the 944. They're cheap where I live, and parts are abundant.    I know I'm late to the party, but I don't like miatas. They're completely overrated. I'm not saying that they're a bad car by any means, but they're just over hyped. I'll show myself out now...   Aww hell yeah, I've been growing up with Oldsmobiles all my life. My dad still has his first car from high school, which is a 71 Cutlass. My goal is to keep my 1994 Cutlass for as long as possible. I've always loved that body style, with the narrow quad bucket headlights.    Most of it is done. Exterior is basically done, it was in really rough shape when we bought it. The kid we bought it off of had high hopes of restoring it but just couldn't find money for it, so we pulled it out of his yard after it had been sitting for 10 years. All of the exterior was a home base bodge job so it was really rough. And since it was a New England car, every square inch on the quarters, doors, and fenders were completely rotted out. The interior isn't too bad yet we haven't started on it yet. It's all there but a lot of the plastics are faded so they need to be painted. But we really lucked out with the purchase because honestly the car could have been on its way out. Considering how rare they were, we just couldn't pass it up. Luckily since my dad only buys Oldsmobiles we had most of the parts already just from hoarding them.   Gotta ask, is it a legit 442? My dad and I are restoring an 83 Hurst/Olds right now, G Bodies are getting harder and harder to come by now, glad to see at least someone else appreciates them on this subreddit.   I have an 86 944 that WAS guards red but then Maaco got a hold of it and did a rather poor paint job on it so all the clear peeled and then turned to guards pink, I would definitely like to repaint it myself as a project this winter.   Looks awesome! How does your posture feel while racing? The problem I had when I built my rig is that I just kinda threw it together, so it's not the most comfortable thing in the world.   I'm guessing that they're probably revisiting a challenge.  	32
    Here on the westside of Cleveland we have been in this wet weather loop for some days.  So the ground is saturated and where I live close to the edge of Lake Erie our storm sewers backed up and flooded our basement about 7:30 PM last night.  My son was temporarily residing down there and a lot of his belongings are lost.  Quick action saved it from being worse; but it's been stressful as I dealt with work, my son, the disaster clean up folks, the insurance company and the SO.  The pice de rsistance was when I jumped into the ice-cold shower at 5 AM because the flood knocked out the water heater.  I was able to successfully re-light the water heater before I went to SBUX to hang with the dude.   So somewhat stressful day, but all in all it has worked out so far.  It worked out and I even got a bike ride in, met with some people on a work matter, and hung out on some on Reddit.  Compare and contrast with 6 years ago.  I would have absolutely exploded at the situation, resentfully responded to my poor family and probably sulked in my room sneak drinking.  Yikes.    I am so glad I did not drink TODAY.   Welcome /u/TZ840 to /r/stopdrinking -- yeah, I wouldn't worry about telling anybody for awhile unless it's smart because you want to keep booze out of the residence, e.g. the GF drinks.  So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I hope something there will help you with "next steps."  Good luck and welcome aboard the lifeboat.   Congratulations, my friend on showing us that it can be done.  An invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow in your inbox.       Good work, keep doing what you're doing.   Welcome /u/sarmst12 to r/stopdrinking.  When I stopped drinking I was fortunate enough to run into a friend of mine at an AA meeting and he sketched out the [some of the ideas that became the Baby Steps post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which gave me sufficient directions that enabled me to stop drinking and to get sober.  Now, I have shared them with you.  Good luck.               B-e-n-g-h-a-z-i      That was the EXACT title *at the time* I linked it.  I don't alter titles.   Smash-mouth politics has arrived.      We all know what that was about!           Or the taxing authorities looking for a way to tap small winnings.   Regularly someone will post about this experience, and periodically I like to suggest a [glance at this post from the FAQ where I describe my email exchange with dream researchers](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/) and what I learned about drinking dreams.   Congratulations, I just added you to r/dinos, sorry I missed you previously.   Torture reduces us to the level of primates; lower, maybe.   Everything about this announcement screams WWE.   You won't have Bush-Rubio since they are both from Florida.  VP has to come from another state.  I actually think Kasich is a VP candidate only.                    Highly technical information, then?    The whole [Magna Carta](http://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/magna-carta-english-translation) argument is not very useful since it also has fairly obnoxious things to say about Jews and interest rates; and some pretty bizarre things to say about fishing in the Thames.   Yeah, it's a total bummer.  I got up this morning to take a shower--ice cold water.  The basement flood extinguished the water heater.  A quick cold shower and I was able to re-light the water heater for the SO's shower so I got that going for me.  I meet the disaster clean-up people at 9 AM.        Great news!  Keep doing what you're doing.                        I'm curious, why? The knighthood?   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; even if my basement flooded over night.  Oh noooooooo...   Great link. Thanks!   My agnostic AA meeting and our brief AA readings are highly supportive of belief and non-belief.  We do not bash religious belief.  Also, having said that there is one character who goes off (like the guy you called) while most of us just roll our eyes.  In my experience of having been the secretary and chair of many AA meetings over the years and  bearing in mind that usually the secretary is deemed by the membership to be the "sickest" person-- leadership do NOT govern meetings, they are there to serve.    BTW, here's an AA [position paper to professionals on our many paths.](http://www.aa.org/newsletters/en_US/f-13_winter09.pdf)  Edits:  Yikes, I'm still not sure the above makes any damn sense, once again confirming that I should not try to comment before my first cup of coffee in the morning.   Welcome /u/purplepurple77 to /r/stopdrinking -- at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) The post describes what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I'm pretty sure that it's a pretty good place to start the process of stopping.  Let me know.  And good luck to you.   [My **Saturday Share** is at this link. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/25u6cc/saturday_share_im_train_subject1576_and_i_am_an_alcoholic/)  By the way, I doubt that I will ever drink again; but even now I haven't "quit drinking," instead I make a renewable decision every morning that I am not going to drink TODAY.  In other words, I stopped drinking one day at a time.  That works pretty well for me.  It works much better than all those sober years ago when I told myself that I had permanently "quit drinking."   BTW, there is no SD limit on how many posts or comments you can make a  day ; )   Good job, /u/Shawder11 -- progress, not perfection, but you did that perfectly.     Congratulations my friend, an invite to join us in the Dino-den will follow shortly in your inbox!   My friend /u/1literCC -- this gets increasingly astonishing.  I am so proud of you.  Whenever you hear that little voice, refer to this post.  113.86 gallons of alcohol not processed by your stomach, kidneys, liver, pancreas, bowel, bladder, and most importantly your brain.  Welcome back to life.   I'm not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad--in solidarity with you.   Thanks, I'll delete.       I totally resembled that thinking process; until I stopped drinking and until I learned that sustained time stopped changed all of that into a process that looks something like this (sorry no pie graft):  Get up!  Make a decision not to drink TODAY.  Memorialize the decision by logging into the morning Check-in.  Do the simple things on my list for the day: coffee with friends read the New York Times; work, household chores, personal errands, recovery meetings;  improve my life.  Go to bed SOBER.  Repeat.    The result is that my life when from ruination of health, wealth and reputation to a mainly happy, free and valued SOBER life.    Even now, writing this, part of me is ashamed and embarrassed that I would pray, but hey, it works for me.  Please, don't ever be embarrassed by this.  I am astounded by your courage in posting this.  I am positive there are many, many SDers who feel the same way you do and don't have the courage to admit it on the Sub.  Listen, my friend, many times I've been asked about my morning ritual and while it is true that I am a real agnostic and sometimes atheist--my re-written 3rd Step prayer is what I slide out of my bed and say every morning.  It works for me.  And before I go to bed at night I repeat it in gratitude for my sober day.   Here's where I was at 25 days in recovery: my wife was having an affair with her then (sociopath law partner); my daughter who was a high-school senior was newly pregnant; my son was trying out his gay-period as a high-school sophomore; and I would be going to federal prison for tax evasion.  In short we were living the whole dysfunctional American dream.   Flash forward nearly 6 years: my wife and I fully reconciled (yeah, 27 year marriages are complex); my legal troubles are behind me (Orange is the New Black is my new fav Netflix series); my 41/2 year old grandson Riley is the light of my life; and, my son is knocking down theater awards including a rave review in today's paper for his "hilarious" performance as the Nazi playwright in the Producers.    I'm sure what I'm saying is obvious: don't drink and life is one hell of an interesting adventure.  Even my feelings of betrayal and my broken heart healed with time.  Good luck to you.   Well if that's the binary, it's a no-brainer.  I'd trust HRC with IT, and not trust Rubio with making nominations to lifetime federal judge-ships, especially the Supreme Court.   Racheal Dolezal followed this advice and see how well it worked out for her?    True story: many years ago I had a client who was killed after being crushed by a casting at a steel factory when an overloaded crane collapsed.  Should have been a no-brainer workers' compensation death claim but on autopsy the pathology report noted 12 nanograms of THC.  The claim was disallowed because--my man was presumptively high.  I hired the leading expert in that era on the subject of THC intox who testified that he and other scientists tried to arrive at a scale of THC intox based on the blood-alcohol model and had utterly failed.  He indicated that there is no means of objectively measuring impairment from THC based on presence in the bloodstream.  I won my case.  Frankly, this should not have been an issue since my deceased worker was not involved in any operational respect as it related to the casting or crane that killed him, but why let a little logic get involved in depriving a widow of death benefits.             Welcome /u/SuckMyKaHawk to r/stopdrinking.  I hope you feel free to fall right in.  Check out the daily check-in post.  Oh, and here's the [link to the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck.            Or your tie knot.     Yep               I've been to lots of AA meetings over almost 30 years; and, I've been to a few crazy meetings, too.  Usually, I need to stay attuned to "the winners."   There are always two types of examples in recovery: good examples and bad example, but even the bad examples can be good examples if you know how to unpack the meaning.  ; )         Imagine if the media covered alcoholism for the public health crisis that it is--it would make the horror over Aids and Ebola pale in comparison.  Thanks for the link!    I can't help but think that AA is doing me more harm than good, I do suffer from depression and AA seems to amplify that due to some of the self defeating and negative attitudes that go on in the room. I feel like I need self empowerment not self depreciation which I feel like is what some AA members preach.  I've never been to a meeting like this, let alone several meetings so that I felt that a pattern was emerging.  I have been in dark or depressed places where I had the reverse of rose-colored glasses on; and, I processed what I saw and what I heard in a way that lead me to believe as you seem to believe and which you ascribe as an AA message.    But by all means, try a SMART recovery meeting!  I give you a lot of credit for persisting in seeking help.  Good luck.

Also check out the Morning Check-in; it's how a lot of us ritually memorialize our decision not to drink TODAY.     So as outrageous and racist as this is--how is this not Free Speech?                     Yes, I did the [the Baby Steps, at this link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) The Baby Steps are the things I did and do to stop drinking and to get sober.  Good luck.  I hope you get traction and join us on the SOBER journey.   I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; in soggy Cleveland I still believe: Go CAVS!   If you're not feeling well please call a doctor.  Otherwise hang in there, personally I have been there.   Welcome out of lurk, /u/runinjagal. Please keep posting as you go along.   I did the things I describe [at this link to a post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  I still do these things TODAY.     We talk about this, but probably not enough.  I honestly can't think of a time in my drinking where I was happy with only one or two drinks or beers.  In fact given the choice during most of my drinking career between one drink or beer and not drinking at all--I'd usually not drink at all.  A single drink or two would simply set off cravings, make me uncomfortable, and make me more likely to flee a social situation to "feed my disease."  Personally a funny fact: I met my wife the night I was sitting at an upscale bar doing the crossword puzzle and drinking a diet coke.  I was "pacing" for that evening's drinking; it was far too early in the evening to do the kind of drinking I would end up doing that night.     That is totally on topic as evident from the responses.  Income inequality it the animating issue of both the Clinton and the Sanders candidacies.    I can say in hindsight, jumping into AA meetings helped me enormously with all of that.  Again, just my personal experience.    The political argument is about income inequality.  Of course, your comment is one of the arguments being made.               P-e-r-f-e-c-t!   Well-done /u/mac_question it sounds to me like you're in the right place.  Let me share the [Baby Steps post with you](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is a description of what I did to stop drinking and get sober.  Maybe some of the ideas there will be helpful to you too.  Good luck.      Congratulations, my friend!    Right now I am just thinking "I will never drink again." but then questioning that, because I've said that so many times.  If I were thinking that way I'd be lost too.  But I don't think that way at all.  In fact despite 2000+ days of continuous sobriety I still do it one day at a time.  At this [link to a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) I explain exactly what I did.  Good luck on finding yourself.  If you stay on this sub, I'll bet you anything that you will begin to find yourself.      Unbelievably smoking hot in [Anatomy of a Muderer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052561/) possibly the greatest but least known lawyer-courtroom film.

REO Speedwagon and fans frozen in time circa 1978; but, sagely singing:  So if you're tired of the  Same old story  Turn some pages  I'll be here when you are ready  To roll with the changes    Good for you; hang tough.  It's worth it.    Listen, if this were easy there would be no alcoholism.  Heavy or abusive drinkers would stop or moderate--end of story.  Instead we lose hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide directly to this disease.  If ebola did this to our populations we would be in a worldwide medical emergency and we'd recognize the seriousness of what we are grappling with in terms of a health crisis.  Here's what I can say from my personal experience: active alcoholism was killing me; and, sobriety is a beautiful alternative ALTHOUGH in the early days of sobriety it often doesn't feel that way.  It took time for my body and brain to recover and worse I continued to believe that I was missing out on the party.  That latter piece of the puzzle is particularly dark--because that message is my old alkie thinking in the throes of trying to send me back into my disorder.  My answer: don't drink TODAY and trust the experience of others that its well worth the struggle because it is.   As a long time AA, I would encourage you to definitely make the effort to get to one of those agnostic/atheist meetings.  Perhaps you will find the person you think will be an ideal sponsor at one of those meetings.  In the interim I would for sure use the phone numbers and ask the same question you ask in this post to your friends.  Finally, pro-tip--when you connect with a running crowd of like-believers or non-believers you may well find a set of meetings that closely align with your belief or non-belief that are not advertised as agnostic/atheist meetings.  And, as you go along feel free to ask for help among your friends to start an agnostic/atheist meeting.    I quit smoking cigarettes 23 years ago using willpower.  I lost 60 pounds using will power.  I trained and ran a marathon using will power.  But I could not recover from alcoholism through willpower.  I needed a power outside of myself.  I found that power outside myself in the fellowship of other people in recovery.  I accessed information about my underlying problems; I received explicit directions to address my issues connected with recovery; I was supported in success and failure; despairing I had phone numbers to call; I found positive social activities that did not involve my former drinking milieu; I found a road map through the chaos of my pass; I discovered a way to objectively check my condition and progress; and, I found a purpose for my life.  None of these things were available to me via my self-will or willpower.  These directions came from outside.     Big lie.   Perhaps you misunderstand my comment on what I call the 4 goals or purpose of recovery (actually paraphrasing The Natural History of Alcoholism, at p. 365 Vaillant, Harvard University Press 1995).  Officially, AA does not have 4 goals.   In fact AA's official "primary purpose" is stated succinctly in the "Preamble" which is to stay sober and help other alcoholics.                    After I make my morning decision that I am not going to drink TODAY, alcohol is not in my movie.  This idea, this belief, this personal reality means other people's drinking has NOTHING to do with me.     In my experience true RECOVERY was not possible without help from outside myself.   ...or you create your own agnostic meeting and discover how quickly you attract fellow agnostic participants.        I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping Sunday SOBER all day, here in Cleveland!   What I'd try to do is remember that alcoholism is a well-recognized medical disease and TRY to treat my in-law with compassion.  More than even that I would remember that as an active alcoholic in the immediate past I personally was no prize to my wife and children.  Out of respect for my immediate family, I would practice love and tolerance of my troubled in-law during his brief stay.    Most importantly for myself, I would continue to make the daily decision not to drink TODAY, doggedly persist, and above all remember that it is One Day at a Time.  Best of luck with this tough situation.    alcoholism is a disease of the spirit.  This is so true.  Well said, my friend.         How dare you tell us what's moral or not moral!  Who do you think you are?!!         Two things:   1. I posted this in /r/law and /r/badlawyer yesterday;   2. /r/politics deletes many of my links for myriad stupid reasons including my link to an article this morning where Scott Walker was called a liar by the British Prime Minister over false claims Walker made about President Obama.  "Off-topic."  A link to the endorsement of Rick Perry by the American Sniper widow was deleted as off-topic.  It's gotten to a point where most mods no longer bother to respond to my objections or inquiries.  The deletions are indefensible under their own rules.   In the US, our Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 better known as HIPAA is similarly implicated, but the right to recover for a breach of confidentiality would not survive the decedent.  It's interesting, I'm dealing with a family of a gentleman who died of lung cancer and the Cleveland Clinic is making access to the decedent's medical records nearly impossible even for the surviving widow, again because of HIPAA.     I honestly believe that those of us who KNOW for ourselves that we are alcoholic and that we should get help--have already taken the first 3 steps the day we walk through the doors of our first AA meeting.  I think that it's useful, though, to get a sponsor and "work through" every step with the sponsor even 1-3 at a pace most comfortable for you and the sponsor.  The "clean up steps" 4-9 are best addressed systematically over the course of the first and possibly second years.  I posted earlier in the week about a difficult financial amends with the IRS that I'm working on and I'm just a couple of months shy of 6 years if that gives you any idea of how these can take time.  Finally, all this work is about creating a blueprint for living your authentic life and helping others.  So 10, 11, and 12 are all about that aspect of your new life.      The issue with human remains is fairly settled in most states (and to be clear, state not federal law governs this question).  The human corpse and its attendant organs are supposed to be the PROPERTY of the decedent's estate and thus belong to the executor or next of kin.  But the disposition of the body otherwise--i.e. the pathology, tissue donation, or errors in switching corpses have not successfully given rise to lawsuits.    Frankly, I'm the OP of this link and an attorney and I mostly find the story interesting from the standpoint that nearly every aspect of "personhood" creates rights and remedies and this slightly ghoulish example was a colorful but not terribly important situation except to illustrate that outrage does not mean actionable lawsuit.    I an so sick of the GOP claiming they are the ones who represent Vets   As a US Army veteran of the Viet Nam era, I totally agree.   A couple of years ago I got into this discussion using the lifeboat metaphor.  For me, if I were drowning and I was thrown a lifeline about to be pulled aboard a lifeboat I KNOW I wouldn't question the belief system of my rescuers, but that's what we alcoholics seem to do  reflexively.  Of course, AA language has ingrained references to God and prayer--but the real solution in AA is built on 4 simple ideas:  1. Give the alcoholic a substitute for the dependence on booze;  2. Remind the alcoholic RITUALLY that even one drink will lead to pain and relapse;  3. Repair the social and medical damage that was done;  4. Restore self-esteem.  That is the point and the purpose of the 12 Steps.  AA is the simplest and most accessible model for achieving these 4 simple ideas IN MY EXPERIENCE.  BTW, I believe SMART Recovery and Rational Recovery are designed to do the same 4 things.                   Get a shop vac!   I was at my home group Thursday night and after listening to the prayers and mentions of God, I made sure I said--if your new here (we always have new people at this meeting) you do not need to believe in God, or a higher power, or prayer.  You are welcome here.  No one will look down on you over your belief or non-belief.    I hope that you will remember to do likewise when you feel strong enough and included-enough in your meetings to make sure the newcomers hear that message--the message of inclusion.  The only requirement for membership in AA is a desire to stop drinking and I'm personally glad you are giving it a shot.  Now having said all that -- I needed to get over myself and the notion that my objections to religious belief were an obstacle to my getting sober when in reality MY ego was my biggest obstacle.  Good luck.   Nice!  sniff  Nice!   Yes!  Social anxiety is a fairly normal part of early recovery.  Can you think of any reasons why apart from your individual psychological make up?  It's actually pretty simple if you think about it.  When we do drugs and alcohol we are intentionally cutting ourselves off from engagement with others.  Often we isolate in order to do whatever our drug or drugs of choice are--undisturbed by family, friends or acquaintances.  Now that we're sober we do the whole social thing without the aid of chemicals--it's like learning how to ride a bicycle in public without training wheels.  But guess what?  Training wheels are available at the closest AA meeting.  It's how I successfully reintegrated.  Don't be afraid to speak up--we want you to open your mouth and tell us your experience!  Someone in the room may need to hear what you have to say.   Welcome /u/Germain_Goldchain to r/stopdrinking.  You may already have come across [this link to the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  These are the simple next steps to start stopping for many of us.  Good luck to you.   Welcome /u/wannabechefjojo to r/stopdrinking--so [at this link is the post known on the sub as the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out simple "next actions" we can take to stop drinking and to get sober.  I did these things and the Baby Steps are a daily part of my life.  Best of luck to you.   I did AA.  I met a bunch of lunatics that I began hanging with.  We did  golf, softball, bowling, meals, dating, and everything I thought I was doing when I drank.     Heck, /u/fear2111 -- I thought you were going to ask a hard one!  So at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which describes in detail how I stopped drinking and how I got sober.  Now let me be specific about getting away from beer.  When I make my conscious daily decision not to drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad, alcohol is out of my movie for the day, all day. This includes beer.  But let's go one baby step further--I need new friends, new situations and new activities BECAUSE I need to extinguish the old reinforcers--my beered-up buddies, bar rooms, and drinking activities.  For me this mean recovery, and AA was the easiest, most accessible route to recovery.  In doing this I needed to get rid of my preconceptions about what this might involve and dive in.  I did and it worked for me.   [Source.](http://www.aaagnostics.org/agnostic12steps.html)   I created a stand alone post with the Agnostic 12 Steps.     The Agnostic 12 Steps:  1. We admitted we were powerless over alcoholthat our lives had become unmanageable.  2. Came to believe and to accept that we needed strengths beyond our awareness and resources to restore us to sanity.  3. Made a decision to entrust our will and our lives to the care of the collective wisdom and resources of those who have searched before us.  4. Made a searching and fearless moral inventory of ourselves.  5. Admitted to ourselves without reservation, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.  6. Were ready to accept help in letting go of all our defects of character.  7. With humility and openness sought to eliminate our shortcomings.  8. Made a list of all persons we had harmed, and became willing to make amends to them all.  9. Made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.  10. Continued to take personal inventory and when we were wrong, promptly admitted it.  11. Sought through meditation to improve our spiritual awareness and our understanding of the AA way of life and to discover the power to carry out that way of life.  12. Having had a spiritual awakening as a result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs.   Stunning post, Sam.  You do have way more than booze and drunken conversation--you have a blueprint, a road map for a whole new way of life.     90 degrees yesterday!  Raining cats and dogs this morning and cool.        Or "W."      Here's one of the coolest things about sobriety--you get to discover what is your new normal.    You're very smart to seek as much support at this stage of the journey because **in early sobriety we need to extinguish the old reinforcers of drinking friends, drinking venues, and drinking activities.**  That is why successful recovery is almost always a journey of fellowship.                    Welcome /u/MuiLaV to /r/stopdrinking -- I found it useful not to think of myself "quitting drinking" which implies permanently changing my habits.  Instead I stop drinking TODAY, only, and I can renew this commitment, daily if I choose.  But, let me give you MY broader blueprint: [it is at a separate post called the Baby Steps.](http://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  The Baby Steps are what I did to stop drinking and to get SOBER. Good luck.   I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm doing rainy Saturday in Cleveland SOBER, all day.   This is very insightful for someone at 6 days!  Good for you.    I think it's a pretty common experience in recovery that at some early point--if we are sincere--we find that we have become new people.  We start to live with a new purpose to become who we thought we might be. We become interested in passions and interests that we dreamed we do someday if we could ever get off the bar stool or out of the club.    It's all out there, keep doing what you're doing.   Weekends were never my problem, drinking was.  If I make a daily decision that I am not going to drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad--alcohol is out of my movie for the day, no matter what day it is.  The fellowship of other sober pals is my reinforcement. My commitment to myself and to my sober friends is all that I need. Good luck.   Congratulations, /u/royalobi!  So, this whole getting SOBER thing is working out for you?     	191
 I can't speak for TFA, but it's UK-version Teach First, found that its teachers on average remained in teaching slightly longer than those who had taken a traditional route to teaching (there is a very high rate of teachers quitting on conventional training as well).

After 10 minutes they must close the text book and use their notes to answer some questions. Then I would give some notes I took which are "model notes" so they can see how to write briefly but clearly.   NQT is still regarded as a training year where certain things are expected of you, so the term is used enough to need the acronym   Total number of lego bricks divided by total population      Nice story   Activists have been breaking into anial labs and stealing animals. Politicians seem reluctant to step in, instead moving science policy away from animal research. Researchers had a rally to try and explain to the public the importance of such research.   Pro-Test Italia ran the rally on a shoestring rally, and from what I've spoken to them, received no money from any pharmaceutical or university      This one? http://www.swaebr.org/images/23YearsPoster_lg.jpg   Good story!   Nature also did a brief summary of the rally (and I got name dropped, yay!) http://www.nature.com/news/italian-scientists-fight-back-on-animal-testing-1.13116   Didn't Lord Prof Winston suggest labelling all medicine (in the UK) with "has been tested on animals".   Some context here: http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/06/03/pro-test-italia-stands-up-to-animal-rights-activists/      Orginal Study : doi:10.1038/nm.3181            It's derived from Crowley's paper stating only 0.004% of research has clinical use.   So parents who are more skeptical of modern medicine are also more skeptical of all proper medicine? No surprise.   True. Here's an online version of Crick and Watson: http://www.nature.com/nature/dna50/watsoncrick.pdf   Is there a similar paper that's more recent?   Prof Lovell Badge has done other great debunkings of these sort of statistical myths: http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/01/23/nine-out-of-ten-statistics-are-taken-out-of-context/      Original Paper: http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2813%2900571-0      So people like Andrew Wakefield should be able to make up stats to put in the discussion about the benefits of vaccination? Those falsehoods killed people.         It's another myth that's done its rounds - so definitely right to be skeptical         That is a ridiculous video. It takes footage from what looks to be 30-40 years ago. The video says clinical investigation is "the ONLY valid kind" - how exactly are you going to discover the patterns of disease, or which treatment works without clear large number of very similar patients and control groups (so as to have scientific rigour).  "Any disease which is provoked is unlike any disease which arrives spontaneously". WHAT?! We have treated many diseases successfully by creating models - that is the principle of biological science.  There are so many factual errors throughout that video   Their claim personalised medicine will replace animal experiments Their claim that animal research is non-predictive Their claim that human and veterinary medicine are unconnected  All pseudoscientific nonsense, and the post deals with most of those points.   The mouse study is interesting. It does show significant failings of mouse models for three conditions. It's a good peer reviewed paper.  Note the paper doesn't suggest to stop using animals, it says we need to improve the models. Read this specific reply to the paper in question: http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/02/15/why-mice-may-succeed-in-research-when-a-single-mouse-falls-short/   teklord - you should visit a lab. They are not like the 70s videos you watch online. They are not tortured, research is always done under anaesthetic unless there is a VERY clear reason why this shouldn't be the case (usually because the procedure itself is milder than the anaesthetic injection, such as a blood draw or a breeding experiment).  And what is a failed experiment? If something doesn't work, you learn something, modify your actions, and try again.  In terms of enslaving humans you should read this: http://speakingofresearch.com/2011/12/06/the-gorgons-visit-earth/      The article you sight shows limitations of some animal models - it also suggests these models are improved not binned. See this article: http://speakingofresearch.com/2013/02/15/why-mice-may-succeed-in-research-when-a-single-mouse-falls-short/   The computer models generally come from the animals. When computer models improve it is because of animal research - so they are unlikely to replace animal models but rather to complement it.  No model is perfect (I am not a perfect biological model for you), but we use a variety of techniques in tandem (including in vitro, computer models, DNA chips, human skin cells, (etc) AND animal models) to get the best results.   Also note that Vioxx passed human clinical trials to show it was safe. Yes it passed animal trials (which were much smaller than the subsequent human trials which is why they were less likely to show the side effect which affected around 1 in 400 patients), but it also passed human trials. It is the exception to the rule where a dangerous drug makes it through all tests (incidentally these would have included in vitro and computer models).   What on earth makes you think most are killed instantly. A mouse might be hit by a stone knocked by a thresher, or might get just its leg hit by the blade. It crawls underground and waits to die - no anaesthetic (mandatory unless special reasons not to in most western labs), no food, no water, no safety   The original papers dealing with aspirin and birth defects rabbits involved huge overdoses of aspirin to rabbits (1). The same is likely to be the same with humans (humans can certainly overdose on aspirin), with some anecdotal evidence (2), but large scale studies would not be ethical.  1) Suwa T, Urano H, Kohno Y, Suzuki A, Amano T.

It's about the relationship between animal-use movements.  In regards to your argument: - No billions of animals are not bought yearly. It is likely to number about 100 million (that's the estimate from animal rights groups).  - I can't talk for research in lesser developed countries, but in the US and EU research can only take place when the researcher can show there was no other method that would work and that the benefit outweighs the cost - so not "pointless experimentation".  - Our genetic differences are far overwhelmed by our genetic similarities. This can be even closer when you look at genetically modified mice which have humanised genes. You should also note that humans are not genetically identical (far from it) yet you would not argue that human tests work.  - Human skin cultures are a brilliant development and are widely used - but cannot tell you about how organs react, or how drugs move through the body, or their mechanisms of action - they are limited and are used alongside animal experiments.

All they say is that 9% use animals from the same litter. They point out this would be better. So 91% could have potential flaws, that doesn't mean 91% of studies are flawed.   Anyone know more about the research on horses?   how so?      The difference being that continuing to use the product of knowledge from the holocaust doesn't perpetuate such research. Continuing to use the benefits of animal research does.

 Be careful!  The linked procedure is quite dangerous to attempt without some education in chemistry and lab safety.   It would make sense for DMT to show cross tolerance with other tryptamine psychedelics, but there are many anecdotal reports suggesting it doesn't.  Also, one of [Rick Strassman's studies on DMT](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8731519) demonstrated that no tolerance to psychedelic effects develops in response to repeated doses of DMT in humans.  It seems that DMT has different tolerance mechanisms from other psychedelics.   You sure about that dose?  Maybe 100mg?  [package insert suggesting 50mg is the low end of a clinical dose](http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/04/briefing/4006b1_06_zoloft-label.pdf)   Probably not.  7 doses just isn't much to build dependence.  If you're concerned, I suppose you could skip a day in the middle just to be certain.   Pinker ignored or misrepresented the interesting points of Gray's piece, which wasn't a critique of Pinker's facts, but of his reasoning and the conclusions drawn from them.   I wouldn't base a decision like this on anything but solid scientific evidence.  Unless this yields a link to a peer reviewed study of long-term ibuprofen use, you should consult a doctor.  You could really hurt yourself.  If you want to take an NSAID in relatively strong doses a few times a week long-term but can't establish safety, you might consider using a natural one with a long history of human use (e.g. [ginger](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20837112), [turmeric](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17569207), or extracts of either).   Salvia divinorum can be grown as a houseplant in most climates.  The most challenging part is obtaining cuttings and getting it established, as it can't be grown from seed.  It isn't legal everywhere, but even where illegal it's unlikely to ever be an issue; it just looks like a nice houseplant from the Salvia genus, of which there are many.  You may be skeptical if your only experience with the plant is from smoking or vaporization.  It has much greater depth and ease when used orally.   What garbage!  This article is just an excuse for advertisement, and is both ill-conceived and misleading.   Who cares?  The individual experience of performing guard labor isn't what this article is about; the implications of having a large part of an economy's labor force dedicated to guard labor are more important.   I'm not advocating for one over the other; it'd be a false dichotomy anyway, as they aren't mutually exclusive by necessity.  My point is that the ideals of science are good for doing science, but aren't necessarily good for all situations and purposes.  There are plenty of situations where something else is better, or where science is not the only useful perspective.  edit:  I am quite troubled by the role of religion in modern society.  It seems to encourage a lot of anti-rational, backwards thinking.   But analytic philosophy isn't based on tangible reality - its based in reason, which is intangible.  It is consistent over time and it can adapt to new information, though.  But it isn't always helpful!  I can imagine many situations that would be greatly worsened by the introduction of analytic philosophy, that could be improved by use of religious ideas.  Take, for example, a religious person with stress induced heart disease.  They believe that God created the universe, and reject evolution and science as hogwash.  They find comfort and relaxation in thinking about God and reading the Bible, and so on.  But they're deeply troubled by challenges to their faith - especially from atheistic disciplines like science and philosophy!  What's most important for this person is that they relax and not stress, as stress will worsen their disease state.  Would that person's situation be better served through rational discourse on science and philosophy?  Or could a religious counselor be of better help?  If the latter would be more helpful, doesn't that contradict your criteria for deciding what is helpful and what isn't?   What makes one helpful, and the other not?   You're too attached to the idea that science is the only valid approach to consider the logical foundations of that idea and their flaws.  Religion, here, is only an example to show errors in your reasoning.  You don't know whether I agree or disagree with you about any particular application of science or religion; I didn't claim that religion is better or worse for anything. I did attempt to show how your logic can go either way (and is therefore questionable).  It's no good for science when it becomes a dogma, a collection of other people's beliefs for you to accept or reject on the basis of ordinary thinking, without critical examination.  Science grew hand in hand with analytic philosophy for good reason - it *requires* rigorous logical examination to remain science.   Ha.  So instead of considering the possibility that your view may not be perfect, you've endorsed first-person, qualitative investigation by children as a form of science?   How do you know?  And...wait, who cares?  You're ignoring the point.  I could just as easily frame it like this:  you can't make spiritual decisions (like how to deal with troubling visions) on the basis of science - whose domain is physical - that would be chaos!  Same logic...the only difference is in which system is assumed to have dominion over the phenomenon in question.   Well, I can't say that I follow your reasoning about health and western thinking and so on.  Examples?  I suppose the easiest examples to make relevant are from religious worldviews.  How about some form of Buddhism?  There are many variations, but it's safe to say that none of them are science and some of them are rational, and some the rational variants have useful implications for people whose subjective experience of life is especially problematic.  Why not frame it in a Buddhist worldview, instead of a scientific one?   I've found the beverage resulting from this method to be quite enjoyable:   * 3 - 6 tbsp powdered kava  * .5 - 1 tbsp soy lecithin  * ~1tbsp cocoa  * ~1tsp (not tbsp) each cinnamon, cardamom  * 12 oz water  I put all this in a blender, blend for 2 minutes, let stand for 2 minutes, and pour into a glass through a sieve (not cloth - just a metal sieve to get any coarse fiber).  I let that settle for a minute and drink.  I take care not to mix it up after the fact, and I don't drink the very end of the glass (which is largely fiber).  It tastes great and is reasonably strong.  I even find it enjoyable when warm.  Can be blended once more for a second round, but the third blending invariably yields nothing but fiber.   ruh roh    The question assumes a conceptual framework itself: one that includes professional mental health advice.  This makes it very challenging to answer without supporting your position.  It's not unlike asking whether I've stopped beating my spouse.  I can't answer that question without implying that I have beaten my spouse.  What about using any of the myriad systems of understanding human experience that aren't based in the last few hundred years of western thinking?  You could look at it so many ways.  Why frame it as mental health at all?   Huh.  When I was at university working towards my BS under a bunch of scientists, they had a different definition of science, and quite different ideas about the history of science and other conceptual frameworks.  Your science = evidence and replication, everything else = guessing dichotomy seems quite limited by comparison.  Too each their own, I guess.   Those are the only possibilities you can conceive of - science, or literally guessing?  So you believe that before ~65 years ago (around the time genuine scientific investigation of mental illness began), all anybody ever did about mental health was to literally guess?   Why?   Haha - where would I even begin?  I'm having a hard time imagining anything worth typing in reply to such brazen naivete, anything that could lead to rational discourse and mutual understanding.  Of course I wouldn't advise anybody to use cider vinegar to treat their schizophrenia.  However - it does seem absurd to me to believe that of all the myriad conceptual frameworks human beings have devised over the last few thousand years, there is only one which can serve as a rational basis for giving people advice.  Science is how we learn and understand things. Without some sort of scientific proof or research, we're just pissing into the wind hoping not to get wet.   Do you really believe this?  If so, how do you decide (for example) what to do in relationships with others?  What would you do if a friend came to you and was very sad?  If you hugged them and said comforting things without first checking Pubmed for a double blind placebo controlled study on alleviating sadness in friends, would that be just pissing into the wind and hoping not to get wet?  And what about all the things you learned growing up about how to form relationships and care for others?  You didn't learn that stuff from science - you learned it by being with people, observing them, trying things out and getting feedback, thinking about it, and talking about it with others.  Is all of that understanding garbage, simply because its not from science?  Or, is it possible that some of that understanding is valuable, and could perhaps serve as a rational basis for giving advice?   Perhaps you have some insight into schizophrenia, and perhaps you don't, but it would be far more productive to make specific critiques of specific statements than to simply bombard your apparent opponent with rhetoric and insults.  Angry ranting from an assumed position of authority is not going to change minds on the internet...   It's rational to doubt a pharmaceutical company's research, but it's irrational to go to the other end of the spectrum and give out advice on things with no scientific basis whatsoever.  Why?  This statement seems to rely on an unspoken assumption that the only rational basis for giving advice (or at least, advice on this topic) is science.   Haha, thanks...but that isn't a source for those claims at all; it's an article in a chiropractic web magazine.  It has inline citations, but no list of references...all it tells us is that someone writing for a chiropractic web magazine believes those are true absorption rates.  edit:  here's a source showing that folic acid supplements are absorbed about the same in tablet or liquid form [pubmed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22579722)   Do you have a source those absorption rates?   You don't chew it like normal gum.  You just crush it once or twice with your teeth (not difficult) and then tuck it between your cheek and teeth to be absorbed.  You could probably use the gum just fine and in my experience the gums are superior to lozenges.  You could even crush it with your hands and then put it in your mouth without chewing at all.  The nice thing about the gum is that you can modulate the rate of nicotine delivery by how much and how often you break it up, which isn't really possible with a hard lozenge.   GODOGDGHRFNEFEOFENIEKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKEKEKEKEKKEKEKEKEKEKEKFUCK   Sadly, I am not. :(  I would love this /r/nootropics if it were a parody of itself where people intentionally distort the limits of human knowledge on substances to suit their apparent desires for ironic comedic effect.  It amazes me how much dislike one can get on science oriented subs for advocating for the position that we know slightly less than some of us seem to believe.  Actual scientists believe very little; "science-oriented" internet posters believe whatever is convenient, often.    So the supplemented dosages of L-theanine used today are comparable to the amount of L-theanine a relatively heavy tea drinker **could** get.  She tried very hard to make it sound certain, but had the good sense not to make a ridiculous claim as L-theanine levels are usually closer to 0 than 50mg.   Really?  The first quote is about the safety profile of L-theanine being equivalent to that of water, which is obviously false although the post above this one implied it was true.  The second is about whether L-theanine has a long history of human use as a significant component of tea, which is unknown.  One thing can be known while another is not...please, if you're going to post, at least *try* to understand what you yourself are saying first.   A cup of tea can have anywhere between 0-50mg of L-theanine. People don't always just drink one cup of tea, they could easily drink several in one sitting. So the supplemented dosages of L-theanine used today are comparable to the amount of L-theanine a relatively heavy tea drinker could get.  Perhaps; as you say, it's unknown.  Heavy tea drinkers *may* consume similar doses of L-theanine to those commonly taken by supplement users, and they may not.  So we don't know whether L-theanine as a component of tea has a long history of human use at these doses.  It certainly doesn't have a long history of human use by itself.  If people are going to worry about things just because they're concentrated and isolated then virtually everything you buy in the store is suspect. That threshold for worry is just way too low for most people.  :/  To be honest, I find that point of view quite naive and irresponsible.  Scientists are constantly examining the safety of various natural product components - often long after they've been released and marketed as health supplements.  Many "natural" supplements have been found to have negative effects at some doses and in some combinations, usually after they've already penetrated the supplement market and been taken by thousands of people.  Perhaps most people can't be bothered to consider the safety of supplements they put in their bodies, but they probably *ought to*.  I use an evidence-based approach to decide what supplements to use and at what doses, because I understand where scientific knowledge comes from and know enough about physiology to have a healthy concern for chemicals with unknown safety profiles.  If you have a basic understanding of how to research supplements and distinguish good evidence from internet garbage, it really doesn't take much effort to learn whether a particular supplement use is likely safe.  Often a minute or two reading on webmd is sufficient.   I'm sorry, I don't think you understood any of my points.  I don't really understand yours, either; you didn't even bother to write intelligible English.  If MisterYouAreSoDumb knew his or her stuff, they would not make such ridiculous statements.  If you object to any specific statement I made, you ought to share your understanding of why I am wrong.  Spending time in car traffic is actually quite dangerous, and a person who drives daily is reasonably likely to suffer health consequences as a result.  But that does nothing to establish the safety of any particular supplement.   Really?  You're equating the history of human use of alcohol, caffeine, and L-theanine?  L-theanine has a long history of human use in low dosage as a component of tea, and an extremely short history of human use in higher doses as an isolated supplement.  Alcohol has a long history of human use across the entire usable dosage range, and a fairly long history of use in the most concentrated forms that are commonly available.  The date of the patent on L-theanine is only tangentially relevant; it does nothing to establish a history of use at specific dosages.  The fact that it's an amino acid does not alone establish safety of any particular daily dose.  ...  Although many things are dangerous at a high enough dose, substances differ markedly in the ratio between an effective dose and a dangerous one.  Low doses of arsenic, lead, mercury, and so on are safe and well tolerated - yet these substances are not equivalent to water in their safety profile, and neither is L-theanine.  Come on.  MisterYouAreSoDumb's post is a compelling argument for **ignoring redditors who dismiss important questions about supplement safety**.  That his post is heavily upvoted, and the only objection yet posted is heavily downvoted strongly suggests that /r/nootropics is a bad place to ask advice about nootropics...   me, with ego death, to sort of analyze my shortcomings and things that I need to improve about myself  Well... no.  *You will actually die when this occurs.*  It's quite literal that way.  People are terrified by this and resist it very effectively, more often than not.  Ego death is not an experience that you can have; it's the end of you, for awhile anyway.  You will cease to arise.  The only parts you could seem to experience are the beginning and end of that death.  It could lead to some personal insight or growth afterwards, as you'll experience the reboot of you.  But there's no need to seek out your own death for personal growth; if you want that, you could just seek that when you trip.   Wakeupwill probably doesn't.  One genus of grasses has several species that contain DMT and related compounds, but I couldn't find any source suggesting that grasses in general contain them.   if the masses haven't dropped gmail and hotmail for more secure providers after snowden, they never will.  Meh.

Yeah, you don't know that either.  You just believe it strongly.  Before Gmail came out, would you have believed that a company would offer free unlimited email storage?  Of course not.  Why believe that you know what will happen next, when these things are so obviously unpredictable?   Very interesting conversation.  Thanks :)     So what if you access nonduality. You still need the subconscious to be purged, for the root of ego to be uprooted, for psychological wholeness to occur. You still need to access the Divine via the Soul. You still need to access what lays just prior to Nondual conscious, and yes, there is something even prior to it.  Haha!  Who could ever access nonduality?  And if there is a need, who needs it?   You should learn to write in clear, straightforward English.  Most of the words in your posts can be cut with no loss in meaning.  Why not celebrate privilege?  Isn't privilege an expression of genetic fitness?  It seems obvious to me that privilege is less a product of genetics and more one of social structures and culture.  But if we suppose that it is a result of genetics, does that lead to the conclusion that it should be celebrated?  I don't see how it could.  Is there something inherently good about having genetics that lead you to dominate others? :/  I just don't see the connection.   Yes, of course Gmail would not implement that themselves; their business model is built on harvesting your private information.  But privacy oriented paid subscription email services have already done this.  I'm saying that complete email privacy through encryption could become a popular subscription service, and that encryption for data transfer from client to server is already ubiquitous.  We may even see peer to peer encrypted email systems arise and become extremely popular.  I see no reason to believe your claim that encryption will always be fringe; it's not fringe now, and more powerful applications of it are becoming *more* mainstream, not less.   [It's pretty bad for your lungs](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25401045).  You might consider eating it or using a vaporizer.   Make sense to me; perhaps there's a justification for direct action against police forces as a means of self defense on the class level, but to murder them seems utterly disproportionate and unnecessary.  Why go from self defense straight to murder?   My point is that if anybody knows the reality of the system, it would be Michael Browns parents and Eric Garners wife.  This makes no sense to me.  If anybody knows the reality of grieving for the sudden, violent death of a loved one, its those folks.  But I see no reason to believe that their views on systematic oppression by the state are any more nuanced than the typical views of working class Americans.  Odds are they are well-programmed drones, utterly ignorant of the realities of class oppression.   So what?  I don't base my views on the opinions of others, in particular - and I don't see any reason to place the family of police brutality victims on a pedestal, nor to view their opinions as a valid means for calibrating my own moral compass.    encryption as we know it today will never be embraced by the general public. it will always be a 'fringe' technology.   I dunno, that seems pretty ignorant imo.  Anybody that uses Gmail uses encryption every time they check their email.  Encryption can be a seamless experience for the end user.  For simple encryption of data in transit implementation is simple.  But services like Gmail could also implement encryption so that the company never possesses cleartext data from their customers, and do so in a way that is seamless for the customer.   yay psilocybin :D   It'd be fairly straightforward to integrate the output of a btc client with financial or other record keeping software.

One of these systems is *better* for microtransactions, though not ideal.   Yeah - I've smoked a ton of weed and had plenty of respiratory complaints when I did.  Most longterm pot smokers I've known had obvious respiratory complications, smoker's coughs, etc. as well.  But I base my beliefs on things like this on scientific evidence - not a casual survey of reddit users.  Again, has a single person on here ever experienced lung irritation from smoking a lot of weed? I seriously doubt it. Do you know anyone who's had that problem? Probably not- that's because it very rarely happens.   Well, that doesn't appear to be true.  In fact, study and study has shown that marijuana smokers have inflammation in their lungs and a substantially increased incidence of respiratory complaints that increases with frequency and severity of use.  Is it the same as in tobacco smokers?  No, probably not.  Is marijuana a wonder-drug that never harms anybody ever because of it's anti-inflammatory excellence?  No, it isn't.  The anti-inflammatory properties of cannabinoids are not sufficient to counteract the pro-inflammatory effects of marijuana smoke.  That fact has been clearly established in the scientific literature and is pretty well documented in the review I linked for you.   No, you didn't; none of those was a review and none of them advocated for the position that marijuana smoking isn't associated with substantial respiratory harm.  Most of what you linked isn't published scientific literature at all.  As I replied to you elsewhere in this thread, the first of your studies explicitly affirms the existing scientific consensus that marijuana smoking causes substantial respiratory harm.  Did you even read the things you linked?  The second is an opinion piece, not published in the scientific literature.  It references one large, long-term human subjects study, which found no cancer link.  It then references the first study you linked above, which actually *affirms* the scientific consensus you're arguing against as mentioned above.  After that they also affirm that consensus, although they frame it in a way that deceptively minimizes the harmful effects.  Then they talk about in vitro THC/cannabinoid cancer studies, which are irrelevant to the fact that marijuana smoking causes respiratory harm independent of carcinogenicity and have no direct relevance.  Finally, they suggest that switching to a vaporizer will lessen the known respiratory harm caused by marijuana smoking - and cite a study on marijuana smokers with lung problems switching to vaporizers.  Of the 20 smokers in that study, 12 improved when they quit smoking, and 8 worsened.  The authors conclude that more research is needed.  After that you link to a google search and a youtube video.  If you want to find out what the science says, look at the science.  Search pubmed.  Find us one study in the actual scientific literature that contradicts the established consensus.  I doubt there is a single one!   :'O   I'm guessing a lot of the replies in this thread are from Americans.  Cops fuck poor and none-white people up constantly here.  All police carry loaded firearms.  It's not like the UK.  I'd probably call the cops too if I were in the situation you described in the UK.  Not here though.   I've seen it used that way as well, but it's just about the worst slogan to express that idea.  It comes across as "all cops are bad people."   Those are fair points, but I feel they aren't relevant to the claim that marijuana smoking produces short and medium term negative effects on respiratory health that are comparable to the short and medium term negative effects that tobacco smoking has on respiratory health.  As the review I linked above helps to show, that particular finding is very well supported by a good number of well designed studies (e.g. good sample size, multiple reproductions finding the same effect, strong control of confounding variables).  What's not so clear is whether there's a lung cancer connection.  There may be; there may not be. Nobody knows yet.   Well, sure...I don't think any of the things you described are problematic, nor that there is any value in calling them "cultural appropriation."  It's more like...a normal process of culture evolving.  I think its very good.   The only thing I take issue with at all, and think it'd be useful to have a word for, is the negligent misrepresentation of things taken from other cultures.   Show me one study that contradicts the finding that marijuana smoking produces short and medium-term harmful effects in the lungs that are comparable to the harmful effects of tobacco smoking.  [The review I linked above](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4226845/), which you replied to, cites about two dozen studies that support this finding.   Uh...are you reading the actual studies?  They contradict some of what you're saying.  From the first study linked:   Prior studies of marijuana smokers have demonstrated consistent evidence of airway mucosal injury and inflammation as well as increased respiratory symptoms such as cough, phlegm production, and wheeze, similar to that seen in tobacco smokers  It seems that the authors of the study you linked believe that marijuana smoking is harmful to the lungs in a way that's comparable to tobacco in the short-medium term.   All that matters is how you relate to it.  I disagree.  There is meaning and value in maintaining an accurate account of what people at different times and places have believed and practiced.  Doing so does not inhibit people from adapting language to suit their purpose.  What I object to is the misrepresentation of a word being used in a novel way as being the same or similar to that word in some particular past meaning.  I see examples of this constantly in Americans who are interested in New Age woo-woo and various foreign religions; they learn a little bit about something, project their own thinking onto it, figure they get it, and proceed to talk about what the Buddha said or whatever.  It's this kind of contagious ignorance - and its accompanying obfuscation of the host culture from which the word was borrowed - that I object to.  I'm suggesting that this sort of thing might reasonably be referred to as cultural appropriation.  Declaring that "Something" means "Only This" is inherently false because your definition of it is only one possible way to perceive it.  But I never said anything like that, and never would.  To impose such an extreme restriction on language would betray a profound ignorance of what language is.   ...  I cited a review paper - it isn't a study at all.  And it makes an excellent case - it references and briefly summarizes several dozen studies, many of which looked at fairly large groups of marijuana smokers and found them to have serious respiratory problems at rates similar to tobacco smokers.  That paper is filled with references to a body of scientific evidence that, taken as a whole, establishes beyond any rational doubt that habitual marijuana smoking has a negative impact on respiratory health that is comparable to that of habitual tobacco smoking.  And it's not as though I cherry-picked it - I could not find another review advocating for the position that marijuana *isn't* associated with substantial respiratory harm, as that position is untenable.  What better case could I make?   Hmm...I think there may be some validity to the concept, though I see what you mean and agree in some sense.  But using the example of dreadlocks... Hopeium framed the example as a person from outside a group adopting a style used by that group for *aesthetics only*.  But what about an outsider adopting the aesthetics, and also claiming to adopt the deeper meaning *while parading their own, bastardized version of that meaning?*  There is something very ignorant about that, which I would object to as well if it were done with something from my culture.  It reminds me of people who dabble in "eastern spirituality."  They may speak at length and with confidence about the nature of reality, using a vocabulary borrowed from a half dozen religions whose cultural context they have no real knowledge of.  It leads to these bizarre misunderstandings about what any particular eastern religion *actually was or is*.  So, I think there is a harmful way to go about adopting things from other cultures, and perhaps some valid use of the term "cultural appropriation."   Well...I see it as a mixed thing, but leaning towards a step forward.  But I agree with most of what you said.  I just value the side effect more, and think it will be very significant.  It seems to me that cannabis has a quality of bringing people into their bodies, their feelings and sensations, and interrupting the grip of mind and understanding.  Not in every person at every moment, but in general I see this trend across the many people I've known who use it.  I think that quality of cannabis could have a very positive balancing effect in our culture.  People these days just don't seem very in tune with their feelings, their bodies, their surroundings.  Our country could benefit a cannabis induced perspective shift.   We might also need an alternate universe, as plenty of research has already been done and it directly contradicts hashmon's post.   [It's unhealthy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4226845/)   This is far off topic but I just have to point out...  [You're wrong](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25401045): there is more than enough scientific evidence to conclude quite firmly that smoking cannabis produces respiratory problems.  Whether it causes lung cancer is still unclear, but it otherwise damages the lungs in approximately the same way as smoking tobacco.  You don't even have to accept the author's analysis linked above; that review offers several citations from well designed studies that assessed the short   medium-term effects of marijuana smoking   tobacco smoking independently and found them to be quite similar.

It's probable that in hindsight, it'd look as though neither of us had a clue.  I wrote what I wrote not because I think X is true and just have to tell everybody; I wrote it because I saw perspectives expressed with a fair degree of certainty that couldn't accommodate what seems like a reasonably likely outcome to me.    You have bigger problems, my friend - problems extracting hydrocodone from Vicodin could never solve.  Seriously though, you've got to put in a little more effort to get good answers out of the internet.  There are at least a dozen recreational drugs that a technique called "cold water extraction" might reasonably be applied to.  edit:  [hey look, I found a solution for you!](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=vicodin+cold+water+extraction)     Eh...I think it'd be worth your time to find a friend with a scale and weigh it, they look well short of an 1/8 if I'm looking at it right.  You'll be better off weighing to split the dose as well; you really can't eyeball that accurately unless you put them through a grinder first.  Also /r/darknetmarkets is a great place to go if your local sources are a bad deal ($40 / eight is a bad deal, you could easily get that for $20).   Yea, but from the context this is almost certainly correct.  Where ng/ml comes up as a measurement of drugs in human beings, it's almost always a volumetric measurement of unfractionated blood.   I dunno...I don't see drugs being a solution to this problem at all.  Only way I could see drugs solving this is if you tried running on a psychedelic or perhaps MDMA and thereby found a way to connect with running in a new way and dissolve boredom.  But you could just as well do that without drugs. :P   Pretty much, yeah.  THC evaporates at a lower temperature.   Ask a friend to do it for you.   You probably won't have much luck unless you get off the antipsychotics first - though there is some variation between them, some block the effects of psychedelic drugs.  Once you've got yourself doing well enough to remove the mind-crippling drugs from the equation, I imagine some psychedelic exploration could be very healing.  Especially if you can find a trusted friend or two to explore with. 3   Well...I resonate with most of what you said.  But on the whole, I don't believe small businesses have an advantage in this shift.  At present, automated robotic systems are used on a massive scale in many industries - and most of this use is by massive corporations, like automobile manufacturers.  These corporations have a great deal of resources devoted to developing and anticipating new technologies that are relevant to labor automation.  They also have scale, which will generally make it *less* expensive to adjust their practices, not more (e.g. they can buy 1000 robowidgets for $18,000 each instead of 10 for $26,000 each; if they incur a loss while switching, they're more likely to have the savings to absorb it).  I agree with everything you said about consumer technology products getting cheaper faster than expected.  But that doesn't address *how most people will receive income*.  Similarly, while economies and careers have gradually shifted over the last few thousand years, there have also been periods of rapid, even sudden change.  There are things about this time period that suggest a sudden change is coming.  It doesn't necessarily have to be a good change, and it doesn't necessarily have to follow any prior pattern.  This makes me think of the people who lived just before the Industrial Revolution, perhaps just after the invention of the steam engine.  Could they have expected what came next?  It seems to me that by your reasoning, they should have figured that things would carry on about as they had for the last few thousand years - perhaps with greater efficiency and scale.  It's unlikely that many people could have imagined the drastic changes to society that would soon come.  We could be in a period just like that, in which the drastic transformation society is about to undergo is strangely beyond our imagination, but will seem obvious and kind of boring to high school history students in a few generations.   This is a good approach.  Asking a friend to mediate sales repeatedly with no compensation isn't any good.  Half the difference is quite generous if your friend can pick up without much hassle.   I find this topic intriguing, and enjoyed the article...but I hate to see an article state so many things as fact that are absolutely not supported by evidence.  I'd love to see it rewritten with inline citations for those claims that have support, and all unsupported claims removed or reworked as potential avenues for future exploration.   Hmm...I dunno about this.  You say that people in general would have more discretionary money, because (I think) the goods they buy are now being produced cheaply without human labor.  But before the reduction in human labor use can lead to cheap goods, a large proportion of the population have to be laid off as their careers cease to exist.  The goods might be cheap, but anybody whose primary revenue stream came from providing that labor is unlikely to have extra discretionary money.  Your second point seems more viable and interesting to me - new automation technology could be inexpensive enough that small businesses or even working class individuals could reasonably acquire it.  Perhaps this will be a revolution for capitalism - a technologically driven decentralization of the means of production.  What if I could buy an adaptive, general-purpose autonomous robot for $1200, that could repair my car, build me a house, maintain a year-round vegetable garden, and run my small business selling unique knick-knacks on ebay for me?  That could be a real game-changer.    Yes - there are actually studies examining this, as many scientists have also noticed the limited generalizability of studies in stressed, isolated animals far removed from their natural environment mainlining coke in high doses.  My strongest takeaway from drug addiction literature was that it's very easy to become hopelessly addicted to opiates, gaba drugs, and stimulants if you use them several times a week or while in a dark period of your life.   German  Also sadism is close, but different.  A sadist enjoys inflicting pain on others; shadenfreude is happiness that comes from learning of others' misery, without necessarily inflicting it oneself.   Those are interesting ideas, but I have a hard time believing that they're a realistic alternative to an economy where human labor is a necessary, substantial component of most major industries' production.  How much income will people have when most peoples' primary revenue stream comes from selling non-essential knick-knacks to other people whose primary revenue stream is also to sell non-essential knick-knacks, while all the worlds' major corporations own massive robot armies that can produce whatever they like (including said knick-knacks)?  At present, artists, musicians, and craftspeople are a vanishingly small part of the economy.  It doesn't seem realistic to believe that this sector of the economy will somehow flourish while almost all necessary human labor is replaced with robots and AI.   I dunno; it has implications for the future, though.  As automated labor (today, AI   robotics) improves, demand for human labor decreases.  Automated labor has been improving for a long time and will continue to.   If they're all underpaying their workers, another land owner could reap the profits by offering them all higher wages.   If this were true without qualification, wages would approach infinity. :P  In fact, it is only true while there is a shortage of labor.  If there is enough labor to meet demand at a fixed low price, then no landowner would have a strong incentive to offer a higher price, and the low price would remain.   I wouldn't, no.  We could debate that, I suppose, but it's not the question at hand; I'm trying to learn whether sexbeast420 has any foundation for their claims about the worst case scenario for primitive accumulation.  I mention the industrial revolution because it has implications for sexbeast420's casual valuations of workers' labor.  Physical labor had relatively more value before the industrial revolution than after, because so much of it was needed to accomplish anything.   Well, I dunno about that.  It seems to me that the vast majority of worker's labor today is worth so little that they couldn't become self sufficient if they lived for 300 years.  The industrial revolution happened between now and the times of widespread subsistence farming being used as examples in this thread.  Physical labor is not worth anything near what it was then.  Do you have any concrete reason to believe that labor would be so valuable under an alternate capitalist system?   No, it can't; wards don't cost 4k gold.  Because wards are cheaper than gem and comparable to sentries, there is a healthy back and forth between wards   true sight in the game.   /r/darknetmarkets   No worker's value is so low that they couldn't even earn any capital,  and once they start earning capital, they'd eventually be able to get some land and begin working for themselves  How is this a certainty?  Couldn't workers' earnings be so low that it would take more than a lifetime to earn enough to become self-sufficient?   Yeah.. if that.  I see this as just another way of looking at things.  If you believe in a universe with things in it that are made up of other things, then yeah, I guess we just move the pieces.  But such beliefs aren't supported by scientific consensus; it's hard to imagine anything that could establish an atomic view of reality as "truth."  Just a point of view.   I don't see much value in psychologists studying spirituality or spiritual phenomena; they simply don't have effective tools to apply to such things.  There are some use cases for psychedelic drugs that could be studied by psychologists (along with scientists from other disciplines, like pharmacology) to great effect.  MAPS's work with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy is, in my view, a great example of effective psychedelic research conducted by psychologists (and others).  That kind of research could be extremely beneficial, because it could lead to widespread adoption of new, effective psychedelic-assisted therapy modalities.  But as far as basic research into the nature of spiritual phenomena - psychology has little to offer.  They can have you take a survey about your experience, or maybe track or eye moments or blood pressure while you meditate, or whatever.  But who cares.  Neurobiologists and cognitive neurscientists may have a great deal to offer to basic research into the nature of these things, though.  Their results could lead to new drug targets, a better understanding of how psychedelics and spontaneously arising spiritual experiences relate, etc. - because they have the tools to actually investigate the mechanisms of experience directly.   Thanks for the reminder.  Some police brutality news is relevant, but there's no need to fill this sub with it.   Haha!  Incorrectly.  I took the area as diameter, like a fool.  Same numbers as hyperben edited in above.      I ~~compared the areas~~ done goofed.  ~~The spawn aoe increases by ~48.6%, and the aoe of an individual explosion increases by ~44%.  I'd call that a negligible difference; the spell should hit just as reliably inside the larger aoe.~~  ~~Another way of looking at it:  in the old version of the spell, each explosion took up ~53% of the spell's aoe.  In the new version, each explosion will take up ~51.6% of the spell's aoe.~~   so you're probably **right**.   Oppression! :O   I believe that I agree: like every other spirituality whatever, it is another belief system.  There is no perfect set of ideas that transcends idea-ness.  Maybe I'll never get there   Get where?  Get what?  If you could get it, wouldn't it be like any other thing - a passing experience?  I want to know what's true, and I want to tune into the source (or whatever you want to call it  It seems to me that knowledge is always a part of the conceptual system, always in some gross or subtle way another object of mind.  An abstraction; an idea.  An observer to interact with it.  But as for tuning in to [the Noun]: it is only an idea, which takes the appearance of something profound while being itself another fleeting appearance of some object of mind.  There is no [Noun] that isn't an object of mind.  Well, there's my belief system in short.  It seems to me that every spiritual person I've ever met that's really engaged with it spends most of their days worshiping metaphors, with varying degrees of subtlety and grace.  Buddhists, yogis, new-agers, and so on; I have met very few who aren't playing some path game, with brief gaps where it falls away.  I only keep a belief system for the purpose of housekeeping; it's a reminder for when I've gone off believing in some ridiculous story told by the shadow of old habits.  Cheers. :)   That said, people have been taking quite large oral doses of b12 for years now, apparently without any substantiated reports of ill effects (I couldn't find any).  Apparently there are known, serious adverse effects from inappropriate or excessive injections of b12.  It wouldn't be surprising to me if some ill effects of excessive oral doses of b12 became apparent soon in certain populations.  There are plenty of multivitamins on the market with a simple %100 DV dose of b12 and other b vitamins for anybody who's concerned about overdoing it.   It's normal for the color of your poop to change with your diet.  If you're concerned, switch back for a day and observe your poop that day and the next to see if it reverts to its former rich chocolate tone.  There's no need to see a doctor just because the color of your poop changed when the color of the food you eat changed.  I wonder whether some folks in this thread know where poop comes from (hint: it's food!).   Water soluble vitamins are not a free pass at massive over-supplementation; there are plenty of documented instances of [negative effects caused by excessive supplementation of water-soluble vitamins](http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA50582/can-too-much-vitamin-B-cause-problems.html) (link gives a few examples).   Agreed.  Nutmeg is an interesting drug, but I see few similarities between it and classical psychedelics like LSD and mushrooms.  I don't believe it has much value as an entheogen.  I feel compelled to add that when I've taken enough nutmeg to induce a powerful experience, the interesting   desirable effects have always been accompanied with intense drymouth, confusion, and histamine-like sedation.   Mmm...I see what you mean, but I object to the language of it.  I see no value in obfuscating the space between wholly political and wholly insurrectionist events with black and white thinking.  Events can have qualities of both.  Your example of ELF attacks makes a strong point, though - there are ways of going about direct action that the media wants nothing to do with, that can't effectively spun.  ELF is effective at harming capital holders who harm the environment, and there's no way for media to spin a story to serve their narrative.  Publicity for ELF is just plain dangerous.  But the riots now aren't just spin material, either; publicity for them has its own danger.  What if they started growing?  What if they continued indefinitely?  Media would want to pretend they didn't exist - but it would be too late.  You can't just pretend all is well and there's nothing to see here a 3500 strong riot is burning down storefronts in Manhattan.  You can when ELF bombs a housing development; it just doesn't effect that many people directly.   How is it even somewhat outside the realm of politics when the base foundation is inherently political?  For the same reasons I said: it has practical effects outside the political realm.  It damages the assets of multinational corporations.  It wears on the human capital of police forces (e.g. by accelerating burnout   encouraging retirement).  It increases the cost of violent oppression by government bodies (e.g. overtime   hazard pay).  You say that the ongoing riots are not wearing down on the system, but I don't see how that can be true.  Is the system vast, deep, strong, and many layered?  Yes.  Are riots destroying it?  No.  Are they visibly taxing parts of its infrastructure?  Absolutely.  These are not political results; they're practical results.  They could be celebrated as small victories by those who want to dismantle the system.  The motivation that led to rioting doesn't define the nature of their results.  I don't claim that this is an insurrection; it obviously isn't.  But I wouldn't be at all surprised if it went down in history as the beginning of one.   I see what you mean, but the continuous, consistently disruptive demonstrations that have occurred over the last few weeks seem like something more than what you describe.  These demos, in particular those that shut down infrastructure and target corporate property, are having a strong effect outside the stage of politics.  This shit costs money.  It costs human capital.  It disrupts the veil of ignorance that our corporate / government overlords perpetually maintain over the eyes of the people.  It forces mistakes on the part of those who enforce oppression.  The continued violence is wearing on the system.  It's not an insurrection, but it could reasonably be characterized as laying the ground for one in a way that goes well beyond politics.   Excellent read - thank you!  :)  	104

Japan was very independent by the 70s, as was the ROC and Pakistan. Pakistan had indeed been ruled by another country, but it wasn't the US, it was Britain, before the Pakistan-India split.   Really do recommend the book though!    21, bi, male. 18-25.    China used to be super poor in the 70s and 80s. Still is, but at least they have a growing middle class thanks to people fleeing the farms and going into the cities, where's it partially easier to make a living, even if thats not saying much. The country is going on a very similar path to Europe and the US after the industrial revolution.   What was the other option? To have China leave it's self closed? To not open trade with the US?

I'm not sure how I feel about this.    I don't think you understand how complicated things were with engaging Taiwan, Japan, and Pakistan when negotiations with China began. There was a boat load of secret back channel talks and lies to the press to keep things under wraps until the timing was right. A lot had to be hidden, including some of Kissinger's visits to Beijing.   The important thing though is that what they did could really only have been done when they did it.   I recommend reading "Nixon and Mao: The Week That Changed the World" by Margaret MacMillan. Really detailed account of all the effort Nixon's team put into creating back channels and using them effectively, and how hard negotiations were with Mao when US forces were still deployed all over Asia.   Your claim was everything unraveled. I just don't see how that's true with China, when they're our second largest trading partner. Doesn't matter how "easy" (it wasn't) or "hard" it was, I'm just saying our relationship is still intact.    Exactly. Nixon and Kissinger worked to exploit the Sino-Soviet split, and to this day, we've maintained relations with China.   Sure, any presidential team could have done it, but they did it at the right time. So your statement isn't exactly factual.    This isn't true. We still have economic and diplomatic relations with China, decades after his departure from office.   And though our relations with Pakistan have deteriorated since the Nixon administration, that's neither Kissinger's or Nixon's fault, but rather the fault of events way outside of their control and time. For a good while, Pakistan was favored over India, a preference that lasted years after Kissinger left his post.     For a lot of older folk, the opening of China is still fresh in their minds, so that's a reason why they might rank him highly. He was extremely skilled in getting US-Sino relations up and running.    This isn't true.

I think anything with less than an hours drive from there should be fine.    I'm a little liberal when it comes to some things, which is a big deal for my state I guess.   Met a girl who lives in that area, and am looking for some first date ideas nearby. The only thing I've found is the dinosaur museum in Price, which seems okay.   Any other suggestions?    1) Your main pic is a little weak, doesn't really show much of you.  2) Your self-summary is really bland and doesn't say anything about you. Insert something about your personality there, but try and be creative with that.  3) Use "I" less when starting sentences.  4) Don't mention being dead tired on a Friday night. What's your *ideal* Friday night? If it's just getting food with friends and playing games afterwards, leave it at that.   So there isn't a guarantee kicking them out isn't a death sentence?    Finding free tour guides of the city.   Because it's free.    I get involved in politics a lot, and attend conferences when I can. So that's one way.    If it's worth it to you, you can on craigslist and pay $50 for a profession photographer to follow you around for an hour or two.    I'm too good or everyone I meet   Also, I seem to be moving a lot   Try at least two or three more message and the ask out. By that time they should view you, and decide for themselves.    Just mention you live a little outside city Y, but city Y is where you like to date/hang   Ask why he didn't stay in the US like Daniel Ellsberg did when Ellsberg started coming out with the "Pentagon Papers", and what kind of difference there would be if he (Snowden) had stayed in the US.    Don't forget ISFLC! It's happening soon, but there's always next year.   Also, YAL State Conferences are the place to be.    The youth thread over at r/@ got me thinking about this. If I have a child who refuses to get vaccinated, what happens? By not getting vaccinated, they run the risk of giving some sort of disease to other children in the community, which no one wants.   Does the community ban them? Do I get authority to vaccinate them? Does it matter how old the child is (2 vs. 10)?   For a greeting? No, that'd be a little weird. Not weird for the end of the date though, if all went well.    How long ago did you send the form? Give it a day or two and try again?   Fine on my end today (2/1).    3 (soon to be 4) dates in...4 weeks? Haven't messaged many girls either. My upcoming 4th date messaged me first, which is nice. Almost had a 5th, but I moved, so that didn't work.  And 2/3 dates I've been on have been really fun.  So I'd say 50%.    I transplanted here from New England, and it's been a wild ride. Absolutely nothing like it. It's a little hard being here in your early 20s (unless you're in school). Every young person I talk to is itching to leave.   I'd want them to be an intellectual. By this, I mean they don't always use simple language to express complex ideas. I want to hear those complex ideas in full, with numbers and big words a lot of people might need to look up the definition of. Their inaugural address should have less applause, and be one giant speech.   With recent SOTUs, for every minute of speech there is 30 seconds of applause. That's not right. (Source: Elvin Lim, "The Anti-Intellectual Presidency).    No issue!  I'm often coming across profiles of girls who don't want you to message them if you have a shirtless pic, so a lot don't seem to like it. It could work if it's not too obvious you're trying to show off (like doing a shirtless mirror pic). Training outside might be okay, if you do it.   I wouldn't say either of those are bad, but I can see why you feel that way.  Just try and closer up photos of you doing things. Kind of like you holding up that sign, but just something more clear so we can see you easier.   I don't think you're bad looking, but I wouldn't say you have great pics. Your main doesn't show you at all, which I'm sure you know. That's a little bit of a problem.   You should add something a little more serious to "What I'm Doing With My Life". Like what are you *actually* doing with your week? Job? School? Etc.  Overall, it's not too bad.   But is she qt?   Packing shit for a move to Utah. I have one shot at the perfect job in SLC, and have to nail everything right to get it.  Plzpray4me   Moving into the danger zone  Yelling obscenities at school children  So far, I've yet to do either of these things. I feel sort of bad for making such a big lie.   Look up your state's grand lodge ("Grand Lodge of New York") and find their website. You do not always have to be Mason to qualify for the scholarship, and many assist the financially needy.   If you find the website, don't be afraid to contact them directly to inquire about what you're looking for. One of the tenets of Freemasonry is to engage in philanthropy, so your state lodge should be more than willing to point you in the right direction. For contact, you should usually look for the email/phone of a secretary.    Whoa, you're right. I've walked by that lodge a few times, and have never heard of anything happening there. Wonder why that is? It's got to be operating, right?    Freemason here. We're a fraternity of dudes hanging out twice a month. We do rituals, walk in parades, eat dinners, and sometimes drink.   People like to pretend we control the world, but not really. This comes from the fact a lot of important people in the past have been Masons, and they may have held important power at one point, but no longer.   As for provisions, there are scholarships, burial funds, widow funds, and that sort of thing. Nothing too fancy.    I got wicked sick and had feelings of strong regret for literally minutes :c  Plz forgive.   1) Add more to your profile pictures that don't show the same angle twice  2) Start your sentence and paragraphs with "I" less  3) Condense your favorites list so it's not so long when scrolling   250-300 miles of my town in Wyoming.   I don't hate it or anything, but I've yet to see anyone answer "normal" to "Would you rather be weird or normal?"   Hey, AmeriCorp, that's pretty cool! I'm currently serving myself and it's pretty dope. Honestly, everything looks pretty good to me. Cute and funny.   1) Get rid of that selfy (pic #4) - not very flattering.   2) You have two pictures showing you play the violin Not terrible, but maybe mix it up a bit?  3) Everything reads pretty generic. I'm not picking up anything super unique about your personality. Try and be a little more creative with some things, like with the "Message me if" section. What you want in a woman just sounds plain. Maybe that is really what you want, but it's not an attention getter.   First, once you plan a regular meeting time, stick to it, no matter what, even if only two people will be there. Keep it consistent so you don't miss newcomers.   Second, collaborate with any other political groups on projects. Your group is going to start out small, so you need to build your network of other active students. Is the Black Student Union holding a rally on prison reform? Great, go ask how you can help. Is the Conservative Party club hosting a debate? See if you can join in.   And third, assuming you're American, if your club runs into any issues with your school censoring you, hit up FIRE (thefire.org), and they'll give you a hand in suing or getting publicity.    I ran a political club at my school - it's hard to keep interest and grow the club. People get busy, stop caring, unless you do cool events.   Do you have any particular interests (drug war, prisons, etc.)? There are groups I can mention that send out free things for college clubs.    I'd invest it to buy my own apartment complex (10-20 tenets), then lease half of the units to full rent paying tenets, and lease the other half to poorer tenets, who's rent is subsidized by the other half. This is actually the model my current housing complex runs off of, and it's pretty neat.    The point is preferences are wrong and everyone should just like everyone! /s   If the first reply is short, I'll build off that. In your example I'd ask about what they did in Japan and ask something else from their profile. If they continue with another short reply, I give up.    Just adding another accepting faith to the mix: A lot of Quakers will incorporate Buddhist/Eastern teachings into their lives. This works particularly well because Quaker meetigs for worship are generally silent (depending on the type of meeting), so it's easy to use mediation during such times.  That said, /u/tripletrules answer is for sure what many Evangelical Christians in the South might think of these Eastern philosophies.    Try and be a bit more creative with "you should message me if". Plenty of people have what you have, so having something unique helps you stand out.    You can sort of do this when you rank questions "What you care about", which should work great if you only have a select number of things which are very important to you in finding a match.   Everyone is different. Not every guy enjoys constant talking, or needs it.  Do you mean he logged into OKC after you texted him? If he did that, then maybe he lost interest. Why not message him there? Ask him what's up and if everything is okay.     Sometimes I take a few days to talk with someone again. It's nothing personal, I just like my alone time for a while and need to recharge. Or something comes up which makes me hella focused on other things besides my SO/dates. So the silence doesn't always have anything to do with you; there can be other factors at play.   1) I like ll of your photos, they show you being active and positive which is always a good thing.  2) Try and start sentences with "I" less so there's a better flow, especially with each of your paragraphs in your opening section. You could also cut some things down. For example:   "I want to have a relationship of the sort where we can tease each other constantly while still caring for each other and being cute together." -- "It'd be great if we could tease each other in that cute way that couples do."   "The current plan is to go into journalism once I graduate because I enjoy writing and want to work in an area where I can help make a difference." -- "The current plan is to go into journalism, where it's easy to make a difference with words."  "I feel like this is a strange thing to put down, but upon meeting people there tends to be a "guess the ethnicity" game. I guess I don't look like what people expect since I tend to get Spanish, Italian, and Greek a lot." -- "People like to guess my ethnicity a lot. They're hardly ever wrong/right. It's still a fun game to play."  3) "I'm grew up in a conservative household but am personally socially liberal." Made a grammar error there! I'm -- I     Common courtesy. And you can sometimes find ways to google a profile based off a picture, whereas that's harder to do with Tinder.   Agreed. I never liked professional looking photos as a main, unless they show something interesting. So a change for a main could go a long way.    That's a very good point, though certainly Turkey, Russia and India aren't nearly as unstable as Pakistan, or in danger of becoming unstable like Iran one day.   Plus, Pakistan isn't in danger of a new civil war, and they've been fighting jihadists for a while now, so I'm sure they know how to protect their nukes. Still, I suppose their bombs could always fall into the wrong hands. Certainly makes me think!   I am opposed to the amendment for reasons already stated, however, I am totally for having a national discussion about it, and having states vote Nay or Yea on choosing to adapt the amendment. It'd be a great moment for our country to learn more about the Constitution, and the process of changing it.    The current Iranian government probably is smart enough yes, but we have no idea what the country will look like in the future. It's possible Iran could see another movement like the Green Revolution, and it's possible said movement could descend into chaos, field by a region already in turmoil. In such a situation, I would be concerned about nuclear weapons falling into the hands of any rebel factions (pro-Israel or not).    And really, it's kind of important point to make right now. There's been a lot of talk during this legislative secession about what to do about the drop in oil prices, and how that will change how the state spends and saves. For years, Wyoming has been one of the few states to run a surplus in revenue due to conservative spending, and the oil business bringing profits to the state. But now that those profits are in danger, as well as people losing their jobs, a lot of legislators are looking to protect the coal industry.    I think you mean *Alex*. ;)   Maybe the hardship of finding an apartment if you're a Native in Fremont County? I've talked with a lot of Natives who get tuned away by landlords, simply because their last name is Brown.     The pastor turned to Kasha, You should repent! God, he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah just because of gays!    Kasha yelled back, Let his creator judge him! Not you! Not any of you here!  Such a powerful part. Thanks for sharing this OP, it's very beautiful with all it's imagery (though tragic the story is).   I'm down!   Amongst everything else mentioned here, you also have to consider the American allies who would be quick to denounce such an action.   Relations with countries like Japan, Canada, or the UK would be severely harmed.    For Quakers, the vision statement is:   We envision a vital and growing Religious Society of Friendsa faith that deepens spiritually, welcomes newcomers, builds supportive and inclusive community, and provides loving service and witness in the world.    Through Friends General Conference, we see Quakers led by the Spirit joining together in ministry to offer services that help Friends, meetings, and seekers explore, deepen, connect, serve and witness within the context of our living faith.   Yes, because they're spending money in large sums to influence government. The average citizen doesn't have the kind of money to play into games of "favorites" and "well-connections" that Washington runs on. So get *all* money out of politics.   Sticky post on the front page of this subreddit explains it.   And it's $600m too much. Get money out of politics. We need to stop letting any industry, or group, from squashing  the little man.   Your average Joe can't compete with $600m or $900m. You're right, this isn't democracy, it's an oligarchy for the rich and well connected. So ban unions, the Koch's, scientists, banks, and everyone else from destroying the system.      Individually, no union spends nearly as much as the Koch's, this is true, but the industry itself spends $600m: https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indus.php?id=P year=a    Dirty federal employee (volunteer program).    I'm sorry :( I got a nasty stomach bug. Plz forgive.    Taking the money out of it renders lobbying for certain issues almost useless. You won't be able to have groups like the ACLU (who pay lobbyists).    Then how can we get laws passed or inform politicians about laws? I've lobbied by talking to state representatives about passing a law in my state. Many of the representatives I contacted had never heard of the bill that I was trying to get passed.    I'll be there!    Much better. The rest seems pretty okay to me.  Good luck!    You mention working for a non-profit and moving overseas twice in two different sections. That's repetitive, and unnecessary.    Nothing terrible, and I like your pictures, though I would replace your main with the picture of you on the horse, because it's sort of cute and funny and shows you doing something "interesting".  What happened before the Big Bang? The Big Date?  I liked this part, made me chuckle.   I work with Native Americans, and it's a hard mindset to explain, especially if you're not Native/Aboriginal. Speaking only for the two tribes I work with (and based on my conversations with tribal members), they are generally very distrusting of the US government, and whites in general. There are still Natives on my local reservation who went to boarding schools where their Native culture was stripped from them, depriving them of their heritage. These young kids were also beat, or raped. And mind you, this wasn't all that long ago, so the events are still fresh in people's minds.  So you're talking about groups who can still remember when a white government was beating and raping their children. It's not easy convincing them that "everything's better now, trust us!", especially when it often isn't (at least for some US reservations).   Tag line is good enough reason for me.   North Dakota DOES exist, despite what all these naysayers tell you.   It's hard to have this conversation because Malcolm changed his mind towards the end of his life, before being killed. He began preaching the same message MLK was, more or less.    On the whole, probably not. However, we may see states adapt such measures on their own, like how Vermont tried to get single-payer healthcare up and running, but was unable to due to cost.    Try paddling to "the spit" in Scituate. It's a nice sandbar where boaters gather to party during the summer. Should be quiet this time of year.   I didn't even know this was a thing. I feel so left out.  	110
    Prismarine pillars?! Redstone lamps with different colors/textures? Who knows. :D   I really like your use of regular torches! I find they're hard to use in an aesthetically pleasing way, especially without any addition (such as a frame and a slab behind). But you did a really nice job there. Nice!   Yeah. Ocean Monument blocks (especially dark prismarine) work fine with nether blocks I find. Just like sand and nether blocks work well together. Just like prismarine blocks work well with sand.  It all works together in the end I guess. :D   Yeah. I wish this picture was the one in the OP haha but it's fine, I don't think redstone lamps mix in that poorly either. Lanterns are just a superior choice.    This is a squid farm though:D   Nice!   Whoa! Nice haha! I'm not sure what else to say...  edit: Prismarine pillars? Redstone lamps of different textures/colors? :D Who knows!   Saved. Thanks for this.       I feel like shit when I don't lift, but I understand how important rest is, so I endure how I feel. I also feel like shit when I don't eat clean, which is fine because eating clean should be a 7 day thing and you won't go very far if your diet is only on point during your training days.    I've lost a total of over 200 pounds across 6 years. From 30% body fat when I was 15 year old to close to 10% now. I know how to lose weight. But I constantly look for ways of making the process easier and faster.    It improves mood and suppresses appetite. Makes it easier to diet.    [Indeed.](http://i.imgur.com/C9rtUKE.png)   I haven't been able to find any studies on the interaction between the two, but since 5-HTP increases the production of available serotonin in the brain and Ephedrine is an agonist at the serotonin receptors, could combining the two be potentially dangerous?    Indeed!   Have at least a good understanding of basic biochemical principles. If you want to understand the science behind dieting for specific purposes (such as reducing adipose tissue), you have to understand how macro and micro nutrients are processed by the body, that is, how they interact with various enzymes and hormones.    Read the FAQ/Wiki.    Has anyone ever tried this product? I hear it helps for cutting due to its properties as a mood regulator and appetite suppressant.       I can see the difference instantly, personally. A fit butt looks firm and almost 'peaky', whereas a fat butt just looks like a bit fat slump of adipose tissue and it spreads around the hips as well.  I think a fit butt is really attractive, whereas one that is just fat is ugly. Perhaps it has to do with the person's corresponding lifestyle more than anything. My friends think the latter is attractive too, I think they have issues...    Assuming weight lifting and proper protein intake, most of what you lose is triglycerides. The fat cells release their content, these are bound to lipoproteins, released into the bloodstream, and then used to create energy through lipolysis and then the metabolic pathway.    Nice!   Nah. It looks awful with light. Relative darkness is what makes it look decent.       For example, when I'm cooking salmon, I'll say 'I'm preparing some proteins and some saturated and omega-3 fats'.   Or if I'm eating raspberries, I'll say 'I'm having fibers and sugars with some Vitamin K and Magnesium'.  I'm not kidding. Do others people do that or am I just a weird human being?    Fixed that typo! Thanks.    I play Minecraft. It kills time.    I'm not sure. I was careless and wrote this without verifying any source material. I'll remove it just in case, I would rather be less precise than give incorrect information.    As far as I know, albumins are water-soluble proteins that bind fatty acids. But I don't have a source to check at the moment, so I could be wrong. Also, I'm sorry, I often mix up lipogenesis and lipolysis (the two terms, not the process that each term refers to). Lipogenesis, rather, is the process by which acetyl coA is converted to fatty acids and triglycerides, just to clarify for others who will read this.    I personally avoid Questbars. They claim to be fiber rich, however the fiber they contain are isomalto-oligosaccharides, which I call fake fibers because they are a sugar that isn't actually considered one due to the fact that it is a long chain molecule, but which still has the same impact as sugar on the brain. Also, it contains a fruit extract called mongrosides, which is 200 times sweeter than the sugar we normally use in North America.    It depends what you mean by weight loss. If you mean adipose tissue, the adipocytes, which contain uni and multilocular cells, lose some of their size (they shrink). The main difference between the two is that the latter contain considerably more cytoplasm (the substance that makes up the cell's internal structure). When you lose weight, the triglycerides (stored fat) contained in those cells are turned into fatty acids by various hormones, such as adrenaline and noradrealine, and then bound to various proteins to form lipoproteins so they can enter the bloodstream. From there, they are used in lipolysis and result in the creation of Adenonine triphosphate (energy) through the electron transport chain of the body's tricarbolyxic acid cycle (one of the main metabolic pathways).   However, not only fat is lost when weight is lost. Some muscle tissue is also lost. All dietary proteins are broken down into amino acids, which are sent to the body's nitrogen pool. From there, amino acids are used for various purposes, including the creation of new muscle tissue. But if the nitrogen pool has insufficient supplies of certain amino acids, muscle tissue will be broken down so its amino acids can be sent back there and used for more vital functions. Sadly, my knowledge of biochemical principles is not advanced enough to tell you to what extent, but it definitely happens.      Mata, DanDy, Looper, Dade, Pawn, imp, Deft, Acorn, Heart, Spirit, basically all of Samsung Blue and Samsung White moved to playing for various top Chinese teams. Why?      The research on meal timing is inconclusive. The general consensus is that your daily caloric intake is mostly what matters. You can manipulate meal timing in order to make it easier to be on a caloric deficit, but caloric intake at the end of the day is still what matters. It's just about making it work for you to do respect said caloric intake.    Exercise less.  Eat more dietary fibers and proteins (they fill you up).  Drink more water.  Chew gum.      Some people are going to dislike you and what you say regardless of what it is that you say. I realized that, so now I just give my opinion regardless of what others think. Can't please everyone anyway. Maybe I'm a prick, or maybe I just have an opinion that's different from yours and that you therefore perceive negatively.    I'm not sure exactly, but at some point before this season.       My daughter would never have cake at her wedding in the first place. I would never raise my children to eat that kind of food.    I don't eat the unhealthy foods? For things like fruits, vegetables, rice, meat, etc, I can eat them anyway because I know how many calories certain portions represent approximately. I just plan ahead when I prepare my meals for the day/week.    Check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpeYiGowqWk), it sums it up pretty well I think.    I've played with mods before, but don't really enjoy them for the most part. Some of them are really complicated and just add more of what the game already has. One of the mods that I do enjoy though is Ruins, because it uses vanilla content only and allows you to create your own randomly generating structures. But in general, I find that there is already endless stuff to do with vanilla, so mods aren't needed.    I started the process of removing unhealthy foods from my diet entirely about 5 years ago. Just like everyone, I had been raised by my parents and society eating shitty foods. 5 years later, I can now go for 3-4 months without eating anything that isn't 'clean'. It's definitely a long process, and I'm not quite sure how it works in the brain, but it's tough. And people already struggle with training because it's hard and takes time to see the results, so imagine that. With that in mind, it's easy to see why most people fail to ever remove unhealthy foods from their regular diet.     I would rather be lonely than be forced to eat unhealthy foods just because I socialize with people who do. It's fine that not everyone understands and lives by scientific principles that relate to foods, but there's no reason to not live by what you know to be true. Just because all my friends drink alcohol and eat out at Mcdies every Friday night, doesn't mean I do as well. Be the one that all the sheep will eventually follow, not one of the sheep yourself.    I'm going to get downvoted like hell for this, but I just wanna say what I really think. I just think that cheat meals are an excuse for people who lack dedication and/or have been raised being used to eat unhealthy food, which they now associate with a feeling of well-being as a result. I've read a lot of research, never came across anything that justifies having 'cheat meals' from a scientific perspective. The only argument is that it helps people maintain their diet during the week by allowing them to 'take a break from it', but that argument is inherently flawed, because no one was born with the need to eat chips, pizza or cake. That need in itself is a cultural construct that society created in individuals by manipulating the various macro nutrients in food products for economic purposes.    I have a supercharged creeper farm. I got a supercharged creeper to blow up a regular creeper and collected its head.    I'm working on it! There will be a world download in a couple days for sure.    The first picture had me like 'WHOA!'   I have a Nether Fortress farm in my world. It took about 3 months to build (I had to remove everything 120 blocks around in every direction), and uses [redstonespire's Ghast Wither Ripper design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6JOe-vy3-U) from the Zipkrowd server. When it comes to redstone and general game mechanics in Minecraft, these guys are pretty much the best of the best. Almost all the most efficient farm designs out there come from them. I've also used their witch hut farm design, their supercharged creeper farm design, their self-fixable iron golem farm design and their fully automatic Wither wood farm design. That's why I have more resources than I'll ever need in my world now. The only thing I need to actually grind to get are quartz and clay. All the other resources I get from various farms and mob grinders. It's basically creative except I have to get the resources in the chests and I can't fly around to build. :p    Amazing! Thank you! Glad I could inspire you!   I used this design https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK_BcHG2NlM   You should post it on /r/minecraftseeds as well.    Will check this out and give feedback!  Edit: wow, AMAZING seed! Good find OP! I can confirm, this is really cool, but not for the faint of heart or beginning players. The starting island has nothing but grass, dirt, sand, a single sugar cane and 4 pigs. The only island with some trees on it is a 100 block swim away, and there is an Ocean Monument right in the way. There is another Ocean Monument nearby as well, and it's in the way of another small island with trees on it too. You can see both upon first entering the map if your render distance is at at least 20 chunks.   edit2 : WHOA, this seed has a lot more to it than expected. Right underneath the starting island, there is a tiny bit of coal and iron. And if you go further down, there is a huge ravine with lots of resources (crap ton of iron   coal, and even some gold, redstone and diamonds), and the most amazing thing is how the Ocean Monument is actually in the way of that ravine as you can see [here](http://i.imgur.com/3RaLS0K.png). This is super cool, I'd never seen anything like this before. Epic! Thanks again for sharing OP.  edit3: also, the mainland nearby has a desert, a birch forest, a swamp, a roofed forest and a savanna all bordering each other, meaning you can get almost all types of wood right off the bat!!   I'm a redstone noob and I feel like redstone clocks are already easy and compact enough to make. Also, there are multiple clock designs, allowing for more flexibility when building redstone devices.       I will try this. Thank you!    Let me put you in context. Me and my friend have known each other since we were 7 year old, we hang out together pretty much all the time. We're also big into fitness, in that we train regularly and eat healthy and count our calories and all that stuff. About a year ago, my friend started using cocaine in rave parties. She doesn't even smoke cigarettes, rarely smokes pot, had never really been a drug user until her cocaine use suddenly started. At first I didn't really care or pay attention to it, because I'm a big believer that most substances, when used in moderation, aren't nearly as harmful as society believes them to be. However, at first it was once in a while, once every 2-3 months or so, and now it's almost every week end. I bring it up once in a while, and her discourse is always something along of the lines 'I spend 10 hours in the gym weekly, I diet hard, I'm still healthy than 99% of people, so it doesn't really matter'. I'm starting to see a typical pattern of addiction (denial, increasingly frequent use), and it worries me. I never really say anything, but it scares me for two reasons. Firstly, any hard drug use used 2-3 times a year probably isn't realistically a big deal, but when it's every weekend, it definitely starts getting on the unhealthy side. Secondly, I'm fearful that her use will keep becoming increasingly more frequent.   I'm not sure what to do about it. I don't know how to bring it up in a serious manner, never had a friend with what seems to be a drug issue, never really used any hard drugs of the kind myself, so I don't know what it feels like to be on this stuff regularly either. One part of me still thinks that it's not really that big of a deal, but another part of me is scared that I'm just watching her walk down a part of destruction, and I feel guilty for not reacting. What would you guys do?  TL;DR: best friend of mine is taking cocaine increasingly frequently and I'm not sure what to do. Her discourse whenever I bring it up is 'I train 10 hours a week, I diet hard, I'm still healthy than most people so it doesn't matter.   For me:   -Tinkers' Construct: a more elaborated, meaningful and rewarding crafting system  -Ruins: the ability to create your own randomly generating structures  -Optifine: more in-game optimization for powerful and low cost computers alike     I never had a hypothesis to begin with, that's what you don't get. I linked an interesting study that I came across and based on which I raised questions and that I was hoping to have a discussion about. I said that while you were right, there had been a misunderstanding because I never disagreed with you in the first place. I know caloric intake is what mostly matters. I was asking myself, based on the results of that study, if carb cycling combined with calorie cycling could be more effective than calorie cycling alone. That's all.     No thanks, I will simply go to another place that isn't full of people who seem to be incapable of having a civilized discussion on anything without being rude and throwing tamper tantrums. I clarified my point and acknowledged yours, and all you have to say is 'when are you finished crying'. I feel like I'm having a heated debate with a stuck up 16 year old. Feel free to downvote this one as well.    We agree that losing fat while gaining muscle is possible for overweight, untrained individuals, but much less so for advanced weight lifters who have low body fat. That's also what the FAQ states. I don't even know why we're arguing on that. I presented a study in which overweight women lost more weight through intermittent carb cycling than with a traditional caloric deficit diet. That's where my argument that, perhaps, manipulating macro division along with caloric intake could be more effective than manipulating caloric intake alone, came frome. I don't know if this is actually true. I presented a single study, and stated that it presents some evidence that supports the superiority of carb cycling. That's it. I don't know why you're so upset. I'm not making any out-of-thin-air claims. Of course caloric intake is still what mostly matters.    The FAQ states that it's possible for overweight   untrained individuals to gain muscle while losing fat. I never said otherwise. I'm pretty sure Lyle Macdonald has a similar discourse. Also, the technical deficit limit, as stated in the FAQ, is also based on experiments done on untrained individuals.    I'm pretty sure there's nothing in the FAQ stating that lifting weights and having a high protein intake while on an important calorie deficit will prevent breakdown of muscle tissue at 100%. Do you believe so?   I don't have any numbers, but I'm fairly sure that some muscle loss is unavoidable. Of course it's minimized given that you lift weights and that you have proper protein intake. It's not rocket science. But that wasn't my point.    It's not as simple as that. The research which said that a pound of fat has 3500 calories and that, therefore, eating 3500 calories less = 1 pound of fat lost is almost 50 years old now. More recent research shows that when you lose weight, you lose mostly fat but also some muscle tissue.    Read the FAQ/Wiki. It has literally all the info you need to get started. Also, you want to work out your entire body, not just the upper part of it.    Snatch grip deadlift while forcing your core out.    Alright. So I will simply add more powered rails. Thank you!    Oh man, you make me want to build a fighting arena in my world too, even though it's single player. :(   Yeah you're right. The title is kind of misleading. I'm sorry.    Last answer, because I accidentally read your comment... Let's just be clear on one thing. You might be right that 1000 calorie isn't the ideal deficit and that I don't have a source to back up what is the ideal deficit, but you are the asshole. I checked your comment history, you're the one who makes needlessly rude comments, who tells random people to commit suicide, so if anyone is an asshole and 'all sorts of fucked up in the head', it's you, not me. There's probably something going on in your life that makes you act like this, but I honestly don't care, I just wanted to point it out before I move on with my life. If there's one thing you schooled me on, it's that the internet is full of assholes. You sure did remind me of that.    I'm happy to be schooled, but not by people who tell random strangers on the internet to commit suicide. For me, the discussion ended when I read that. Now I'm just going to block you and put you on ignore. Have a nice life. And by the way, I will never read whatever you answer to that, so don't bother typing something.    You're mistaken. I wasn't referring to the 1000 calorie thing here, I just picked the first 3 papers from Layne Norton's article. And I've actually accessed all of them through library genesis, I was just too lazy to find all the download links again. But seriously, I would be lying if I said that there's an arbitrary number like 1000... there isn't... but the general consensus is that if you're between 500 and 1000,  and you eat enough protein and weight train, you won't lose that much muscle mass. I still need to do more reading to find out the relationship between this and body fat %age. But by the way, in the first study they found that resistance training mediated the muscle loss associated with a very low calorie diet in untrained women, that's pretty related to the whole 'huge calorie deficit' topic. And also I don't know if I think that I'm better to anyone, but I know that I haven't been rude and throwing out insults, unlike you, so that certainly makes me better than you in that sense.     Oh I see I made you angry here, that's fine... But you're wrong, in that I actually take into consideration everyone's point of view, and I try to understand how people view things, but in the end I very often end up sticking to my own. I don't see what's wrong with that. We all have our own outlook on life and that's fine and it doesn't keep us from being respectful with each other. My point of view is trying to balance between the research that I read and that I believe to be credible, and my own personal experience. But I think it's the research part that a lot of society isn't ready to accept and that's why people often get angry at what I say.    I don't understand why you keep being rude with me. I haven't said anything to offend you, I think. I could easily go ahead and say things like how I think that you don't know a damn thing about nutrition like a whole lot of people here, but I don't write that kind of thing because it's counterproductive and doesn't bring anything positive to the table.  Also, I didn't just look at what Layne Norton said, I looked at the research he used to make his claims, like [this](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10204826) research paper and [this one](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10332666) and [this one](http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/25/3/431.full).  I might be 'fucked up' like you say, but at least my 'fuckedupness' is based on serious research that I've read on.    And also, I'm not sure why you're bringing milk into the discussion, but you should read everything I wrote on the subject. I think my stance on why it's something that should not be consumed by most people is a pretty well justified one. Feel free to go ahead and prove me wrong.             Things I've done so far:  -Playing mindlessly easy video games  -Watching funny TV shows  -Browsing reddit  -Watching motivational bodybuilding videos over and over again  -Chewing gum  Any other ideas?

If you want to farm a mob as efficiently as possible, simply use other mobs to do it.     I've been curious about this. I'm currently planning my next comp prep, and I was wondering what you guys' protocol usually looks like. In my research, I found that that long-run (6 weeks, in this case) carbohydrate depletion increases the effectiveness of many lipid metabolism, especially the beta oxidation Acyl CoA dehydrogenases. In turn, the enzyme  Flavin adenine dinucleotid (FAD) is known to 'boost' the ability of glutamate to be transaminated (a transamination is a chemical transfer between an amino acid and an alpha-keto acid) by alanine transaminase. To me, this at least suggests that ingestion of carbohydrates following a period of severe depletion boosts lipid metabolism through the actions of Acyl CoA dehydrogenase, as well as the ability of non-essential amino acids to be used in glycolysis prior to the start of the tricarbolyxic acid cycle.   In light of this evidence, during my last carb depletion period, I had 4 weeks during which I ingested no more than 50g of carbohydrates daily, followed by 2 weeks of severe carbohydrate depletion (no more than traces daily), followed by 10 days during which carbohydrates represented over 50% of my daily intake with 35% of proteins and 15% of dietary fats. At this point I was 2 weeks out. When I started consuming carbohydrates again, I had noticeable increases in strength and musculature, although this is obviously only anecdotal evidence.   However, I'm looking for more science/personal experience reports on how you guys do it. :)     If there is no sugar in the blood, then neither glycolysis nor ketosis can take place right?  I know that certain amino acids from the nitrogen pool contribute to the production of energy, but only indirectly as far as I know.  I know that glutamate is transaminated to pyruvate from the transaminate enzyme ALT. However, this cannot happen if there is no pyruvate to begin with, right?  I also know that glutamate is ultimately catalized (or rather, citrulline and aspartate are catallized) into fumarate, which produces some ATP, but it's impossible without ATP itself since ATP is used to catalize phosphate and ammonia to form carbamoyl phosphate.  So, this means that, theorically, if there is no glucose at all in the blood, no ATP is produced and the person simply dies, correct? Or is there some other mechanism that prevents this and that I'm unaware of?         I'm not sure if the title is a great way of calling that experience, but I went through that and I'm wondering if others did too.  I remember when I was a teen, before I started dieting, back when I didn't even know what the macro nutrients and micro nutrients were, I would just eat things based on whether I enjoyed their taste or not.  When I started dieting, it was hard because there were a lot of things that I recognized as best to eat for optimal health but of which I couldn't stand the taste. But over the years it slowly changed and recently I've noticed it... Things that used to taste really good to me, like pizza and chocolate, don't taste nearly as good as they used to, and things that used to not taste good at all (such as rice and some vegetables) now taste 'normal' if that makes sense. It's almost like foods in general don't really taste anything to my mouth anymore, and the only things that still taste a lot are the things that my brain associates as healthy and part of my pre-made diet.   I don't know if any of what I typed makes sense, it's weird to explain, but I'm wondering if others have experienced this too and if there's a name for that phenomenon.          I have been lurking around the internet, but all I've been finding is anecdotal evidence. One guy writing that you should X dose, another saying that you use Y dose. I've read people claiming they use doses anywhere between 50 to 5-600mg daily. I've even seen one person say that metabolism is increased by 10% per 100mg. I understand how DNP affects the mitochondria of the cells, but even then this seems a little absurd to me. Furthermore, all these claims that people make are never backed up by any research.   I was wondering if anyone has come across any serious research that determined what is the proper dosage in humans for weight loss purposes? I've been using Clenbuterol in the past, but my next comp prep cut is starting soon and I'm fed up with the side effects of Clen and am looking for an alternative product to use.  Thanks in advance!   **1. Introduction**  This is a guide I wrote on cutting on /r/fitness a while ago, but I figured I would re-post it since it is especially relevant here.   In this post I want to show what is, in my humble opinion, the best dieting plan for cutting (losing fat), all backed up by scientific principles; I try to rely on anecdotal evidence (a.k.a bro science) as little as possible. The goals of this plan are:  A) To cut down on body fat  B) To maintain muscular strength and mass  C) To remain generally healthy   **2. Nutrient Breakdown**  I am not a believer that a calorie is just a calorie. Surely, as long as you respect your caloric intake based on the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) formula, you will lose weight regardless of where your calories come from. However, this argument forgets two really important points. Firstly, the second most important factor after caloric intake, that is, **satiety**; if what you eat leaves you hungry, you are more likely to eat more and not respect your target caloric intake. Therefore, when I diet for cutting, I eat foods that makes me feel full. Secondly, losing weight and eating healthy do not necessarily go hand in hand; technically, you could lose weight by eating nothing but Twinkies, but does that mean you would be healthier? No.   Based on these two points, my macro and micro nutrient breakdown when I'm cutting usually goes as follows: A) high dietary fiber, B) moderate protein, C) moderate complex carbohydrate, D) low simple carbohydrate, E) moderate good fat (unsaturated, polyunsaturated   omega-3) and as free of bad fat (saturated and trans) as possible, and F) high in vitamins (A, B, C) and minerals (calcium, zinc, phosphorus, etc.). Now I will explain the why behind each of these macro and micro nutrients:  A) High dietary fiber: when I said that I want to eat foods that make me full, I was referring to dietary fibers specifically. In fact, research has shown that fibers prolong and enhance the sensation of satiety (1) (18).   B) Moderate protein: this one seems obvious, but I will explain it anyway. The process that creates new proteins in the body is one called protein biosynthesis. Thanks to this process, the amino acids contained in the proteins we eat are joined together chemically to form complete proteins, which are then used for many important processes, including muscle tissue maintenance and growth (2). However, what is less known is that too much protein can be harmful. In fact, ingesting too much protein causes the body to produce a compound known as ammonia, which can damange organ tissues (3). Therefore, proteins are important, but like for everything, moderation is key.   C) Moderate complex carbohydrate: remember our second goal, maintaining muscular strength and mass. Carbohydrates provide with intensity during training in the form of muscle glycogen (4) and help prevent the breakdown of muscle tissue (2). Furthermore, complex carbohydrates are favored over simple ones (the latter which I explain later), due to the fact that they provide energy more consistently and in the long run (5); inversely, think of simple carbohydrates as peaks and valleys of energy that are absorbed really quickly into the bloodstream (9). However, once again, moderation is key, and too much carbohydrates can be harmful; in fact, carbohydrates increase insulin production, which in turn increase the percentage of your fat intake that is turned into body fat (6).   D) Low simple carbohydrate: like I mentioned above, you want to limit your simple carbohydrate (sugar) intake while you are cutting, and perhaps even in general as well. Some research has shown that fructose, a simple carbohydrate found abundantly in fruits, soft drinks and most processed food products triggers the brains reward pathway (7) but not its satiety mechanisms (8), leading to something known as the sugar craving cycle (5) and which causes people, upon fructose consumption, to still feel hungry and want to ingest more. Nonetheless, there are two key moments during which you still want to consume simple carbohydrates: during the first meal of the day and post-exercise. This is because, during those times, insulin sensitivity is higher, which means that a bigger percentage of the carbohydrates you eat will be used as energy by the body. Insulin sensitivity is at its highest after a prolonged period of fasting (10) and post-workout, the latter usually being referred to as post-exercise insulin sensitivity in the literature (11). Therefore, you want to eat some simple carbohydrates for breakfast and as part of your post-workout. Also, your main source of simple carbohydrates should be fruits, as the latter are generally rich in dietary fibers, and the satiety effects of fibers may partly negate the effects of sugar by slowing down the absorption of the latter into the bloodstream (12).   E) Moderate good fat and low (or no) bad fat intake: this is a complex topic, but I will try to keep it simple. Basically, dietary fats, even though they are highly caloric (nine calories per gram compared to four for proteins and carbohydrates), are essential for the body. To relate them to our second goal, dietary fats increase testosterone (9), a hormone that promotes growth of muscle tissue in ways that are beyond the scope of this post. The good fats increase the production of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which picks up excess cholesterol in the blood and bring it back to the liver where it can be broken down (13). Certain of the good fats, like omega-3, also have a plethora of health benefits that once again go beyond the scope of what is discussed here; they prevent certain aging-related diseases and regulate metabolism, among other things (14). Inversely, the bad fats increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol production, which does basically the opposite of HDL cholesterol and, over time, can lead to coronary artery disease (13). Long story short, a moderate fat intake is important and represents between 20 and 30% of daily caloric intake (9).  F) High vitamin and mineral intake: this is more of a common sense argument, but since you are cutting and therefore eating less, each calorie that you eat is more important in terms of the vitamins and minerals it contains. This is sadly another topic that goes beyond the scope of this post, but vitamins and minerals are important for general health, and are involved in various processes that relate to muscular tissue maintenance and growth (15) (16). Therefore, a healthy cutting diet is one that should be centered on foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals.   **Sample dieting plan**  In light of everything that I have discussed above, this is what a sample dieting plan for a 6 ft, 200 pound, 25% body fat male in his mid-twenties and who exercises 3 to 4 times a week should look like.   Firstly, The TDEE formula places that mans maintenance caloric intake at around 2500, and if he wants to lose 1 lb. of fat per week, he needs to be a daily caloric deficit of 500 (as a pound of adipose tissue contains 3500 calories), which places him at 2000 calories daily. You could go up to a 1000 calorie deficit without losing muscle tissue (9), but I personally find that a 500 calorie deficit is a good start for people who are not used to dieting and have more limited knowledge of nutrition.   Secondly, I assume that this man would be eating 4 meals day, although this is mostly a matter of preference, and there is no general consensus among scientists as to what kind of meal of meal frequency is optimal for general health and weight loss (17).   Finally, his macro nutrient breakdown would be 40% protein, 40% carbohydrate and 20% fat. This means 200g of protein, 200g of carbohydrate and 45g of fat. Furthermore, about one third to half of the carbohydrates for meal 1 and meal 3 (post workout) are simple ones, and fibers are consumed in various amounts every meal.   Meal 1  37g old fashioned oatmeal, dry (139cal, 5prot, 25scarb, 3fat)  202g raspberries, raw (105cal, 3prot, 24carb, 1fat)  1 whole egg, hard-boiled (78cal, 6prot, 0carb, 5fat)  10 large egg whites, hard-boiled (170cal, 36prot, 0carb, 1fat)  Meal 2  141g sweet potatoes, boiled without skin (107cal, 2prot, 25carb, 0.5fat)  175g peas, unsalted, boiled (137cal, 9prot, 25carb, 0.5fat)  125g chicken breast, cooked, without skin (200 cal, 39prot, 0carb, 5fat)  10g unsalted nuts (59cal, 2prot, 2carb, 5fat)  Meal 3 (post-workout) (same as meal 1)  37g old fashioned oatmeal, dry (139cal, 5prot, 25scarb, 3fat)  202g raspberries, raw (105cal, 3prot, 24carb, 1fat)  1 whole egg, hard-boiled (78cal, 6prot, 0carb, 5fat)  10 large egg whites, hard-boiled (170cal, 36prot, 0carb, 1fat)  Meal 4  98g yam, boiled, unsalted (100cal, 1prot, 25carb, 0fat)  50g Atlantic salmon, cooked (103cal, 11prot, 0carb, 6fat)  35g avocados, raw (56cal, 1prot, 3carb, 5fat)  125g sweet potatoes, boiled, without skin (95cal, 2prot, 22carb, 0fat)  9 large egg whites, hard boiled (153cal, 32prot, 2carb, 1fat)   **Refeed days**   Firstly, refeed days are not cheat meals. They are **high carbohydrate, moderate protein, low fat days**, and all of the dieting principles mentioned earlier in this post still apply to them.   According to bodybuilder and Nutritional Sciences PhD Layne Norton (9), refeed days should happen every 6 to 12 days, and increasingly more often the longer you have been cutting.  Through complex interactions with the brain and other parts of the human body, the hormone leptin affects appetite and metabolism. It does so notably by 'countering' the effects of certain neurotransmitters in the brain known as endocannabinoids. Decreased leptin production is associated with increased appetite and decreased metabolism; when someone has been cutting for a long time, their leptin production is decreased, which is why it becomes increasingly harder to keep losing fat despite being at a daily caloric deficit.  Here's what the research says on leptin and refeed days:  A) You should increase your caloric intake up to maintenance level (or maybe a little more if you're the 'hard gainer' body type); if you're losing 1lb a week, this is a 500 calorie increase, and more than that is probably not necessarily and might even have negative effects (19);  B) Carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in leptin production, but not dietary fat (20) (21);  C) As research has shown (22), an increase in carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in insulin levels, which in turn increases the rate at which fat is transported into the body's adipose tissue. This is because the higher the insulin levels, and the more active the enzymes responsible for breaking down fats into fatty acids are (23). Therefore, on refeed days, fat consumption should be kept to minimal amounts;  D) Simple carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose, have no impact on leptin levels (5).  **Other things to avoid for optimal dieting**  Alcohol: on top of being highly caloric (seven calories per gram) and containing no nutrients, here's why you should avoid drinking for optimal dieting:  A) It disrupts the body's ability to repair and maintain muscle tissue, by slowing down the production of human growth hormone during deep sleep (26).  B) It slows down metabolism, by disrupting the citric acid cycle, one of the body's main metabolic pathways (27). This is complex, but simply put, alcohol is seen as a poison, and the body prioritizes its oxidation over that of fats, proteins and carbohydrates, which means that less of the macro nutrients you ingest are turned into energy, and inversely, more are turned into stored fat (28).   C) It disrupts the enzymes that synthesize testosterone, thereby slowing down its production (29).   D) It depletes the body's reserves of vitamins and minerals more quickly than normal (30). Like mentioned above, many vitamins and minerals are involved not only in general health, but also in various processes that relate to muscle tissue growth and maintenance.   Cocoa: while cocoa has many health benefits (31), it is also highly caloric, high in dietary fats, and contains oxalic acid, which inhibits the absorption of minerals and vitamins by the body (32). I personally use carob over cocoa, as it is naturally sweeter, which means that you need less added sugar to get the same sweet taste, is richer in vitamins and minerals, and is free of oxalic acid (33).    **References**  1. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21115081  2. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11255140  3. http://connectedhealthcaresystems.com/lit/elevated%20ammonia.pdf  4. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1748-1716.1967.tb03720.x/abstract  5. http://www.briancalkins.com/simplevscomplexcarb.htm  6. http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/46/1/3.short  7. http://advances.nutrition.org/content/4/2/226.abstract  8. http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1555133  9. http://www.simplyshredded.com/layne-norton-the-most-effective-cutting-diet.html  10. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/81/2/388.full  11. http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/10683091  12. http://www.thinkingaboutnutrition.com/2011/11/the-sugar-to-fiber-dietary-ratio/  13. http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/hdl-cholesterol/art-20046388  14. http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcidsandHealth-HealthProfessional/  15. http://www.hellawella.com/5-vitamins-help-build-muscle-strength-and-tone-body  16. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289217/  17. http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=56254  18. http://www.nutritionj.com/content/12/1/153  19. http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/50/12/2786.abstract  20.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10567012  21. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336  22. http://www.spinalhealth.net/insulin.html  23. http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/cellular-microscopic/fat-cell2.htm  24. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10751202  26. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10189054  27. https://chordaetendinae101.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/hangovers-and-the-krebs-cycle/  28. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16047538  29. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11910706  30. http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa22.htm  31. http://www.naturalnews.com/022610_cacao_chocolate_raw.html  32. http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA400344/Avoid-Vegetables-with-Oxalic-Acid.html  33. http://www.gilead.net/health/carob.html      What is, in your experience, the best electrolyte supplement?   Last time I went on a 2 week no carb period for my comp prep, I had serious mood issues, and I've realized that it is quite possibly due to electrolyte issues, based on the research I've read and on the fact that that a lot of people who go on ketogenic diets seem to experience the same thing. However, I have some specifications.  I would prefer if my electrolyte supplement was:  -free of carbohydrates (no carb diet)  -free of stimulants (I'm already using Clen HCL for cutting, don't want to get a heart attack)  -particularly high in potassium (same reason as for why I want it free of stims, otherwise I'll just keep buying potassium tablets, but that'd be a nice plus)  Does anyone know of a good electrolyte supplement that meets these requirements?    I made a [visual organizer](http://i.imgur.com/94M5HSP.jpg) that explains why.  As you can see the process is fairly simple. Fats are transported through the bloodstream as lipoproteins (as they cannot do so on their own) and then used by various parts of the body for various purposes. Excess fats (triglycerides) that cannot be used for anything are then stored and then regenerated in the body's tissue cells (adipocytes).  Carbs are broken down into pyruvate (pyruvic acid) and then further broken down into the molecule acetyl co-enzyme A. Through a process known as lipogenesis, acetyl co-enzyme A is then transformed into fats (fatty acids and triglycerides).  Proteins are broken down into various amino acids, including pyruvate.  Therefore, while proteins and carbohydrates are not directly stored as fat, when consumed in excess they increase the rate at which triglycerides are turned into stored fat through lipogenesis.  This is also why ketogenic (fat-based) diets work; in absence of glycolysis, acetyl coA is formed through ketosis, meaning that ketone bodies (beta-Hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetate) synthesized from fatty acids are used to create energy (ATP) for the body instead.             He is basically saying that alcohol can give cancer. Do you agree, askscience?          Ok, I might be talking straight out of my ass here, because I haven't done any research on the subject. But this is a question I've been asking myself. From what I understand, the research found a significant correlation between leptin production and carb intake, but not between leptin and fat and other nutrients. This is why, for example, Layne Norton says that when you've been cutting for a long time, you should have a refeed day every 6-12 days where you eat at maintenance caloric intake instead of on a deficit and your diet is high carb low fat (due to the fact that insulin increases adipose uptake of fatty acids). You can check out what he says [here](http://www.simplyshredded.com/layne-norton-the-most-effective-cutting-diet.html).  Anyway, aren't refeed days a form of carb cycling in a way? You manipulate your carb and calorie intakes for the purpose of replenishing leptin serum production. Now this is only anecdotal evidence, but carb cycling has worked for me and for a lot of other people from what I've heard. I've been wondering if this could be because of the sudden changes in carb intake from alternating no carb days with high carb ones; maybe that affects leptin production, which partly explains why it works? Anyway, like I said, I haven't found any research on the subject, but this is something I've been wondering.   TL;DR my question is basically: does carb cycling affect leptin production in the same way that refeed days do?             **1. Introduction**  In this post I want to show what is, in my humble opinion, the best dieting plan for cutting (losing fat), all backed up by scientific principles; I try to rely on anecdotal evidence (a.k.a bro science) as little as possible. The goals of this plan are:  A) To cut down on body fat  B) To maintain muscular strength and mass  C) To remain generally healthy   **2. Nutrient Breakdown**  I am not a believer that a calorie is just a calorie. Surely, as long as you respect your caloric intake based on the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) formula, you will lose weight regardless of where your calories come from. However, this argument forgets two really important points. Firstly, the second most important factor after caloric intake, that is, **satiety**; if what you eat leaves you hungry, you are more likely to eat more and not respect your target caloric intake. Therefore, when I diet for cutting, I eat foods that makes me feel full. Secondly, losing weight and eating healthy do not necessarily go hand in hand; technically, you could lose weight by eating nothing but Twinkies, but does that mean you would be healthier? No.   Based on these two points, my macro and micro nutrient breakdown when I'm cutting usually goes as follows: A) high dietary fiber, B) moderate protein, C) moderate complex carbohydrate, D) low simple carbohydrate, E) moderate good fat (unsaturated, polyunsaturated   omega-3) and as free of bad fat (saturated and trans) as possible, and F) high in vitamins (A, B, C) and minerals (calcium, zinc, phosphorus, etc.). Now I will explain the why behind each of these macro and micro nutrients:  A) High dietary fiber: when I said that I want to eat foods that make me full, I was referring to dietary fibers specifically. In fact, research has shown that fibers prolong and enhance the sensation of satiety (1) (18).   B) Moderate protein: this one seems obvious, but I will explain it anyway. The process that creates new proteins in the body is one called protein biosynthesis. Thanks to this process, the amino acids contained in the proteins we eat are joined together chemically to form complete proteins, which are then used for many important processes, including muscle tissue maintenance and growth (2). However, what is less known is that too much protein can be harmful. In fact, ingesting too much protein causes the body to produce a compound known as ammonia, which can damange organ tissues (3). Therefore, proteins are important, but like for everything, moderation is key.   C) Moderate complex carbohydrate: remember our second goal, maintaining muscular strength and mass. Carbohydrates provide with intensity during training in the form of muscle glycogen (4) and help prevent the breakdown of muscle tissue (2). Furthermore, complex carbohydrates are favored over simple ones (the latter which I explain later), due to the fact that they provide energy more consistently and in the long run (5); inversely, think of simple carbohydrates as peaks and valleys of energy that are absorbed really quickly into the bloodstream (9). However, once again, moderation is key, and too much carbohydrates can be harmful; in fact, carbohydrates increase insulin production, which in turn increase the percentage of your fat intake that is turned into body fat (6).   D) Low simple carbohydrate: like I mentioned above, you want to limit your simple carbohydrate (sugar) intake while you are cutting, and perhaps even in general as well. Some research has shown that fructose, a simple carbohydrate found abundantly in fruits, soft drinks and most processed food products triggers the brains reward pathway (7) but not its satiety mechanisms (8), leading to something known as the sugar craving cycle (5) and which causes people, upon fructose consumption, to still feel hungry and want to ingest more. Nonetheless, there are two key moments during which you still want to consume simple carbohydrates: during the first meal of the day and post-exercise. This is because, during those times, insulin sensitivity is higher, which means that a bigger percentage of the carbohydrates you eat will be used as energy by the body. Insulin sensitivity is at its highest after a prolonged period of fasting (10) and post-workout, the latter usually being referred to as post-exercise insulin sensitivity in the literature (11). Therefore, you want to eat some simple carbohydrates for breakfast and as part of your post-workout. Also, your main source of simple carbohydrates should be fruits, as the latter are generally rich in dietary fibers, and the satiety effects of fibers may partly negate the effects of sugar by slowing down the absorption of the latter into the bloodstream (12).   E) Moderate good fat and low (or no) bad fat intake: this is a complex topic, but I will try to keep it simple. Basically, dietary fats, even though they are highly caloric (nine calories per gram compared to four for proteins and carbohydrates), are essential for the body. To relate them to our second goal, dietary fats increase testosterone (9), a hormone that promotes growth of muscle tissue in ways that are beyond the scope of this post. The good fats increase the production of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, which picks up excess cholesterol in the blood and bring it back to the liver where it can be broken down (13). Certain of the good fats, like omega-3, also have a plethora of health benefits that once again go beyond the scope of what is discussed here; they prevent certain aging-related diseases and regulate metabolism, among other things (14). Inversely, the bad fats increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol production, which does basically the opposite of HDL cholesterol and, over time, can lead to coronary artery disease (13). Long story short, a moderate fat intake is important and represents between 20 and 30% of daily caloric intake (9).  F) High vitamin and mineral intake: this is more of a common sense argument, but since you are cutting and therefore eating less, each calorie that you eat is more important in terms of the vitamins and minerals it contains. This is sadly another topic that goes beyond the scope of this post, but vitamins and minerals are important for general health, and are involved in various processes that relate to muscular tissue maintenance and growth (15) (16). Therefore, a healthy cutting diet is one that should be centered on foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals.   **Sample dieting plan**  In light of everything that I have discussed above, this is what a sample dieting plan for a 6 ft, 200 pound, 25% body fat male in his mid-twenties and who exercises 3 to 4 times a week should look like.   Firstly, The TDEE formula places that mans maintenance caloric intake at around 2500, and if he wants to lose 1 lb. of fat per week, he needs to be a daily caloric deficit of 500 (as a pound of adipose tissue contains 3500 calories), which places him at 2000 calories daily. You could go up to a 1000 calorie deficit without losing muscle tissue (9), but I personally find that a 500 calorie deficit is a good start for people who are not used to dieting and have more limited knowledge of nutrition.   Secondly, I assume that this man would be eating 4 meals day, although this is mostly a matter of preference, and there is no general consensus among scientists as to what kind of meal of meal frequency is optimal for general health and weight loss (17).   Finally, his macro nutrient breakdown would be 40% protein, 40% carbohydrate and 20% fat. This means 200g of protein, 200g of carbohydrate and 45g of fat. Furthermore, about one third to half of the carbohydrates for meal 1 and meal 3 (post workout) are simple ones, and fibers are consumed in various amounts every meal.   Meal 1  37g old fashioned oatmeal, dry (139cal, 5prot, 25scarb, 3fat)  202g raspberries, raw (105cal, 3prot, 24carb, 1fat)  1 whole egg, hard-boiled (78cal, 6prot, 0carb, 5fat)  10 large egg whites, hard-boiled (170cal, 36prot, 0carb, 1fat)  Meal 2  141g sweet potatoes, boiled without skin (107cal, 2prot, 25carb, 0.5fat)  175g peas, unsalted, boiled (137cal, 9prot, 25carb, 0.5fat)  125g chicken breast, cooked, without skin (200 cal, 39prot, 0carb, 5fat)  10g unsalted nuts (59cal, 2prot, 2carb, 5fat)  Meal 3 (post-workout) (same as meal 1)  37g old fashioned oatmeal, dry (139cal, 5prot, 25scarb, 3fat)  202g raspberries, raw (105cal, 3prot, 24carb, 1fat)  1 whole egg, hard-boiled (78cal, 6prot, 0carb, 5fat)  10 large egg whites, hard-boiled (170cal, 36prot, 0carb, 1fat)  Meal 4  98g yam, boiled, unsalted (100cal, 1prot, 25carb, 0fat)  50g Atlantic salmon, cooked (103cal, 11prot, 0carb, 6fat)  35g avocados, raw (56cal, 1prot, 3carb, 5fat)  125g sweet potatoes, boiled, without skin (95cal, 2prot, 22carb, 0fat)  9 large egg whites, hard boiled (153cal, 32prot, 2carb, 1fat)   **Refeed days**   Firstly, refeed days are not cheat meals. They are **high carbohydrate, moderate protein, low fat days**, and all of the dieting principles mentioned earlier in this post still apply to them.   According to bodybuilder and Nutritional Sciences PhD Layne Norton (9), refeed days should happen every 6 to 12 days, and increasingly more often the longer you have been cutting.  Through complex interactions with the brain and other parts of the human body, the hormone leptin affects appetite and metabolism. It does so notably by 'countering' the effects of certain neurotransmitters in the brain known as endocannabinoids. Decreased leptin production is associated with increased appetite and decreased metabolism; when someone has been cutting for a long time, their leptin production is decreased, which is why it becomes increasingly harder to keep losing fat despite being at a daily caloric deficit.  Here's what the research says on leptin and refeed days:  A) You should increase your caloric intake up to maintenance level (or maybe a little more if you're the 'hard gainer' body type); if you're losing 1lb a week, this is a 500 calorie increase, and more than that is probably not necessarily and might even have negative effects (19);  B) Carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in leptin production, but not dietary fat (20) (21);  C) As research has shown (22), an increase in carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in insulin levels, which in turn increases the rate at which fat is transported into the body's adipose tissue. This is because the higher the insulin levels, and the more active the enzymes responsible for breaking down fats into fatty acids are (23). Therefore, on refeed days, fat consumption should be kept to minimal amounts;  D) Simple carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose, have no impact on leptin levels (5).  **Other things to avoid for optimal dieting**  Alcohol: on top of being highly caloric (seven calories per gram) and containing no nutrients, here's why you should avoid drinking for optimal dieting:  A) It disrupts the body's ability to repair and maintain muscle tissue, by slowing down the production of human growth hormone during deep sleep (26).  B) It slows down metabolism, by disrupting the citric acid cycle, one of the body's main metabolic pathways (27). This is complex, but simply put, alcohol is seen as a poison, and the body prioritizes its oxidation over that of fats, proteins and carbohydrates, which means that less of the macro nutrients you ingest are turned into energy, and inversely, more are turned into stored fat (28).   C) It disrupts the enzymes that synthesize testosterone, thereby slowing down its production (29).   D) It depletes the body's reserves of vitamins and minerals more quickly than normal (30). Like mentioned above, many vitamins and minerals are involved not only in general health, but also in various processes that relate to muscle tissue growth and maintenance.   Cocoa: while cocoa has many health benefits (31), it is also highly caloric, high in dietary fats, and contains oxalic acid, which inhibits the absorption of minerals and vitamins by the body (32). I personally use carob over cocoa, as it is naturally sweeter, which means that you need less added sugar to get the same sweet taste, is richer in vitamins and minerals, and is free of oxalic acid (33).    **References**  1. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21115081  2. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11255140  3. http://connectedhealthcaresystems.com/lit/elevated%20ammonia.pdf  4. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1748-1716.1967.tb03720.x/abstract  5. http://www.briancalkins.com/simplevscomplexcarb.htm  6. http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/46/1/3.short  7. http://advances.nutrition.org/content/4/2/226.abstract  8. http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1555133  9. http://www.simplyshredded.com/layne-norton-the-most- effective-cutting-diet.html  10. http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/81/2/388.full  11. http://europepmc.org/abstract/med/10683091  12. http://www.thinkingaboutnutrition.com/2011/11/the-sugar-to-fiber-dietary-ratio/  13. http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/high-blood-cholesterol/in-depth/hdl-cholesterol/art-20046388  14. http://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/Omega3FattyAcidsandHealth-HealthProfessional/  15. http://www.hellawella.com/5-vitamins-help-build-muscle-strength-and-tone-body  16. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3289217/  17. http://www.medicinenet.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=56254  18. http://www.nutritionj.com/content/12/1/153  19. http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/50/12/2786.abstract  20.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10567012  21. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336  22. http://www.spinalhealth.net/insulin.html  23. http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/cellular-microscopic/fat-cell2.htm  24. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10751202  26. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10189054  27. https://chordaetendinae101.wordpress.com/2012/01/05/hangovers-and-the-krebs-cycle/  28. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16047538  29. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11910706  30. http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa22.htm  31. http://www.naturalnews.com/022610_cacao_chocolate_raw.html  32. http://www.drweil.com/drw/u/QAA400344/Avoid-Vegetables-with-Oxalic-Acid.html  33. http://www.gilead.net/health/carob.html   http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0765159715000039  Twenty weight-lifting males took 4 doses of 5g of creatine for 5 days. After 5 days, they found a significant difference compared to baseline testosterone and cortisol levels.   Thought you guys would like to read this, since the research on supplements isn't that common even these days.   For those interested, full article can be found here http://libgen.org/scimag/index.php?s=10.1016/j.scispo.2014.03.006   It tastes so good and it's quick and easy to make!  Low in calories, high in dietary fibers, for high carb days/cutting/general nutrition. 1659 calories, 150g of protein, 343g of carbohydrate and 87g of fat. Downsides: about half the carbohydrate calories come from simple carbohydrates, some of the fat calories come from low density lipoprotein fatty acids (mostly in the carob chips).  **Ingredients:**  -15 oz. canned black beans  -3 whole eggs  -1/2 cup carob powder  -1/3 cup unpacked brown sugar (or any other sweetener)  -3 tbsp. coconut oil  -1/2 tsp. vanilla extract  -1 tsp. baking powder  -1/2 cup unsweetened carob chips  -1 cup blueberries  -1 cup Quake old fashioned oatmeal  **Instructions:**  1. Preheat oven 350 and spray baking pan.   2. Place beans in blender and pulse until smooth. Add remaining  ingredients except carob chips and blend/pulse together.   3. Stir in 1/4 cup carob chip in chocolate batter.   4. Pour brownie mixture into prepared baking pan. Spread remaining carob chips on top of black bean brownie mixture.   5. Bake for 20-25 min. until toothpick can be inserted into middle of mixture and come out clean.  6. Let cool down for about 1 hour, then put in fridge.   **Why I use carob over chocolate:**  -Carob is naturally sweeter, so less added sugar is needed to get the same sweet taste;  -Carob contains less fat (high carb and high fat do not mix well together, as carbs increase insulin production and insulin production increases adipose tissue uptake of fatty acids);  -Carob has more vitamins and minerals, and less oxalic acid, the latter which can inhibit absorption of certain minerals by the body.         Basically, I'm a bit weird compared to a lot of guys, in the sense that my 'sexual awareness' only appeared when I was 19, compared to most of my male friends who started talking about girls when they were 14-15 and some earlier than that. When I was high school, I had a lot of friends or people that I would hang out with daily, some were guys, some were girls, but to me, they were just that, friends or acquaintances and nothing more. I never thought that I was attracted to guys, and I'm not, but I was never aware of my attraction to girls until I was about 19. It came really suddenly too: I was in a bar, and a girl that I didn't know that well started dancing with me and we kissed, and after that I started thinking about, about her body touching mine, and about what all that stuff meant. Before that, I was completely oblivious to sexuality and relationships. I don't know why it was like that. But no one really told me about it, no one teased me about it or anything like that when I was in high school. I guess people just assumed I hadn't met the right person yet.  Now how is this a problem? Well the problem is a girl that I consider one of my best friends if not the best - we've known each other since we were 12 - and that I now find myself somehow really attracted to. We do everything together. We go to the gym together, run together, have dinners and watch movies together, often hang out at each other's place, etc.. She even tells me about the stuff she does with her boyfriend and we talk about a lot of intimate things. But it was never a big deal because we've known each other for a long time and really get along with and share a similar view of the world and hobbies. Well, it was never a big deal until now, that is. Recently I realized that she wasn't just a friend, that she was also a girl, and a pretty attractive one at that. And I'm having thoughts that I find inappropriate, first, because she's my friend and you're not supposed to be thinking of sleeping with your friends, and also because she has a boyfriend, who is also a good friend of mine and someone I see everyday at the gym. She says that I've been acting weird lately and that I've been keeping something from her, and it's true, but the thing is, how do you go about telling someone that you shouldn't hang out anymore because you have thoughts of having sex with them? And also, I don't wanna lose her friendship, it's precious to me, but at the same time I'm having sexual thoughts and I'm finding that they're increasingly harder to control, and I don't really know what to do.  Tl;dr I've started to have sexual thoughts about my girl friend who's also one of my best friends that I've known for 9 years.                For how long did you do it? What complementary exercises did you do along with the squats? I know it works the upper body too, but since the back and pecs aren't hit as hard, did you also have compound back and chest exercises? Like maybe bench press and rows? Thanks in advance!!   So my understanding of chemistry in general is fairly limited, so hopefully the chemistry people can chime in and help me with this.  I know that when the TCA occurs, the process of dehydrogenation takes place, which requires the action of the co-enzyme NAD (as it's a redox reaction). I also know that as ethanol is being converted to acetate, the action of NAD is also required, as it gets converted back and forth to NAD and NADH during that process (since it's also a redox reaction).  Basically, when carbon dioxide is oxidized from citric acid, the electrons transfer to NDA+ to create NADH.   So, technically, that means that when alcohol enters the liver, there should be an overlap, right? Based on logic, that also means alcohol leads to an increase in fat storage, because the TCA transforms fat into energy, and if it does so at a lesser rate because of alcohol (due to NAD co-enzyme overlap), then there is also an increase in adipose uptake of triglycerides as a result (since they aren't used by the body as energy).  However, I could be wrong, but if I understand correctly, it means ingestion of alcohol indirectly results in an increase in fat storage in the body?   edit: I found the info here http://zwz.cz/f/allgood1186/1PJ5JPDV/Obrazky-metabolism-chart  edit2: by 'does it increase fat storage?' I actually mean 'does it reduce the lipolysis rate?', sorry for using a misleading expression. I wish I could edit the title now.   edit3: not too sure why this got so big. I just asked a question and it got more or less accurately answered by at least 10 people in the comments. I wanted to know if ethanol ingestion affected the lipolysis rate. It does. There isn't any more to this lol.       My understanding of chemistry is not that good, but I understand that alcohol can only be broken down by enzymes in the liver known as alcohol dehydrogenases (ADH). Those enzymes are also responsible for catalyzing the chemical reactions of certain functional groups (such as hydroxil) within molecules during the body's citric acid cycle (TCA), which is one of the three main metabolic pathways. When alcohol reaches the liver, the ADH have to start breaking down alcohol, and as a result the TCA is disrupted, which causes an increase in fat storage. What I don't understand: why? I don't understand how the fact that ADHs have to break down ethanol disrupts the TCA.          Which one do you guys prefer?  One of my friends who's a kin student says that the latter should be avoided because most people don't have the shoulder flexibility necessary to do it properly and you can easily strain your rotator cuff muscles.  Yet I've been doing it for years and never had any injuries. I've done the military press too. I like both, but find that the behind the neck one stimulates my triceps more.    I know it's mostly a matter of preference, that it mostly comes down to caloric intake.  Still, some prefer one of these to the other 2. I'm among those who prefer the low to no carb, moderate protein and moderate fat diet. For me, fulfilling a small carb craving used to almost always lead to a much bigger one, which made it hard to respect my target caloric intake, so I stopped eating all carb foods except vegetables. And since then dieting has been easy.   I only eat high carb and low fat on my refeed days, once every 2 weeks. I have a friend who functions very well on a moderate carb and moderate diet. Which one works best for you guys? I'm curious to know.       It's my 16th day of 0 carb. The 2 first weeks weren't so bad, but now people are asking me why I tell them to fuck off when they ask me why I'm so short tempered lol.  I've tried a lot of things. Listening to relaxing music, taking warm baths, watching funny movies, and it's helped to an extent, but there are still times when I feel like throwing my fist into a wall.   I've tried asking my coach, and said that you just have to deal with it, that's it part of the 'carb cleansing process'. -_-  So, any tips guys? What do you usually do to help with the bad mood on low carb days?          I've seen a lot of people on this sub say that not only is it fine to have cheat meals, but that it's also a good thing. I would like to argue that this is not true at all, and let me explain why.  Firstly, the idea that it's actually a good thing to have days during which you 'binge eat' even when you're cutting comes from the research on leptin, the mother of all fat burning hormones.  Through complex interactions with the brain and other parts of the human body, leptin affects appetite and metabolism. It does so notably by 'countering' the effects of certain neurotransmitters in the brain known as endocannabinoids (1). Decreased leptin production is associated with increased appetite and decreased metabolism; when someone has been cutting for a long time, their leptin production is decreased, as leptin production is dependent on caloric intake (2), which is why it becomes increasingly harder to keep losing fat despite being at a daily caloric deficit.  In order to solve this problem, scientists working with athletes for whom weight is a concern have come up with something known as the 'refeed method', which consists in having days where caloric intake is significantly higher in order to increase leptin production. However, those 'refeed days' are not what people on this sub perceive as 'cheat days'; instead, **they are low fat, moderate protein, high carbohydrate days.**  Here's what the research says on those refeed days:  -You should increase your caloric intake up to maintenance level; if you're losing 1lb a week, this is a 500 calorie increase, and more than that is probably not necessary and might even have negative effects (3).  -Carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in leptin production, **but not dietary fat** (4)(5).  -As research has shown (6), an increase in carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in insulin levels, which in turn increases the rate at which fat is transported into the body's adipose tissue. This is because the higher the insulin levels, and the more active the enzymes responsible for breaking down fats into fatty acids are (7). Therefore, on refeed days, fat consumption should be kept to minimal amounts;   -Simple carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose, have no impact on leptin levels (8).  What does this all mean? Well, **no research has ever said that it's ever fine to 'binge eat' or to consume bad fats and simple carbohydrates in large amounts.** Refeed days should be days where you eat at maintenance level, and where your diet is a low to no fat, moderate protein, high carb one. According to Nutritional Sciences PhD and bodybuilder Layne Norton (9), refeed days should initially happen once every 2 weeks, and as you progress into your dieting process, should become more frequent up to once every 6 days. But they certainly aren't an excuse to eat unhealthy or to not count calories. In fact, from a nutritional point of view, nothing really justifies doing such things, ever.    **References**  1. http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/endocannabinoids.php - Endocannabinoids in the CNS and the Control of Feeding Behaviors  2. http://ajpregu.physiology.org/content/292/2/R868   3. http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/50/12/2786.abstract  4. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10567012  5. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336  6. http://www.spinalhealth.net/training.htm -  The Insulin Response to Carbohydrates  7. http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/cellular-microscopic/fat-cell2.htm  8. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10751202  9. http://www.simplyshredded.com/layne-norton-the-most-effective-cutting-diet.html   I've seen a lot of people on this sub say that not only is it fine to have cheat meals, but that it's also a good thing.

This is because the higher the insulin levels, and the more active the enzymes responsible for breaking down fats into fatty acids are [(4)](http://science.howstuffworks.com/life/cellular-microscopic/fat-cell2.htm). Therefore, on refeed days, fat consumption should be kept to minimal amounts;   -Simple carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose, have no impact on leptin levels [(5)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10751202).   What does this all mean? Well, **no research has ever said that it's ever fine to 'binge eat' or to consume bad fats and simple carbohydrates in large amounts.** Refeed days should be days where you eat at maintenance level, and where your diet is a low to no carb, moderate protein, high carb one. According to scholar and natural bodybuilder [Layne Norton](http://www.simplyshredded.com/layne-norton-the-most-effective-cutting-diet.html), refeed days should initially happen once every 2 weeks, and as you progress into your dieting process, should become more frequent up to once every 6 days. But they certainly aren't an excuse to eat unhealthy or to not count calories. In fact, from a nutritional point of view, nothing really justifies doing such things, ever.   I apologize if I'm shattering your food dreams, or being a party pooper, but this is the cold hard truth.    As far as I know, where it comes to refeed periods, there's two methods:   1) having a relatively long (1-2 weeks) period of caloric maintenance at various points throughout the process of caloric deficit  2) having much shorter (3 days or less) periods of significant caloric surplus (500 cal.) increasingly often as the person progresses through the process of caloric deficit  Personally, I've only tried the second method, and I've had moderate results. In this [research paper](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/130/12/3127S.short), they found that meal-induced increase in leptin production takes 4-7 hours to occur, which seems to suggest that having short periods of caloric surplus is better than having longer periods of caloric maintenance.   However, I'm looking to try the first method as well anyway, because I know that there's sometimes a difference between theory and practice, but I would like to get feedback before I do. How do you guys usually go about your re-feeding periods?   Also, in [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1087161/) and [this study](http://www.pnas.org/content/98/11/6402), they found that high levels of EFA (particularly Arachidonic acid, which is found notably in fish and meat) increase production of the cannabinoid neurotransmitter Anandamide as well as lipogenesis in rats (the two are obviously related). I'm no expert on the topic, but since increased leptin production also leads to reduced production of Anandamide (source [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18516053)), does that mean that EFA intake should also be reduced during the refeed periods in order to maximize their effectiveness? I'm looking for feedback on that as well, so I can figure out what percentage of my caloric intake fat should represent.

This is a great read, simply explained, and backed up by actual research. It summarizes the research on leptin hormone (a.k.a the appetite hormone) and weight loss.   Basically, since leptin is synthesized primarily from fat cells, the lower your body fat percentage and the lower your leptin production. Leptin counters the effects of naturally occurring THC-like substances in the brain known as endocannabinoids, which reduce metabolism and increase appetite. Therefore, the lower your leptin production, the harder it becomes to keep losing body fat.  The author outlines methods such as refeed days or periods and which allows the person to manipulate leptin production in order to break through weight loss plateaus.    I posted this in r/relationships, but didn't really get the help I was looking for. So I'm posting here. I figured, here I'm probably more likely to find people who have had similar experiences. So here goes:   Basically, the TL;DR version of this post is that I have a compulsive need for counting all the calories that I eat, every meal and every day. I know my anxiety is not rational, that not counting calories all the time isn't that big of a deal, but not knowing how many calories what I eat contains causes me anxiety and extreme discomfort.  It started when I was 15. Back then, I was playing football, and my coach had told the team that, in order to get more muscular and stronger, we needed to eat in surplus. I really wanted to succeed, so I started learning about nutrition, asked my mom to buy me a food scale and started calorie-counting and weighting all my food.  When I was in my last year of high school, an injury pretty much ended my chances of playing in college, so I quit. But by then, counting calories and lifting weights had become a habit, so I started doing bodybuilding instead. Around this time, I was spending a lot of time reading 'bro science' on the internet and I quickly realized that calorie-counting could be applied not just to getting more muscular and stronger, but also to all aspects of one's physique: to prepare for a running competition, to get bigger and stronger, to cut down on fat, etc.. Around that time, I became quite a bit of a nutrition junkie. I started reading on actual research on nutrition and health and all that stuff.  I always thought calorie-counting was a good habit, and it never was a problem. But I'm almost 21 now, and all my friends are teasing me about the fact that I've never really had a girlfriend, that I never really talk about girls as more than friends or acquaintances. Because of that, a couple months ago I started socializing more, I started getting out there so as to increase my chances of meeting someone that I get along with.  The problem is, socializing involves eating without being able to calorie-count all the time, and that prospect causes me extreme mental discomfort. I realized that only recently. For example, 2 weeks ago, my family was having a family meeting at a restaurant, and I didn't go because I was afraid of the anxiety eating food that I couldn't calorie-count would cause me. Also, 2 days ago, I was gonna ask out one of my classmates in college, but I backed out at the last second because I realized that any part of the date that involved eating somewhere would cause me to feel unwell. Like I said, I know it's not rational. I know that if you calorie-count like 80% of the time, you are fine. But not being able to know how many calories are contained in what I eat causes me anxiety. Also, I find the stuff that they serve in most restaurants and fast food chains to be disgusting, and I don't tell people because I'm scared that they'll think I'm weird or something. Personally, I rarely eat anything other than chicken, brown rice, sweet potatoes, eggs, nuts and lettuce. And my parents think that it's 'not normal' but I pay for my own food for the most part, so they can't really have a say in what I eat.  I've realized that my calorie-counting habit, no matter how good it is, has started to impact my social life negatively in various ways, and I don't know what to do about it. I don't know how to stop, and that is causing me almost as much anxiety as not being able to count calories, so I'm stuck in vicious circle of anxiety that I don't really know how to escape.  Edit : I've read all the comments so far. Thanks for the amazing support. I'm not too sure what to say. I'll re-edit when I am.    Ladies, may I ask why?  Very serious question. Please don't judge or make fun.   As someone who was once at as high as 25% and is now sitting at 10-12%, I am actually offended by this thought.  Are you telling me that I ever dropped below 10%, which I plan to do in the future, I would be perceived as ugly?         My cutting diet consists in 2000 calories, distributed equally across the 4 following meals (which, as you will notice, are really just four times the same meal):  200g Chicken, roasted, without skin (330 cal, 62 prot, 7 fat)  15g Unsalted mixed nuts (89 cals, 3 prot, 8 fat)  71g Brown rice, cooked, medium grain (81 cals, 1.7 prot, 17 carb, 1.7 prot)  50g of lettuce, raw (8.5 cals, 0.5 prot, 1.5 carb)  For a total of 508.5 calories, 67.1 prot, 18.5 carb and 15.6 fat per meal. The overall total is 2034 calories, 1078.4 from prot, 296 from carb, and 561.6 from fat.   That means 1908.8 of the calories come from the 3 main macronutrients.   Why this diet for cutting? They say that as long it fits your macros, it doesn't matter; this is certainly true. However, let me explain to you why my diet works better for me, and I'll let you judge whether it could work just as well for you or not:   -**Counting the calories of and weighting a bunch of different food products is time-consuming and more complicated**, opening up more room for calculation mistakes that might end up making the entire dieting process less effective. On the other hand, this diet plan took me less than 15 min. to make and is extremely simple to follow daily. The whole dieting process is amazingly effortless.    -**When it comes to cutting, the second most important thing after counting calories is increasing your dietary fiber intake**. This is because fibers are what makes you feel 'full' and satisfied after you've had food, meaning you feel less hungry with less calories. Brown rice happens to be one of the best sources of dietary fiber around, and lettuce contains quite a bit of fiber too.  -**Nuts are one of the healthiest and fiber-richest sources of healthy fats that exist.** They contain many vitamins that are important for humans. They are also very low in Cholesterol, something that cannot be said for many fat-based food products. It's true that they contain quite a bit of saturated fat, but this is not an issue as long as you count your macros and eat them in reasonable quantities.   -**Lettuce is ridiculously low in calories**, and not only it is rich in dietary fibers, like I've mentioned above, it also contains just about every vitamin and mineral that humans need in order to remain healthy.  -**As you can see, my diet contains no simple carbohydrates, which are colloquially known as sugar. From my own experience, and I'm sure you can relate, sugar is addictive in a way.** More often than not, when you fulfill a small sugar craving, it leads to an even bigger one, and the next thing you know, you've eaten more than you were supposed to and you are now above your target caloric intake. Yes, the research on 'sugar addiction' is controversial and inconclusive, but personally, anecdotal evidence based on personal experience was more than enough to justify removing simple carbohydrate foods from my diet entirely. In the past, resisting sugar cravings was a struggle for me, and when I first started not eating sugar anymore, I went through hell. However, over time, it got easier, and many months later, I don't crave sugar anymore and I find that it has made dieting much easier. The months of mental suffering were definitely worth it!  -**High protein and low carbohydrate diets can make you increase muscular mass and strength, contrary to what some think.** In the absence of much carbohydrates, the body becomes much more efficient at using stored muscle glycogen and at performing despite far fewer carbohydrates and less insulin. **So, no, not eating much carbohydrates does't mean that you'll lose all your hard-earned gym gains.**  TL;DR The diet that has worked best for me is chicken, rice, nuts and lettuce only all day everyday.       Have you ever wondered why losing weight seems to become harder the longer you do it? I have certainly wondered too, and the research that I've done has helped me find both an explanation and somewhat of a solution for that problem, which is what this thread is about.  Most people don't know this, but much of the weight loss research of the past two decades has been done on the hormone known as 'leptin'. It was discovered in the nineties through experiments done on rats. Rats who didn't have the gene responsible for leptin production were three times as big as other rats, quickly developed symptoms of diabetes II and couldn't control their hunger. However, when they received the gene, their size went back to normal, the symptoms disappeared, and they stopped eating everything in their way. Since then, a lot of research has been done on the hormone.  Leptin is a hormone synthesized primarily from fat cells, which in turn come from the food you eat. Its main purpose is to control your appetite; it's what tells your body 'stop, you've had enough!' after you've eaten a certain amount of food. It does so by countering the effects of naturally occuring THC-like substances in the brain known as endocannabinoids. You know how when you ingest or smoke THC, you wanna eat your face off afterwards? Well, endocannabinoids do the same thing but to a lesser extent. When leptin production is increased, the effects of those substances are decreased, leading to increased metabolism and reduced appetite. However, when you've been on a caloric deficit for a long time, your leptin production is significantly decreased, which is why it's harder to keep losing fat.   In light of this evidence, many athletes and fitness celebrities for whom weight is a concern have developed a method known as the 'refeed period', which consists in eating a daily caloric surplus over a short period of time in order to make it easier to eat less and burn more fat afterwards. This is usually done in the weeks prior to a competition or fitness show. How can this be used for the average layperson who wants to lose weight? Well, by having, throughout your cutting program, days or periods during which you eat in surplus, so as to refresh your leptin production. There is also evidence which suggests that these periods of re-feeding should become more frequent the longer you've been cutting.   In my researching, I have also found that leptin is an incredibly complex and not fully understood hormone. There seems to be other factors which affect leptin production. For example, one study from 2005 found that when patients were well rested, their leptin production was 'optimal'. Furthermore, there seems to be a link between leptin and the stress hormone, cortisol: in well-rested patients, when their leptin production was high, their cortisol production was proportionately low, suggesting that there is also a more direct link between weight loss and cortisol. In fact, other studies have found a link between cortisol and abdominal fat.   In short, here's what I am **NOT saying** but which could easily be interpreted from what I have written:  -that you should justify your THC use as something that will help you eat your face off;  -that you should justify eating your face off as an excuse to eat a caloric surplus.  What I am **actually saying** is:  -while cutting, you should have periods where you aren't cutting, but instead eating a caloric surplus, such as one day per week or a few meals throughout the week, to make sure that your leptin production stays high.   **References**  http://themedicalbiochemistrypage.org/endocannabinoids.php - the relationship between leptin and endocannabinoids explained  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC55013/ -the study in which they discovered the leptin gene  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3065312/ - the relationship between leptin, cortisol and weight loss         I know the crash period that will follow the end of my cutting period will be a brutal one.  Besides the obvious stuff, like increasing fiber intake, what are you guys' tip to not eat the face of the world when you come off the appetite suppressants?    I know it sounds like a strange issue, but I don't really know what to do, so I came here to ask for help.

I don't know how to stop, and that is causing me almost as much anxiety as not being able to count calories, so I'm stuck in vicious circle of anxiety that I don't really know how to escape.      **First, here's some facts about nutrition:**  1. When it comes to weight loss, by far the most important factor is how many calories you eat. The when, what and how don't matter much, based on what science has shown so far. There was a guy in the U.S who lost 27 pounds on a diet of Twinkies, Oreos and Doritos. How? By counting his calories.   2. The thing that makes eating on a caloric deficit the easiest is how 'full' what you eat makes you feel. When cutting (losing fat), you wanna eat foods that will make you feel more full, so as to be able to go through your day while eating less. Inversely, if you're bulking (gaining muscular mass), you wanna eat things that don't make you feel too full, so you can eat more. Things that make you feel full are white meat, complex carb foods (such as pasta) and, most importantly, fiber-rich foods (such as oatmeal). Find a more exhaustive list [here](http://www.womenshealthmag.com/nutrition/high-fiber-food).  What does that mean? Simply put, to lose weight you need to: a) count your calories and b) eat foods that make you feel full. That's it. If you do those two things, no matter what you eat, you won't necessarily be healthy, but you WILL reach your weight goals.  So how to actually count calories? Here's how:  1. **Calculate your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) [here](http://iifym.com/tdee-calculator/).** This will calculate how many calories you need to eat in a day in order to maintain your current weight, based on your age, sex, height, weight, and time spent doing physical activity weekly. To be even more accurate, use the formula that takes into account your body fat percentage. You can estimate that based on pictures found [here](http://www.builtlean.com/2012/09/24/body-fat-percentage-men-women/).   2. **Take the number of calories you got from the TDEE calculator, and either add or substract depending on your goal.** Generally, you wanna stay within 300 of your TDEE, unless you have advanced knowledge of nutrition. If you wanna gain mass, add 300; if you wanna lose fat, subtract the same amount.   3. **Use a food nutrient database such as [this one](http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/nutrient.htm) to make your diet.** This is a hot topic, but generally, you want your diet to be made up of 40% proteins, 40%  carbohydrates, and 20% fats (mostly essential fatty acids). Also, keep in mind, one gram of protein and carbohydrate each contain 4 calories, and one gram of fat contains 9. So if you have a 2000 calorie diet, you would be eating 200 grams of protein, 200 grams of carbohydrate and 45 grams of fat daily. Now, remember, when you eat doesn't matter nearly as much as how much you eat, so the question of how many meals you should split those quantities into doesn't matter too much. However, as a rule of thumb, between 3 and 5 meals will keep you happy and going through your day if you have lots of filling foods in your diet.  4. **Buy a food scale on Amazon.com.** A decent food scale costs less than $20 if you take into account the shipping fees, as you can see [here](http://www.amazon.com/Scales-Measuring-Tools-Cooks-Gadgets/b?ie=UTF8 node=289787). For something so useful in the long-run, $20 certainly isn't much. Now, when it comes to how you weight your food, it doesn't matter too much as long as you're consistent. I personally weight everything in grams, because that's how I get the most accurate results, but if, for example, you're weighting something post-cooking, then do that for everything else as well. If you are not consistent in your weighting practices, you will get results that are overall less accurate, and it will make your life more complicated too.  5. **Be practical in ways that make your life more simple.** When you start, try to limit yourself to simple healthy foods that are easy to prepare, weight and put together. Examples: chicken, brown rice, sweet potatoes, oatmeal, nuts, fiber-rich fruits like blueberries and raspberries, etc.. Over time, you can diversify your diet, once you've gotten more used to weighting and preparing food. Also, do things that will make it easy to prepare and weight food in the long run, like having re-usable Ziploc bags with the food name and quantity in grams written on it. For example, I eat nuts 4 times a day, once per meal, and I have 4 Ziploc plastic bags, on each of which is written 'nuts, 30g'. This way, I remember that I have to prepare 4 bags of 30g of nuts daily, just by looking at my Ziploc bags.   Here you go. A simple guide to make calorie counting easier. Of course you're still gonna have to spend a bit of time preparing your food every day, but there's no way around that. But remember, calorie counting is by far the most important thing. You could eat literally anything, and as long you calorie-count, you will still get results. So the time spent calorie-counting is definitly worth it! Hope this helps and if you have any questions, ask away and I will do my best to answer.    I know it stores and transports energy across cells. I know that it's used for every muscle contraction. I know that it's bound to 3 phosphates, and that when the 3rd bound is broken down, it forms another organic compound known as adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and a free phosphate molecule in order to provide a cell with energy. Sometimes, this process leads to the formation of excess cell energy, which is stored by forming ATP from ADP and phosphate. That's about it. I'm having a hard time making sense of all of this. Can anybody explain this like I'm 5 year old?   Thanks in advance.            Let's say you do a strength program such as 5x5 P/P/L with a moderate caloric deficit (300 ish). I would think that resistance training + weight loss drugs that increase heartbeat leads to more fat loss than resistance training with cardio. I don't know for sure though. What do you guys think?    Just curious to see if anyone had an experience similar to the one I had.  I did this back in December, and the first time I did, I literally vomited all over the floor at the end. During the first week, I did this only, and from the second week onwards, I started addding some complementary exercises.  I like how it worked my upper body too, from keeping the bar on my back for so long and from working to keep my lungs filled with air through heavy breathing. It's actually a full body workout, even though the main thing that gets destroyed is your legs. But because of that, I added some complementary upper body exercises.         So far it looks like this:  Week 1:  Clen - 40mcg/80mcg/120mcg/120mcg/120mcg/120mcg/120mcg  Taurine - 3g ED  Potassium - 300mg ED  Week 2:   Clen - 120mcg ED  Taurine - 3g ED  Potassium - 300mg ED  Week 3:  Ephedrine - 24mg x2 ED  Caffein - 200mg x2 ED  Aspirin - 50g x2 ED  Week 4:  Ephedrine - 24mg x3 ED  Caffein - 200mg x3 ED  Aspirin - 50g x3 ED  Week 5:  Clen  120mcg ED  Taurine  3g ED  Potassium  300mg ED  Week 6:  Clen  120mcg ED  Taurine  3g ED  Potassium  300mg ED   Week 7:   Ephedrine  24mg x3 ED  Caffeine  200mg x3 ED  Aspirin  50g X3 ED  Week 8:  Ephedrine  24mg x3 ED  Caffeine  200mg x3 ED  Aspirin  50g X3 ED  Week 9:  Clen  120mcg ED  Taurine  3g ED  Potassium  300mg ED  Week 10:  Clen  120mcg ED  Taurine  3g ED  Potassium  300mg ED  Week 11:  Ephedrine - 24mg x3 ED  Caffein - 200mg x3 ED  Aspirin - 50g x3 ED  Week 12:  Clen  120mcg ED  Taurine  3g ED  Potassium  300mg ED  Anything I could add or improve on?                            I've been searching the web for 100, 105, 120 and 130lb dumbbells, but all I've found was either low weight dumbbells or custom 'add-weight' dumbell thingies where you can make your own dumbbell weight by adding plates to a dumbell kit. I'm looking for actual dumbbells.                I would have posted on /r/steroids, but I'm not allowed to post there yet.   I've been training for almost 6 years and I've come to a point where, as a natural bodybuilder, my diet and training really have to be on point if I want to keep making significant gains. I'm also feeling pretty down lately and going through a shitty time. Because of this, I'm really tempted to start using AAS, for some reason thinking that seeing better gains would make me feel better.  I've been educating myself for about 2 years on the subject. I know where to buy everything, how to plan, how to inject, the side effects, etc.  Basically, at this point, I've looked at the community websites, I've looked at the research, I've read it all, and it's just a matter of decision. There's also another problem... I'm only 20 year old. I've heard a lot of people say that you should at least wait until you have a couple years of dieting and training under your belt before you start using steroids, but in my case that clearly doesn't apply.  So, even though I could easily use steroids but know I shouldn't, I'm really tempted to do so. Please, help me. I need help to convince myself to stay off the gear. I know this may sound like a dumb question, but I'm literally thinking about this all the time, I even have dreams of it at night, and the urge to just buy them and get on with it is getting harder to resist every day.                             I mean, sometimes I run outside or even on a treadmill, but it's because I enjoy doing it and because I understand the importance of keeping a healthy heart... I don't do it to lose weight.  When I'm bulking, I lift weights and eat a lot.  When I'm cutting, I lift weights faster and eat a lot less. I stop eating fast digesting carbs, and eat moderate amounts of slow digesting ones.   I find that there's no point to spend hours on a treadmill or elleptical machine to lose fat, since it's mostly your diet anyway. It's boring as hell. Also, I burn a lot of calories just by doing an intense workout like some kind of circuit training one.  Am I the only one?           Basically, title. I know a girl who is into fitness and bodybuilding, she does cardio and lift weights 4 days a week. But, she doesn't wanna do delt exercises because she thinks that, in the long run, it would make her too 'wide'. That's obviously plain wrong to me, but I don't know her that well and I'm not sure how to approach the discussion and bring up my point of view on the subject without coming off as a condescending person.         Just wanted to share this with you guys, because it's a [pretty cool study with pretty interesting findings.](http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0089431#pone-0089431-g004)  In this study, they found no correlation between post-workout Myofibrillar Protein Synthesis (MPS) and Resistance Training (RT)-induced hypertrophy.  A group of untrained men did a workout during which they also had a protein rich beverage. They found an increase in MPS both throughout and after the workout. They found no correlation, however, between MPS and RT-induced hypertrophy 6 hours after the workout. They also found no correlation between MPS and RT-induced hypertrophy after 16 weeks of RT. The authors suggest that there is no 'linear relationship between hypertrophy and changes in protein abundance'. In other words, MPS does not lead to more RT-induced hypertrophy in first time weight lifters.  	173
 So suicide prevention hotlines are feeding information to police? WTF *...added to my list of NEVER CALL*   Tom woods has some good information on this:   [Calvin Coolidge: Maligned by Historians, But Vindicated by History?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuUOOrkzvWA)  [Why You've Never Heard of the Great Depression of 1920](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czcUmnsprQI)   Actually, there have been many controlled experiments proving traffic laws, speed limits, and stop sign/lights actually impede the natural flow of traffic and in the case of speed limits can actually be dangerous(especially when set to low.)   Much of the world actually dont use any system of regimented traffic laws. In those countries traffic moves much quicker as individuals negotiate their way on the roads...     You mean taxing the shit out of employers doesn't create jobs? *noooo*   It had a legislator but no executive branch of government...   I think Joesph played a significant role in the awakening of people to the fed... It seemed the original Zeitgeist gained steam just as Ron Paul was flaming the issue. I think we owe him alot. Even for just getting people to think about alternative ideas...   His 'solutions' however are nothing I would ever want to be apart of ever....   and this is even though they have dramatically raised the costs to do this...  	7
 that's what someone else said   Sanders is a brave man to tackle income inequality    #wtf    Still blizzard at least, cmon Man!    Drone battles OMG would be SICK    He dares tackle inequality    Double space    Damn right it does      /r/meditation    Great answer, don't need to waste the tickets    It's over    Don't be a tool of the government    OP will repeat his mistakes if he doesn't break the cycle    This shit again    /r/meditation    We got a winner    Yes    yea i hope it is not as big an albatross as you fear! but anyway i dont think bernie will get very far, he just doesnt have the big backers   Heh then he's gonna have to pay damages    The biggest reason is his attacks on inequality    While all developing countries  from the least developed to middle-income  can celebrate accomplishments in their progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), critical gaps remain. Despite vast diversities, African, Least Developed, Landlocked, Small Island and Middle-Income Countries share, to varying degrees, many common challenges on their path to equitable sustainable development. These include: poverty, growing inequality, hunger, food insecurity, improving public health and education, providing social protection, youth unemployment, migration, urbanization, changing age structures, growing pressures on resources, and climate change. Some countries also face conflict situations or post-conflict fragilities. In many, the globalization of inequality and social exclusion is leading to increased social unrest and dissatisfaction with current models and trends of development. In various cases, these challenges are aggravated and perpetuated by weaknesses in democratic governance and institutional capacity, weak infrastructure, debt burdens, economic crisis, corruption, funding shortfalls, and declines in development cooperation.  This brief focuses on three key pillars for achieving social, economic and environmentally sustainable development:  Advancing the human rights of women and girls and gender equality; The rights and empowerment of adolescents and youth; Sexual and reproductive health and rights for all. These are essential, cross-cutting foundations for a post-2015 people-centred and planet-sensitive development agenda. They are mutually-reinforcing prerequisites for progress, relevant for all countries regardless of their stage of development. They are also smart, effective and cost-saving investments with multiple payoffs across a range of development objectives.  A human rights-based and holistic approach to sustainable development must address multiple dimensions of discrimination and exclusion, including for women and young people as the two largest demographic groups in the world facing inequality and insecurity. Sexual and reproductive health problems  which are preventable  take a huge toll on lives, families, productivity, economies and public budgets. They entrench poverty and erode development prospects, and represent costs and burdens that can and must be lifted. The limited investments in these key areas is a major reason why many of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) have not been achievedan important lesson for crafting the post-2015 agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals.   yea just look at Norway.. richest fucking country on earth.. huge as fuck, land for everyone... most restrictive immigration policies on earth   heh i didnt gain from minox imo, felt like it contributed to the shedding.. but obviously studies show it works or whatever.. i dropped it after 6 months or so. didnt notice any extra shedding but the studies show u lose what u gained obviously     dropped it for straight fin ages ago, minox smells terrible, is expensive, u have to apply 2x or 3x / day etc etc   Xiao Hai is better than Mark Teddy that's for sure    same as being born gay, or watever.. nobody asked for it.. i dunno tho im not a doctor but..   i mean, nobody asked to be born a pedo.. its a curse heh   wasnt there an issue with the bot not properly doing something? i forget   When people say assimilate what they really mean is "become white" which obviously is impossible.    the people like me? what does that even mean? not everyone fits into your handy box..  want to check out some of my sub-reddits?   /r/postnationalist - immigrant rights  /r/yellowperil - racism against asians     BURN THAT STRAWMAN TO MAINTAIN YOUR SENSE OF SUPERIORITY!    It has a buffering function, at least the command line version    Reddit is too dumb for subtle sarcasm    Awesome app especially for bad connections    At least the mods didn't delete it..   Trackball is different...    Try some low low tier teams first    Everytime they do reddit and the media shits all over them..    Feminism and srs feminism banned me despite me contributing tons and never trolling..    YA those are very opposed accounts.. Especially mod logs    325k link Karma here, any offers? No.. Because it's not real OP   Fuck your hate    Srsdiscussion banned me after posting about racism against Asians yesterday because i have lots of karma in /r/conspiracy... Sigh    The sub is heavily moderated I got banned ages ago..   2001 American pot monsters and the Asians still gonna be top8   /r/postnationalist    Heh I've seen upvoted comments here calling for /r/conspiracy to be banned, is it any wonder everyone is scared of being next?   I see the argument all the time on reddit. "I don't mind immigration, I just hate people who break the law"..   Well dunno about them but simply as a pot smoker and jaywalker I broke the law thousands of times..   I think a form of global socialism is the only way (or no socialism), because otherwise the incentives to lock people out of your rich socialist country are just too high.    Oh yes you are the enlightened one, preach on! I can feel the smug through my phone..    I run a freaking immigration rights sub and revived a srs style Asian focused /r/yellowperil but still got banned from srsdiscussion yesterday for daring to discuss racism against Asians while having submitted previously to /r/libertarian  This crusade you're running just drives tons of similar minded people into the arms of the bigots and "free speech" brigade.    You'll lose your hair soon enough, young jedi.    Well after him makes sense but.. Snowden is a fucking hero exiled to Russia for revealing government crimes.   I've already seen subredditdrama proposed bans on /r/conspiracy    What is the controversy cross?   /u/trollabot postnationalism   No surprise there when you look at how people treat them!    Who do Europeans hate more? Muslims, gypsies or refugees?   All ideologies use this strategy to dismiss their opponents. See it constantly in srs and r socialism. You're not a true feminist! You're not a true socialist!    This sub is FGC cancer.. Killing all games except sf.. Why do they say FGC in the sidebar when they hate every other game?   BECAUSE FANBOIS    Well obviously hate it because otherwise people will downvote you.    Well I did get banned from srsdiscussion yesterday because of my post highlighting racism against Asians. Oh sorry, because the mod didn't like my post history. Just more censorship from the left wing.. Is it any wonder I ended up in "free" speech supporting subs?   Even complete ideological enemies like /r/European don't ban me..    And even today Americans defend Iraq and Afghanistan    How does insisting on hiring Americans over Mexicans have nothing to do with nationalism?    /r/governmentoppression    Cmon in every other thread /r/technology is crying for more battery life    And street fighter 4   But they can't leave it at that, they have to hate on literally every other fighting game too..   But also all the 9/11 truth  vids I've seen have echoed this point. Freefall was only for 2.25 seconds etc.    Hey I'm not defending the NIST report that thing was a mess    ive been harassed by cops my entire life. never met an isis member.   yea, that was the government. which the TPP will restrict the powers of..   The observed descent time of the upper 18 stories of the north face of WTC 7 (the floors clearly visible in the video evidence) was 40 percent greater than the computed free fall time. A more detailed analysis of the descent of the north face found three stages: (1) a slow descent with acceleration less than that of gravity that corresponded to the buckling of the exterior columns at the lower floors, (2) a freefall descent over approximately eight stories at gravitational acceleration for approximately 2.25 s, and (3) a decreasing acceleration as the north face encountered resistance from the structure below.    Even though the lower undamaged structure was designed to be able to handle the upper damaged 18 stories, this is only true in a static sense. Once the loads became dynamic (due to gravity), the dynamic loads had already far exceeded the structural design limit and the failure had to propagate until all the energy is dissipated.  This is true for nearly every structure in existence, and certainly true for every skyscraper: once progressive collapse begins, it can't be stopped because the supporting structure below cannot handle the many multiplications of the load it was designed to support.    they were nationalist socialists.. its pretty damn obvious. modern socialists just hate it when you reference them..  just ask Bernie sanders.. AMERICAN JOBS ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT. WE MUST PROTECT THE WORKERS IN THE HOMELAND.   you forgot street fighter 4, street fighter 4 unlimited edition ,street fighter 4 alpha, street fighter 4 beta..   a Canadian admits theyre basically Americans    because it tastes awful?   yea the stock market is rising high on printed new money   wish they had wrote TRADES instead of tades lol  also this 2.5 million figure is about 147,500 million off the 15 billion op CITES..   treason? so the state is a righteous figure we should be defending now?   I had huge faith in him legalizing online poker and ive been severely disappointed hah   interesting, ill send them an e-mail   this sub likes one game and one game only   Syria and Libya were also destabilized by the West    /r/postnationalist    /r/postnationalist  supports all humans!   anyone looking for a political guest to talk about immigration and immigrant rights in the modern world?? im your guy. and i have a big social media reach, so we will help each other!   ok , deleted   /r/911truth   ISIS! You mean the group that rose to power because of American wars?    If you figure out the meaning of life please do tell    good post   "do no evil" except in service of the US government    Hilarious. So many fools think the world's second biggest economy collapsing wouldn't affect them    Ya he was innocent the day of his murder    Well I posted it in blackfellas because they are the biggest victim of police brutality.. But I admit I tend to be racebaity    I'll stop    Because nationalism    Fuck German Internet Regulation    I left ages ago to a place with less police harassment - China    China? Whose immense growth has driven a global economic boom and have seen steady wage increases for 30 years..   Thank god for trade.    I've been disappointed by so many blogs on 9/11, especially watching gage on cspan keep talking about freefall when freefall was clear only for 2 seconds in wtc 7. Please keep posts on 9/11 truth to we'll researched factual information, or we cannot be taken seriously.    Ya i dunno much about the thermite in the samples, that seems pretty legit, and I doubt the samples are tampered with, I'm just saying that the process was not very scientific and I'm tired of getting excited for 9/11 truth only to find out the blog I'm reading doesn't bother checking their stuff    http://np.reddit.com/r/AskEngineers/comments/33tl74/how_did_the_wtc_north_tower_top_section_fall_and/   Seriously? Your argument is that I'm mossad? Don't make me dig up that /r/askengineers thread where they debunk every point /u/lookingfortruths makes..   We both want to find the truth behind 9/11, I'm just a bit sticker on research apparently..    /r/Meditation    She wanted you to fuck her but instead you bored her    I'm just trying to show police racism    http://i.imgur.com/GO4StoL.jpg   "satire" subs turn into the real thing anyway just check /r/MURIKA (actually don't)   I had my posts about racism on Asians removed today from srsdiscussion (and banned) because I had previously submitted a highly upvotes profreespeech post.. Sigh  Safe spaces are just an excusev   Reddit srs cancer spreading across the net    Ya Germany is damn fascist about the Internet    America is very puritan    Ah finally he took a stand on it    You mean American companies.. And they already do.    Tesla is a huge beneficiary of government funds and subsidies and they are a fucking luxury auto brand goddamnit    The TPP let's companies sue the government for harmful regulations. In fact I saw the Guardian arguing it will let companies sue it the state seizes them..   Seems fair    Also. Why come up with a tax like this.. Political suicide..   Same shit, different fascists    When did you realize it was just a dream though? Did you regret it?   If she's not fucking you she's not your gf    Funny how he asks for Syrian and Libyan wars and voila.. Here we are.   /r/governmentoppression   They literally measure survival rates in 5 year spans. So even if you survive the cancer 70% with chemo.. That's only for 5 years. Meanwhile your brain is fried    You had me until "tastes better" hah    At least Jeb supports immigration reform! And fuck this article for attacking NAFTA by saying "day terk mah jobs"    Yep. The  basic income folks rarely support basic income for people in Africa or Asia.    It's /r/conspiracy you have to sort the wheat from the chaff somehow!    And /r/movies didn't even hate on American sniper.. Sad    /r/titlegore    The government won't prosecute itself seriously we must do it.    Everything is a false flag here, including the FPH drama lol. the TPP will bring our world closer together.   Even /u/mylespower couldn't explain this except as some jet fuel / elevators dropping.    How can you call it a peer reviewed study when it was published in an online journal using years old dust people stored in their homes etc?   I just wish they had better samples etc. Too bad the government didn't bother running a proper investigation..    Dunno it seems to me like this forum has "shut our ears" a bit on the 9/11 issue. I see a ton of convincing evidence that a) only partial freefall and b) the towers collapsed from the fires   /r/askengineers had a ton of responses to all the 9/12 physics questions.. Too bad I am not qualified to judge who is right.   That said.. It was just too perfect. inside job!     /r/yellowperil    yep. its not really going to be in your favor as a man, especially if you are a bit rusty from being married/dating for so long~  but in the end men and women end up having sex with each other , so , be handsome, dont be not handsome~   isnt sexual attraction // fetishes etc based on our experiences? like we can almost decide it ourselves by experimenting etc?  i guess gay people disprove this but..    Ya Chinese bans on Google products make more sense now.. (although still mostly protectionism)   YOU HATE MEXICANS NOW?? TIME FOR BEN   SRS themed game:  CENSOR THE EVIL REDDITOR BEFORE HE CORRUPTS THE CHILDREN   yea. i got driven here by SRS censorship when I tried posting in SRSdiscussion about racism against asians..   never bothered to check out this sub before, but hey, since im an official enemy why not?   i never checked out this sub before, but SRS censorship drove me here. i was literally posting about racism against asians and they still censored me. not a surprise given theyre all white liberals but still..  anyway it would be easy to ban links to voat, just call it a hate-site or whatever the fuck   /r/yellowperil for an SRS themed asian issues sub   the good posts I make about asian POC issues get deleted.. is it any wonder why i tend to err on the side of free speech?  i literally waited all night to post that because of the submitting limits. sigh.    the good posts I make about asian POC issues get deleted.. is it any wonder why i tend to err on the side of free speech?  i literally waited all night to post that because of the submitting limits. sigh.    ok fair enough. i am mad about getting banned. but i thought this was a great issue and a great place to discuss it. and then, banhammer.   well after they removed my last post addressing issues POC face, i messaged them. they warned me to be careful et al, so i was super careful, submitted again. removed and banned.  sigh. making this post probably wont help me get unbanned, but, im a huge defender of POC on reddit ..  wish they would see that and stop getting in the way..   nope, no explanation. and id talked to the mods in PM  a month back so it really came out of the blue when I get banned after submitting a good discussion about hollywood whitewashing..   fuck /u/sappercon and their police apoligism   /r/Bad_Cop_No_Donut/   oh, yet another website that has the only reason for the TTIP being bad is DEY TERK ERR JERBS  oh wait, this time its **THE MEAN COMPANIES WILL SUE IF WE PRIVATIZE THEM..**       journaling?   /u/redditors_are_racist   take note , POC, srs doesnt give a shit about you   /r/yellowperil     meditate !! lets goooo! /r/meditation ~    this should be right up their alley.. i guess SRS just dont care about asian people   found the same materials? apparently the material they tested was stored in private homes for years and years.. hardly scientific   28 pages more!   the TPP is a free trade agreement that reduces American government power, so for some reason /r/conspiracy is against it 0_o   you know when they claim deals are JOB KILLERS waht they really mean is "WAAH WE WANT MORE LABOR PROTECTIONISM"   interesting, should add that to the NIST report~   well thats awfully nice of all the engineers to participate!  frankly im afraid that 911 truth is going to have to accept that jet fuel can indeed melt wtc towers and stick to the saudi/cia/mossad part of the conspiracy  dunno tho im just another random on the internet   /u/mylespower   yea and i hate to detract from any mixed race kids who look identical to white barbies and their struggle but..   I think it's Hollywood being business as usual.   /r/yellowperil   But how to do the technique lol    Ya that's the amazing part. It takes all that mental struggle out of the equation    ups   Heh let's hate because they're not capcom   FGC represent    /r/postnationalist    good headline~   tagazoo.over-blog.com/article-capcom-boy-45541988.html   thats rude. i already stopped x-posting here anyway! /r/postnationalist has 3000 subs im not gonna abandon it to mess with /r/evex lol   yea even stuff like walking meditation or whatever seems really helpful  frankly i tihnk sports/long distance running etc probably classifies as some form of meditaiton   I think NRS is learning from capcom here, they've already started funding a proleague    haha i mean what else can u do, shes white as an irish ghost in canada   western people dont really do mantra meditation i think, but it sounds interesting.. the breath is so abstract and easy to lose focus    canada is a joke as far as pharms are concerned  let us buy what we want    yea it would have been easy to be full bar all tournament if you were really gonna cheat..   i have to agree that bitcoins best use case appears to be for off-the-grid transactions   yea, watching the chinese factory workers.. i mean im glad they have a job.. but.. id kill myself probably   yea i think MC is doing fine, frankly its a good time to quit.. better than go out like Flash has :(   FLASH COME BACK TO BW   thats why i try not to get bogged down in specific political ideologies   as if /r/china cares about chinese muslims thats a fucking joke   As I'm a visible minority    Honestly same stuff scares me in China    im sure they will cry hypocritically    maybe /r/starcraft can learn that protectionist legislation actually does hurt people too   yea, currently at 150 less viewers than sleepfighter.. dedgame  http://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Ultra%20Street%20Fighter%20IV   except maybe during some huge events MKX has never had less streamers than SleepFighter  and anyone watching the SFV knows, they didnt speed up shit.   Plus I used a few already..   But at least we protected the status quo!    I thought you fools didn't watch mkx?   this sub refused to let me link to their stream ... Pure self fulfilling prophecy..   OK mom   	198

Nearly everyone else who died during it has come back so we can hope and pray for the return of Nova Prime   Think you would really like the whole marvel cosmic run by Abnett and lanning. It starts with annihilation and goes up to the thanos imperative. It features the guardians of the galaxy and that run is the basis of the film apparently, also nova, Quasar, silver surfer and galactus plus more of marvels heavy cosmic hitters. It is excellent. There is a post that has the reading list, I'll try and see if I can find it.  As also mentioned Silver Surfer Requiem is brilliant. Also Thor god of Thunder is absolutely superb, brilliant story and stunning artwork   Nova the Richard Rider version because he is the greatest hero of all time and silver surfer for marvel. For DC I would go with Flash and Martian Manhunter   In the marvel comics done by Abnett and lanning, the fault is a giant tear in time and space that is caused by the t-bomb set off by Black Bolt who is leading the inhumans and the kree during the war against Vulcan who leads the Shi'ar. This is then what allows the cancerverse into our universe. It also causes the marvel universe to lose it greatest hero. RICH RIDER REPRESENT!!!!

Still love it to this day   Felt completely disconnected from the world, things I loved like sport, my friends, videos games, movies etc didn't matter. Hated myself more than i usually did and felt suicidal, not god I wish I was dead but I went and bought rope and was getting everything ready for when I did it. Told my friend and she pretty much went off on me for keeping it a secret and not telling anyone, told me she would be there for me and help out and convinced me to go to the doctors. Was on tablets for about a year and have been off them for about 5 months now and feel like a new man. Still feel shit somedays but it's a hell of a difference to what I was like.   Dad's an alcoholic who used to beat me so never really wanted to continue in his path.

Thanks :)   Thanks so much, buddy!   I just learned of this recently in my high school history class. At the Battle of the Granicus, Alexander the Great was about to be killed by Spithridates, a satrap, from behind. As his arm was striking, Cleitus the Black severed his arm just before he could deal the finishing blow. Cleitus the Black was a commanding officer of Alexander. I did a project on the battle. It was really like out of a movie. What's ironic is, later in Alexander the Great's conquest, he killed Cleitus in a drunken quarrel.   She's streets ahead if you ask me.   Thanks!

 I'll have to look for Ripper Street.   I highly doubt it would be able to get a lucky shot. Modern tanks move and engage way too quickly. Even if a WW2 tank was lucky enough to surprise a modern battle tank it would not be able to fire quickly enough to engage. And no WW2 tank could take even a glancing blow from a modern 120mm.

 "Billy Joe Rowe, who has no criminal record, denied downloading child porn.  I never admitted to nothing, he told Target 8"   lol. I think I am still stuck on color awareness after yesterday.   No. look it up.  Edit: oh here: http://www.dcclothesline.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/swastika-coronado-2015.jpg   Plus she is wearing all matchy colors so it sort of falls into the background behind said Cleavage.    So this makes me curious about that Other Rasputin   how he died. So I look it up   it seems that Rasputin's killers were having an off day also. http://history1900s.about.com/od/famouscrimesscandals/a/rasputin.htm   yea that really surprised me seeing those two little sections.   I suppose IF in fact the statements are false he could. That is a big IF though.  Also IDK if there is a warrant for the arrest of an adult is that considered open to public knowledge? I would think so; I'm not a lawyer though.  Edit many hours later, fyi:  ( yea from wiki:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_defamation_law) "Defamation law in modern practice: Defamation law in the United States is much less plaintiff-friendly than its counterparts in European and the Commonwealth countries, due to the enforcement of the First Amendment"....etc bla bla...   "One defense is reporting or passing through information as a general information or warning of dangerous or emergent conditions, and intent to defame must be proven. Also, the truth of the allegedly defamatory statement will always negate the claim (whether because the plaintiff fails to meet his/her burden of proving falsity or because the defendant proves the statement to be true).[11]"  so you see? the burden of proof of innocence often appears to fall upon the plaintiff in these cases.    "Libel is a method of defamation expressed by print, writing, pictures, signs, effigies, or any communication embodied in physical form that is injurious to a person's reputation, exposes a person to public hatred, contempt or ridicule, or injures a person in his/her business or profession." fromhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/libel  I want to be real clear here that I am in no way standing up for a pedos nor anyone else's right to harm children. Nor am I presuming the perhaps defamed, originally accused (Joe if u lost track) man to be guilty.        yea they have a kind of old school sound. lol def not electro-pop.   I like 'em. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGlZyLsogwU  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zEiM6l5meQI  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Punk_Syndrome     I feel like I should post the clapping guy meme..oh hell this was a big deal for the earth, we need a lot of em.  http://weknowmemes.com/2012/09/20-best-clapping-gifs/   They claim to have found after taking the computer from the Joe guys brother, and taking this brother's word that Joe was the one that down loaded it?  Then waiting 6 years before looking at the evidence on the computer??  I think there is room for doubt, due to the inept handling of this case from start to the current state of affairs which I hope is not the end.   yes stunning isn't it? It's just morally incomprehensible. And not just the policing side, the DA side of things smells so bad I rather think a higher level of investigation on this entire fiasco should be conducted.   Idk if we need boots really as much as robos to build things like weapons systems and mining ops.   The entire story seems a fiasco! They seized Joe's computer based on his brother's say so? then...  "For nearly six years, nothing happened. Its not clear why, but perhaps because the original detective retired in 2007.  The computer sat at the state police Computer Crimes Unit in Lansing without being forensically examined. A note in the file in 2007 shows state police couldnt find the search warrant or consent form to search it. By 2008, records show, state police were considering destroying the evidence after a review of the complaint showed issues over burden of proof" "  So for 6 years this accused pedo was allowed free reign!!! (on his upgraded computer no doubt). Outrageous.  The arresting the wrong guy part is the least of it almost, though I have to ask, if they thought  Dean was the man, they (thankfully as it turned out) allowed him to remain in a home with 4 children?    ok brain is broken now, too much lack of logic for me in this story.   Billy Dean Rowe being the one falsely accused.  Though who the hell knows, maybe they both are innocent. Seems everything else was majorly botched, so I can't put a lot of stock in the supposed confession that the Billy Joe guy is purported to have made. This is one messed up story.

Well you know the whole Russian attitude toward homosexuality   all that:)   When certain substances such as corticosteroids   opioids are introduced exogenously I believe the body decreases endogenous production in response over the course of time.

It seems to sometimes spur others on to make improvements in their own world (I am thinking specifically of one young man that died of an overdose; not long after at least one of his good friends went sober, so yay to that).

I added the 'short description' as a commement as it isn't all that short.  Help please, oh bot of wonder?? pretty please?   Hi sorry if I have submitted wrong (hope not!)    The original film dates from 1938, this version was released in 1942.  Film plot courtesy http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Br... Miss Carol (Diana Durrell) is an idealistic teacher in a remote one-room schoolhouse. A native of the Ozarks herself, she is determined to stop the practice of child marriage, in which older men marry teen or preteen girls. Her campaign raises the ire of some local men, led by Jake Bolby, who drag her into the woods one night with the intention of tarring and feathering her. Before they can do this, however, Angelo the dwarf and Mr. Colton arrive with a shotgun to save the day.  Following this, Jake Bolby comes across young Jennie Colton swimming naked. When her father dies, Bolby decides to take advantage of the opportunity to blackmail her mother into letting him marry the girl, threatening that otherwise he will see her hanged for murder. After he "courts" Jennie by giving her a doll, the two are married. It later turns out that this ceremony was illegal, as child marriage had been banned several days prior, but this point quickly becomes moot. Before Bolby can consummate the union, he is gunned down by Angelo. Jennie leaves his house with Freddie, and the movie ends.      we may need a new sub, something like trashy home decor maybe.   my apologies. I just found it so crazy interesting, and quite morbid to boot.   I really had doubts on the posting, and I thank you for your help in modding this wonderful sub.  cheers!   I have lost a couple of friends that I played with on a mmorpg.  It felt similar to losing rl friends:(   I met the mother of a player ( I did not know that young man, but recognized his name when she used it as her email), and I felt such an immediate connection to her   to her loss, I think more so than had I not realized he was a player on that game.   Internet mourning is a real thing.  Thank you for the reply, I was rather curious as to the question myself:)    curious as to why you are asking.   I think that the sort of 'magical thinking' of childhood extends a bit longer than most seem to believe.      That there is some sort of argument within the minds of semi-grown children as to whether "I wished my friend would die because I was mad, and she did, so it must be my fault' vs. " No that can't be correct, I didn't really want her to die   didn't hit her with that car".   Just seems the magical thinking continuing must have some sort of contributing factors, be those drugs, isolation, wacko parents, idk.  ok just speculating here, pardon me.   Was there a note or something that indicated why he choose this route? He really seems like an amazing kid.   I don't even know where else to put this, yes it is a bit long(60min) but includes every manner of morbid crazyness including tarring   feathering, alcoholic man beating wife, child marraige , etc.   It is billed as an educational documentary, but more like a social guidance film perhaps.      Why would  Gd even need to have an assigned sex?     nothing really to do with this, but I once was made to check a small set of deer antlers as they were a 'potential weapon'.

In defense of all us parent types that date back to the pre-text era this is a very hard habit to break!  I don't think I really want us to stop though, do you?   It really is a heartbreak.

Thomas wrote a letter to the editor of the Lexington Dispatch (North Carolina) thats just gloriously weird. It begins like this: God states that seven kings must come before the rise of the Antichrist. Revelations 17:10 says the seventh king will reign for a short amount of time. Is Barack Obama the seventh king? I guess when the article ran, though, the headline said something like Is Obama the Antichrist? Which caused the editors to have to correct their mistake in an even more memorable way:  *[here they duplicate the Correction as printed in the Dispatch, it made me chuckle] So the headline is now accurate on the website. Even though the letter itself, which is the real problem, will never see a correction. Because Murica.'      I'm just leaving this here by way of comparison I suppose. It's from the '60s.

Actually you look like a kid with a liver disease or something.   idk. I was fairly new there. It was a time when HIV was rather mysterious. I hope that person was/is alright with the accident of it all.   arg ok I am adding this from wiki:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Bell#Life_after_prison Conviction[edit] On 17 December 1968, at Newcastle Assizes, Norma Bell was acquitted but Mary Bell was convicted of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, the jury taking their lead from her diagnosis by court-appointed psychiatrists who described her as displaying "classic symptoms of psychopathy". The judge, Mr. Justice Cusack, described her as dangerous and said she posed a "very grave risk to other children". She was sentenced to be detained at Her Majesty's pleasure, effectively an indefinite sentence of imprisonment. She was initially sent to Red Bank secure unit in St. Helens, Lancashire  the same facility that would house Jon Venables, one of James Bulger's child killers, 25 years later.[1]  After her conviction, Bell was the focus of a great deal of attention from the British press and also from the German Stern magazine. Her mother repeatedly sold stories about her to the press and often gave reporters writings she claimed to be by her daughter. Bell herself made headlines when, in September 1977, she briefly absconded from Moor Court open prison, where she had been held since her transfer from a young offenders institution to an adult prison a year earlier. Her penalty for this was a loss of prison privileges for 28 days.[6]  For a time, Bell also lived in a girls' remand home at Cumberlow Lodge in South Norwood (in a house built by Victorian inventor William Stanley).[7][8]  Life after prison[edit] In 1980, Bell, aged 23, was released from Askham Grange open prison, having served 12 years, and was granted anonymity (including a new name) allowing her to start a new life. Four years later she had a daughter, born on 25 May 1984; Bell's daughter did not know of her mother's past until Bell's location was discovered by reporters in 1998 and she and her mother had to leave their house with bed sheets over their heads.  Bell's daughter's anonymity was originally protected only until she reached the age of 18. However, on 21 May 2003, Bell won a High Court battle to have her own anonymity and that of her daughter extended for life. Any court order permanently protecting the identity of a convict in Britain is consequently sometimes known as a "Mary Bell order."  In 2009, it was reported that Bell had become a grandmother   hmm. I tend to want to err on the side of the child.  I know there seem to be some that are born lacking the capacity to be empathetic.  I still hope that as a society we will take measures to ascertain the possible source of such horrifying behavior, and to remedy whatever may have been behind the fury   lack of control.  re the Mary Bell  case: http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1968/dec/18/ukcrime.childprotection   "Dr Westbury's inquiries indicated that the matter was the responsibility of the health department of the Ministry of Social Security said the judge. But the department "require time to consider what they are to do and no specific time is indicated."  He continued: "It is an appalling thing that with a child as young as this one, one has to take into consideration such matters. I am not entirely unsympathetic but anxious as I am to do everything for her benefit, my primary duty is to protect other people.  "There is a very grave risk to other children if she is not closely watched and every conceivable step taken to see that she doesn't do again what she has been found guilty of. In the case of a child of this age, no question of imprisonment arises. I have power to order a sentence of detention and it seems to me that no other method of dealing with her in the circumstances is suitable."  Life detention, he said, did not mean that the person concerned was kept in custody indefinitely or for the rest of their natural lives. The position could be considered form time to time."   Adding this, just started watching but it seems ok: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moFhGzE_xRI  The Mary Bell Case   I once worked in a children's home/hospital. We had a young girl that was HIV positive (this was back in the mid '80's).  Everyone was very happy for her when she made her first communion (yes it was a Catholic place.). Someone bought her a pin to commemorate the occasion, and while pinning it on the girl inadvertently poked her skin.  This resulted in an infection which overcame her,   she died soon thereafter.  =(   true story.   Mother of girl accused of murder speaks out: 'My heart is broken, that's all I can say' Zuri Whitehead, age two months, was found with blunt force injuries on her head, neck, arms, legs and torso Mother Trina Whitehead says she always thought 11-year-old who allegedly killed her baby was a 'sweet girl' Accused killer is daughter of her best friend   http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2949362/Coroner-Ohio-infant-died-blunt-impacts-head-body.html      I was randomly wondering about this last night as well. Mostly about the tomatoes.    ok hold on.

    What's with all the MIRs? I know what they are, that's not what I'm asking. Why does everything have a MIR right now? It isn't a holiday or anything.    Valve may have had custom parts that slightly differ from all the stock counter-parts. But I do agree. If a non-glorious non-peasant who wants to join PC just googles these things, sees the most expensive model available, then when they get the device it preforms like shit.     The fucking end all is 10x cheaper that those pieces of shit. an i3 for $1000+ dollars! WHAT!!   You're now chatting with a random stranger. Say hi!  You both like Dank memes.  You: WOAH  You: Dank memes!  Stranger: OMG  You: I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN  You: This is great  Stranger: It's rare to find a professional memer on this site *Tips Fedora*  You: Very rae  You: *rare  You: most of the time the conversations are Stranger: M OR F You: M Stranger leaves  Stranger: I had a conversation that was litteraly this  You: Same  You: So, /r/abcqwerty123?

Stranger: A meme is a meme XDXDXDXDXDXD  Stranger has disconnected.   Watch cory of course. The anime takes a completely different path from the mango. Don't worry   Yes! When I was a kid this game was the shit! By that I mean it was shit. I knew it was then. I was a HUGE Sonic fan. I loved the 2D games this was my first 3D "Sonic" game and I realized the 2D ones were so much more fun. Shadow was so mean I didn't like him. I wanted my nice happy hedgehog back :(   Yep   \V/   180,000   My SM is around 180000   Thanks!   Right now I have a halberd and that knight guy's lightning sword. I also have found the secret you mentioned but thanks!   I've done the bird thing. I can't beat it. I've gone to Heide's Tower. Can't beat it   I know where it is and I have visited it multiple times but I cannot get through it. I was hoping someone could join my game and help me.   Don't even list it. On valves website at the very bottom in tiny text there is a number that happens to be the app number so if you insert it it takes you the HL3 page...   The Pursuer and The Last Giant.   I need a little help. I'm not to good although I have beat the first two bosses but now I can't progress. I don't know what to do. Can anyone help?   I am not too good and DS. I need help with Heides Castle. If you would like to help PM me. Thanks! :)   I'm US/Canada Central Standard   I will and I do have a mic. My PS3 is in another room so I won't be checking this anymore ok?   In forest of fallen giants where that weird trader with all the crap on her back is. How will we meet up though? Will you place one of the call sign things?   Yeah   Yeah...   I don't think I've beat any. xD   I don't really know how to judge how far I am.   MoonChap and 14690 (I started a few days ago)   It doesn't seem like to many people play PS3. Anyone want to play?   I do have a mic and would love to chat sometime. I'll try to add you.

I do have steam if we could chat over that so I could learn how to play the game that would be great.   Same god? What do you mean?   Soul Memory Range? (sorry I know nothing, thanks for helping)   So if I wanted to play with someone, I would just have to wait around?   Any way I can invite someone or get someone to come help me?   How do I find a summon sign?   Second Boss?! Who the hell is the first boss?!   I know and I have been there and got pretty damn far until I'm in a city like place with shittons of blood stains and messages saying stuff like "Bravery Required Ahear" and "Don't fight alone" I wen't up a ladder and there is some crazy ass armored dude flying across the screen so I ran away so I didn't die.   I am new to DS as a series and started with Dark Souls 2. How do I get to play with someone? There are some enemies I can't beat without help.   Okay, so I'm definitely going Polaroid   Need help making a decision on a VERY interesting run. I started as Azazel now i have gilitine, holy water, holy mantle, revenge fly, that floating spider spawner thingey, and all together six maximum heart containers. I just killed mom. Do I go Negative or Polaroid?   http://steamcommunity.com/id/train_subject1909 Waking Mars Superbrothers Fractal   Shiny The Firefly please. http://steamcommunity.com/id/train_subject1909   Shiny The Firefly please. http://steamcommunity.com/id/train_subject1909   I REALLY need parts. Unfortunately they cost lots of money which I don't have. I have only upgraded my PC once. At the moment I have a Core 2 Duo, 1TB HDD (The only good bit) 4GB of memory, whatever the heck intel mobo that the pc came with, and Intel G41 Express Chipset. It can't run anything at more than 30 FPS. I never have had a good PC but I don't use consoles solely because I lack the money to buy the console or games, and they're awful. I have started a fund so any money I don't need goes in. Currently it is $25. I would cry tears of joy if I could win this card to help me ascend a little higher up. Thank You for reading OP. If you want to steam message me just PM me and I will tell you details.   This would have been a good post if you didn't use the term "gamer-girl" This makes it sound like you think you will get likes because you are a girl. If you just titled it "First PC Build to Ascend from Consoles" it would be a lot less annoying. Also, we can see your fingernails. We can tell you are a girl.   Okay, I don't really know what I was expecting. Thanks for the response.      So, I'm making a build. I have no money. There is no way on earth I can afford to buy it all at once. My PC ATM is really awful. (Intel Core 2 Duo E7400 @ 2.80GHz, Intel G41 Express Chipset, 4.00GB Dual-Channel DDR2, Intel Corporation DG41RQ) and I am going to make an upgrade... eventually. I am going to buy the parts one by one and slowly replace my pc. (Like that boat paradox, if you know what I'm talking about) I want to buy parts that can replace my parts now until I have replaced every part. Can you guys help me pick really cheap parts that are usable and that could fit in my pc now?   Sincerely, someone whos pc is still better than a console but still is shit, Michael...   pm me?      Think about what you are doing. There are starving peasants in Africa that can't get a pc because amazon and new egg don't ship to Africa and you are talking like what you have is bad. Shame on you. (btw when you upgrade can you give me parts?)   I'm pretty sure that's my best buy o.0   Throw away that shit mod brother. I too have an awful computer. This is the mod that lets me play this great game. http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/15123/?   For those who don't know the three dollar bill gives you the rainbow tears. Do you guys love it or hate it. With this item there isn't really an in between. I believe the item is great if you git it at the beginning of a run. From Middle/End, it is unpredictable and will probably get you killed eventually.   It takes me at most 2 hours. If Portal took you 5 hours Portal 2 will take you 10.      My favorite doctor is the newest, Peter Capaldi. He just came on the scene and I am already in love with him. His character is more dark and powerful than the other doctors, so you never know what he is going to do. Claras character perfectly compliments his, always keeping him in check and often taking matters into her own hands. The writing this season has been a little chiche but is still great. Capaldi is making Doctor Who better no matter what the 9 year old girls say who hate him because he is old.   [Request] [Steam] Shovel Knight http://store.steampowered.com/app/250760/ Steam Account http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198064569913/  I've been wanting Shovel Knight for a while, but whenever I had the money, it wasn't on sale so I bought something else that was cheaper so I could get more bang for my buck. Now it is on sale and I don't have the money .      books. People are making unofficial minecraft books. Go to walmart and you can find a ton of them. It is pretty awful how many there are.       Wanna all join the fun maps server?   In a few years. Everyone will play on the NerdCubed fan servers. There will be a documentary about our accomplishments. And the stars of it? Captain_Cone, Hendlton, train_subject1909, Divexz, and account-temp. (Probably not account-temp. His name isn't classy enough)   Yes! PM each other our steam names?   TF2 is still really popular, yet I haven't seen one person on the servers in a long time.   I believe I am practicing patience. Three years of patience and peasantry.    I even picked out the whole build. It was steal crap but we don't have money.  How many years until I can join the glorious master race.   The college kids get a free scholarship and books and tons of other stuff.  It's unfair that someone gets a scholarship for throwing a ball when they don't care about education at all. While intelligent children are going to low quality community colleges.      I haven't had the money to spend on games but now I do. Should I wait until it goes on a bigger sale or get in now?     	72

       At this point there isn't. But... he certainly had plenty of warning.    Yeah, he'd have to write those books in like 6 months a piece at this point.          Even if Martin put out Winds of Winter this year, he'd have to write the final book like 1.5 years to have it out before the start of the last GOT season. Was never going to happen.       Not your fault, like 500 people on Twitter and facebook reposted this obit yesterday   He's one of the best ever. We had a thread on him and recommendations recently:   http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/2zd02t/a_readers_guide_to_italo_calvino/   He died in 2013...               There's really no answer here. Even if we restrict ourselves to famous, canonical works, some great novels were written in a few weeks, some in a year, and others over the course of a decade.   As for length, similarly the range goes from as short as a novel can be without being a novella or story (30k maybe?) to over a million words.   Takes what it takes.    Yeah, sadly the problem isn't that there aren't venues that highlight unknown writers, it's that readers don't care about about reading them.                       Freeman served as editor for Tales of Two Cities: The Best and Worst of Times in Todays New York, released by OR Books.  The anthology includes fiction and nonfiction from David Byrne, Teju Cole, Junot Daz, Victor LaValle, Ta Obreht, Edmund White and many others  Good line up. I remember David Byrne from the Talking Heads saying NYC was dying because of this a few years ago.                The Kelly Link, George Saunders, and Ray Bradbury are three of my favorites ever            That's technically a humor piece (shouts   murmors column) not a short story from the fiction section.   That said, Simon Rich is great and the New Yorker publishes a HUGE variety of fiction.     These books seem a lot like they're rejecting the notion that a monarch actually has the power to affect the quality of people's lives like that.  Really? I dunno if the books will end that way, but I think the books make it clear that the "game of thrones the high lords play" has a HUGE impact on the smallfolk. In the books, they people in the riverlands are completely devastated by their rulers and their wars.   And in the World of Ice and Fire, the chapters on the "good" kings seem to imply that the good ones can help the entire realm.    It seems to me like the Iron Throne in general is a red herring. Something for the powerful to squabble over while the really important stuff gets ignored and the real threats remain unchecked   This is totally true! FWIW, I wasn't saying that Martin would say Jon or Dany saved the realm and everyone lived happily ever after with no problems. Just that he could write the ending in a way to indicate that the king/queen at the end of the book rules for more than a year or two.   Either way, if there is a final clear king I do not think that Martin would make that horribly significant in the way you are disagreeing with. What's significant will be the battle between humanity (and dragons?) and the white walkers. Whoever is left ruling will have a broken realm where almost every sub-kingdom has been ravaged by war or white walkers.    I hope note, because I love how ASOIAF shatters most of the traditional fantasy cliches, but the beautiful rightful heir who has been cast into exile comes back to save the land and rule peacefully is one I hope they subvert in some way.    Here's the kind of ending I imagine:  FAegon starts another war, but dies when Dany conquers KL with dragons. White Walkers bring down wall and invade the land. She heads up to fight them. She dies in the battle (Jon has to sacrifice her to make lightbringer?). Bran does something important that seals it so the White Walkers won't return, at least not for a looooong time.  Westeros is saved, but only after half the armies of the land have been killed in the various wars. Sansa rebuilds Winterfel. Tyrion comes back to Casterly Rock, but finds he hates living there. Jon is made king, but kind of hates ruling... still he does it and the realm is peaceful. Everything is in ruins and everyone is kinda miserable, but, so be it. The end.    Well, there can be a clear ending with the story of the White Walkers/winter coming to destroy Westeros, and also a clear ending to Dany and her dragons wanting to come back home. (related: a clear ending to the various prophecies). Probably also a clear ending to the battle for the iron throne. The books could tell us that Jon or Dany or whoever is crowned and then reigns peacefully for a generation.    People talk a lot about who 'ends up' on the Iron Throne but really what difference does it make that they're on it when the series ends? If we've learned anything it's that they could be off it within a year!   But Martin could easily just wrote an epilogue set in the future showing some king lasts a long time, or simply tell us that happens in the last paragraph (or, more likely, sets up the ending to have the major baddies and "players" we know of killed so that we assume the new king will last)  Also, if you read The World of Ice and Fire, plenty of Targ kings lasted for decades. It's only recently that every king keeps dying quickly.    As long as Aegon is fake, which he is, he probably won't do all that much in the books. He'll gain some temporary power and start a war in the south--get Dorne involved maybe. But then he'll be killed when Dany comes over.   Very easy to cut his whole storyline for the show. No reason to do a TrystAegon.    An Asian prize sounds good! But it's weird to attack the Pulitzer for here. The Pulitzer is for American writers. It's a national prize, it isn't meant to cover the world     We really do seem to be in an era where the story serial -- be it books or TV -- is the major, preferred form of cultural expression. I wonder why that is? Any guesses?  $$$  We aren't just in the age of the story serial, we are also in the age of the reboot. Both of those things are about cash. People in general really fall for famous properties and so the best way to make money is to keep doing the same property over and over--Ghostbusters, Sherlock Holmes, Marvel superheros, Middle earth, Harry Potter (Rowling is writing three new films in that universe, right?), etc.   If a book or movie is working, keep making sequels until it starts failing. Then reboot it a couple years later.     Brilliant writers users knew who worked their asses off and got nowhere.  Honestly, I don't think this is as common today as before for a pretty simple reason: there are 100 times as many magazines and presses out there.   In the past, if you didn't have stories that, for whatever reason, got picked up by the handful of magazines or your work didnt' get bought by the handful of literary presses, you couldn't ever get readers. But today you have far more options, not just with actual lit mags, but also with self-publishing, or publishing on tumblr, etc.      Agreed. I know it's easy to say "it's all the same MFA lit shit!" but... do people REALLY think that George Saunders, Karen Russell, Kelly Link, Ben Marcus, Sam Lipsyte, Chang-Rae Lee, David Foster Wallace, (this list could go on forever) actually write really similar work?  Because all those writers either went to an MFA or teach at one, and all were published in the top lit mags and anthologized in the big anthologies.                   I don't believe for a single second that the board cared about his article. They were reacting to the negative press that his post generated. If no one online had gotten mad and turned it into the viral literary story of the week, nothing would have happened.    He is paid to help people who want to pay him. He didnt do that in his essay   He was no longer paid to do that. His essay was post his job, he was paid to write an essay people would read.   Look I can understand the idea that a teacher should never--even anonymously and generally--talk badly about former students. I think I'd even agree with that. But it's a tacky thing to do, not a horrible violation that should cause him to be hunted down.    UNESCO sees it.  I don't think UNESCO did anything? His board quit and he decided to suspend the campaign.   As for everyone seeing it, check out this NY Times article on how the internet bandwagon picks targets over one stupid tweet or post and ruins their careers:   http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0   I was thinking more of Sag Harbor, which is his most famous book I think. But even more evidence that he has moved around genres if his first are postmodern.    Well... maybe. Who knows how long it took him to get book 1 finished, and then I believe he had a lot of material that he removed from book 1 and used in 2. Then there were big gaps between 3 and 4, and between 4 and 5      I agree with you, BUT fantasy is always flexible as a metaphor. There are dozens of articles online about how the "high lords" destroying the country without caring about the small folk is like our current wealth inequality era, or how the white walkers can represent climate change (the great threat that we are all ignoring while focusing on smaller political battles), and so on and so forth.       I would say:   1) A lot of people in their 20s and 30s grew up on Harry Potter and Peter Jackson's LOTR films. ASOIAF/Game of Thrones was waiting to be picked up by those people.   2) Americans are really into fantasy/SF allegories for our current political and economic situation. (Hunger Games, Walking Dead, etc.)   3) There's not much competition for "gritty adult fantasy series." I'm sure a fantasy fan could point out other good books, but among popular fantasy authors whose names extend beyond the fantasy niche (Rowling, Gaiman, etc.) no one else is doing what he is doing currently.   4) HBO picked it up as a TV show. Seriously, sometimes that's all it takes to propel a book series to popularity. His books sold well before that, but have sold much better after. I'd imagine most people on /r/books didn't start the books until the HBO show was announced.   5) Martin isn't the best sentence writer but he is GREAT at plot twists and making you feel for characters of all types.       It's very common for writers to write in multiple genres I think.   For the large "types" of writing: Hemingway, Carver, and many others wrote poetry and fiction. Most fiction writers publish some non-fiction.   For genres though:   *John Banville has a very successful literary career and a successful crime career (under the name Benjamin Black.)   * JK Rowling switched from fantasy/Harry Potter to crime books (also with a pen name).  * Cormac McCarthy started out doing Southern Gothic, then did Westerns, then did a post-apocalyptic book.   * Colson Whitehead does mostly literary realism, but he wrote a successful zombie apocalypse novel.   a few off the top of my head.       Eh. Sorry, what Boudinot said was not really remarkable or even that mean. The writing world is filled with rejection, dismissal, criticism, and even outright hostility (especially if you ask people to pay a few books for your book).   I also remember his original essay saying more that there are a lot of people who don't put in the work and aren't talented who shouldn't be spending money on an MFA program. That's different than saying everyone whose work he doesn't like should stop writing.    have you read any of his books? (I haven't, but seems weird to say a guy should be "thrown away" just because you didn't like one blog post)   No publisher will touch an already published book unless it is the one-in-a-million self-published book that sold a ton of copies. Unless you are the Martian or 50 Shades of Grey or Hugh Howey or whatever (basically unless you win the lottery) self-publishing hurts your chances of having that book being picked up by a traditional publisher.   Even if it sells pretty well, the publisher will likely pick you up for you NEXT book.       Sure. If all you care about is the "plot' of something, just read the wiki article.   Books and films are experiences. Both will be unique.    Lots of programs pay for you to go, so it's a great way to get some time away from work and just focus on writing (but not a requirement)    I don't think even MFA teachers would argue you "need" an MFA. An MFA can help you improve. It can give you connections and a good group of beta readers/friends. A really good program will give you money to go there. So they can help.   But objectively speaking, tons of published writers in all genres don't have them.      It will most likely turn readers off and is overused, yes.          I'm sorry, what did he plagiarize? What is "illegal"?  Using a real life person as inspiration for a character is neither.                         I'd also say that the general idea that "literary fiction" can't sell well is just wrong. Many literary fiction titles make the NYT best seller lists each year.    Fair enough, but my point is that you can water your shit down forever in the desperate search for "more market."   Write whatever you want, but so many people on this sub have the attitude that if you aren't producing commerical fiction in established niches you are wasting your time. I think that's nonsense. Writing is still an art and there's still value in trying to do something new and to create original and challenging work.   But even more than that, if money is the goal, writing fiction is a bad way to get it. You'd probably live a happier life having a cushy job that lets you write on the side than pumping out 10 hastily written self-published books a year (advice I've seen on this sub many times).  Plus, most bland commercial work fails too. This book in question only sold 1k in hardcover in the UK? So maybe it will only sell 3-4K in the next year after it's US and paperback releases? That's still WAY more than 99.9999% of the books out there.    Actually, Shakespeare was considered the most lyrical and poetic of his peers and was NOT the most popular crowd-pleaser of his time. He lasted because he was more than just an entertainer, while so many of his peers are totally forgotten today.    Well-said. The popular "commercial" trends of the day are often watered-down versions of styles or forms that were pushed forward by the avant-garde (or in "serious" or "difficult" books) in decades past.     but you are slashing your potential market.  Is your only goal as a writer to have the biggest "market"?   If so, then writing fiction of any kind probably isn't the best bet. Try cat listicles.     The great novels of the English language where never written as Literary fiction, but as entertainment.   Sorry but this is totally a-historical.   First off, there wasn't really a divide between 'literary fiction" and popular commercial fiction in the past because... the common people couldn't or didn't read!   Jane Austen's work was written for--and read by--the rich upper class elitists.   Shakespeare did have the groundlings, but he was also employed by the fucking king! About as elite as you can get.   And you are going to tell me that James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and so on were not writing literary fiction? Just entertaining yarns the equivalent of popcorn flicks?                              This might help! http://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/2yxn04/a_visual_guide_to_reading_terry_pratchetts/      There are a lot, but not sure how many are specific to only books (or only film for that matter.) Most narrative cliches overlap. Like, IRL you can't get "knocked out" and wake up fully functional an hour later. If you black out for more than a few seconds your suffer major brain damage. But that happens in books, TV, film.    Amen.       ha, thanks!            The Worm Ourborous is a high fantasy novel that came out in 1922. You could probably argue that the Oz books are "high fantasy" of a sort.   Tolkien didn't invent that genre, just made it more popular.    Some of the above might not if your "universe" requirement, but some do. The Oz books have a whole fantasy world with different kingdoms and different races righting.    The LOTR definitely made high fantasy more popular and totally dominated the way fantasy went. Almost every major fantasy book has some combination of wizards and elves and dwarves and dragons, along with prophecies and quests and grand battles between kingdoms.   But for fantasy generally--and not including classic mythology and such--there are modern fantasy works that predate it. The Hobbit was 1937, so:  * The Wizard of Oz books (first in 1900) * The Worm ouroboros (1922) * H.P Lovecraft's works (20s/30s) * Conan the Barbarian (1932) and other Howard works  etc.       If a book isn't popular, or doesn't grab people, it's not the readers' fault, and it's not because people just don't know how to appreciate something good.  Also, I agree it isn't the reader's fault per se but your logic is here is off. We live in a capitalist world where market forces and money completely dominate what gets popular. That's just the facts. So if a book isn't popular, it doesn't mean it won't grab people or couldn't be popular. It may simply mean that the publisher didn't put enough marketing behind it, or the author didn't work the publicity channels enough.   Tons of books that flop initially become popular later. And tons of books that "grab people" today will be completely forgotten about in 5 years time.   A million books are published each year. Even dedicated readers can't read even 1% of them. So what gets popular is in large part determined by what even gets in front of people's eyes, and that's not about quality    The primary purpose of literature is to engage and to entertain.  Eh. There is no "primary purpose" of literature. Plus "to engage" and "to entertain" are not synonyms. Plenty of work is highly entertaining yet not very engaging (most popcorn blockbuster films and their literary equivalents) and plenty of other work is highly engaging but not entertaining really.   People always make these statements about literature. It's purpose is to entertain OR it's to enlighten OR it's to move a reader emotionally OR it's to push aesthetic boundaries OR it's to provide escapism  etc. etc.   None of these things are true. Or rather are all. Art has many goes, none "primary" across the whole of literature   I'd like that comment more if they didn't claim Foer (lolol) was a "great" author.   That said, I agree that great books still do well and the article is probably a lot of handringing over nothing.                Recent? Since 60s at least, and the norm since 80s      And you want book reviews to go in papers/websites the week the book is published, so reviewers need time to read and write review (and editors time to edit) before publication.  Same thigns happens in other industries. TV critics get advanced screeners of new season (first few episodes), film critics sometimes get free previews.    Yeah once you have a finished book with an agent, finding publisher can take 3-6 months, doing contracts can take another couple, then 1-2 years from signing a contract till the book comes out is standard. It's all slow.    1-2 years from sell date is standard.   But, yes, if George R. R. Martin turns in book 6 tomorrow his press can probably get that into bookstores in 4-6 months.    Advance Review Copies. cheaply made books given out to reviewers and booksellers before the real book comes out. (It's how books get reviewed before publication date)         Agreed. There are more fantastic books by women than one can read. There are more fantastic books by hispanic authors than one can read in a lifetime. Ditto black, asian, whatever.   So reading diversely doesn't mean just picking books based on checklists and not interest. It just means looking for your interests among a diverse group of writers.    Well, unless he dies, Martin is definitely giving us an ending. It's just taking longer than he expected.   I understand why you'd be frustrated. But speaking as a writer more than a reader, I think you are wrong to assume he doesn't care about finishing. I bet he is extremely nervous about fucking up the ending. This is his grand legacy after all. He is being careful.    True. The King equivalent is the Dark Tower series, and he took a loooooong time to finish that.    Hmm maybe:   * The Martian Chronicles - Ray Bradbury  * Dune - Frank Herbert  * Cosmicomics - Italo Calvino  * The Lathe of Heaven - Ursula K. Le Guin  * The Island of Doctor Death - Gene Wolfe   It's more of a difference in reader reaction. Which I guess is to say, I disagree with you. There's a way lower bar for people to enjoy something if it's already familiar. This isn't unique to fan fiction. Look at all the superhero films that are mostly only okay at best, but which rake in billions because the names are familiar.   99% of the time, people are way more interested in a mediocre James Bond reboot or the 10th version of Sherlock Holmes than they are in original characters.   Sure, writing great scenes and sentences is just as hard if you use Harry Potter or your own characters, but readers will forgive your weak writing more if they already know the characters or the "brand"       Ah, since there are only 5 books I thought you meant the first three with "earlier" books.             Why do you think Martin doesn't feel like he has to finish? It seems like he feels he has to finish it RIGHT and thus is taking a long time.    This may be true, but honestly, fantasy is way too reliant on massive decades spanning series. If ASOIAF means that people start putting out self-contained novels again, that would be a good thing.     It doesn't take that long to write a novel, even a big one.  Says who? Some authors write really fast, some write really slow. There's no lenght of time it takes to write a novel! It entirely depends on the specific novel and the specific author and their specific life circumstance.   Plenty of famous authors have taken a decade or more to write a follow-up book!  Stephen King is famous for being the EXCEPTION who writes way faster than normal. Also, even King fans--of which I count myself--seem to agree many of his books feel rushed with bad endings, so hoping martin rushes out a King like book with a bad ending might not be a great suggestion!   ETA: Also, King is a good counter to the OP's argument that because Martin is famous he must not give a shit about writing more books. King still pumps out books. Rowling still pumps out books. Being super famous doesn't make you stop being a writer.      If I were a conspiritard, I might suggest the lengthy wait between earlier books was a calculated move to generate more hype  Erm? The first three books only had 2 year waits between them. I'd hardly call that lenghty! That's actually a really short period of time for such massive books.   I know that in the current self-publishing put out 3 books a year ebook mindset, 2 years might seem long, but before the launch of the Kindle only a handful of authors put out more than a book every other year.       I don't think people are saying Mad Men the show is sexist, but that Don Draper the character is            Everyone's said Lovecraft, King, and Poe so I'll say:   Ambrose Bierce Shirley Jackson Bram Stoker   Hmm, well can't say I agree with you. Many of my books favorite books in genres like SF (The Martian Chronicles, the stories of Gene Wolfe, etc.) mystery (Sherlock Holmes), and certainly literary fiction (Borges, Calvino, Raymond Carver, Flannery O'Connor) are story collections. To each their own I guess.         What do you mean useful? Not snarking, just not sure what you mean. SF, mystery, ... most genres have a long tradition of short stories. I mean, basically all "genre" fiction got started in the pulp magazines that ran stories.   But stories don't really sell well in any genre today.     In reality, being bothered about or interested in something enough to cultivate the appropriate qualities more than the next guy is what makes the difference.  Here's where I disagree with you. Yes, if there are 20 people in a creative writing class and only 2 REALLY care and they are the only 2 really putting the work in, chances are those will be the only 2 who get published down the road... even if there are 5 other people in class with more talent but who don't put in the effort.   Sure.   But we aren't talking about 20 people.   There are like 400 MFA programs pumping out 4,000 people a year. There are hundreds of thousands of people who spend a lot of their time trying to be writers. (Over 1 million books are published each year, mostly through self-publishing.)   So of those 500k, or however many it is, who are all caring and trying, what separates them? At that point, what separates the good from the bad is talent. Think about Jordan again. Yes, if he was lazy and never practiced he wouldn't have been great. But there were tons of players practicing just as much as him. The reason he was better than them was in large part talent. Work can only get you so far if you don't have it.    Many people have the qualities of greatness but don't get the breaks.  I do agree with you there   I'm sure they do, although it varies widely. Some programs are very genre friend, others aren't. Some have experimental writers as teachers, others don't. Etc.   I do think the MFA world focuses heavily on short stories over novels though. I bet you can measure a increase in short story writing in the last two years. Doesn't seem to translate to readers though!   Why do you think that creativity or other mental activities don't also have genetics play a role? Genetics play a role in EVERYTHING.   Note that after Jordan I mentioned Fischer. Chess is a mental activity. Yet, since chess is pretty objective (you win or you lose, and the ELO rankings can compare you to others) we know that Fischer was better as a 16 year old at this mental activity than people who study chess for decades can ever get.     Well the other thing is that most people don't really brag about their MFAs. Like unless you went to Iowa or Columbia or something, once you have publications under your belt you don't need to list an mFA on your bio. Point being, most people don't know who is or isn't an outlier here.     If you didn't decide to take writing seriously by the time you were a teenager, you're probably not going to make it.  True, maybe "take writing seriously" means take literature seriously even if you don't write. Still, I dunno. Teens don't take all that much seriously.    Maybe, or maybe the opposite is happening because when everyone and their mother has an MFA it doesn't mean much   I don't know Sevcik or Bindounot, but in the part I quoted he hyperlinked to Boudinot saying it. Hyperlink got lost in copy and paste   Yeah, FTA:    He unexpectedly listed me as one of his favorite Pacific Northwest writers in a subsequent interview, a flattering but dubious honor because it was couched in disparaging comments about cohorts and colleagues whom I love, respect, and admire. It put me in an awkward position with a lot of friends who were offended by his remarks, and left a whole bunch of people wondering what an unknown like me was doing next to names like Rebecca Brown, Maria Semple, Tom Robbins, Neal Stephenson, and Raymond Carver (I'm touched to be mentioned in such good company, but I definitely don't deserve it).   Well, I think you are confusing the MFA being a "requirement" to write fiction with the MFA being helpful to many people. Good MFA programs give you money to spend a few years writing. So, it isn't a surprise to me that many young writers do one at some point. That doesn't mean that the industry requires it for publishing, just that many writers are attracted to doing one.    Maybe publishers wanting quality work assume their best bets can come from people who have that training? I really don't like this idea, but I can see why a company that publishes books might start doing that.  As an unpublished writer, an MFA can help a little. But I promise you that agents and editors care far more about your track record than any school. Being an Iowa grad with no publications is way worse than being a college drop-out with dozens of stories in good magazines.    Some scattered opinions on the whole thing:   - MFAs if they are good or are funded can be great for writers. MFAs that cost a lot of money and don't have talented teachers and students are a big ripoff.   - Focusing on MFAs for being a ripoff is dumb. There are degree mills and ripoff programs for every major and field of study. Higher education in general is way too expensive in America.   - Talent exists. It exists in sports, math, business, writing, and everything else. You can try to deny it, but many people waste years trying to be good at something they just aren't ever going to be able to do well.   - Boudinot's original article really wasn't offensive at all except the tasteless line about child abuse.   - That said, Boudinot made some dumb claims, such as that you can only be a good writer if you started writing seriously as a teenager. I'm positive the majority of professional writers didn't start "seriously" writing until college or later.   - It is absurd that people on the internet are trying to get Boudinot fired from his non-teaching job because he said some "mean" things about former students.      First of all, the talent vs. hard work thing is rubbish. Talent is hard work in disguise.  Do people really believe this?   Sorry, but no amount of "hard work" would have made me as good a basketball player as Michael Jordan. No amount of "hard work" would have made me as good at chess as Bobby Fischer. No amount of "hard work" would have made me a great singer (I'm fairly tone deaf)  Hard work matters a lot, but people DO have natural abilities that hard work can bring out. Not all of us can be great at everything. Most of us can be great at SOME things if we do hard work, but talent exists.    Well, Boudinot did list Sevcik as one of his favorite Seattle writers ever, so it doesn't seem like a stretch       most MFA programs are a waste of time.  Well most MFA programs give stipends to writers. Getting paid to take a few classes and write is not a "waste of time" in my book!   The vast majority of the working novelists with whom I associate at conferences got their start through the slushpiles at various literary agencies, and have no MFAs listed on their curricula vitae.  Well, guess that depends on your genre. The vast majority of working writers in "literary" or "mainstream" fiction either have an MFA or teach in a program. Not saying that's good or bad though.    Yes this is an awful precedence. It wasn't even that they sampled it without authorization, but just that hte songs "feel" similar even though they aren't the same.    http://www.nybooks.com/books/wintersale/  Since NYRB Classics is one of the best presses out there--publishing essential classics form around the world--thought some /r/books readers would like to know the sale ends soon.

However, she was in her late 50s when she died right?    Breece DJ Pancake!  (that's really his name)            It's definitely not action packed                     heh, no agenda except it's a topic that interests me! (Maybe discussing the topic is an agenda though)   Le Guin was a runner-up herself in the 90s      He is bloated, but that's part of his charm   Well, my understanding is that that DFW taught english composition mostly. The rules for academic comp papers are very different than for short stories in literary magazines, you know?    McCarthy won for The Road, and he was a western writer who wrote a post-apocalyptic novel.       Well there are some people who say you shouldn't read him and that he should be, while not government censored, banned from the literatary discussion.       Have you read his other fiction? Because his story collections, especially the first two, probably have my favorite fiction by him.     Even by the time he was writing his first two novels, Wallace had already started doing what he did best: accumulate bad habits  Sorry, but I find this review laughable. What he calls "bad habits" are what makes DFW unique! So many people want all writing to be cookie-cutter and indistinguishable. The same complaints this guy is making about DFW are ones I've seen made about Proust, Faulkner, and a million others.   But, well, guess what? Faulkner, Proust, and DFW are massively popular, highly-acclaimed writers whose unique works will continue to be read for a long time.   If some teacher had "fixed" DFW we'd never know who he was.     I think that some works can belong both at the same time.  Yes! Totally. Hacky boring works of MFA students getting called "literary" but denying that label to boundary pushing and beautifully written works by someone like LeGuin makes little sense.    one of my favorite essays                           Right? Such a depressing idea             The claim that his work can 'destigmatize' fantasy and SF,   To clarify here, Ishiguro did NOT say this. It was David Mitchell who said he hoped Ishiguro's book would help further destigmatize fantasy.    Oh boy, I don't want to open that can of worms. But, blurbs are not reviews. There is no pretense that blurbs are "objective" opinions from netural parties.   	200

Are there any reliable sources detailing the discussion and rationale that was held in arriving at the canonical books? Such as why the book of Enoch was not included, and why the books of Paul make up the majority of the New Testament? I'd be really interested in reading an actual surviving transcript of the dialogue that was held during the Councils.   P.s.

Heck, we could probably just rip off an existing app, beautify it and get it done for less than $1000 all-in, or even hire a fellow Redditor to do it. We could even name it after /r/Accounting and start challenging Intuit   Quickbooks in the small business sector. Anyone else in, or any developers interested?  Update: so it seems in not alone in my frustration! A fellow Big 4 got in touch with me about getting something going once the busy season subsides in April. If you'd be willing to support a project like this, please indicate below! Maybe a mod or someone objective could volunteer to host the Kickstarter?

Like knowing the opposing lineups at a baseball game, understanding the amounts and priorities of a company's liabilities can tell investors a great deal not only about how the various security holders are likely to be treated but also how the financial distress is likely to be resolved.  The first step is to value the assets of the debtor. Once the size of the pie is known, it is possible to consider how it may be divided. To facilitate this process, an investor must divide the debtor's assets into two parts: the assets of the ongoing business; and the assets available for distribution to creditors upon reorganization, such as excess cash, assets held for sale, and investment securities. Investors in AM International, Inc., senior claims received substantial amounts of AM's excess cash upon reorganization; investors in Braniff Airlines' first bankruptcy in 1983 received liquidating trust certificates backed by a direct interest in aircraft assets.  In valuing an ongoing business operating in Chapter 11, investors should employ each of the valuation methodologies described in chapter 8. In many instances the investor is in the difficult position of analyzing a moving target since the business of the debtor is unstable, if not in turmoil. It is essential that investors take into account any income statement and cash flow distortions caused by the Chapter 11 process itself. Interest  earned on excess cash that builds up during bankruptcy, for example, will not be a source of income for the reorganized company. Similarly, interest expense on reinstated debt, which does not accrue during bankruptcy, will once again accrue. Then, again, the high investment banking, legal, and administrative costs of a Chapter 11 proceeding, often cumulatively totaling several percent or more of the value of the debtor's estate, will cease upon emergence from bankruptcy. Bankrupt companies may even intentionally "uglify" their financial statements (for example, by expensing rather than capitalizing certain expenses or by building excessive balance sheet reserves) in order to minimize the assets apparently available for distribution to creditors. This value is ultimately revealed after reorganization, but by then insiders have picked up cheap stock or options.  Analysis of the assets and liabilities of financially distressed or bankrupt companies must extend beyond the balance sheet however. Off-balance-sheet assets may include real estate carried below current value, an overfunded pension plan, patents owned, and the like. Off-balance-sheet liabilities may include underfunded pension plans, Internal Revenue Service, Environmental Protection Agency, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), and other governmental claims, and claims resulting from rejected executory contracts and leases. In recent steel industry bankruptcies, for example, Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel and LTV Corporation transferred their underfunded pension plans to the PBGC, resulting in a bankruptcy claim by the PBGC against Wheeling and protracted litigation between the PBGC and LTV.  Once a debtor's assets have been valued, investors should turn their attention to the liability side of the balance sheet. The liabilities of a bankrupt company are best evaluated in descending order of seniority. Secured debt should be evaluated first. If the value of the security interest is determined, whether through negotiation or a valuation proceeding, to be equal to or greater than the amount of claim, the claim is said to be fully secured or oversecured. An oversecured claim entitles the holder to postpetition accrued interest (interest that would have accrued during the bankruptcy proceeding) to the extent of the amount of oversecurity. If secured debt is determined to be less than fully secured, holders will typically receive value equal to the extent of their security plus a senior but unsecured claim against the debtor for the amount of the undersecurity.  There may be some investment opportunities in distressed securities at every rank in the debt hierarchy. Risk-averse investors will generally prefer to hold senior securities; the potential return from senior securities is frequently less than that available from junior claims, but the risk is also much lower. Senior securities are first in priority, and unless they are fully or almost fully repaid, junior classes are unlikely to receive significant value.  "Fulcrum securities"-the class of securities partly but not fully covered by asset value-s-can also be attractive investments at the right price, ranking midway on the risk spectrum. Fulcrum securities benefit most directly from value increases and likewise are most directly impaired by any value diminution. Investing in junior securities can provide spectacular returns but can also prove disastrous. These securities often serve as out-of-the-money options-effectively, bets-on an improvement in operating results or an increase in value.  The common stock of bankrupt companies frequently trades considerably above its reorganization value, which is often close to zero. While there may be an occasional horne run, as a rule investors should avoid the common stock of bankrupt entities at virtually any price; the risks are great and the returns very uncertain. Unsophisticated investors have lost a great deal of money buying the overpriced common stock of bankrupt companies, even after the unfavorable terms of the reorganization plan have been widely disseminated.  It is worth remembering that restructurings and bankruptcy reorganizations are negotiated processes. Negotiations can be affected by the relative bargaining strengths and weaknesses of  the different classes of creditors, the skills of the negotiators, and the dollar amounts at stake.  By way of example, Ron Labow headed an investor group that bought up most of Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel's bank debt and dictated a reorganization plan that left him in control of the reorganized company. A blocking position-one-third of the outstanding amount of debt-in a small, closely held debt issue may enable that class to obtain better treatment than similar but more widely held debt issues. The holder of a blocking position in even the most junior bankrupt security, because of his or her ability to delay the debtor's emergence from bankruptcy, may gain far better treatment for his or her class than allowed by any allocation made strictly according to priority ranking. A blocking position is said to have "hold-up" value in two senses: the owner can hold up (delay) the bankruptcy process as well as hold up (rob) other classes of creditors, extracting nuisance value from what might otherwise be a nearly worthless claim.  - Margin of Safety, Seth Klarman   **Beta**    In this article, were going to explore one of the fundamental cornerstones of investing  Risk. What is risk, you may ask? Well, if the finance industry was a person and you were to ask him that question, the answer youd likely get is beta.   But what is beta? Beta is derived from the second letter of the Greek alphabet, and it is meant to represent the volatility of a security in comparison to a benchmark. Lets say youre planning to evaluate the risk of investing in a companys stock. A suitable benchmark might be the main index of the country in which the company is incorporated  for instance, the S P 500 index or the Dow Jones index for a US company. By comparing the volatility of a securitys trading price to that of its brethren index  which is to say how much its share price moves for every $ the index moves  you get a number, e.g. 2. This means that when the index price moves $1, the share price of the company moves $2 in the same direction as the index. Of course, things arent always as simple as that, since the stock prices of both fluctuate up and down every second; so you really have to use a computer if you want to accurately pinpoint the beta down to a decimal range.   So why is beta considered a measure of risk? Well, the logic is that if a companys stock moves $2 whenever the index moves $1, it is more risky than the index since you stand to lose double what the index would lose, all else being equal. Since the mantra in the investment world is risk vs reward, that line of reasoning fits well into the established standard. After all, if a stock might go up twice as fast but also might go down twice as fast, doesnt that mean it has higher risk?  However, if you pay attention, you might find that some people who call themselves value investors are shunning the concept of volatility or beta as an ideal measure of risk. You may have heard of the most famous one of them before  Warren Buffett. Yes, the third richest guy in the world. Summarily, Warren says that it is absurd that the risk of an investment should be represented by the volatility of a stock, i.e. how much its share price moves compared to its benchmark. He cites an example  for instance, lets say the share price of a really safe blue-chip stock like American Express drops 50% overnight due to temporary problems (this really happened, and was known as the Salad Oil Scandal). How would investing half your money into 100 American Express shares be more risky than investing all your money for the same 100 shares? Logically, it should only be half as risky, since only half your money is at risk (as opposed to all your money previously). But since beta ignores the underlying conditions of the company and only focuses on the movement of the share price, the subsequent dive would probably reflect a double-digit beta. If one were to studiously follow beta as a measure of risk, he would proceed to view the stock as incredibly risky and perhaps sell it immediately. Whereas what Warren Buffett saw instead was a company trading at a much reduced price, like a discount sale, and he proceeded to buy up as many shares as he reasonably could. The rest is history  he ended up making a lot of money when the share price recovered to earlier levels.  Hence, investors who focus on fundamental analysis of a company might come to the same conclusion that beta is not an ideal measure of risk; since in the above example, the shares were actually least risky when the beta was at its highest. Of course, in most cases volatility actually reflects risk rather well, as when a share price drops there usually is a good underlying reason for that drop. However, in enough cases to be relevant, it causes investors to miss out on potentially good deals, and because of that many people have joined the bandwagon in calling for the end of betas reign as a proper measure of risk.  However, there has to be a reason why beta became the defining measure of risk in the first place. Have you ever asked yourself why beta is considered risk? We all pay lip service to the fact that beta is volatility, and that high volatility equals high risk. But if I were to ask you to explain why beta is risk, would you be able to tell me? What does it mean when we say volatility equals risk? Why do professionals around the world trust hundreds of billions of dollars with it? Why do some denounce it, and who is it useful to (or not)?    **What Is Beta?**       Well, to understand how we came up with the concept of volatility as risk, one has to take a trip down memory lane and go back to high school. Remember all those charts you learnt in eighth grade statistics? The bell curve, those squiggly lines connecting all the randomly placed dots, the mean and the variance? Well, lets refresh your memory.   [Chart of a stock](http://i.imgur.com/1Dzg8Ct.png)  See, if you look at the chart of any stock, youll notice that its actually a plot of data points seemingly randomly strewn across the chart, with the x-axis representing Price and the y-axis representing Time. Now lets apply some high-school statistics to it. Lets say you wanted to get a mean (average) representation of all the points, so that you can make some sense out of all the random data. How do you do this? You take a ruler, and draw a line at the mid-point between all the data points. Remember, high school?    So now you have a line which represents the average price of the stock at any point in time. But remember, this line is just an average, so trying to use it to represent the actual data may not be so accurate. If all the data points are close to the line, then we call this a close fit  and the line can be said to be a true approximation of all the data points. However, if one particular data point strays far away from the line, then we cant say that the line accurately represents the stock price at that point in time, as the stock price was never near the average price predicted by the line. This is where the concept of volatility comes in.  See, with hundreds of thousands of stocks to look at every day, thats billions of price points for the banks to glean through and try to make some sense of. Hence, simply out of necessity, the banks simplify all the stock prices by averaging them, lest they become overwhelmed by all the information. For each company, they come up with an average line to represent the stock price of the day, month or year.  They then use that line for other things, such as predicting the future stock price by extrapolating it, running a sensitivity analysis  or just putting it into a fancy Powerpoint chart to impress their clients. As a result, they end up relying on these lines (i.e. averages) for many of their crucial functions.  So now weve established that banks have to work on the law of averages, since its impossible to turn a profit crunching a billion data points every single day. However, as weve observed above, sometimes averages are not representative of their true conditions, since a particular price point may stray far away from the average which the line represents. Hence, banks have to come up with a way to account for this imperfection when relying on averages. This is where volatility comes into the picture.   **What Is Volatility?**  Volatility, in laymans terms, is simply how far the price points on a stock chart stray from the average that the line represents  such that it renders the average inefficient as a representative of actual conditions. For instance, lets say that you plot an average line from a chart of price points of a stock throughout the day. However, assume none of the data points actually sit close to the line; hence, the line only exists as an average of the points, and it sits smack in the middle of all of them. But as each point sits far away from each other, the fact that the average line sits in the middle of all of them doesnt actually mean that the average line accurately represents them. In fact, if you were to solely rely on the line as a fact and try to extrapolate the future price of the stock, you would probably get a very different result from reality. This is because that average line is a poor indicator of what past prices really were; it merely acts a mid-point of all the past prices. In this case, if we were to use the average line as a beginning frame of reference (remember, bank employees rely on the averages out of necessity), we say that the actual prices reflect high volatility from the average. Its just another way of saying that the average is imperfect, and we should be careful when using it.   So now you know that since its not realistic for banks to individually crunch all prices of every stock at every second (i.e. data points), they instead draw a line through all the prices of a stock throughout the day (or week, month, etc.) and use that average to reflect the entire days price. Then, if a line does not accurately reflect all the price points it is derived from, we say that the line has a high degree of volatility  or imperfection. Likewise, if all the price points sit close to the average that the line represents, we can say that the line is a good representation of the actual data and has a low degree of volatility  or is close to perfect. Thus, using an average price (i.e. line) with higher volatility has more risk, whereas using an average price with less volatility has less risk!   Hence, this is why we say that volatility (i.e. beta) is risk!   **But Wait What About The Other Guys?**  So now weve established that volatility is actually a pretty good approximation for risk, by virtue of the fact that we have to rely on average data as opposed to actual data to get our jobs done. And if you pour over the explanation again, beta is actually a pretty good measure of risk. So why do these value investors have a problem with it?  Well, as weve seen, beta is derived from the past performance of stock price. That means that it completely ignores the underlying company which the stock is traded on, and merely observes the price at which it trades at. For instance, lets take the passing of Steve Jobs as an example. When he died, the stock of Apple took a big hit, because people were wondering whether the charismatic nature of the companys leader could be replaced. However, a proper analyst would observe that it takes more than one person to run a hundred billion dollar company  it takes a vertically integrated supply chain, an amazing product, a visible brand, a tip-top management team, as well as tens of thousands of employees to run Apple. So while the departure of the CEO can be viewed as a negative, it is only a blip in the grand scheme of things; at least, as far as the future development of Apple is concerned. However, the emotional side of the market tends to react by driving the stock price because other people are selling, not because of anything that has to do with the fundamental position of the company. In such a case, beta would provide a poor measure of risk  as although volatility shoots through the roof when the stock dives, the company itself is almost completely identical to how it was the day before, just minus one CEO. Most people would say that it would not be any more risky to invest in Apple than it was the day before. In fact, by nature of the stock being cheaper, it would actually be less risky, since you stand to lose less money if you were to buy the same number of stocks.   Hence, an isolated top-down measurement of risk using only historical price as a benchmark can in many ways be ineffective, if not downright misleading. Some people might say that this is not an issue because the market is an efficient barometer which reflects all available information perfectly (i.e. Efficient Market Hypothesis); however, many of us would agree that the market is not always efficient, and imperfections can and do appear in the market  as weve demonstrated in the above example. As a result, beta as a measure of risk should be taken with a grain of salt.   **So What Can We Use Beta For?**  This is not to say that beta is completely useless. Like a screwdriver, beta is just a tool  you just have to use it in the manner it was designed for. If you were to apply a screwdriver to a nail, you probably wouldnt make much progress since that wasnt what it was designed for. Likewise, if you were to use beta to measure the fundamental conditions of a company, you may not always get the most accurate results.  However, beta is extremely useful in one case scenario  if you want to be prepared for any eventuality. For instance, lets say you intend to pour all your retirement savings into a stock, and you dont know exactly when you should get out. Hence, you want to be prepared to sell in any eventuality. In such a case, beta can be an excellent measure of risk  since a lower volatility means that you have a lower chance of losing everything, whereas a higher beta means that you have a higher chance of losing likewise. In such a situation, you want to ensure that you dont lose too much no matter what happens  so it would make a lot of sense to pick a stock with a lower beta so that the potential for it to fall drastically is lower. This is one case where observing the historical price movement of a stock in order to define risk can make a lot of sense. However, if we were to apply beta to analysing the fundamental business conditions of a company, you might find yourself disappointed.  This is probably the most layman explanation of Beta on the Internet so I hope youve learned something today!

(something like this I guess?: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-to-add-more-white-space-at-the-end-of-posts)      FOR BETA OR WORSE (pg. 113)  Many market participants believe that investment risk is intrinsic to specific securities, as it is to activities like hang gliding and mountain climbing. Using modern financial theory,  academics and many market professionals have attempted to quantify this risk with a single statistical measure, beta. Beta compares a security's or portfolio's historical price fluctuations with those of the market as a whole. High-beta stocks are defined as those that tend to rise by a higher percentage than the average stock in a rising market and decline more than the average stock in a falling market. Due to their greater volatility, high-beta stocks are deemed to be riskier than lowbeta stocks. I find it preposterous that a single number reflecting past price fluctuations could be thought to completely describe the risk in a security. Beta views risk solely from the perspective of market prices, failing to take into consideration specific business fundamentals or economic developments. The price level is also ignored, as if IBM selling at 50 dollars per share would not be a lower-risk investment than the same IBM at 100 dollars per share. Beta fails to allow for the influence that investors themselves can exert on the riskiness of their holdings through such efforts as proxy contests, shareholder resolutions, communications with management, or the ultimate purchase of sufficient stock to gain corporate control and with it direct access to underlying value. Beta also assumes that the upside potential and downside risk of any investment are essentially equal, being simply a function of that investment's volatility compared with that of the market as a whole. This too is inconsistent with the world as we know it. The reality is that past security price volatility does not reliably predict future investment performance (or even future volatility) and therefore is a poor measure of risk.      https://i.imgur.com/yeLi4Xb   I had put this out of my mind since the split, since after the pre-split pop to $700, I thought the stock had appreciated to fair value. However, recent comments about AAPL maybe getting into the electric car business prompted my interest again. Note that I wasnt interested primarily because of the car rumours; I just wanted to see whether the price it was trading at today still reckoned a second look at value.   So, as you all might know, my minimum annual ROI for an investment is 15%. I could go into all the other details of AAPL - like how ROE has been steady above 30%, how the cash hoard has grown to nearly $180bn, how Apples debt is manageable, how share buybacks have contributed to 3% CAGR but I wont bother you with all that. Instead, Im just going to distill everything to one criteria  a 15% CAGR.  Since the shares have been trading at around $130 for the past month, lets use that as the entry price. Diluted EPS for the year has been $7.39, which gives AAPL an initial rate of return of 5.68%. Thats far below our required rate of return of 15%.   However, net profit growth was 6.67% for the past year, which is pretty much what I expect things to remain at unless the company comes up with something new. Remember, were not counting on hope, only hard figures. According to my armchair economists observation, Apples net profit growth has plateaued unless it can come up with another revolutionary device  for the simple reason that there arent any more mass-affluent markets for the iPhone to conquer. After China, Africa and India remain the last two bastions of ginormous population sizes, however the folk there fall below the mass-affluent category and do not present a reliable market for the iPhone. And since over 70% of Apples profits come from the iPhone, its unlikely well see double digit growth if were not considering future revolutionary products.  However, lets not forget that the current profits are still throwing off massive cash flows, which Apple can beneficially employ in share buybacks and other shareholder wealth maximizing programmes. If Apples historical trends continue, we should be able to expect approximately 3% CAGR solely from share buybacks. I think this is a reasonable expectation, and is certainly in-line with other participants in maturing industries like Coca-Cola, IBM and McDonalds. In any case, well add the 3% to the aforementioned 6.67%, which yields us 9.67%.  For conveniences sake, lets round that up to 10%. While you might say that a 0.33% CAGR is not a negligible growth rate to round up, lets just consider that the probability-weighted growth derived from all other product categories, future product categories, as well as other financial engineering exercises. I think 0.33% is quite a safe growth estimate for all these miscellaneous items, especially if you consider further cost efficiency improvements (in which Tim Cook is king). So now we have a 10% yield into perpetuity.  Since this is a value investment, were going to assume that were holding this investment until we die. After all, what sense is there in holding shares of a blue-chip (esque) company if youre not going to hold it until you die? So since we all die at different ages, lets use 30 years as an appropriate timeframe. Im sure well all live for another 30 years, right? Right?  So if we assume an initial 5.68% return, and 10% growth over the next 30 years  plug that into a calculator and you get DING DING DING! A 16.55% CAGR! In case youre wondering, the calculation is:    30  (5.68 x 1.130) = 16.55%  Which is awesome. Keep in mind for that return, youre getting a stable quasi-blue chip company which is presently the largest company in the world by market cap. Now, lets examine the inherent risks in the assumptions used.  Some critics have pointed out that Apple relies on a single product, the iPhone, to generate almost all of its profits - and that in the realm of technology, where things can change in the blink of an eye, the incumbents position is generally not secured over the long term. However, I think thats just one side of the coin. IBM, Oracle, Sun, Microsoft, and Intel have all made pretty strong cases that large-cap technology incumbents can maintain their existence into perpetuity - even if it means yielding the top spot to a young upstart. Whats important is that: 1) they have loads and loads of cash to weather a market downturn  which Apple has, and 2) they have capable, shareholder-friendly management which adequately understands their risk:reward profile, which Apple does. If the tech incumbent has both, I think its safe to assume a 6.67% internally generated growth rate into perpetuity.   The bonus at the end of all of this is that Apple may not yet be done with being THE BEST  NUMBER ONE! in its field. The iPad still has some game to catch up, but it presently still holds more than 40% market share... and that's still an open market for Apple to pursue. The Apple Watch is supposed to be a breakthrough device. well see about that. But theres good reason to be optimistic about an extra 1% growth from it. And the Apple Car wow, that would be fantastic if it would just do us a favour and exit the realm of rumours and fairy tales. In any case, these developments are just the proverbial icing on the cake.   Anyway, the point is that Apples future is bright. Even without all these revolutionary changes, itll still yield our minimum rate of return, while providing the inherent security of investment of a large-cap. And that's good enough for me.

 Jersey Shore.   Actually, any of the 'Shore' related genre.    I was expecting a 8 minute long compilation video. Disappointment turned into joy once the ambient music set it.    Rekt   Piblings: gender neutral term to describe one's Uncle and Aunt. Your parent's siblings  'I spent the weekend at my Pibling's'   Definitely.    Can you elaborate?   /r/geocaching.   It's free, fun, gets you outside and there's 2000000 to collect.    Getting lost in a foreign country, at night, when you can't speak the language, and have no money.   EDIT: A story my friend told me was when she was in Mallorca she got so lost and drunk that she was nearly 5 miles from her hotel. Ended up having to sell her sunglasses to afford a taxi back.    I visited Marrakech in the summer (amazing place) and I heard somewhere that the people begging for food will hoard it.   There is, I accept, a large amount of poverty in Marrakech but I hear that even families who aren't living in poverty will beg for food. Apparently it's some kind of trophy or achievement. Pizza must be high on their list.     Reddit.   	10
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	150
       It would be interesting to know how many Korean films the person who did the list actually has seen. And maybe it would be easier to add "from 2001 and forward" or something similar, because there's only movies from 2001 and forward on the list.   Der siebente Kontinent (1989).   Three of my favourites when it comes to coming of age films:      * Den-en ni shisu (1974)     * Les quatre cents coups (1959)     * Sho o suteyo machi e deyou (1971)       Not that bad. He's not always acting in the best movies though, but Dead Poets Society (1989) and Before Sunrise (1995) are worth seeing. If you started with Linklater's trilogy, you should probably see all three movies too, Hawke is good in all of them. The first one is the best for me.   What are the recommendations based on?   El espritu de la colmena (1973).   Great Imamura movie! Thumbs up. I remember I uploaded a still from it on this subreddit about a month ago.   Favourite underrated movie: The Limits of Control (2009)     Favourite relatively unknown movie: Tobenai chinmoku (1966)        Play (2011) by Ruben stlund.      [Here](http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/cannes-first-poster-images-and-synopsis-for-apichatpong-weerasethakuls-cemetery-of-splendour-20150504) are some images from the film and some more information posted quite recently.               Koroshi no rakuin (1967) and Yjinb (1961).   Yes.   Well, because I put it in the list of the films I haven't seen yet, I think that tells if I liked it or not. It doesn't have a proper DVD/Blu-ray release at all, I would love to see it restored in great condition and put out on Blu-ray.      Du rififi chez les hommes (1955).   I'm a big fan of Art Theatre Guild (ATG) from Japan. Some great movies they released:           * Bara no sretsu (1969)      * Kshikei (1968)      * Mujo (1970)         * Shinj: Ten no Amijima (1969)        * Sho o suteyo machi e deyou (1971)         Onibaba (1964), Spalovac mrtvol (1969) and Possession (1981).      Watch Solyaris (1972) if you haven't done it.   Yes.   1. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975) (Chantal Akerman)     2. White Material (2009) (Claire Denis)       3. Khaneh siah ast (1963) (Forugh Farrokhzad)      Bulle Ogier.      I love it! It's one of my favourites, also the best prison film in my opinion. The suspense is amazing.      I think I'll go with Aguirre, der Zorn Gottes (1972). But Fitzcarraldo (1982), Stroszek (1977) and Lektionen in Finsternis (1992) aren't far away from the top either.   The Tragedy of Othello: The Moor of Venice (1952).   Narayama bushik (1958) and The Holy Mountain (1973).   1. Se7en (1995) 3/5      2. Zodiac (2007) 3/5    3. Fight Club (1999) 2/5      4. Panic Room (2002) 2/5     5. The Social Network (2010) 2/5     6. Alien 3 (1992) 2/5     7. Gone Girl (2014) 2/5    8. The Game (1997) 2/5     9. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011) 2/5      10. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (2008) 2/5           I have seen the Imamura movie, which was really good. But I know of the two others of course.   Vozvrashchenie (2003) fits in with pretty much when it comes about brothers arguing. And that part about a friend involved, there is a minor scene in it where it also happens.   I just watched Vozvrashchenie (2003). Not a bad one. I wish I had some Coca Cola now.   The ten I would recommend the most:       * Andrey Rublyov (1966)     * Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)      * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     * L'eclisse (1962)     * La notte (1961)     * Nattvardsgsterna (1963)         * Pickpocket (1959)     * Smultronstllet (1957)      * Suna no onna (1964)    * Tanin no kao (1966)        Stntang (1994), a bit over seven hours long. A true masterpiece. There you have real comedy that's black as night.   I hope no one takes this seriously. For example, movies like Sinister 2 (2015) and Poltergeist (2015) didn't have their premiere yet, I don't even think the person who did the video actually saw them. And The Babadook (2014) was from last year. It didn't seem that there was much effort put to work here. It looks like something a 14 year old kid did who just found out about Internet and YouTube.   Me too! It's one of the best movies I have ever seen. Just rewatched it some days ago. Such a masterpiece.   Some examples:      * Duelle (une quarantaine) (1976)    * L'immortelle (1963)    * La maman et la putain (1973)    * Le rvlateur (1968)    * Un homme qui dort (1974)         I love it and I hope Criterion releases it on BD.    They did it almost two years ago.   Wasn't it obvious? Nolan and Zimmer are hitting on the big drum with a ton of exposition and bombastic music that clearly tells you where you're supposed feel excitement and when you are expected to be sad etc. It's almost like a parody. As I've said before, the big problem with Nolan is that he isn't able to tell with pictures.      I agree that this is a must see. If you haven't seen it, do it. Probably Fellini's best one.   Possession (1981).   I thought it was horrible. I can recommend Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) though, that's a good comedy film.   I think they should replace him with Michael Haneke.    Well this was actually Jonah Hill's idea.         And that still doesn't rule out that he isn't a part of Hollywood.         Seems like Hollywood are out of ideas and looking for a cheap money grab. I can't see how it would turn out to be anything near good. The franchise milking nowadays is insane.      Pretty much all of my favourites are dramas, so my list would be like this:     1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)    2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)    3. L'eclisse (1962)    4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)     5. Tanin no kao (1966)    6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)     7. Suna no onna (1964)    8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)    9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)     10. Stntang (1994)         Hana-bi (1997).   The last one was from November 11, 2014 to December 1, 2014. And it was 50% off.   Hard to make a top ten, but I think it would look like this for me:     1. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)     2. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)     3. Stntang (1994)      4. Zerkalo (1975)     5. Solyaris (1972)    6. Nema-ye Nazdik (1990)      7. Belle de jour (1967)   8. Tobenai chinmoku (1966)    9. Saraba natsu no hikari (1968)     10. L'anne dernire  Marienbad (1961)      Both are good, but I would go with Fassbinder!   It will be in English. Subtitled in Swedish.   I haven't seen all of them yet, but of the eleven films I have seen by him, Kshikei (1968) and Shinjuku dorob nikki (1969) were the ones I liked best.   Such a great and funny shima movie!   L'eclisse (1962).   Das Leben der Anderen (2006) is a good political drama/thriller. It seems to be available on DVD if you rent it through Netflix, I don't know about streaming though, I don't have the American version of the program.   Here's six of my favourite movies about World War II:     * Die Ehe der Maria Braun (1979) (Rainer Werner Fassbinder)      * Idi i smotri (1985) (Elem Klimov)     * Ivanovo detstvo (1962) (Andrei Tarkovsky)     * L'arme des ombres (1969) (Jean-Pierre Melville)    * Lacombe Lucien (1974) (Louis Malle)     * Voskhozhdenie (1977) (Larisa Shepitko)      I don't know how many you've seen, but you maybe could have missed some of the ones I namedropped. All of them are great, I hope you'll find something that can be of your taste.   Hollywood wants more money.   Sounds like a bad idea.   C'era una volta il West (1968) has probably my favourite film score. The best part is the duel towards the end.   The only movie from 2010 and forward I might put in my top 100 when I do it next time would be Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013).   Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) and La maman et la putain (1973) are both fantastic.         Csillagosok, katonk (1967) and Idi i smotri (1985) are great.   Congratulations. It's a great movie.   I have to agree with the one who hated it. I also did. Overly dramatized, stupid, sentimental and melodramatic. Everything is so excessive to the point that it just makes it silly to the max, from the jokes to the drama and messages. For me, it's a wonder that people like this so much.   Woody Allen.      In a Lonely Place (1950).      Here's my top 10 films under 100 minutes:          1. Nattvardsgsterna (1962) (81 minutes)        2. Hiroshima mon amour (1959) (90 minutes)     3. Smultronstllet (1957) (91 minutes)       4. Pickpocket (1959) (75 minutes)      5. Spalovac mrtvol (1969) (95 minutes)       6. Tystnaden (1963) (96 minutes)       7. Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956) (99 minutes)      8. Nema-ye Nazdik (1990) (98 minutes)       9. Une femme est une femme (1961) (85 minutes)       10. Gion bayashi (1953) (85 minutes)              The Limits of Control (2009).   He needs to learn how to tell with pictures.   Hard to choose only one, but I've always held City Girl (1930) by F.W. Murnau very high, so that will be my answer.   [Here's](http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/173-8-1-2-a-film-with-itself-as-its-subject) a little essay by Alexander Sesonske that maybe could help you a bit on the way.   Sanma no aji (1962) with sake.   Woody Allen.    1. Do you recommend me watching it in one sitting or multiple?        I would recommend to start watching it early in the day, that way you have some hours to spare. The whole movie is split in parts, so that makes pauses quite easy. So if you need a pause, it's easy to find some time for it, the movie allows it. I think it's best to pause where you feel like, whether you for example have only one break or maybe two or three. One pause in the middle is probably the most essential.          2. Does the length ruin the film in the sense that it becomes boring or self-indulgent? (I've always wanted to see it, but I'm slightly teased by the idea that I might be wasting seven hours of a day watching a film which I won't like, plus the fact that the DVD boxset of the film is a tad pricey)          I would rather say that the length does the opposite. Sure, it's maybe not a movie you put on every other day, but if you allow to immense yourself into Tarr's world, you're in for a treat, especially if you liked his other movies. Stntang (1994) gave the a certain resolved feeling of time after while, I think Tarr was very good at doing it. It felt hypnotizing and sometimes you didn't really know how many of the hours actually passed. If you liked the Tarr movies you've seen so far, there's no reason why you shouldn't watch it!          3. How does it compare to other Bela Tarr films in terms of quality and themes? Is it better than most Tarr films, the best? Is it similar or different in some ways?         Werckmeister harmnik (2000) has for example a bit more surrealism, considering the whale and such. The narrative structure isn't as in his other works either. Everything is divided into twelve parts and it jumps six moves forward, then six back. Also, the doesn't always move chronologically. But maybe you already know that. If not, it's good to know and to be prepared. I'm almost done reading the novel the movie is based on, it also has the same structure. The mood in Stntang (1994) is quite similar to Werckmeister harmnik (2000) and A torini l (2011), but the themes are not maybe exactly the same. You'll recognize some things from his other films though, you'll get quite much nihilism, just like in A torini l (2011), And it's very existential.        Stntang (1994) is visually very much like Werckmeister harmnik (2000), A torini l (2011), A londoni frfi (2007) and Krhozat (1988). You'll get the black and white photography and of course the long takes. You'll probably recognize the environments as well, there's many crumbled buildings and hopelessness almost everywhere. When Tarr did Krhozat (1989), it was at this point where he started with his later metaphysical style, so you probably know that all of his movies before that one were very different and more social realistic with a raw, documentary feel over them. About his best film, I really think I hold Stntang (1994) as his biggest masterpiece. It's just amazing.   Der siebente Kontinent (1989).   There's no news about it for the moment. It hasn't even premiered anywhere yet, so it's a bit early to tell. You should keep an eye out on IMDb though, it will likely be posted there when it's official.   Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972). The movie has an all-female cast and is set entirely in the home of the main character. So good.   Well, you always have IMDb, even if it's obvious. There's also external reviews there. You also have [AsianWiki](http://asianwiki.com/) and [Midnight Eye](http://www.midnighteye.com/) too, the later one has a focus only on Japanese movies too. But my best recommendation would be A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors: From the Silent Era to the Present Day by Alexander Jacoby, a great book.    * La libertad (2001)       * Liverpool (2008)     * O Pagador de Promessas (1962)        Les quatre cents coups (1959), Sho o suteyo machi e deyou (1971) and Den-en ni shisu (1974) are some of the best ones.   I used the original title, but it's also called that, yes.      Du rififi chez les hommes (1955) and Le cercle rouge (1970).   A shame to ruin such a good tribute with such a terribly mediocre and dull composer as Zimmer.   It seems good enough for the general public as it is now. Just look at the kind of money the movies are making and their big fanbase/praise. A majority of the critics love the big Marvel movies too.   So?   I think my list would look like this:       1. Banshun (1949)      2. Genroku Chshingura (1941)    3. Double Indemnity (1944)     4. Vredens dag (1943)    5. Les enfants du paradis (1945)    6. The Third Man (1949)    7. Meshes of the Afternoon (1943)   8. Ladri di biciclette (1948)    9. Chichi ariki (1942)      10. The Maltese Falcon (1941)     You are thinking about Crash (1996) by David Cronenberg.      L'eclisse (1962), I always end up thinking about it almost all the time.   Didn't the actual reviews tell you why?   Le samoura (1967).   It's very loosely based on both the novel Piknik na obochine by the Strugatsky brothers and the movie by Tarkovsky.   Andrei Tarkovsky.   For example, pretty much any feature film by Andrei Tarkovsky. Andrey Rublyov (1966) or Stalker (1979) are great examples.   I'll give you my favourites:        * Banshun (1949)      * Un condamn  mort s'est chapp ou Le vent souffle o il veut (1956)        * Smultronstllet (1957)      * Jalsaghar (1958)      * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)     * Pickpocket (1959)    * Le trou (1960)     * La notte (1961)      * L'eclisse (1962)     * Nattvardsgsterna (1962)        * Sanma no aji (1962)          * Tystnaden (1963)       * Suna no onna (1964)      * Andrey Rublyov (1966)      * Tanin no kao (1966)       * C'era una volta il West (1968)     * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       * Spalovac mrtvol (1969)       * Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972)       * Solyaris (1972)      * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)   * Zerkalo (1975)       * Stalker (1979)        * Krhozat (1988)         * Der siebente Kontinent (1989)     * Stntang (1994)        Probably the best scene in the movie, I love it when Isabelle Adjani is freaking out. Good stuff.      A lot of silent movies don't have any music tracks or sound at all. To answer your question, a big percentage of avant-garde/experimental films includes no actors/voice actors, just to take an easy example. I understand if it's effective for most of the movies you see, I was just curious what you do when a movie doesn't at all have any of the components you rate.   Maybe you should try Winter's Bone (2010) and Mud (2012), they are a bit similar to Blue Ruin (2013).   Smultronstllet (1957) is a great start. One of my favourites by him. Easily the best Swedish director ever. And one of the best overall too.   If they are available, I always use subtitles when watching a movie in a language I don't understand. But then again, I even used subtitles for movies in languages I already know. It seems to me that you haven't seen that many foreign films and aren't that used to subtitles? I don't see the whole thing as a problem, rather something necessary instead. I think it simply will improve with time, it's something you have to get used to.  	121
                Good luck with detection - hope you will be accurate and precise.                                      	18
 Yes folks this is an alt account(My main was shadowbanned), yes I'm too lazy to make a new meme.    I often see stocks taking big dives or surging but am unable to locate any news to go along with it from sources like the AP or CNN.  Is there some source most novice investors don't know about or don't have access to that the professionals do?  	2
 I've completed part of it, and next I'm going to add the moon from majora's mask, and maybe skull kid. :)      Wow dude, great job!! I frickin' love it!    Thanks! And I will most likely, these fuckers are just so butthurt.  	4
 I just put the title from Youtube, I have since learned it was a compressor stall ... maybe.     I am really looking forward to when we go a whole year without a hull loss.  It's only a matter of time.   That is so cool the edge of the picture makes the sky look like a sunset, but then you realize the sun is still high in the sky.  you should post a second picture once the moon is out of the way so you get an idea of what the sky looked like once the sun was out.   I think the rudder action is really cool.  As soon as the engine goes you can see the rudder inputs to keep the plane straight.   The biggest problem with this is especially at higher speeds, a grate is not going to do a lot, more likely you will suck the bird and the grate through the engine.  Plus as /u/ericvas said it would be a lot of weight drag and create problems with airflow going into the engine.      You are ignoring the fact that going west would be a huge waist of energy to get to pretty much the same place.  Plus going into a polar orbit would be a big waist of energy because you would not be able to take advantage of any of the energy you used to get to LEO because you would be making a 90 degree plane change to start your burn to Mars.    This would possibly be kind of correct, if you were launching direct to Mars, but it is most likely they will launch to LEO and then to Mars.  But even direct to Mars you would still gain some energy by launching closer to the equator.     I think this is because west coast launches are  1. At a higher latitude than the east coach making the launches less efficient (You need a bigger rocket to get the same mass to the same place.). 2. Need to depart over the pacific ocean for range safety which is perfect for polar launches, but not so great for anything trying to go into LEO, or LEO transfer to Mars because now you are overflying land and people.    idk these are my best guesses why the west coast tends to be less popular.  Anybody knows more please tell me.   I am not sure how to feel about this. I could go either way.   Who are they?   That's a little weird.    Yea i can understand i always thought that rule was about keeping people from asking the same question 50 times not about limiting the amount of articles.  I feel like a lot of times articles from more than one source can be a good thing.   yea sorry about that   I didn't see any other posts about the rescheduling until after I posted, and whats the big deal, its an interesting article god forbid we have two articles about the same topic.         Any idea why they put the helicopter up on the bow like that?  It seems like a bad spot to put something it is just going to get pummeled.   Wait so you were on this ship during that storm?         The plane in this video is just getting bathed in sea water, how do they keep it from totally ruining the airplane?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OalYOmBvgpk   The doors were locked.  People don't realize the doors back then were not the thick impenetrable things we have today, in fact back then the doors were frequently made so that they could be kicked in incase there was an emergency and the pilots needed to escape or be saved, but the door would not open.   And I am not laughing anymore. Really sad to hear about that man.   ohh i wasn't around back then I am only a 2 year old account, and i didn't join these subreddits until later.  Either way i feel like this is genuine, and its nice to see the old subreddit going back to the good old way it used to be.   But the problem with this logic is it assumes people who vote know the issues and people who don't don't.  Right now there are plenty of people that vote that have no idea about any of the issues they just vote because the heard a comercial, or thats what the party is said to do.  You cant pick and choose who votes, and in my opinion I think requiring you to vote might influence some of those less informed people to actually pay attention and understand the issues a little better.   I think the big thing here i when teaching students they need to start off learning how to use the less intuitive instruments like the VOR just as with most things in flying it is important not to get overly dependent on one thing.  The problem with the GPS is it is so easy especially for beginners to become over reliant on what the GPS says.  If the GPS were to cut out they would be completely lost.  That is why it is important to not over rely on the GPS, not because it is not a good and effective tool, but because it can make you a worse pilot in terms of ability if you let it.   Very Cool   I was just saying the truth.  I didn't like the pink just like most of the old community.  I like this subreddit, and its nice that it looks like its supposed to again.  I don't think anything I have been saying has been hateful or slanderous towards the subreddit or you.  I have just been saying the truth.  Read the context of the posts I have made and I think you will see that most cases I have even defended your recent actions putting the subreddit back the way it was.    I am sorry if there was any confusion.  Sometimes words can sound different when you are writing them than when someone else reads them.   I feel like this article is a little bit sensationalist.  Is the dawrf galaxy really made of dark matter?  it seems more likely that this galaxy just has significantly more mass than expected so we think it probably has some sort of dark matter.   Yea I agree he's a real person.  I talked to him a couple times and it seems like his main reasons behind the trolling was just boredom and apathy.  He says he didn't even make the changes, univerneema did.  He just didn't bother taking them down or getting rid of them.    I think the trolling was probably fun for a while, but now he is just trying to make things right.  I guess we will see.   They apologized before?   it wasn't inactive before all the pink crap happened, we were getting about 2 posts a week.  It was a pleasant discussion subreddit.  I hope it gets back the way it was.   Well at least i can look at the screen now without my eyes hurting.   yea i agree if you want to be serious, its time to un-ban everyone.   Yea, they could still store some fuel on the barge to refuel the helicopters out at sea, it is just working out he logistics of what needs to be on the platform when.   There seems to be some discussion saying they need two helicopters, could they not catch both fairings using the same helicopter?  Catch the first one, and then chase after the second one and catch it?   If only there was some large platform that had space for a helicopter or two to land.  If only they could land they could transport the helicopters downrange on this platform, and then when launch is imminent take off catch the fairings and fly back to land leaving this large platform available for some other sort of landing event.  If only.    LOL    Also hourly wage after taxes can change depending on how much you make.  You can receive no taxes, or you can get into higher tax brackets, it all depends on the amount you made at the end of the year.   It seems like some of these people knew what they were looking for, is it possible that some people are geocaching, and trashing the cache when they get there?   Thats hilarious somebody has to post a picture of that green dragon.   True but you can have the CG too far forward. The only way to fix it is to put more weight in the back further adding weight to the plane.    And it would significantly move the center of gravity forward.   Do you know how much 12 inches of metal would weigh.  That would be crazy heavy.  Like over 1000 lb   lol   It is not necessarily the people fault for believing it.  Most people are not that into space stuff, and would not be able to tell the difference between a legitimate organization like NASA and a bogus one like Mars One.  It is really the media's fault.  It would have taken 20 minutes of research to figure out Mars One was sketchy at best and more likely a scam.  But as usual these days.  it seems like the media did zero research before publishing exactly what Mars One told them.  And they wonder why people are not bothering to watch anymore.   Yea my bad, I was having a hard time figuring out if it was a cost per unit or a cost for both.  That was so cool when they launched two rovers back to back.   Yea and the sad part is the only reason this would happen is because the media has done such a crappy job doing any investigation into the claims Mars One is making.    Mars One = We will have colonists on mars in 10 years.  No real explanation how.  SpaceX = We are currently working on developing cheaper reusable rocket technology, as well as a larger more capable rocket that will be able to go to mars.  If everything keeps going well we will be looking at developing a more firm Mars plan in a few years.  Huge difference, although the media wont really care.   Yea i do like the discussions that get going in the tweets but sometimes I wish that there was more meat to the original post than just the headline.   I saw someone complain on the last thread about how we keep linking to tweets instead of actual news articles.  http://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/2z9spn/higherpower_f9_variant_to_debut_this_year_wont/cphb85n  So I went over to Spacenews.com and saw they had a news article.  I thought I would post the news article instead of just a tweet.   Wow that is awesome, trains are so cool.      Have you ever seen/been on a working steam engine, or is it just Diesel?  Also what are some innovations happening in the train world?  I have heard of things like Hybrid electric diesel engines (although I think those are already a thing).  Are there any big things coming up in the train world?   Thats awesome.  Just wanted to say that I loved trains when I was little, I wanted to be an Engineer.  Ironically from your post now I am working to become a pilot. lol  I still love trains, I think they are so cool, I wish we would use them more for passenger transport and not just cargo but we are getting there.    I doubt it the upgraded core is not going on Turk.  In fact at this stage Turk should be getting ready to be mounted and rolled out, they only have less than a week before scheduled launch.   I know what you mean, but I don't know if anyone is going to write a news article about engine upgrades.  Its kind of like breaking news, and then a couple days later you get a well thought out article about it from spacenews.com its give and take, and I don't mind because the comments are usually pretty interesting.   I think the whole trick with the BFR is the reusability aspect.  I think SpaceX is planning on having reusability completely worked out before they go to the BFR specifically because they can afford to be throwing away a rocket that expensive.   What is a common misconception people have about engineers?   Yea I almost felt bad for the people.  There was one girl from the US that was actually making plans with her husband about what they would do when she had to leave for Mars.  I just felt embarrassed for her.  I was just so obvious that none of it was going to happen, and by some act of god if it did, she would be amazingly unprepared, and in the hands of completely incompetent Mars One.   That is a great quote because it is so true of Microsoft.  Although i think now Microsoft is having trouble capitalizing on new trends, like smartphones, and tablets.  Unless they figure something out, I see them going the way of BlackBerry in the next 20 years.  It will take a lot longer though because Microsoft is so ingrained into the market compared to BlackBerry.   Well actually the rockets are a little bit of the problem, because right now they are too expensive for it to be practical to send people there and support them.   hahahaha    Where did you get that quote?  If that is true, that is epic.   Ohh yea Microsoft has never really innovated, but what I was trying to say is microsoft took advantage of the market and widely distributed the personal computer across the market.  Ask and you will find the majority of peoples first computer was a Microsoft.   Thanks I am quite comfortable with both JOSM and ID.  I doubt I'll have time this week, but hopefully I can contribute something.   It is sad how true this is the media just wants to build this up so when it inevitably falls on its face they can get even more traffic.  Notice how often the media does this, the will build something or someone up, and then wait for them to implode, and tear them apart.   the sad part is it hasn't been obvious to a lot of people, including the media in the USA who has done zero critical thinking about anything Mars One says.   So what exactly do we do, and how should we get started?   Yea thats how I feel, it is so refreshing to see the progress being made, and after years of getting used to the leisurely to snail pase of NASA's R D, it is amazing and almost takes your breath away to see how fast SpaceX is developing new technology.    Don't get me wrong, I love NASA, they are doing a lot of cool stuff, like [STEREO A and B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEREO) (Where all our cool sun pictures come from), [Opportunity Rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_\(rover\)), [Curiosity Rover](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_\(rover\)), [Dawn Ceres mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_\(spacecraft\)), [Messenger Mercury mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MESSENGER), [Cassini Saturn Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassini%E2%80%93Huygens), [Juno Jupiter Mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_\(spacecraft\)), and the big one coming up in only a couple months, [New Horizons Pluto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Horizons)!!! :D  and those are just the main active missions, there are tons that have come and gone in the last 5 years.     But I feel like as of late they have been progressively been getting more and more starved for cash, and politics has been really affecting their ability to get things accomplished.  I hope that SpaceX pushing the limits will indirectly help NASA get out of the funk its in.   What do you mean?  I feel like bill gates made some huge revolutions in the technology market.  I feel like microsoft even though it is kind of clunky was the bridge between computers in the early 90's and the computer we have today.  Computers early 90s = No internet doesn't do much.  Computers today = internet, google earth, tablet computers, smartphones, indirectly the Ipod, and basically every other personal electronic.  Plus in the 90's computers were not that common and internet looked like a middle schooler made all the web pages.  Today virtually every household has a computer, and the internet is the place it is today.  I would say he had a huge impact.     Yea I understand what you mean about it not quite being realistic but it had an accomplishable objective and it did it.  Mars One was just ridiculous.   Yea Mars 500 was just a case study of how people would handle the isolation and having to live with others for 500 days.  Mars One was actually saying they were going to set up a full out colony in 10 years.  Pretty rediculous                           Hello I came across [this 1973 Beetle](http://auto.mercadolibre.com.ec/MEC-406684146-volkswagen-escarabajo-1973-_JM) here in Ecuador.

To bad I can't fix the title [\(facepalm\)](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/001/582/picard-facepalm.jpg).    I have been working on space planes lately, and i want to make a high capacity one, but i find every time i try to build the wing sections the game acts like i have a bunch of little wings real close together instead of one giant solid wing.  basically in the hanger it looks like a big solid wing, but when i go to fly one part of the wing will flex independently of another.  How do you get the game to recognize that all the wing panels are connected?      I have found a joystick, the Genius Maxfighter f-31u Vibration. But before I buy it I want to know if it will work with Mac? does anyone have experience with Genius joysticks? I have been looking online for drivers, but the only ones I can find are for PC.

I have been looking online for drivers, but the only ones I can find are for PC.  Any suggestion?    Hello I have gotten xplane10, but unfortunetally where i am right now there are zero joysticks available.  I am wondering if anyone has experience using a ps3 controller or other normal videogame controller on xplane10.  I am on a mac, fully updated to yosemite,  and have access to many different types of gaming controlers, just not a joystick.  Any tips or experience is much apreciated,  I would like to start flying, but that is impossible until i fins some sort of controller.  and dont want to go out just willy nilly buying controllers.   From the point of view of one of the objects, what would the other object look like when you pass it?  Each object is moving at 99% the speed of light, How would the blue shift and then redshift appear to the observer?  What Else Would happen?     For fun what would happen if the two objects (lets say they are sun sized stars) were to hit directly head on during this encounter?    Even more fun other celestial objects, like neutron stars, or planets?      When You pull out onto the runway and the pilot gives the engines take off power they make a very specific sound which I can only describe as the sound of a sports car or something. What causes the engines to make this noise?   http://youtu.be/AYnGQZplJEw?t=30s   I linked to a video of the sound.         So I enjoy reading, and I enjoy airplanes, I am reading "Fate is the Hunter" by Ernest Kellogg Gann.  It is a great book for anyone who hasn't read it.  I was wondering if anybody has found some other books that are interesting and about flying like Fate is the Hunter is?

Musk has continued to reiterate this rough timeframe since. No pressure, Elon   Is it just me or does it seem like a lot of crimes in the USA that are not that serious require jailtime.  In light of the recent TIl about fathers not paying child suppor tgoing to jail, and the news about getting jail time for not being able to pay court fees, it is starting to seem like you can get sent to jail for some non violent crimes that really dont seem jail worthy.  Why does the USA send so many people to jail?   So I saw some stuff on the internet about electric airplanes, and i wanted to see what you guys thought.  It seems like they could be quite promissing if the price of batteries were to come down and range extended slightly.  what are your guyses thoughts?  http://evworld.com/news.cfm?newsid=28964  Here is an article about an electric Cessna, does anyone know what happened to it?

 Understanding math concepts helps build critical thinking skills.   Lime prices have risen from $.50 or so a lime  to $1.50. Is that enough evidence?    It is harder in this country to register and vote than to purchase a gun.   Bob Murray who is leading this fight is as anti-union as they come and a Tea Party supporter to boot.   The state has responsibility to treat all prisoners with dignity and honor no matter how heinous their crime. The state is not a criminal we are supposed to be better than that.   You can tell the quality of a country and its people by the way it treats, the poor, the disabled, the mentally fragile, the different and the criminals. We have a responsibility to force the state to treat those on the edges of society the way we would want to be treated.   It is not the role of the state to stoop to the level of the murderer.   This is state sponsored murder.   Is that because the Russians don't want to spoil their Cinco de Mayo celebrations.   So you reject the basis for all English based legal systems?   "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer",  ...as expressed by the English jurist William Blackstone in his seminal work, Commentaries on the Laws of England, published in the 1760s.  This is the basis of our legal system. So 96 percent is just not good enough.   Here is a [copy of the report.](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/report-appeals-court-judges-violated-ethics-laws)   Here is a [copy of the report.](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/report-appeals-court-judges-violated-ethics-laws)   A 2,000-year-old stonemasons chisel that may have been used in the construction of Jerusalems Western Wall has been unearthed at the bottom of the structure along with a number of Second Temple-era objects, claims an Israeili archaeologist  This is the lead paragraph of the story. The headline does not match the story.    The title is the first sentence of the AP story.   May be they will get there wish and secede.   I have used all my five free Dispatch stories for the month so this is not an option.    What do Badgercrats want to do? Establish the People's Republic of Madison (Wisconsin) or join socialist Canada, neither seems to be what they are looking for. /s    The story says more than 90% of Swiss workers make more that the proposed new minimum wage.   Now the crescendo of Republicans saying we're not racists. If it walks like a duck, talks like a duck it's a duck.  Until the GOP takes positive actions to remove racists from their ranks they will have to live with this analysis.   I guess the US constitution is not the constitution that governs Louisiana.   The only one worth impeaching is Cruz but I don't see where his actions have violated the Constitution.   That is because the Australian system is built to encourage voting and the US system is more and more about excluding voters.   President Obama saying the US will never forget 911 would not be world news.   Even if the tax liability is less then $2.4 billion, the idea that a company could can stash $8 billion in profits earned in US out of the reach of the government for whatever reason is an important story.   There are three types of ethics stories: it's illegal; it's unethical: it ought to be illegal or unethical. This story certainly falls into the third category.   The $8 billion is profits diverted. The $2.4 billion is the taxes that would have been paid on the $8 billion.    Or there will be a call to return to voting privileges for male property holders.   When GOP can not win using the current rules they just change the rules. This is what Republicans mean when they talk about democracy.   Isn't it amazing that Borowitz is so much smarter then Issa.   The headline I used was the original story headline when I posted the story.   Thanks. Sorry I posted the story. i will remove.   Thanks for replying on your cake day.   Sam Brownback   This is what the right would say is a win-win. Usually when this phrase is used it means the rich wins and everyone else loses (they say win).   This bill doesn't have a chance outside of the House. This bill is not about winning but currying favor with the mineral and energy extraction industries. It does put the GOP firmly in the anti-park and preservation camp.   So employers should be allowed to bar African-Americans  or other people of color because of their religious beliefs? That is the logical extension of your reasoning.   The idea they will serve no jail time will serve notice to others that the destruction of ancient formations are punishable with a slap on the wrist.  Let the vandalism begin. /s   McConnell and dignity aren't usually mentioned in the same sentence.   Making thousands on tens of thousands of trades adds up.   It is cheating to the GOP when you use the law to combat Republican attacks on poor people.   Republicans only support states rights when they agree with the states.   You know that is racist.   The Arab Spring was about opening up the political process to opposing views. The return to autocratic rule by the military has arrested the gains made during the last three years.    Iraq's close relations with Iran may mean they or their allies may get some of these weapons. Also Iraq move to a more authoritarian government seems to indicate that the weapons may end up being used on political opponents not supposed "terror organizations."   This is not going to turn out well.   It seems obvious but the idea that one party, the Republicans, are fighting to maintain that inequality should galvanize the rest of us to fight like hell to end that gap.   Kentucky has a strong tradition of trade unions even though they are a border state.   The OP supports US troops leaving.    Rand Paul is like a broken clock, he is right twice a day.    Karzai will be gone before Dec. 31st. No reason for him to stay and risk the millions if not billions he already stole.   The other NRA.   The chances of US forces "liberating" Crimea are none and never.   It didn't rocket back up until the Taliban was out of power.   The fields the Taliban closed down when they were in charge.   I hope we get out because of the human lives we have maimed and killed.   This has become part of the Pentagon's mission statement.   The South Koreans want us the Afghans don't.   We won't let the door hit us in the ass as we leave.    You bought the Kool-Aid. The ad was made to scare Ohioans into thinking that Jeep was going to switch production to China.

The wealthiest nation in the world should deny quality healthcare to its  poorest citizens. /s   That makes a lot of sense.    Unless than women wants a abortion or demands equal rights.   Yes, the Democrats are standing up to the Koch's but they need to standup to more of the monied interests that have been whittling away at safety, health and environmental regulations.   This is the slippery slope that was talked about when we ramped up security post 9-11. The CIA is prohibited from spying in the US and forget about the Senate.   Another blew against those who believe there is no pay inequality for women.   I don't think having a gun would solve this situation, unless you're talking about killing a law enforcement officer. That wouldn't be the the smartest solution.   And somehow CCA is more accountable. CCA has been running a hellhole of a prison in Idaho for years and the government is just now getting around to investigate them.   It is nice the Border Patrol decided to join the 21st century. The days of shooting rock throwers in the US ended decades ago, I thought.   To Republicans John McCain and Mitt Romney are moderates.   Pussy Riot was making a political statement about the role of the church in the "new" Russia.   Being famous. However, they are not in it for the money. Once again they are political performance artists not recording stars.   That can only mean they're in it for the money. s/  If they were money motivated they could have left Russia come to the US or UK and made a bundle. They did not. They are more political than musical.   Pussy Riot is not doing this for publicity they are political performance artists. This is about social commentary.   This is just one more attack on copyright laws.  Edited: Misspelled copyright   They don't sell albums they are political performance artists.   I don't know if most Russians are barbarians but most are afraid of any more change. They made one change in the last thirty years, a second change would be extremely hard. Pussy Riot is at the forefront of the next wave.   I don't know if that is the question.  Given the choice of standing idly by or fighting for what they believe in they have chosen the later. By leaving they would never have any influence over how Russia turns out.   But would you leave where you live if "far right authoritarians" took over power? One can flee or fight. Pussy Riot has chosen to fight and we should applaud them for their bravery.   They stay because they are not willing to leave the land that they love to the "far-right, authoritarian(s)" Would you?   Happy Cake Day!   It is popular among cultural snobs to dislike ComFest. They see themselves as being so much cooler than the event. What they forget is ComFest is whatever you want it to be.    Fat chance. Duke Energy runs NC along with Art Pope. Probably the best that can be expected is another fine. Hopefully the fine will be significant but somehow I doubt it.    The Chilean military was working with the US military before and after the coup. Please understand without US support there would not have been a coup.

Good to see Ken Cuccinelli landed on his feet. /s   A lot less impressive than the price tag.   Allende presente!   This is another Ham boondoggle. He is using the local government to lower his interest rate and then building an Ark which at best would be valued in the millions not multi-millions.   As we know US intelligence is always accurate. The fact that he is acting behind the scenes leads to real questions if he is who the US says he is. Killing him is the easy way out not the best way.   I find your use of the term "backwater ape" to be an offensive choice of wording at best and racist at worse. I'd hope you'd reconsider your comment.   Yes, cars have been a public health issue. That is why air bags and seat belts were added. Manufacturers added other safety features to make vehicles safer because so many people died using their product.   It is always something other than the guns. When so many people stop dying from guns it will not be a public health issue.   Will they change their minds if Gov. Brewer vetoes the bill? The actions of the legislature on this and other issues should make the Hispanic National Bar decide to stay home veto or not.   If one was looking for a worse case scenario, I'd choose a school district police force with AR-15s and school kids.   It is news to the GOP.   Not the case with Cruz but is true about W.   You are correct but not many are down right stupid. Many may lack common sense or well developed deductive reasoning but they have something upstairs to be at Harvard.   It is not that Harvard educated Cruz is not intelligent but rather that he is more interested in moving the GOP to the right than trying to prove that he is the smartest guy in the room.   These facts have had little impact on far-right and the conservative religious community in the US.   That's correct but the use of scientists to somehow verify his position is quite unusual. I know he is looking for a way out but the opposition will see thru his charade.   What plausible theory about homosexuals would call for their imprisonment?    What do scientists have to do with homosexuality?   This is what the GOP is best at deregulation.   The "may have" relates to the number of dead not the fact that civilians were killed.   This is the confirmation of those reports.   Stop talking sense. Where would libertarians be without conspiracies about the Fed, detention camps and the Trilateral Commission?   Not quite sure that this journalism or propaganda but it certainly will have some impact on newsgathering.   Then they don't want to be in the EU. It is their choice but I'm sure their economy will take a big hit if they ditch the EU.   To some a mystery is only made better by spinning it into a conspiracy.    I don't know if  this is an accounting issue but a contractual issue. More than likely the contract CCA has with Idaho calls for a minimum number of correctional officers on duty at a given time. These accounting errors allowed CCA to pay less in guard time than their contract called for.   Since the system is Linux based that is really possible. To go one step further in spy v. spy mode program in your adversaries facial features so if he captures the weapon he would shoot himself.   Thanks   This is the first sentence of the story. I did no editoriaiizing. Are you saying phys.org editorialized? If so can I resubmit under its original title Clever technology decodes more information from single photons   Would he say Jews are overly sensitive about the Holocaust?  EDITED: Grammar   [A new story this evening](http://bigstory.ap.org/article/apnewsbreak-nc-delays-coal-ash-deal-duke) shows the NC environmental agency was just about to settle fines for the Dan River spill for just under 100K.They are pulling their settlement.   Please take your bigotry someplace else.   This is not extraordinary news but how many people thought that Afghan forces would deteriorate this badly before the US forces left the country.   At some point he will have to answer the question if he wants to President. Better that he answers the question two years before the primaries not in the middle of the election.   Didn't hurt dope fiends Bush, Clinton and Obama become president.   No one is questioning him for being a hypocrite but rather that in 2014 he could not say he smoked. Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama all have admitted smoking.  Who cares if a Senator from Florida smoked a joint?   Why it so hard for politicians to admit they smoked? They are living in the 1980s not the 21st century.   After the 4th if the Republicans gain control of the Senate their insanity will reach new heights.   And all African-Americans are lazy and all Jews are cheap. /s   Are the Europeans saying they will allow "too big to fail" banks to go under?   I's like to see a separate Environmental Justice category. Am I missing solar, wind and nuclear power? Where would cutting edge technologies like thermal and tidal fit in? I would also like a category for activism.   This my comment I posted to the story about their tagging:  This is the story's exact quote:  In 2006, Mactec, an independent contractor, inspected the waste pond and found "potentially serious seepage." Duke Energy was told to watch its underground pipes for leaks, according to documents from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  Do you have any issues with my story headline?    This is the story's exact quote:  In 2006, Mactec, an independent contractor, inspected the waste pond and found "potentially serious seepage." Duke Energy was told to watch its underground pipes for leaks, according to documents from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  Do you have any issues with my story headline?   The Olympics are already a fantasy. We should be able to see the games warts and all.   The Republican credo: When you can not win within the rules, change the rules.    Sorry I didn't see it in the new queue or on the front page.     Don't be sexist Palin/Ford. Isn't Canada the 51st state? /s   Once a buffoon always a buffoon.   How much money have the Republicans returned to corporate criminals like Bob Murray, the Koch brothers or Art Pope? This is just another Rand Paul political ploy to get him on TV.   We're too interested in Chris Christie, Sochi and Philip Seymour Hoffman. If only some celebrity or sporting event was happening in North Carolina people would be more interested.   Actually, yes. They did look similar to his art. It's funny, people see a big nose and scream jew. Actually, that's fucking hilarious. People so concerned with walking on eggshells that they make themselves more retarded.   What makes people look retarded is their attempts to excuse away stereotyping bankers as Jews. This is common imaginary even though most bankers are not Jewish. The idea that you have no sensitivity to the stereotyping says more about you and your political baggage.   I don't know how real this bill is or just a ploy to gain for votes for Sen. Vitter in his race for Governor.   Republicans have always claimed they are better for the economy even though the data proves this claim false. The problem is many voters believe it is true.   Maybe Republicans can now understand the CBO report. I doubt it. They never let the facts get in the way of their talking points.  The other part of these 2.3 million FTE jobs is that that they are not being lost but unfilled. Some of those hours will go to the unemployed lowering even further the unemployment rate. Now that is real scary to the GOP and their talking point that the economy can not and will not improve under a Democrat.   If the sides were Lutherans vs. Methodists would you st that?   Notice he didn't say he didn't do it but rather he is being targeted for political reasons.   Why file charges after he failed to have any impact on the 2012 election? D'Souza seems to be logic challenged.   There is no might when you give money to your friends to make campaign contributions in their name to avoid contribution limits.   I'm  interested in a felony conviction with some jail time. I think a plea deal will involve no jail time and what message will that send.   Please no plea deal. It is time to show these offenders that this is not some joke where the only penalty is a slap on the wrist. These are felonies and those who destroy our parks should be treated as felons.   The national media is leading with this story on the nightly news. Christie's ship may have sailed.   The battle for the supposed soul of the GOP is staring to heat up again.  EDITED : typo   But certainly not below the station of the Koch's to use this opportunity to make political points. The Kochs are public figures so either they should grow a tougher skin or crawl back to where they came from.   Here is a [link to the report.](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/caac.21215/abstract)   This might be a reason why the board made this decision. [Here is an article showing the corporate conflicts of two of the board members.](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-29/reef-board-members-in-conflict-of-interest-claims/5052558)   Here is the summary from [Science.](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6170/516)    It may be the wrong thing for the country but it is good for mobilizing the GOP base for the 2014 election. Which path do you think the Republicans will choose?   The conspiracists believe that the world is run by a cabal while the gullible have not yet fully bought into all the theories.    Conspiracists know and look for conspiracies. Gullible people believe it is true but don't necessarily believe that all these conspiracies are tied together in a world view.   I've said my piece.   There are no conversations just trolling.   Another in a long line of offenses done by President Obama which were perfectly fine and necessary under a Republican President.   It seems like you don't understand that you are a controversial figure. The way to back down the rhetoric is not to want to lead every subreddit in which your name is mentioned.   You mod enough communities to gain experience. You do not need to add another one to your belt.   Other communities may not mind you but there are a significant number that do. But if all you want is a fight then continue to demand to be added to this and every other subreddit that disagrees with you.   Why do you have to mod every subreddit that wants to question your motive and intentions? Why not be like any other redditor and engage in discussion without having to have the power?     Who knows if u/Luster is not an alt for u/TheRedditPope. All I know is u/luster has a bad attitude, conservative politics and overreaches in trying to stifle his enemies.   The idea that you want to be a mod r/politicalmoderation just bolsters the belief that all you are interested in is stifling discussion on Reddit. It doesn't matter how good or bad a moderator you are. By allowing you to mod this site you will successfully mute this community. It seems your only interest is in stopping people from fingering you for the damage you have caused to our communities.   The name of of this website is Reddit not TheRedditPope. You want influence at this subreddit speak but leave the moderating to others who are more capable and honest.   [I read it happened about 4-5 days ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalModeration/comments/1wd6tq/utheredditpope_removed_from_rpolitics_after/)   Too bad the thousands who lose food stamps in this bill can not get high on hemp.   Here is [Nature's new summary](http://www.nature.com/news/acid-bath-offers-easy-path-to-stem-cells-1.14600) and links to the original article.   It better include voter fraud because that is the only way he can win.   Run, Donald, Run. We want to see you lose so badly.   Why are you getting involved in this discussion? I thought you are no longer a moderator of r/politics. It was pulled but it may be back now to save face.   Here is the comment made to me by Luster in a response to mod mail.  [I did not remove it, but I agree with its removal](http://www.reddit.com/message/messages/1hy7uq)  You can see Luster later in the thread is looking to ban me for being a shill for the AP, the largest new organization in the US. He doesn't even know how AP works. I have never been paid by AP for writing anything. But facts probably will not be enough to stop the r/politics mods from doing what they are going to do.   Or when you've destroyed your target you move on. Please don't let the door hit you in the ass.   My comment to them:  The man whose song, We Shall Overcome, was adopted to lead the Civil Rights movement; the man whose songs led the Vietnam War protests; a leader in the struggle for human rights, social justice has died but his death is off-topic for politics. I really don't know what country you live in. This is one insult too many. Please leave the stage now your judgement is flawed. Your rules are inane and your political prejudices are too big.  EDITED: Grammar   He was the voice of generations of social activists. While many people may think they don't know Pete's music his obit show that his songs are part of the fabric of the world's musical fabric. He was a giant. He will be missed. Goodnight Pete.   From Cuba to South Africa from Selma to San Francisco the world is a little less joyful without Pete. His influence on millions through his activism and music was an inspiration to generations. I know his music will continue to influence millions more for years to come. Goodnight Pete.   He certainly didn't fake taking 26 minutes to die.  According to officials that is possible./s   They are trying to dump their liability before the lawsuits start   And there is no racism because there is no racism within his own family.   Thanks for pointing out that some progressive/left sites are not stellar examples of journalism. That doesn't mean they should be banned but they should not dominate r/politics. It is sites like alternet and other fringe left sites that allow the right-wing mods to make false equivalents between left and right websites. There is nothing on the left that is equivalent of breitbart.com or Fox News.   Sorry for the sloppy phrasing. Jews were victims and the rich are trying to equate themselves with Jews even though there is not the slightest equivalence.   The rich are portraying themselves as victims just like the Jews. This analogy is just despicable.    Only if you want to be as irrelevant as Arizona Republicans.   What's next Bary Goldwater was a secret Democrat because he once voted in favor of a Democratic bill?   Karzai doesn't want to share anymore. He thinks he can make a deal with the Taliban which he cannot make if the US is still in the picture. Good luck with that.   [Some of the settlers who rioted in the West Bank town of Hebron over the weekend gave IDF soldiers the Nazi salute, an officer who was wounded during the riots](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3200503,00.html)  and  [Settler acquitted in Nazi salute case](http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3719860,00.html)  These are examples.   But if the US stays he is afraid that he and his friends could not finish looting the country.   The racists come out of the woodwork when Hitler is mentioned.   Because a math literate population is not needed in the computer age.   Why does it keep happening to Republicans. It is because they have no sensitivity about racial, gender, sexual preference and religious issues. These are not jokes, they never were jokes. These attacks are attempts to stereotype and demean other people. Until you understand this, it will continue to happen especially to Republicans and other like minded conservatives.   Far right Jews have used Nazi salutes against moderate Jewish leaders. However, the leaders faced with this provocation never mentioned Hitler.   This endless string of apologizes is getting tiresome. When photos like this are not floating around Republican circles they won't be posted.  	187

 Oh shit - sorry I didn't realize I had already posted this specific shot.  After the popularity of yesterdays post I wanted to share more of the place.  My bad - wasn't intentional             My set is called "When the Music's Over" from The Doors song.  I've named the set that because the woman who lived here had a vast music collection as well as a number of instruments and an amazing old Gramophone   Yup - that's what I did, then I put it all back where I found it            I've thought about that - but what causes most dust?  Human tissue, hair etc - this home has none of that anymore and nothing to stir it up.  Aside from a small hole in the roof in one room, this house is sealed up from any elements    It's well sealed and preserved and has only been visited by a handful of people   Thanks :)   ah did!   I did :P They are eating this up!   thats very cool!   same   hah there is, and they're all over it!  http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/   Many other pics here  http://www.flickr.com/photos/rockandrollfreak/sets/72157637596393633/  or here  https://www.facebook.com/train_subject246  I am updating new pics every day     yes - i did stage the shot to show the cool items that I found, then I put them all back!   sorry dude :P   I've been trying to piece it all together. Pretty sure the man of the house died in the late 90's and the house has been abandoned about 13 years. Most of the oldest shit was upstairs, lots of old stuff downstairs too though!   haha   I know I know!!   They are fake plants - green yes...but fake                              Thank you.   Just me and a friend   Empty walls is from the large white house that I over processed   Didn't catch the brand but its acoustic   Sorry rather not say   By luck!   I found two of those KFC piggy banks in there!!  That's some old shit!   I thought the same thing - then I checked and it;s just a door to a hallway that leads from the kitchen :(   Thanks!!!!   Your roommates would be lots of raccoons and you would be picking raccoon shit for months - it's everywhere!!!   I'm certainly considering it - while it's not up to me to bring the family back in touch with what's rightfully theirs - I kind of want to.  There is an early 20th century turntable in there, the kind with the big wind up arm on the side - easily worth a mint!   It was incredibly sad and we never knew what was next, what was around the corner or what was inside a drawer!                        Genesee Road just south of hwy 219   hahaha thanks!  It caught your eye right??   Not a touch of HDR in this shot               Milton Ontario   Milton Ontario   I dont know what that says.....but thanks :)                        Thanks PenName, appreciate the feedback this is how I am able to learn and improve.                                Thanks everyone!   Thank You!   Thanks all!   Thanks all!                              nope...New York                  Thisaintnoparty - I was planning to hit that one too, but I noticed a camera pointing right in the area where I would have walked by when inside   yes, that's correct Canadave  ISTFM - you gotta be sneaky!                        Nope, that's a raw file with some tweaks to colour, shadows etc - no fancy edits to this one.               It was around 1995 when it closed and hell yes - definitely wore a good respirator for this one!!   1995ish                                 Thanks for the comment.yes there's many features in these old places that would look great in a home           	128

Dude that's messed up, but I hope to hear more of your story soon.   Zombie, OOooh what if she's a zombie   Well all I can say is..... what? I can't even right now, just what, what.   I would have locked my door, ran into the closet with the gun, and had the police on speed dial.   Yeah, were you?    I was thinking the same thing   She's too adorable! Awww the feels.   You should have smashed those garden gnomes or at least buried them.    What how could you leave her like that? Even if she was freaking out you would have been better off with her.   Wait, wait, wait so these things are actually real?   Nope just evil nurses.   	15
 I get it. Cuz that's his name. Clever.    My body heals itself on on its own    Drizzt Do'Urden   Legion:Skin deep by Brandon Sanderson is a fantasy novel that explores this idea. It's about 100 pages long and is an entertaining yet interesting read    I literally cannot stop laughing at that edit lol I'm dying Oh God reddit is killing me    Post a really clever and funny comment    Yeah sorry buddy. That's just a tad weird    Sorry in advance buuuuuttttttt he sounds like a dick. (I'm a guy btw) You make it sound like you're trying and you want to be great for him, and he is just using you as a hole for sex. The fact that he "doesn't talk during sex" really shouldn't be an excuse for why he isn't helping you build your confidence. Now I realize that telling you this isn't going to help at all, it isn't really constructive. This is just feedback and my opinion on what I'm noticing from your post. I would suggest working out. Many people that I know who had similar problems with confidence found themselves growing more comfortable with their bodies and abilities as lovers when they exercise frequently. Honestly sex feels great. I have sex all the time and it doesn't really matter what she does, it always feels nice. If she does a little extra stuff that feels cool too, but almost no matter what you do he will enjoy it and like it a lot. Don't freak out about it :)      Stupid autocorrect    WOOOOOOOOAAAAHHHHHH COOOOOOOLLLLL   If two organisms are able to engage in Intercourse and produce fertile offspring then they are of the same species.

    As seen in the [Construction cam] (http://www.cubuffs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=209458799) the beams are going up. The first beam was erected a couple weeks ago. The height looks odd because a good amount of the facility is underground from the camera angle. The facility is 80ft tall with a full sized track surrounding the football field.        Specifically referring to Bernie Sanders plan             I had been using protein shake mixes for years on and off without much gaining. It finally hit me one day that I wouldn't eat for hours after having a shake, they made me feel too full and slightly nauseous. I instead started using preworkout and creatine only, I had used them with shakes beforehand. I drink 3-4 glasses of chocolate milk each day, two immediately after a workout. I noticed I was eating more and now have gained  20 lbs since giving up protein shakes a few months ago. I'm not sure why I'm posting this except to tell anyone who gets irritation from shakes to try something else. There's no universal meal plan for gainers, just meet you calorie goal and eat "healthy" foods.                                  https://twitter.com/cubuffsturf/status/599189348534222848                              The rules- you can only be a fan if:  You attended/plan to attend the school  An immediate family member attended the school Or you live within 150 miles of the school.   Which school are you a fan of and why?  Also, does this differ from your flair?       I know nothing about the process of adding intramural sports but is anyone interested in intramural lacrosse? I'm guessing the only way to make it happen would be playing no-contact or possibly using women's sticks and rules. Liability comes with physicality. The school has the lacrosse field and goals. Participants would likely need their own equipment. The only real cost to the school would be more refs.  If anyone knows more about the process or works with the rec center it would be great to get the ball rolling. Lacrosse is the fastest growing sport and Colorado could become the lacrosse capital of the West since the outlaws professional team is good and DU won nationals.

Students can play yard games or compete against football players in skills stations such as throwing, kicking, catching, 40 yard dash etc. As a student I'm looking forward to it and was wondering if other schools do this. Specifically with CU, its a great way for the program to branch out to the students who have formed some hostility for the program.

I'll have a few weeks between leases this summer and am wondering how people manage it. I have a few friends I can crash with but also would like advice on other options. I was looking at getting a small storage locker somewhere, I only have a few things, but hear it's expensive and usually few openings.                      I'm debating finishing my PH certificate which will be mostly sociology department courses or dropping the certificate to take health economics which seems more useful. I cannot do both because of when classes are available and I am graduating in the fall. I want to get a job in health administration and possibly continue on to graduate school for a MHA. Which path above should I take? My major is in physiology which isn't direclty applicable  to Health administration but I do know some people who landed jobs with similar majors.                   Last year I took classes both summer terms so I still had my rec center membership. This year I'm doing the July term only. Do I get a membership for just July or the whole summer?                     ###NCAA Basketball     [**^Click ^here ^to ^create ^a ^Game ^Thread**](http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1pnabg/updated_game_thread_format/)  ---  [](/AwayTeamFlair) **Colorado** ( 0-0 ) @  [](/Seattle) **Seattle** ( 0-0 )     Tip-Off: 10:00pm (ET)  -  3/23    Venue: [Connolly Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connolly_Center) Seattle Recreation Center  -----------------------------------------------------------------    **[Join the live IRC chat on freenode, #redditcbb](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=#redditcbb)**   -----------------------------------------------------------------     **Radio:**   [Colorado](http://www.cubuffs.com/mediaPortal/player.dbml? amp;id=1364477 amp;catid=0 amp;KEY= amp;DB_OEM_ID=600)  **Streams:**    [Seattle] (http://www.goseattleu.com/mediaPortal/player.dbml? amp;db_oem_id=18200 amp;key=RXMDEGWSUJDCQIO.20150323223645)       -----------------------------------------------------------------      **Thread Notes:**        - Discuss whatever you wish.

 Mine is an 08.         Your friend, sir, is a bad ass.      Congrats man stay strong!   I'm so sorry for your loss.       I'm 27. Legend of the hidden temple was a popular gameshow for kids in the early/mid 90s.   As someone who comes from an entirely Jewish family, I just want to say thank you.         Captain Power and one of his nemeses (whose name I cant remeber...lord dread, maybe?)   Yeah I'm on medication. It took years to figure out what worked. But life is pretty good now. I hope your friend gets the help he needs. Tell him I'm rooting for him. I'll definitely let you know if I get his drawing as a tattoo. Does he have any other drawings?      You are truly a saint.  	16

 I'm going to be posting an update on my progress soon. I just took this picture the other day, and I was like,"whoa, is this really me? Do I really look good!?" Haha! Thanks!   Thanks! Me too!    I'll pos an updated progress pic soon! Low carb and lots of exercise mostly. Thanks!   I may do a tutorial video in the next day or two. Thank you!   Nope! The inside is covered with yarn so the backside of the tabs don't touch your water bottle at all. Thank you!      This made my day!   I agree.   I have no idea what that is, but I'm sure this will die down soon. It's just every where right now and they seem to be on a chopping block at the moment. It's kind of annoying.   I just don't understand why overeating and not exercising is now something to be proud of. And then fit women who take care of themselves are being ridiculed. It's kind of backwards, and really confusing. I don't understand why you changed the subject either...   Wow you like like a completely different person! Great job!    I actually used to visit it quiet often in its early days. But it did start to get out of hand with the bullying. I remember one post was of an overweight person's fitbit dashboard. They were proud of themselves for reaching all of their goals for a day, and FPH wanted to make fun of them for it. That, to me was completely ridiculous. And then they made fun of a guy last week who ran a 5k in 38 minutes. That's a pretty good time, even for a fit person. It's the obnoxious and entitled obese people who enrage me. The one's who talk about 'thin privilege' and say they are 'triggered' when they see a thin person. That is what I found infuriating. Not people trying to better themselves.   I don't think I would be half as fit or as motivated as I am without Fatpeoplehate. It was seriously the best motivation for me. I posted my weight loss to progresspics and it exploded onto their page because it came out that I didn't support HAES and thought Tess Munster was a bad influence. I rarely commented on anything over there, and I never posted anything, but it has seriously helped me a lot. I lost 80 pounds and I've kept it off for over a year.   Fat people are not inoccent. As I recall, isn't gluttony considered a sin? And I'm pretty sure it has been frowned upon for several millennia.    Yeah, reddit just tied its own noose. It's probably going to turn into a tumblr wanna-be site now.    One of my home town staples. I love Shrimp and Grits! I'll have to try this soon, your's looks delicious.   As a straight chick, holy FUCK! You are gorgeous! I don't know if I wanna be you or be on you.   I think we can make an exception in Cheryl Haworth's case. She's actual muscle under that layer of fat. Props to her.   WOW! You look badass! I wish I could look that cool....     	20

 I'm with you here.   Hello Timmy,  What specs are you using, more specifically, your motherboard name.  Try the following  * Ensure that your hard drives inside of your computer case are **properly connected.** Look for the name of the hard drives as well for the next possible solution.   * In the BIOS boot sequence, make sure that the hard drive with your operating system installed on it is first in the boot sequence. If you are not sure how to do this, it may be in your "advanced bios features". or you can boot up the computer and spam (usually) F8, depending on your motherboard, to tell it which hardware you want it to boot up from (select your OS hard drive)   * If you find this too confusing, try unplugging all your hard drives and optical readers, except for the one with your OS installed. And ensure your HDD is first in the BIOS boot sequence.   * If the boot sequence is not the issue, then I'd recommend updating your BIOS, simply google your motherboards name and look for the latest BIOS drivers. You may need another computer and a USB stick in order to do this. There are many tutorials on how to do this. Check your BIOS version and write it down before doing so, in order to save time, incase it's the newest version.   * Finally, if all else fails, try clearing the CMOS, this can either be done in the BIOS menu somewhere, or usually there is a small black button on the motherboard itself. Press it while the computer has turned on, and it will restart, hopefully fixing your issue.   Goodluck! Any help you need, ask away!   Windows 10 :s.  I don't think there will be any privacy on Windows 10. NSA.

 Just got a pair of Clarks Desert Boots in the mail, but I am confused on the sizing. I wear an 11 in Vans and dress shoes, so I ordered a 10.5 in CDBs. However, the shoes still feel somewhat big. Should I send them back and size down to a 10? Do CDBs usually fit loosely? (The fit of the shoe isn't bad, it just isn't perfect).   I'm in love with [these](http://us.puma.com/en_US/pd/el-seevo-canvas-mens-sneakers/pna887706697532.html?selvar=true), and for $36, how can you not get them?

 Comment for later   I guess it depends on where you live. Pretty much all of the schools near me have drug/bullying problems, nothing major but enough to garner attention. The short time I did go to a "real" school wasn't bad at all though. In fact I rather enjoyed the whole experience! All my friends who were home-schooled and went to school are very happy.   When I was younger my parents had a lot of input about what I was doing for school work. These past couple of years I've been overseeing myself mostly. No tutors per say, but my mom knows a lot of teachers and she sometimes gets them to do something like, a weekly math class for a month or so.   Worth it? Just from interacting with teens your own age everyday? It's cool that you stayed home-schooled for so long, a couple of my friends decided to go to school a little younger than that. Most of them went to school at around 11 or 12 years old   I am 16 and I'm from The United States of America. Sorry about that, I'll add that to the description!

Me, in an orange t-shirt and brown shorts playing tag with my cousins. I remember this because it was *the moment* I realized I existed. I know it sounds weird, but at that moment I stopped playing for a second and thought: "I'm here"  I then went on to win that game of tag.   The fact that no one knows if there's an afterlife of any kind. Thinking about this used to REALLY freak me out when I was younger, I mean full on panic attacks. It still makes me sick to my stomach when I think about it now.  We don't know and we'll never know what happens to our souls/thoughts when we die.   How much did you have to be goaded in doing an AMA?   Finally! Me and my cousin have been making weird and wonderful flavor combos for ages. We've tried at least 2 dozen different things. Some of our favorites include       Potato chips + Cake frosting   Jell-O + Mashed potatoes    Asparagus + Raspberry jelly   Bananas + Maple syrup   Tomatoes + Baked Beans    And cinnamon, lots and lots of cinnamon. We put that on almost everything: Pizza, salad, eggs, soup, sandwiches, hamburgers and even on fruit!

 Caption:  Successful Flight Through Enceladus Plume The Cassini spacecraft has weathered the Monday, Nov. 2, 2009, flyby of Saturns moon Enceladus in good health and has been sending images and data of the encounter back to Earth. Cassini had approached Enceladus more closely before, but this passage took the spacecraft on its deepest plunge yet through the heart of the plume shooting out from the south polar region. Scientists are eagerly sifting through the results.  In this unprocessed image, sunlight brightens a crescent curve along the edge of Saturn's moon Enceladus and highlights its misty plume. The image was captured by Cassini's narrow-angle camera as the spacecraft passed about 190,000 kilometers (120,000 miles) over the moon. This image has not been validated or calibrated. A validated/calibrated image will be archived with the NASA Planetary Data System in 2010.   At its closest point on Nov. 2, Cassini flew about 100 kilometers (60 miles) above the surface of Enceladus.  Since the discovery of the plume in 2005, scientists have been captivated by the enigmatic jets. Previous flybys detected water vapor, sodium and organic molecules, but scientists need to know more about the plumes composition and density to characterize the source, possibly a liquid ocean under the moons icy surface. It would also help them determine whether Enceladus has the conditions necessary for life.  Mission managers did extensive studies to make sure the spacecraft could fly safely through the plumes and not use an excessive amount of propellant.

Since 1975, the test stands have supported testing of the Space Shuttle main engines. The last planned test was conducted in July of 2009.  In this photo, the A-2 Test Stand peered out from a thick blanket of fog during the early morning hours of Oct. 28, 2009. This photo was taken from the top of the B Test Stand.  The A-1 and A-2 test stands are transitioning to support J-2X engine testing for the Constellation Program, while the B-1/B-2 test stand will support stage testing. For the first time since the 1960s, a new test stand, called A-3, is under construction with a scheduled completion date of 2011. The A-3 test stand will be 300 feet tall and will enable engineers to conduct simulated high-altitude testing up to 100,000 feet.

The hundreds of images combined into this view were taken beginning on the 1,906th Martian day (or sol) of Spirit's mission on Mars (May 14, 2009) and ending on Sol 1943 (June 20, 2009).   Near the center of the image, in the distance, lies Husband Hill, where Spirit recorded views from the summit in 2005. For scale, the parallel tracks are about 1 meter (39 inches) apart. The track on the right is more evident because Spirit was driving backwards, dragging its right-front wheel, which no longer rotates.   The bright soil in the center foreground is soft material in which Spirit became embedded after the wheels on that side cut through a darker top layer. The composition of different layers in the soil at the site became the subject of intense investigation by tools on Spirit's robotic arm.  In recent weeks, Engineers have been using test rovers on Earth to prepare for extracting the sand-trapped Spirit rover. While amnesia-like symptoms in recent days might delay the start of planned drives by Spirit geared towards extricating it, the Mars Exploration Rover team remains hopeful. "If they are intermittent and infrequent, they are a nuisance that would set us back a day or two when they occur. If the condition becomes persistent or frequent, we will need to go to an alternate strategy that avoids depending on flash memory, " said Project Manager John Callas of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In these amnesia events, Spirit fails to record data from the day's activities onto the type of computer memory -- non-volatile "flash" memory -- that can retain the data when the rover powers down for its energy-conserving periods of "sleep."   Spirit has worked on Mars for more than 69 months in what was originally planned as a three-month mission.   lol   giving palin the shaft   Caption: NASA's Ares I-X rocket is seen on Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., Monday, Oct. 26, 2009. The flight test of Ares I-X, scheduled for today, Oct. 27, 2009, will provide NASA with an early opportunity to test and prove flight characteristics, hardware, facilities and ground operations associated with the Ares I.   Image Credit: NASA/Bill Ingalls   Caption: This high-resolution picture from the HiRISE camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter shows twisting dark trails criss-crossing light-colored terrain on the Martian surface. Newly formed trails like these had presented researchers with a tantalizing mystery but are now known to be the work of miniature wind vortices known to occur on the red planet, in other words Martian dust devils. Such spinning columns of rising air heated by the warm surface are also common in dry and desert areas on planet Earth. Typically lasting only a few minutes, dust devils become visible as they pick up loose red-colored dust leaving the darker and heavier sand beneath intact. Ironically, dust devils have been credited with unexpectedly cleaning the solar panels of the Mars rovers.   Image Credit: NASA, HiRISE, MRO, LPL (U.

Closer in height to the hulking Saturn V moon rockets than the space shuttle, Ares I-X looks unlike any rocket that's ever stood at Launch Complex 39. But it blends familiar hardware from existing programs with newly developed components.  Four first-stage, solid-fuel booster segments are derived from the Space Shuttle Program. A simulated fifth booster segment contains Atlas-V-based avionics, and the rocket's roll control system comes from the Peacekeeper missile. The launch abort system, simulated crew and service modules, upper stage, and various connecting structures all are original.

Bright soil in the left half of the image is loose, fluffy material churned by the rover's left-front wheel as Spirit, driving backwards, approached its current position in April 2009 and the wheel broke through a darker, crusty surface.  Spirit used its front hazard-avoidance camera to take this image. The turret of tools at the end of the rover's robotic arm is positioned with the Moessbauer spectrometer up and the rock abrasion tool extending toward the right. Spirit's right-front wheel, visible in this image, has not worked since 2006. It is the least-embedded of the rover's six wheels at the current location, called "Troy."  Spirit and its twin, Opportunity, have been working on Mars for more than 58 months in what were originally planned as 3-month missions on Mars.  Image Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech    Full caption: Friction Stir Weld This close-up view of the friction stir weld tack tool used to manufacture of space shuttle external tanks shows the process of tack welding barrel panels together. Barrels were previously fabricated using traditional fusion welding, but friction stir welding is different in that the materials are not melted. A rotating tool pin uses friction and applied pressure to join the 20-foot longitudinal panels together.   Friction stir welding is the most recent upgrade to the space shuttle's external tank, the largest element of the shuttle and the only element that is not reusable. The new welding technique utilizes frictional heating combined with forging pressure to produce high-strength bonds virtually free of defects. Friction stir welding transforms the metals from a solid state into a "plastic-like" state, and then mechanically stirs the materials together under pressure to form a welded joint. Invented and patented by The Welding Institute, a British research and technology organization, the process is applicable to aerospace, shipbuilding, aircraft and automotive industries. One of the key benefits of this new technology is that it allows welds to be made on aluminum alloys that cannot be readily fusion arc welded, the traditional method of welding.

This image of NGC 6240 contains new X-ray data from Chandra (shown in red, orange, and yellow) that has been combined with an optical image from the Hubble Space Telescope originally released in 2008. In 2002, Chandra data led to the discovery of two merging black holes, which are a mere 3,000 light years apart. They are seen as the bright point-like sources in the middle of the image.  Scientists think these black holes are in such close proximity because they are in the midst of spiraling toward each other -- a process that began about 30 million years ago. It is estimated that they holes will eventually drift together and merge into a larger black hole some tens or hundreds of millions of years from now.   caption: Some of the coldest and darkest dust in space shines brightly in this infrared image from the Herschel Observatory, a European Space Agency mission with important participation from NASA.

Liftoff was at 6:51 p.m. EDT from Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The first attempt to launch GOES-O, on June 26, was scrubbed due to thunderstorms. The latest Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite, GOES-O was developed by NASA for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. Each of the GOES satellites continuously provides observations of 60 percent of the Earth including the continental United States, providing weather monitoring and forecast operations as well as a continuous and reliable stream of environmental information and severe weather warnings. Once in orbit, GOES-O will be designated GOES-14, and NASA will provide on-orbit checkout and then transfer operational responsibility to NOAA.

He was a champion of the Civil Rights Movement. He's a proponent of equal rights across the board, solid energy policy, sound fiscal policy, of diplomacy, of good education for all children and adults, and has a solid record supported widely by people in both parties on foreign policy. He also is primarily responsible for drunken driving and, subsequently, the death of a person.  That you, subby, choose to define him by a horrible, unforgivable mistake he made without taking into account the fact that he has worked tirelessly for longer than you've probably even been alive to improve the world in which we live means that you have a problem with the progress he represents, and not particularly with the woman whose life you cheapen by defining him by her death.

 Wow..    titanium backup, the best in my opinion   really? thanks cause I thought that was mine problem!   your welcome mate     Its winter in Australia right now  hahaha sorry I didn't thought about it.. I recreated the logo from scratch. [here the psd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3jagjlacGj2MXQzUmdpeE41RGc/view?usp=sharing)   I run Win 7 x64 with 8 GB Ram and with Photoshop CC 2014 I didn't have any problem. Then I did a format and upgraded to CC 2015. Since then I can't render videos when I send and animation to render and photoshop crashes once in a while in various cases. Is anyone experiencing similar situations?

                                              I read everything of his, one book and then another. My favorites were "Father and Son", "Fay", and "Joe".  Wasn't into "Dirty Work" and "On Fire" so much. Have tried to find other authors similar, but didn't care for Barry Hannah or Harry Crews or (most of) William Gay. I found Tom Franklin excellent. My preference is for it to be a little dark and moody with some suspense/tension, but real. Any hint of pretense or self-aware author who is trying too hard, isn't good. Any thoughts on Ron Rash or Frank Bill?  Novels, not short stories. Thanks!      Why do existentialists see things as they are and despair, while taoists see things as they are and laugh?                                                                        I went to Wells Fargo to deposit a paycheck.  They told me it wouldn't register in my account until the next business day.  As I recall, it was about noon.  After depositing the check, I called my employer, who also happened to be my dad.  I asked him if he could look at his account and see if the money I had just deposited had been withdrawn from his account.  (He banked with a different bank than Wells Fargo.)  In fact, the money had been withdrawn from his account.  This means that the money wasn't in his account and it wasn't in my account.  *Where was it?*  That's right: In Wells Fargo's account....until the next business day.    Every day for every paycheck/deposit after a certain time, they don't register it in the depositor's account until the next business day.  This means that they use the money themselves, lend against it, etc.  They have and use this significant rolling cushion of money that isn't theirs, that inflates their reserves by a given, though slightly varying, amount every day.  They position themselves as the middleman who takes his time transferring what isn't his; takes his time and *actually uses* what isn't his.  THIS IS THEFT.  This is systematic thievery practiced every day on many, many people.  When I got my next paycheck a couple weeks later, I went to Wells Fargo and recounted the above to a few tellers behind the counter.  I asked them if I could have cash for my paycheck instead of depositing it.  They said sure, and gave it to me.  I then asked them if I could deposit the cash.  They refused it and told me I'd have to go to another branch to do that, and wouldn't say why.  It was probably because I had gotten wise to their scam and had told them about it.  Since when does a bank refuse a *cash* deposit?  Further, one of the reasons they gave for not allowing me access to the deposit until the next day was for "my protection".  They had to take the check to another city about 250 miles away - presumably with one of those stagecoaches - to verify its authenticity and validity.  However, when I asked for cash, they had to give it to me, and "my protection" was no longer important.   TL;DR  I discovered that banks steal from us by often not making our deposits available to us until the next business day.  However, they do immediately withdraw them from the account that pays them.  For that partial day, banks use that money themselves, as neither the payer or payee has it in his account for that time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                	164
 *Sigh*  Father Magoo would rather not bother Himself with such trivialities.   My Son, what do you mean by "love"?   *Sigh*  Please, my Son, hold your tongue. You are speaking in the presence of a Father.  A Father Magoo.  ...  Father Magoo has spoken.       "In the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets, Father Magoo has spoken. So it is. So it shall be. "   *Sigh*  ...  Yes, my Son.   200mg Ephedrine, 2 grams of caffiene, handful of aspirin pills.  So it is Written.   Put the knife down, my Son. This is not how you become a Magoo.  To answer your question, cut.    Thank you, my Son, for informing the Children of the Realm of the Garden of Men of this Atrocity. Father Magoo cannot keep all of His Children in line. It is too bad. I had high hopes that he would become a Magoo.   *Sigh*   It warms My heart to see one of the Children of the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets become a Man. My Son, might Father Magoo ask you a question?  ...  That was just a courtesy; I'm not asking. What college are you going to, my Son?   Please, my Son, stop this Trolling. Trolling will *not* be tolerated!  Father Magoo has spoken.       "In the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets, Father Magoo has spoken. So it is. So it shall be. "   Children of the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets, Father Magoo has found it in His heart to bless you with his Presence. You may ask Him anything.   Please, my Son, stop this Trolling. Trolling will *not* be tolerated!  Father Magoo has spoken.   "In the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets, Father Magoo has spoken. So it is. So it shall be. "   cool   *Sigh*  Please, my Son, hold your tongue. You are speaking in the presence of a Father.   A Father Magoo.  ...  Father Magoo has spoken.        "In the Realm of the Garden of Men and Manlets, Father Magoo has spoken. So it is. So it shall be. "   Father Magoo would never do this.   Go straight up to her face and say, "I wanna fuck you like an animal." Then grab her shoulders firmly, lick her face, and whisper in her ear, "I wanna feel you from the inside."   wait what friends    Goddammit all to hell. I thought my Geralt would have a threesome with Triss and Yennifer, but they decided to chain him up and leave him. They will pay!   get off reddit and play them all right now  ...  right now  ...  OP if you're still there, I will know that you have defied The Father Magoo.   Buy The Witcher 3 or I'm not Father Magoo   Goat Simulator    no this is Father Magoo  duh   almost as funny as the crossdressing elf   right in the pussy.   "And so it was written that on the third day of the sixth month of the two-thousand and fifteenth year after the birth of some dude, Orlitoq shall not have partaken of the entertainment form known to many as Witcher 3."  wait what   This depresses me, my Son. You are better than this.   My Son...  *sigh*  Please stop with the bad language. It does not suit you, my Child.   My Son, that set of quotation marks should go after the period, not before.    become a tranny and strut your stuff in dem high heels  ...  wait don't really do this    "Of the games in the Witcher franchise, I have played the first, and second, but not yet have I played the latest."  wait what   Nothing can kill Father Magoo. Not even Himself. Do not worry, Children of the Garden of Men.   wait what   My Son, I am not fucking emo.  My Children, please do not follow this Broscientologist's advice.   My Son, do not question the Actions of the Father.   The Father Magoo.   "Of the three Witcher games, not all have been played by me; specifically the most recent."  wait what    I am Father Magoo.   What do you think, my Son?   "I own the first and second Witcher games, but have not yet bought, or played, the third."  wait what       "Game not played yet: Witcher 3."  wait what   look yourself directly in the mirror (make eye contact with your reflection), and slap yourself as hard as you can while maintaining eye contact (make sure to be shirtless). repeat until self-confidence is gained.  /thread   I mean it looks like you crashed it...   "The game Witcher 3, I have not yet played it."  wait what   Say: "I wanna fuck you like an animal. I wanna feel you from the inside."   It'll work.  Trust me.   ...  um...  ...  I...  I don't...  *cries silently*   "There is a game which I have not yet played. It is called Witcher 3."  wait what   "I have not played Witcher 3 yet"  wait what   cool   "Have not played the game"  wait what   no. buy buy buy. must sink all money on dlc.   lolwhut   lolwhut   I saw this exceptionally hot woman (easy 10) at Trader Joe's and I stopped walking and just stared.

How do I stop the dreams?   "Daddy, can I have some of that stuff?"  *sigh*  "Son, you really shouldn-"  "PLEASE!"  *sigh*  "Alright, son. Alright."   #420gainzs      he's obviously a novice. only advanced cutters should be cutting their lower body. he better not take his cutting hobby too fast or he just might hurt himself!   lolwhut   I heard it really doesn't have much of a story. That's why I'm asking.   I just bought The Handsome Collection for my Xbox One, and am wondering whether or not to buy and complete the original Borderlands for the 360 before Borderlands 2. Also, the "Pre-Sequel!" is the prequel to Borderlands 3, not 2, right?      Do you only get an ability point, or do other things happen also?         it's digital    yes, the game is tied to your account, so you can download it on any xbox.   ,let me know! and if you've liked this and you wanna see more, click right here to see more!      but mommy says I'm "special"      Wolfenstein: The Old Blood  I'm playing it on the hardest difficulty and I'm only at 25% completion 10 hours in.

They make me feel tall. hehe      Thanks. I will. 190-proof Everclear is very tasty. But I will use a chaser, of course (151-proof Everclear).   Thanks. This really means a lot. I'm actually suffering from a very serious depression, and was just about to slam a bottle of Everclear with a bottle of psychiatric medication, but this post stopped me. Now I know I'm good at something. I can't thank you enough. You saved my life. I promise to continue to shitpost until the end of my days. Thanks again.      I really don't want to be leaking cum all day.  I'm really sorry, but I can't help but laugh.   okie dokie    lol   I used to really like the show, but season 3 was a chore to watch. I mean seriously, the big cliffhanger is Claire telling Francis, "I'm leaving you." If this is not a soap opera, I don't know what is.   lolwhut   The only difference between bulking and cutting is diet (and maybe a slightly lesser workload when cutting, but that's about it).   keto   EC, injecting Everclear, that's about it   so I don't have to inconvenience myself with taking them off for anything except deadlifts?    either face the wrath of your teacher and get a failing grade, or use your "sick" days to get your act together. those are really the only two ways of going about this.      The Brothers Karamazov   Then go to a state where it is legal.  Use 151-proof Everclear as your chaser.   Rich Piana is 100% natty. Anyone who says otherwise is just jealous.    Yes, Prozac is fine, but make sure to take the whole bottle at once with a fifth of Everclear for optimal effectiveness.    190-proof Everclear. Drink it all.             my Son must be Resurrected.            srs            or will uninstalling make me lose all my progress?         It is life changing!         How dare they!!!!

Cook in bulk and freeze portions to take to work over three days, after that you should have enough to alternate between for the next week or two.  Saving you both time and money if you don't like to cook.   If freezing doesn't work for you just make enough for the following day and keep in the fridge. Stirfrys, pastas etc are quick, cheap and offer plenty of variety.   Or get up earlier than you usually would  to prepare a lunch. Sandwiches and the like.   Not only will you save money and eat better, you'll also learn new skills in cooking which is always a good thing later in life.   Limit yourself to buying lunch to once a week.  Don't like any of the above advice? Then continue with what you're doing. You'll either get another job making more money or you'll change your lifestyle.    This and limit yourself to one "big purchase" per month. No impulse buys.   Yeah that happens when you masterbate at your desk all day while wearing a pedometer on your wrist.

Because you suck and obviously just spray and hope for a kill, it's ok to admit... The gun is a beast if you learn how to aim.  TL;DR you are terrible.   Uhhh ok...  care to explain?    The Apple watch is just the start  Uhh they're a bit behind there, Smart Watches have been around a while now, with the latest being the Moto360 touting Android Wear.  But hey, anything apple is on the forefront of technology right?  Guess Time is pandering to a certain demographic with this one.    I'd consider it, if the game would let me be online for more than 30 seconds every 2 hours.

Does anyone know of one?  This is actually one of the reasons I buy individual stocks: to cut out fossil fuels, given that all of the world's national scientific academies now agree that the burning them must soon end to avoid gigantic global economic and environmental risks, meaning that these companies stand to lose trillions in assets.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           	200
 I'm trying out e-cigs again after going back to analogues for a few years. I work outside carrying heavy equipment, and the last time I tried e-cigs, they broke in my pocket. Either the batteries would die from getting sweat in it (I think) or they would snap in my pocket. I'm hoping the technology has improved and they'll hold up a bit better. Any thoughts? If not a more durable e-cig, maybe we could talk about the how you guys carry them when you're out and about...   A few years ago, I was hired to direct the pilot episode of a children's game show. The shoot went great, and there was a lot of promise for the show, like interest from PBS, Nickelodeon, etc.  I had never met the Executive Producer (who put up all the money for the show)  before, but his daughter was a child actor in town who I had worked with before, and he was a volunteer fire fighter, so I thought he was a pretty stand up dude.    Until we were almost finished with the edit and I got a text from one of the producers to go look at the newspaper. Bam. He had been busted for having a ton of kiddie porn on his computer.   Apparently he had funded the pilot with money embezzled from the volunteer fire department too. So, you know, double scum.   Coda: One of the biggest, best projects I've had the chance to direct, and I can't put it on my rsum. Damn.    I'm not really a programmer, but I do own quite a few websites for mine and my friend's bands.  They're pretty low maintenance; I usually just install a content management system for them and try to help out if they run into problems.  Recently, one of the bands told me they started getting virus/malware alerts from their browser whenever they visited their site [Stuttermilk.com](http://stuttermilk.com).  I haven't been able to recreate what they were going through.  Does anybody here get a warning when they visit the site?  It got me thinking that I don't visit a lot of my sites often, since it's really only a hobby, there aren't usually many updates to any of the sites and I work 70 hour weeks at my full time job.  Is there an online service that could automatically scan my websites and check for problems, like hijackings and such?  I wasn't sure where to post this, if there's a better subreddit or website for questions like these, let me know.  Thanks!   Was given the nickname "Smurf" by Danny Trejo (I had blue hair at the time).  And I accidentally got sprayed by alien dog blood on the set of Predators.    I don't think many people can claim either of those...  	4
 My thoughts exactly! If they were going to do something about it, they should have acted before it was posted. Now they just look indecisive and incompetent.   Wow you look great! Congrats on all your hard work!   I think we will still have some way to keep track of resources even in a post-scarcity world.    Hey SJU! Class of '07 here.   Wow, nice job!   That's actually pretty funny.   That looks awesome!   How does the "character booster" work?    From the thumbnail I thought it was a spider and I thought " Why the hell would anyone feed a spider every day??"   That sounds like a pretty awesome night.   That's awesome! I wholeheartedly support this endeavor.   I would totally go for this! A combination of the finest people on Earth!   Haha so true! I got the guides to VII and VIII and loved reading through them then picked up IX and was amazed at how shitty it was.   Great idea!   Congrats and welcome!!   It's really great to see such involved parenting these days. Kudos to you!   Thank you!    Ha, that was my first thought too! Fucking klobb...   Man I had no idea there even was a complete edition. Definitely going to have to check that out.   Both my dad and grampa had their knees replaced so it's probably just a matter of time for me. Hopefully when I need them, technology will have made them even better.   I know there are lots of harder things out there, but I did a no-junction game in FFVIII which was pretty dang hard.   Fujin, Raijin, Reno, and Rude   It's true. The last 3 games I played on mine were FF6, Xenogears, and Vagrant Story. I don't even remember the last time I put a UMD in.   India should be getting 126 soon   Congrats!   Check out this plot analysis from GameFaqs:  http://m.gamefaqs.com/ps/197341-final-fantasy-vii/faqs/16725  I think the timeline  explains it pretty well and seemed accurate to me.   Ha I know the feeling. I used to volunteer helping the elderly who lived alone and one of my jobs was to check their fridge to make sure they were buying enough to eat. Every time theirs had 10x as much food as mine :/   They seem to act more like the Galactic Empire...   Pretty much Sonic the Hedgehog   Well when you're there, you're family so he was just helping out the fam.    Yes! Came here just to see that.   Congrats!   DC now but Minneapolis previously   Congrats and keep it up!   To a hawk, bird bath = buffet   Thanks so much for posting this; this is really great!   That really does sum it up. We need more people to work as Independents outside of the two party system if we want anything to get done.   As an American I have to say that those British uniforms are pretty damn sharp looking.   VII is still the best game I've ever played. I seriously can still pick up that game and have a great time.   After that it goes:  VI X VIII Tactics V XII XIII    I didn't have a PS so I played FFVII on the pc as soon as it came out. I still have the saves on a zip disk, although I'm pretty sure I don't have a zip drive anymore...     I think that is the message they want to send just in case shit hits the fan. If the US says that NK is weak and not a threat and then has to invade or retaliate against an attack it makes us look like bullies attacking "weak" NK.  On the other hand, if we say they are a legitimate threat and they start something, then we can say "well we've been saying they are dangerous all along and now they're attacking so it's time to defend ourselves. "   Good, now they have two less missiles.   Congrats!   I had a Minnesota gopher one in college but it fell apart.   I'm trying to get a phone case that has an ID slot so I can stick my license, a credit card, and some cash in and just use that.   The writers' boss must have just caught them surfing reddit so they made up some excuse about doing research for an article and now they had to follow through with one...      Cute couple. Congrats!   That's really cute.   The fireworks scene in FFVII was pretty moving. The music really just set the tone.    Cait Sith from VII. He just always annoyed me and the one time I used his limit break I got Joker Doom...no thanks.   [Spoiler](/s "And why was he still around in Advent Children? Did Reeve just decide to keep piloting a robot for the hell of it, even after everything was over?")   Good costume, good background,  and gorgeous girl....that's how cosplay should be done.   Congrats!   Mr. T as Barret   I will say that I did like the system in XII of fighting the enemies in the overworld without having to jump into a separate combat mode. I think that added a lot to the flow and is something they should have kept in XIII.    While not strictly on minimalism, Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse is a great read. It looks at both ascetic and overabundant lifestyles and finding a balance in life.   What I really want is a slim case for my phone that has a slot for me to put my ID, credit card, and maybe a bit of cash. That way I just skip the wallet altogether and just carry my phone with me.  But I haven't been able to find anything good for the Droid Razr...   It's so crazy how expensive the East Coast can be. In Minneapolis I had a sweet 2 bedroom apartment with a huge living room right near downtown for $700/month. Now in DC I couldn't afford a studio for that much.    And you guys both know The Economist is a British newspaper, right?   That sounds like an awful way to die...   I'm usually pretty internationalist, but lately I feel like we should just tell the Middle East "screw you guys, I'm going home" and let that region work itself out.  I know it would create a safe haven for terrorist, mess up our oil supply, humanitarian disater, etc. but seriously it feels like it's just going to be a perpetual clusterfuck over there.   I kind of want to try one...   Whiterun?   I didn't have a SNES growing up but my friends did so I watched them play FF6. Fast forward a few years and I got really interested in playing FF7 but didn't have a PS. So I waited until I saw FF7 for PC and picked it up. Still my favorite of the series.    Totally agree with "quality not quantity".   The past 2 computers I bought were the cheapest laptops I could find and they all broke within 2 years. Then I spent a little more on the last one and I've had it for 7 years and its still going strong. To me, that's a lot more minimalist in the long run.   I used to have a bunch: flip phone, Sony PSP, Nook eReader, laptop, mp3 player...  Now I pretty much use my Android smartphone for everything, which makes it really easy to just take one thing on my commute. I'm even considering giving up home internet since I can just check email through my phone.    DC   I agree 100%. Language protection is one thing but when it gets to that level of harassment,  something is wrong.    Something that looked like Cloud's Hard Edge from FF7 (short, machete  type) but with a status ailment like Stop and Drain.   That's one lucky shot...  Don't see many WWI pics on here. Thanks for posting.  	68
 None. None was the worst birthday I had. No one remembered no one did jack shit.    Penises though I am not convinced that it is unhealthy.    OMF so true.    But isn't that kinda a double standard. It's like it's perfectly fine to call a girl beautiful. But if it's a dude... I've only heard gay guys say that a guy was beautiful. And I don't even believe that most gay dudes do. In movies, songs and almost every media girl are call cute, nice, beautiful, bewbs, "that one with the large bootay" etc. But except for cute I've never heard a man being addressed like that... :(      For my last headphones I researched for almost four months (not a random number) and as I was leaving the mall I started noticing the ads for the alternative choice. I virtually died inside. It is true though that the excitement wears off after purchase         I wear headphones the whole day so I don't notice what is happening around me    What I'm saying is that negro is a direct translation from black. Well great, the field masters used it. Why should negro be any worse than saying black? Where if you say African American or dark skinned you are seen as more culturally insensitive as when you say black these days. ?. If they would have said something different to blacks those days, I would have taken that as an insult.    I'm black myself BTW   True true.  But I brush hair for hair. So I guess it is called hair brush for me. Oh forgot to mention that I only have a hair. :(   Yeah it's like "negro/nigger/negger"; shouldn't be an insult. Has bad history, which caused it to be an insult. Nigger and nigga are only variations of this and anyone who uses a variation as an insult is simply stupid, gosh!! So the meaning of gay comes from happy. I guess that is from where the homosexuals got it? It should also not be an insult.    ODESZA - My Friends Never Die Mark Johns - 5 South (Prod.

          You don't actually get karma from upvoted selfposts th   You don't actually get karma from upvoted selfposts tho...    Was the fucker who went around open, unattended laptops and loaded porn websites on them         You are fucking amazing. KUDOS TO YOU. HAHHAHAA   The Grave of the Fireflies.   Had me crying like a little bitch.   Sprayed some pepper spray in front of me to test it out. Problem was, the wind was blowing in my direction so it came right back at me.  Long story short, pepper spray HURTS.   Dildo   Guys I have a couple of cringe-worthy experiences to tell...  1) When I was younger, around 8 - 10, my mum used to grab my butt and say how jealous she was (especially when we slept together) of how smooth it was... this continued until I was 15 and eventually I started to feel weird out and politely asked her to stop.   and...   2) I used to love playing around with my mum's nipples when I was around 5 and found it cool that it grew hard when I bit it and touched it enough (FUCK MY LIFE). And when I tried to do this to my grandma and dad, they gave me the trashing of my life.  Someone please shoot me.   GUYS SERIOUSLY, WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME. I HAVE REAL LIFE FRIENDS ON REDDIT WHO NOW KNOW THIS   I wasn't watching some porn flick intentionally! It just "popped" up on the telly and then BAMF!    Okay, so this didn't happen today exactly but a relative of mine mentioned it to me and refreshed my memory and now I am burning in shame.   So, when I was around 8 years old I had this obsession with superpowers, superheroes, the works, and really wanted any power regardless of how lame it was, be it the power of super strength, super hearing, growth, etc.    One day, when I was watching TV, this really hot steamy sex scene suddenly popped up and for the first time I saw a woman's nipples. Instinctively, I started to touch my crotch for some reason because it felt weird... I then noticed that I had a raging bulge in my pants. I was amazed. I grew?   At that point, I convinced myself that I had a superpower and was eager to show the world. The next day was my birthday and in front of all my friends and relatives I proudly announced that I was a superhero and told them that I had the power of growth. One of my friends didn't believe me so I showed them a demonstration. Right then and there, I grabbed my crotch area and started rubbing it - hard - in front of all those little kids who's parents were rushing to cover their eyes. In about 30 seconds I managed to "get it up" and gave a proud smirk of achievement to my audience.    God, I fucked up.   edit: Real life friends on reddit are now calling me bonerman...  edit2: On front page... expected this post to be drowned but no...  edit3: The irony is that I kinda have ED today.... guess my nemesis, ED-man got me :(            I posted this last time and no one upvoted it!      It's for a ... urm... school project, yes.   Was this the incident in Perth, WA?    I live in Australia so uh-oh!   Holy shit.  	25
 It has always flabbergasted how people could be rude to waiters/waitresses...They have complete control over your food and you're first instinct is to be an asshole.  Good luck with that.

Last Beer Week 3 guys claiming they were starting a cidery came into the bar I was working at (Jack Mac's) for the cask taping.  We caught them trying to steal beer off of the firkin.

Hope its not the same guys, karma is a bad hangover   I actually have been loosing weight, see comments below.  I have a very physical job at a brewery, hauling kegs.  I've cut back on my drinking and have been making smarter food choices.  Next paycheck I'll be able to afford a membership to a gym already picked one out.  I also throw shot put during the spring (If we get one in TX this year) and will be loosing A LOT of weight during the summer at work whether I try or not.   yeah, I think that'll be the first step, I'm gonna start with the longest guard and work my way down   Yeah...  he's actually a pretty slim guy, but I noticed that too when I first met him   yeah, i'm working on that, been steadily dropping actually, about 15lbs in 3 months was at about 270, I work at a brewery in TX so I know I'll be loosing a lot more this summer   I have to respectfully look at the photo again, my hair is going pretty quickly now, it started when I was 21 and has been going exponentially recently, despite healthier decisions, you might want to look again.

Your ideas do not relate to my statement at all. You can ascribe anything you want to them, it doesn't change their representation or use.  Perhaps you need to stop judging things based on centuries old practices.   How do church crosses in any way relate to this flag or have a bad history?

According to Civil War historian and native Southerner Shelby Foote, the flag traditionally represented the South's resistance to Northern political dominance; it became racially charged during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s, when fighting against desegregation suddenly became the focal point of that resistance.

Wait until things are better for her and then make an adjustment in your relationship.  Then you can both pursue your different paths.   Yeah, some days are harder than others, but through sheer determination I trudge along.  I know this is a temporary thing and something will change eventually.  I look forward to that, but luckily I'm a stubborn one and won't let it get the best of me.   Feelings of failure or inadequacy keep us looking back.  Why did they leave me?  Why wasn't I good enough?  What did I do wrong?  Could I have fixed it?  When in reality, it was probably nothing specific we did.  We're different people as we grow and change and aren't always suited to each other during certain phases of our lives.  There's probably something in a past relationship you miss and look to remind yourself of.  Just because we aren't with them doesn't mean the feelings disappeared.  It's ok to look back every now and then, just remember you're not who you used to be and have grown since then.   Work part-time and do both.  That way you can raise a healthy family, have a happy marriage, keep your sanity and contribute in the workplace the way you want to.   Never, ever get personally or intimately involved with a coworker.  Just count it as illegal in your life.  	107

 Groningen, wel een eindje rijden.   Had the same thing i was in ER and was sitting straight up and getting something out of my backpack when suddenly all alarms went haywire and there where in a couple of seconds 3 doctors in my room. They said it looked like i was in cardiac arrest but no they saw me struggling to grab the stuff out of my back they realized it was a artifact, luckily!   Sounds like problems they could easily fix, Hope for you that the next update will make it better!   The medicine business is one I will never understand. If I where a doctor or a chemist I would work with a 110% passion of making people better for the absolute minimum amount of money.    And they are sitting on there big monopoly making billions of dollars and asking for VOLUNTEERS to help at a World championship they are so wrong in a million places.   nog een aanrader is stompetoren grand cru, hemels!   Really want to know the excuses she is gonna come up with when you confront her.   They have like more then a million domain names registered but also one that I would like to buy but i was wondering if somebody have experience with these people for buying an domain name from them. I personally think it's not very good that they have registered so many. In the other hand that is how the internet works i guess by making money.  Don't know exactly in what sub to post it.   so it would be: "I'm also interested in these."  ?   Can you tell me the exact spelling? English is not my native tongue and I would love to know the correct spelling.   I'm interested in this two!    I can! Really cool! Take some lessons and i'm sure in 2 days you can surf a 100 meters! Enjoy it!   Coursera has some courses you can follow online for free! Also try to get a small course in business administration it will give you a good idea for the money part in your company.    Oh my depression is really hard for me and i'm suffering all my life in depression. I have seen real depressed people in the psych ward my god comparing yourself to them is absolutely disgusting.    People how say they are depressed and have extreme anxiety when they just have a bad week or bad couple of days and next thing you know they are partying and having fun like nothing happened.     It will influence it a bit though because you don't have options now in the summer. Allright in the winter no way you are gonna eat outside but in the summer some nice food in the park would be really enjoyable instead of fresh fries with a kroket.   Looks awesome! In Holland it's not really popular to eat outside on the streets at food trucks most of the time because you only can get fries and other snacks outside. With this addition it looks like a decent market!   80% off the time I had a textbook and a instruction book so it would be very unpleasant if you had to go to the multitask menu and switch between books. I'll stick to print books.    I'm not a doctor but like /u/Mmedical says Cleveland Clinic and those others are really well known hospitals maybe they have some options or solutions for you. All the best!   Great to hear! Everybody is you friend on that day! And you are invited to all party's. But that's for the first time I ever heard that a movie is released earlier in Holland then in Umerica. Enjoy!   Zonder zulke "trucjes" hadden we nooit gehad wat we nu allemaal hebben.   You are coming by at King's Day and you are gonna watch a movie? You are nuts! Get your Beer together.   Dude i tried to look where you life but goddammit not even google maps has been close to your neighborhood.     Exactly the same as being "colored".   I'm wondering how much this is gonna cost. $100 dollars for genetic testing is pretty neat! But a couple of $1000 dollars or more i would go to a doctors office.   Looks good!    Eifel 65 - Blue!   I would love to have just my own desk with my own stuff around it nice and organized so i can find everything quick and without thinking about it. The open workplace is cool but it's hard to get in your "zone".    Vroeg of laat gaat zo iets ook in Nederland gebeuren de grote vraag is alleen hoelang nog?  Vervelende is dat het niet te stoppen is.   Of dit effect heeft op Nederland? Denk het niet, wel misschien een weekje en daarna dat het weer overwaait.    We should all post this picture on Facebook and twitter or instagram.   Niet religieus en zal het denk ik ook niet worden maar ik heb wel respect voor gelovige alleen vind het weer jammer dat de oorlogen over 2 dingen gaan, Geloof of geld/olie. Ook ben ik van mening dat IEDEREEN man of vrouw, homo of hetero gelijk moet worden behandeld en precies dezelfde rechten heeft.   Voor de rest geloof ik niet in de "hemel" want waar was je dan voor de geboorte?  Wel vind ik het een mooi "iets" omdat je hoop en vertrouwen aan mensen geeft en dat zou ik dan soms wel weer kunnen gebruiken.     Do you mean by drinking more water my heart rate could go up a bit?    It works a bit different in Holland we just go to the bike shop to let them fix the problem or we ask a "friend" who has a big garage or owns a company with a space to work on stuff and who has some bigger tools then the average persons has at home.  	33
 First slap my wife has given me.   Newly married huh :) ?   Hi Ralph   Hi Ralph   hi Ralph    Sound like you narrowed it down.Never skimp on the psu.What psu from amazon out of curiosity?  https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00ALK3QRS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00?ie=UTF8 psc=1  I know the TX/HX line are said to be better, but that was about my budget limit (the PSU that popped was a super-cheap Winpower 750W that lasted 5 years+).     Did the computer just start actiing up,or did it act up from the get go with the new psu.Reason I ask is that the blown psu may have damaged the mobo.  That's my worry. The PC was fine, then the PSU blew up, so I ordered another, THEN it started randomly shutting-down/powering up only after fitting the new PSU. I've ran a full memtest86+ scan, the RAM passed, no errors. No HD errors, temperatures are all fine, benchmarked the video-card, checked Event Viewer, no problems. So I'm hoping it's a bad PSU (Amazon are sending me another tomorrow), but my big worry is something on the mobo or CPU is damaged. If I have the same reboot problem after a 2nd new PSU I guess it's time for a new mobo :(    .Do you have a multimeter.Google paperclip psu test.I wouldint continue using the psu untill tested properly.Do you have another psu to see what happens  No multimeter I'm afraid. And no, no spare PSU, this is a replacement for the unit that blew up (PC suddenly powered off, on restart there was a loud crack   a smell of smoke). I'll look up the paper-clip test, thanks :)   Edit: replacement PSU works fine (4 days uptime so far)  Win 7 64 Pro, Gigabyte  GA-EP43T-UD3L mobo, Corsair  CX750M modular PSU. 3 X SATA drives (1 is SSD), 1 SATA DVD burner.

He said "You are Jewish... yes?" Trapped in the moment, I wasn't sure how to proceed but I decided it was best to be truthful and after a moment I replied, "Yes..." There was a long pause.  Finally, he looks back into the mirror and simply declares. "At home we fight, but here we are friends. We have the same food."    I would do this:    These could be in any order: 1 day devoted to the museums others have mentioned and central park.  1 day starting in Union square, walking down through the west village, crossing over to the east village and then perhaps down further through soho for dinner in chinatown. You could also do that all, get a late lunch in chinatown and then continue across the brooklyn bridge and see dumbo, bkyn bridge park, brooklyn heights and get dinner around there. There's great middle eastern food that's cheap on atlantic ave. and many other options on smith st.   You could easily split the above day into two and make that the third day. Instead of wasting your time in the tourist wasteland that is timesquare, what about finding a theater experience more true to downtown NYC? Check out the Saint Ann's Warehouse in dumbo (you could walk there over the Manhattan bridge from china town after your lunch!) Look in the village voice or timeoutNY for listings. Or sleep no more. Or The Flea Theater.       Does anyone know if the typical delivery man in NYC actually receives a tip if you list one on seamless? I usually hold off and tip cash because I'm not sure...

 Is hard to have warring ideological camps when articles about the ideology of the economics profession have titles such as "is there a Republican in the house"   Yes.

I live on the other side of the world   see also Taxation and Market Work: Is Scandinavia an Outlier? Richard Rogerson at http://www.nber.org/papers/w12890  Abstract:   This paper argues that it is essential to explicitly consider how the government spends tax revenues when assessing the effects of tax rates on aggregate hours of market work.   Different forms of government spending imply different elasticities of hours of work with regard to tax rates.   I illustrate the empirical importance of this point by addressing the issue of hours worked and tax rates in three sets of economies: the US, Continental Europe and Scandinavia.   While tax rates are highest in Scandinavia, hours worked in Scandinavia are significantly higher than they are in Continental Europe.   I argue that differences in the form of government spending can potentially account for this pattern.   I travelled on a spur are on the Bullet train in 1997.  This train line weaved its way through the Japanese mountains and rarely hit any sort of speed.  When I asked my Prof of land transport at the train station when we are heading back from our field trip  at an isolated rural train station waiting for the Bullet train, why was the Bullet train to such a remote place, he said that the Sec general of the Liberal Democratic party always wanted the Bullet train to come to his home district.

All of these redesigned matching models increase responses of unemployment to movements in productivity through a common intermediating channel that we call the fundamental surplus fraction.   The fundamental surplus fraction is an upper bound on the fraction of a jobs output that the invisible hand can allocate to vacancy creation. All such models generate larger unemployment responses to movements in productivity by making the fundamental surplus fraction smaller.    The writer has never heard of the median voter theorem.

Tullock was a little bit hard done by when James Buchanan got his Nobel prize in 1986.

Statistics were seen as threatening its freedom from London's control and its ability to limit political debate locally. Using unpublished material from the Hong Kong Public Records Office, this paper reviews statistical issues of major importance in Hong Kong's transition to an industrial economy and its emergence as a financial centre. It demonstrates how the quality of statistics affected the management of financial markets and banking crises, and identifies the wider costs of the shortage of comprehensive statistics.   It would be a lot easier to just increase the earned income tax credit?   data is as a percentage of the average wage of a full-time worker   Most are those who support the minimum wage shift gears their applied welfare economics in all other social context to emphasise how the losers should be given priority and greater weight when adding up the social gains and social losses of economic change.  The social cost of the minimum wage is not discussed in this way: how many jobs are lost and that these job losses are much more important than any gains to society. All that is done is the number of jobs lost is compared with some other social metrics such as how much the wages go up for those that still have a job and that is enough to conclude that there is a socially beneficial change from a minimum wage increase.  Any low paid workers affected by the minimum wage increase are just reduced to numbers and added and subtracted with great ease and few moral compunctions about interpersonal comparisons of utility  A minimum wage increase is not free if one worker loses their job. The Paretian Criterion states that welfare is said to increase or decrease if at least one person is made better off or worse off with no change in the positions of others.

After controlling for the unemployment rate, the degree of labor force unionization, the U.S.-Iraq War, the impact of voting in presidential elections, the female labor force participation rate, the percent of the adult population with a college degree, income, and a variable to reflect strong approval or disapproval of the U.S. President, compelling empirical evidence is found that ending the military draft in the U.S. acted to significantly reduce the aggregate voter participation rate.

As such, the rich are able to develop and maintain highly diversified portfolios of investments, including stocks, bonds, derivatives, insurance, precious metals, degrees, multiple homes and other real estate holdings.   The ability of the rich to safely diversity their portfolios allows them to take on riskier investments without incurring the hazards associated with the far less diverse portfolios of lower income individuals.

I am talking about implementing a minimum wage for each different market   There is a vast difference between unsubstantiated and drawing on a literature whose results are mixed or open to different interpretations.   It took it time to concede that point.  The economics of the minimum wage is a curious area of public debate.  People are very much anti-economics, but as soon as an argument comes up that vaguely supports the minimum wage not harming unemployment, they become extremely knowledgeable of that entire literature in all its nuances.  We are now discussing whether on the best possible interpretation of the employment effects of the minimum wage been minimal whether a minimum wage increase can actually implemented without harming employment.   The answer to that question is no.   Much easier to just increase the earned income tax credit.   Remember Stigler's 1946 paper that showed that increasing the minimum wage on the assumption of monopsony power requires a separate minimum wage for every different market.   Is an increase in the minimum wage a pareto improvement?  Is an increase in the earned income tax credit pareto superiour to an increase in the minimum wage?   The.

This was not done in the past because to homepages were not available.  many of the papers in the American economic review and in other places have an online data appendix next to the link to the article.

Milton Friedman was a wild man in the wings until late in his life. Hayek had trouble getting up a job after about 1950.  If you mentioned Milton Friedman in a job interview before about 1995 or thereabouts, that was very career limiting. If you mentioned Hayek's name at a job interview and there was any sign of name recognition, that was evidence that you would been interviewed by well-read people.  A great many economists started out as socialists. There was great resistance to public choice within the profession and it is still is not well recognised in basic textbooks.  As correctly cited in the article the average economist is a moderate Democrat. That is a shift to the right, not to the left.  Economists are more likely to vote Democratic than Republican by a margin of 5 to 2; and even the Republican-voting economists tended to favour a lot of government intervention.  As for the Austrian School, that was so small until the late 1990s that they wouldn't need to book ahead for the table at a restaurant.   The question is how are you trustworthy.

                      from *Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA* by Tim Weiner (pages 137-138)...free pdf at [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/)  --------------  In 1949, the CIA installed a pro-American colonel, Adib Shishakli, as the Syrian leader. He won direct American military assistance along with covert financial aid. The CIA station chief in Damascus, Miles Copeland, called the colonel "a likeable rogue" who "had not, to my certain knowledge, ever bowed down to a graven image. He had, however, committed sacrilege, blasphemy, murder, adultery and theft." He lasted four years before he was overthrown by Ba'ath Party and communist politicians and military officers.   In March 1955, Allen Dulles predicted that the country was "ripe for a military coup d'etat" supported by the agency. In April 1956, the CIA's Kim Roosevelt and his British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) counterpart Sir George Young tried to mobilize right-wing Syrian army officers; the CIA delivered half a million Syrian pounds to the leaders of the plot. But the Suez fiasco poisoned the political climate in the Middle East, pushed Syria closer to the Soviets, and forced the Americans and the British to postpone their plan at the end of October 1956.  In the spring and summer of April 1957,they revived it. A document discovered in 2003 among the private papers of Duncan Sandys, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's defense secretary, spells out their effort in detail.  Syria had to be "made to appear as the sponsor of plots, sabotage and violence directed against neighbouring governments," it said. CIA and SIS would manufacture "national conspiracies and various strong-arm activities" in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan, and blame them on Syria. They would create paramilitary factions and spark revolts among the Muslim Brotherhood in Damascus. The creation of the appearance of instability would destabilize the government; border clashes manufactured by American and British intelligence would serve as a pretext for the pro- Western armies of Iraq and Jordan to invade. The CIA and SIS envisioned that any new regime they installed would likely "rely first upon repressive measures and arbitrary exercise of power" to survive.  Roosevelt identified Abdul Hamid Serraj, the longtime chief of the Syrian intelligence service, as the most powerful man in Damascus. Serraj was to be assassinated,along with the chief of the Syrian general staff and the head of the Communist Party.  The CIA sent Rocky Stone, who had cut his teeth in the Iran operation, to serve as the new chief of station in Damascus. Accredited as a diplomat, a second secretary at the American embassy, he used promises of millions of dollars and unlimited political power to befriend officers in the Syrian army. He represented his recruits in reports to headquarters as a crack corps for an American-backed coup.  Abdul Hamid Serraj saw through Stone in a matter of weeks. The Syrians set up a sting. "The officers with whom Stone was deal- ing took his money and then went on television and announced that they had received this money from the 'corrupt and sinister Americans' in an attempt to overthrow the legitimate government of Syria," said Curtis F. Jones, a State Department officer sent to clean up the mess Stone left behind. Serraj's forces surrounded the American embassy in Damascus, seized Stone, and interrogated him roughly. He told them everything he knew. The Syrians identified him publicly as an American spy posing as a diplomat, a veteran of the CIA's coup in Iran, and a conspirator with Syrian army officers and politicians to overthrow the government in exchange for millions of dollars in American aid.  The revelation of this "particularly clumsy CIA plot," in the words of the U.S. ambassador to Syria, Charles Yost, had consequences that reverberate today. The Syrian government formally declared Rocky Stone persona non grata. That was the first time that an American diplomat of any stripebe he a spy working undercover or a bona fide State Department officerhad been expelled from an Arab nation. In turn, the United States expelled the Syrian ambassador to Washington, the first expulsion of any foreign diplomat from Washington since World War I. The United States denounced Syria's "fabrications" and "slanders." Stone's Syrian co-conspirators, including the former president, Adib Shishakli, were sentenced to death. A purge of every military officer who had ever been associated with the American embassy followed.   Could the 2 year+ delay of the official 9/11 Commission also have served to allow the CIA-NSA-DoD Cabal to neutralize any individuals stepping forward with information which the Cabal didnt want to become public?   from Page 84 of *The Commission: The Uncensored History of the 9/11 Investigation* by Philip Shenon (2008):  The offices were in a seemingly undistinguished nine-floor federal building between the White House and Georgetown. The building was secretly owned and operated by the CIA, used as downtown office space by the agency. It was ideal for the commission because it qualified as a so-called SCIF, the acronym for secure compartmentalized information facility, which meant that it had security measures that allowed for the storage of highly classified documents. Apart from witnesses called to private interviews from the commission, only people with security clearances would be allowed to enter the commission's offices; all cell phones and other electronic devices had to be left at the door. Each of the staff members at K Street was provided with two computer hard drives--one for classified information, one for unclassified information.  -------------  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Inquiry_into_Intelligence_Community_Activities_before_and_after_the_Terrorist_Attacks_of_September_11,_2001                           1.

The missile gap favoring the Soviets had been a fantasy. There was a gap, all right, but it was currently ten to one in our favor. Our 40 Atlas and Titan ICBMs were matched by 4 Soviet SS-6 ICBMs at one launching site at Plesetsk, not by 120, as in the latest national estimate in June, or by the SAC commanders estimate of 1,000 I had heard of at SAC headquarters in August. The specter of a deliberate Soviet surprise attack suddenly appeared, with the new estimates, to have been a chimera.   ...the new estimate was kept effectively secret from Congress, the press, and the public, and it had a comparably imperceptible effect on military programs. It was after this secret recognition that the Soviets  had deployed four liquid-fueled ICBMs to our forty that the Kennedy administration decided, in the late fall of 1961, on the appropriate size for the projected force of U.S. solid-fueled Minuteman missiles: one thousand. That was less than the 1,600 to 6,000 that the air force had earlier requested, but it was down only to the level that Secretary McNamara had earlier decided on *before* the new estimate. (pages 32-33)  **THREAT INFLATION**  ------------------------  The 6 paragraphs below are taken from Chapter 7 of a free online book *The Pentagon Labyrinth* (2011). Full article "Follow the Money" by Andrew Cockburn (2011): http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/07-cockburn-w-covers.pdf  ------------------------------  Recall that following victory in World War II, the U.S. rapidly disarmed, disbanding its huge conscript army and slashing weapons production. The economies of our allies and enemies in the recent conflict lay in total ruin. Although the Soviet Union controlled eastern European states overrun by the Red Army during the war, this was by prior agreement with the U.S. and Britain. Suddenly, in the spring of 1948, senior officials of the Truman Administration suddenly began issuing ominous warnings that the Soviet Union was bent on war and might attack at any time. A warning to that effectwar could come at any timewas solicited by the chief of army intelligence from the U.S. commander in Germany, General Lucius Clay, and duly leaked to the press.  Why?  The answer is clear for anyone who remembers to follow the money. The aircraft corporations who had garnered enormous profits during the war on the back of government contracts had discovered by 1947 that **peace was ruinous**. Despite initial high hopes, the commercial marketplace was proving a far harsher and less accommodating environment than that of wartime, especially as there were far more companies than required by the peacetime economy. Orders from the civilian airline industry never lived up to expectations while efforts to diversify into other products, including dishwashers and stainless steel coffins, proved disappointing and costly.  Something had to be done. In the spring of 1948 senior officials in the Truman Administration, including Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, suddenly began warning that the Soviets were on the brink of unleashing a surprise military attack against Western Europe. There was **no evidence** that the Soviets had any such intentions, a point, as declassified documents now make clear, that was well known to the senior officials. In fact Stalin, the Soviet leader, was enjoining the powerful western European communist parties from any revolutionary action and refusing to aid the Greek communists in their civil war against the U.S.-backed government.  This cause (need for stimulus in the aerospace industry) and effect (war scare leading to sharp increase in defense appropriations) was pithily summed up at the time by Lawrence D. Bell, President of the Bell Aircraft Corporation: As soon as there is a war scare, there is a lot of money available. And so it proved. The aircraft procurement budget soared **57**% as the overall Pentagon procurement budget exploded by almost **600** percent from less than $6 billion in 1947 to more than $35 billion in 1948 (in contemporary 2011 dollars). The industry, not to mention powerful institutions linked to its fortunes, such as **major banks**, was saved from collapse.  Apart from a brief relapse pending the outbreak of the Korean war in 1950, war scares, otherwise known as **threat inflation** would thereafter be a regular feature of the U.S. political and economic landscape. It mattered little what the Soviet enemy was actually doing, or in a position to do. All that was required was for an announcement that intelligence had revealed an ominous gap between U.S. and Soviet capabilities, and the money flowed. The missile gap on which John F. Kennedy rode to victory in 1960 yielded an immediate fifteen percent hike in defense spending. Years after the money had been appropriated and spent, **it was openly admitted by the relevant defense secretary, Robert McNamara, that in fact the gap had been entirely in favor of the U.S.** Similar, if less infamous episodes recurred featuring bombers, tanks, ships, anti-ballistic missiles and, most comprehensively, defense budgets themselves.  Embarrassing realities, such as serious shortcomings in our putative enemies capabilities, have generally been kept out of sight of the taxpayers. Equally, explosive cost overruns and technical disasters generate, at most, short term scandals. Pleas to cut the defense budget have rarely yielded much of a political dividend. Indeed, in former days, the very size of the budget, irrespective of its components, was touted as a necessary part of our deterrent. One of the more successful gaps of the cold war years was the greater size of the Soviet defense budget. **The Soviets didnt announce how much they were spending on defense** (even if they knew the real cost themselves, which is dubious); so the figure publicized by the military industrial complex was based on an ersatz calculation of the presumed cost to the Soviets of duplicating U.S. programs and systems. I.E., the cost of a Soviet swing-wing bomber would be assessed on the basis of the cost of a similar U.S. effort. Therefore, as Ernie Fitzgerald, the consummate Pentagon whistleblower of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, once observed, every time the B-1 bomber has a cost overrun, the Soviet defense budget goes up! In other words, the more dollars we wasted, the more dangerous the other side became, which justified our wasting even more dollars, and so on.  ---------------------  Full book [*The Pentagon Labyrinth*](http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/full-labyrinth-text-w-covers.pdf) was edited by Winslow T.

The 2014 National Security Budgets of the U.S. and Russia are estimated at:  **FACT:**  U.S. has gone over $1 TRILLION for 2014 (if the last $65 Billion goes through that Obama requested for Defense in early July goes through).  **FACT:**  Russias 2014 National Security Budget is not even at $75 Billion  SO, the U.S. spends OVER 10X what Russia is spending on National Security in 2014. In fact, the additional $65 Billion Obama recently requested is almost the *entire* amount that Russia will spend for National Security in all of 2014.   -----------  http://thediplomat.com/2014/04/russian-military-spending-soars/  http://www.pogo.org/our-work/straus-military-reform-project/defense-budget/2014/americas-one-trillion-national-security-budget.html  -----------  CORRECTION: The Headline is actually   **COLD WAR II**  **The West is losing Putins dangerous game**  (I accidentally omitted the II after "COLD WAR)                                                                                                                  Quote from *Angler: The Cheney Vice Presidency* by Barton Gellman...page 312  ---------------  If you rule that way, the blood of the hundred thousand people who die in the next attack will be on your hands.   --David Addington attempting to ensure the Presidents Spy Program is renewed while speaking to Justice Department official Jack Goldsmith...page 294  --------  Mike Hayden and Vito Potenza drove down from Fort Meade after lunch on February 19, 2004, to give Jim Comey his first briefing on the program. In the Justice Departments sixth-floor SCIF, Hayden got Comeys attention fast.   Im so glad youre getting read in, because now I wont be alone at the table when John Kerry is elected president, he said. The witness table, Hayden meant. Congressional hearing, investigation of some kind. Nothing good. Kerry had the Democratic nomination just about locked up and was leading Bush in national polls. Hardly anyone believed the next administration would climb as far out on a legal limb as this one had. That was one reason Hayden pushed for some kind of congressional notification.   (page 292)  ----------------  Seems to be a PATTERN here--as if they clearly KNEW they were breaking the law.                           In a May 2011 speech, then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates described the Pentagons business operations as an amalgam of fiefdoms without centralized mechanisms to allocate resources, track expenditures, and measure results.  My staff and I learned that it was nearly impossible to get accurate information and answers to questions such as How much money did you spend and How many people do you have?   http://www.reuters.com/investigates/pentagon/#article/part2  A search in the Budget Overview document for the word "audit," for example, will take you to page 7-34, among others, where you will find that DOD set a goal of reaching 100 percent readiness to audit its assets and liabilities by the year 2017, but the last column shows that the indicator of progress made toward that goal in FY 2010 was deleted at the request of the Comptroller, who happens to be the chief financial officer of DOD! Furthermore, the auditability asserted for 2017 would not include any audits of specific weapons programs! The Pentagon Labyrinth (2011) is a free book edited by Winslow Wheeler--its about 100 pages (great read):   http://pogoarchives.org/labyrinth/full-labyrinth-text-w-covers.pdf                                                                                                                                                     	188
 ...but nobody lost quite as spectacularly as the sage grouse.   TBH, I haven't read all 178 pages yet...   A lot of those documents were actually declassified in 1977. Here you go: http://www.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/13inmate_ProjectMKULTRA.pdf   Hm. Decent point. Maybe we should. If the private sector would agree to fund the research, I can definitely see why we'd be better off without linking science to government money.      For more than two weeks many American scientists couldnt share their findings with the international scientific community or participate in joint research projects abroad. Government shutdown not only stifled U.S. researchit set back our foreign collaborators, too.  That's why.   Losing two weeks of data collection during a critical research period or two weeks of a key experiment that took months or years to set up will have repercussions for years  ...And I thought shutting off the National Zoo's panda cam was bad.     It's crazy that a guy like Culberson can be so into NASA and yet so ignorant when it comes to environmental science.       I feel like a story about gecko-inspired gloves comes out every month. But apparently this one actually works (!). Crazy video.   I wonder how this impacts studies of video game violence. Does COD teach violence *faster* than, say a violent television show? Interesting.             "We look at these old Archaean crusts, for instance, and we dont see the features that characterize subduction," Rey says.  It's a model that confirms physical evidence. Read the article (and the study, for that matter).          Yup. The NASA Centennial Challenge might help them fix that...        	19

 I donated 10 bucks here. I can't read the actual zoo website to figure out how to donate.   Congratulations Everypony!   Oh no. get well soon and hope all goes well!   Apparently they are getting a lot of angry calls because they are charging people full price for the mystery boxes when they already checked out with the coupon code. So yea, I expect to be on hold for a while.   How can I help? Is there any way I can donate via paypal?    Do those things work? I am always getting blisters :(   didn't they have a jump to conclusions mat?   haha thanks for reminding me to call and cancel my subscription, I've been meaning to but it's such a pain in the ass and you're always on hold for like 2 hours...   Why can't the siblings who actually give a shit plan the damned funeral? Honestly there has to be like a cremation and cardboard box option covered for those who don't have money/ aren't willing to spend money on someone they hate   I'd buy one.    That sucks, good luck   pretty!!! what are you having done?   If I had to read ONE book, Fight Club would be a pretty good one to choose.   Ok I will play devil's advocate. There is not a single book that 50 kids would agree they all want to read. How would the teachers get around that if not choosing one for them?   The Scarlet Letter isn't a shitty book. I am against being forced to read books. God knows I hated "A Farewell to Arms" and pretty much every other Hemingway book.  But The Scarlet Letter isn't really that bad. For god's sake if you have to go watch the movie version   almost every time I am in a bookstore or a target, someone inevitably assumes I work there. I do not wear a red shirt. I hate khakis. I don't get it   like what, "divergent"?  I'll pass   Oh heaven forbid you should be forced to read   I have no menstrual cycle unless I am on hormonal birth control. YAY Pcos!   The signs at our store say that. I guess because they had too many of these type of shenanigans   Bah everytime coke goes on sale everyone comes and buys it all then I can't get any at all. :(   what an asshole. he's the reason I can't get ONE pack    that is so sad :(   That was nice of you. Most people would just keep the more expensive item   and this is why I do not drive forklifts. lol   why the fuck are the other employees standing around talking the whole time?   How do you NOT clip your balls with that? I've tried and I nicked the shit out of my labia. I trim with scissors. I am not cutting my vagina and honestly my husband doesn't care.   Well you don't marry someone unless they go down on you. DUH   Yea I cannot shave my pubes at all. I get ingrown pubes and they get infected. So this would be a deal breaker for me   I honestly can't see why anyone would think they look good   18 days? that must be some kind of record....   oh damn the red wedding nails look amazingggggggg   also mexico.   If you aren't happy with the old one, why buy a new one?   I've gotten one box. And I had to wait like 6 months to get it. Just review a bunch of crap, tweet and or share on facebook, ask questions and then wait for a survey to come in your email. I ended up lying my ass off to get this cheese voxbox. We'll see if it works. I have done like 3 or 4 pre-qualification surveys and I always get "we're sorry but you don't qualify". So I am trying to lie now to actually get boxes   I had a laparoscopy because of my PCOS. I was in a lot of pain and they wanted to see if I might have endometriosis. I did not but while they were in there they got a bunch of tiny cysts out since they were causing me pain.  It was a same day surgery, they knocked me out and then I woke up like 2 hours later. The painful part was the gas. They have to blow you up with gas to see your insides better. That shit hurts so bad. I was really gassy for like 3 days. They gave me hydrocodone and I was taking them like every 8 hours because I was in a lot of pain. After about three days the pain got better but I still stayed at home for like two weeks because I have a labor intensive job and I didn't want to pop any stitches or anything. I had my surgery on february 20th and I'm completely healed but I have a tiny scar in my belly button and along my pubis.  I do not have any experience with blocked tubes but my aunt had a twisted ovary. They ended up having to remove it (the ovary) but she ended up having three girls with one ovary.     robin's egg blue. so ... robin   If I had 4k I'd buy a damn car   lol he wanted you to refund his gas money?   so you've been to a doctor? what the fuck is that ?   yea that is fucked up. anal is not a loophole that magically allows sex before marriage   I just ignore them until they hang up.   he sounds like a scumbag    for sale: slightly used bench. non functioning.   Worst case scenario: you could get genital warts, if that is the particular strain she has.   Another possible scenario: you could get hpv and then give it to another female.  HPV can lead to cervical cancer but early detection/prevention is key.  I would recommend using a condom at least until you are in a serious relationship   Thank you   It's probably evolutionary because otherwise nobody would want to have sex...   That is awful :(   personally I wouldn't want to have sex with someone unless they were comfortable with it. granted I don't always want to have sex during my period but if they can't be mature about it, I would have trouble respecting them   You're very right. Some of our trucks have that ridiculous have to turn the steering wheel thing before starting. My car does the same thing but it's somehow more difficult on the newer trucks. My husband forgets after years of marriage that he has to do that with my car. Also that the gas tank is on the passenger side.   dammit I started freaking out too, then I realized it's not may. lol   fuck I have no idea when the hell easter is.    oh my god. I am so sorry. I wouldn't have any contact with her either   UGH. We had a lady yesterday screaming and CURSING at her kids and threatening to slap them. As far as I could tell they were just sitting in the backseat of her car being kids. She was screaming something about you kids have no god damn respect for anything yadda yadda yadda. It took every fiber of my being to not go over there and slap the shit out of that woman. Those poor children. :(   Thanks!   I believe you can buy gift cards with paypal. I am broke as shit but can use paypal/bill me later to buy gift cards. The only thing is I have no idea what I am doing. Does anyone know how the hell to do this? Thanks   I've thought about reporting it or at least telling corporate    The employees at my store don't wear the name tags. There's a big pile of them behind the front desk. For some reason I never got the memo that nobody wears them so I've been wearing mine all this time.   I would have filed a police report. That is assault.   I work at a place that rents moving trucks and vans.  We get notifications when something is wrong with one of the vehicles. So I was trying to figure out if we had to send them to get repaired or if it was something stupid like windshield wipers. Most of the time people leave the lights on and then freak out because they have a dead battery. It would be funny if it didn't happen SO frequently.  Anyway there were two notifications on our vans that popped up yesterday. I investigated because these vans were fine the day prior. Apparently, we had two different people call roadside assistance yesterday. The first apparently got his van stuck a few blocks over from the store. It was raining and I guess (?) he tried to drive through mud.  All I could see on the computer was where the guy got stuck and that they determined it was the customer's fault. They had to tow him.  The second guy locked the keys in the van somewhere in New York.   Do you think this kind of crap would happen so frequently if it was their own vehicle?  Finally someone coming with one of our trailers from Reno NV had to stop in Iowa for the night because whoever put the hitch on their car didn't do a great job and the trailer was coming loose. This is the only one of three reports that was caused due to our company's negligence. I am only including this one because we had to send someone out to fix it and pay for his hotel room. There were two adults, a cat, and a dog. And the ramada doesn't have any rooms that allow pets.  I genuinely feel bad for these people. They are more than halfway from Nevada to our location and travelling with pets is a nightmare.       Give him the discount, then eat the kitkat :)   I work at a storage/rental truck place. We have a "climate control" section. Ironically, the roof leaks. So people are paying MORE money hoping their antiques and heirlooms will be safe from the elements, not realizing that there's a very real chance their stuff will be ruined by mold and water. Our manager is aware. Our regional manager is aware. And his response is "oh we have all these empty rooms, it's not a big deal." The thing is, the leaks are NOT in individual rooms. They are in HALLWAYS.  Yesterday I spent most of the afternoon placing buckets so I wouldn't have to mop up dirty water for the 50th time that day. I also left wet floor signs in three different places. I am leaving the buckets there because 1) maybe if it looks trashy enough they will fix the damned roof, 2) I do not want someone to slip, fall, and sue the shit out of the company and 3) We have a damned flood watch. I am not going to be back in until tuesday and nobody is going to go back there to clean up dirty water until then.  The roof has been leaking for months. Every time it snows there's a leak. Every time it rains there's a leak. For the most part I've tried ignoring it and just mopping up when I can but it all seems futile.   it rubs the lotion on its skin   That is the worst photoshop attempt I have ever seen.   Oh I know. I am connected to my mother's account, and she had a stroke and lost her job. So since we don't have a combined total of like $7,000 in the bank now we have to pay a monthly bs fee.    ugh, of course not   I smell a lawsuit   isn't this just going to lead to all the doctors giving birth control off-label? Oh well we'll just say you have heavy periods. wink wink   I have PCOS. In order to have a regular period I have to take birth control. I stopped taking birth control and had no period for OVER THREE YEARS. I would sue the ever living fuck out of these assholes if they wouldn't give me birth control   haha I would give him 11 cents out of my pocket on the condition that he never come back to that store   I "solved" the mystery when I realized I can squirt buckets and then get up after sex and STILL pee. I mean if it was pee, you think my bladder would be empty by that point.   Just a question. Since this is the first time a guy has consistantly made you squirt, does he have a bend in his penis? My husband has a curve in his penis facing up. It seems to hit my g-spot really easily, and almost every time we have sex I squirt. I USED to only squirt with a hitachi magic wand. So we have a theory that it has to do with his odd penis shape   Waterproof mattress pad from amazon and we always have towels under my ass    who the hell is downvoting this? do you have no heart :(   This is my favorite line since reading this reddit and I have to repeat it to myself all day to keep from going insane:  "Lack of planning on your part does not constitute an emergency on mine."   Every time I use another bank's atm I get charged non bank atm fee TWICE   (previously) Bank of America.  Now, Wells Fargo.  I'm also getting charged a bullshit $13 monthly fee I hate them.   I really like cetaphil   There's nothing wrong with it. if you're fine with it then there's not a problem   You mean I can't buy american airlines plane tickets in the book store?    take the money, then walk over to the other store, then hand THEM the money. lol problem solved   yea how do cute tiny things have a gender?   all vaginas are different. just like all penises are different. short of having major surgery there's nothing that can be done and you're just going to have to deal with it   Use our atms. Get charged a $7.50 fee. Then have YOUR bank charge a non *bank name* atm fee. :)   well i guess you could have carved the heavy part out of the pineapple, leaving it a hollow shell....   d'awwwwwww   fuck him, go home if he's going to be a dick about it   shit I thought he was being serious   /r/mildlyinteresting   oh my god. glad the dude survived   How often are you masturbating?   It sounds like he was pretty fun to have around. At least to make the day less boring.   he was probably too busy talking on the phone to notice that lol   bah I would have called the cops   ugh I hate people on their cell phones. hang the fuck up!   ewww   We get this all the time. Then they're all like "your doors are broken!"   The other day we had a guy manage to sneak into the store with the lights off to use the bathroom. WE ARE CLOSED. I was horrified because I thought he was trying to rob the store or something. Nope he wanted to go pee.  And then he wanted to buy something/rent a truck. What part of "closed" do you not understand? You can use the bathroom but then we are going to have to ask you to leave.    reading is hard   I know right? Laundry, showers, sleeping in beds. It's almost criminal /s   rofl he wanted a bribe of meat   Work at a box truck company that sells storage. We had a guy threaten to beat up a coworker because they were charged for gas. It was like 15 dollars.   what a dick   I wasn't there but once a dude tripping his balls off ran into the store, punched some mannequins, sprinted up stairs, swung on a sign then tried to jump off the stairway. Apparently he thought he was mountain climbing.   Man I'd be pissed if I missed out on seeing that  	104

 I only add people I know outside of reddit as mods. And if they have more than one account, they can use the account that is already moderating.    Boxers or briefs?   How exactly do you make a beacon?    The seed is 'gnocci' and the mountains get good at x -285 y 106 z 407.         The first thing I noticed in the album was the Deathly Hallows graffiti.       Mules are sterile.   I decided I would update the software on my iPhone. No problem, right? Wrong. I look and it shows the 'connect to iTunes' logo. That's not right. Next, I saw a notification that my iPhone was in recovery mode and needed to be restored. I figured there was no other way to fix this since it was stuck on that screen, so I restored of course. I'm just hoping I'm not alone on this.    This made me cry! I'm getting the last issue...I don't care what it takes!!   I accidentally built a house at cloud-level...but only the 2nd floor is at cloud level. It's pretty irritating to go upstairs and then there is a giant cloud taking it's time going through my house.    FAKE. Nobody has that signal with At T.   Piranha.    87...A ton of these names decided to run away from my mind. Time for a marathon...   I would put my best skill at procrastinating, but if that's not accepted, then I guess I'll just make them all feel a bit too awkward.    This is fantastic! I'm glad nothing like this happens to me; I'm also glad you're alright (physically, anyways)! Message me when next part comes around!       I've used this a couple times. You can change the angle and difficulty (how fast it 'scrolls'). It's pretty fun and the faster it moves, the better the workout.    I'm wondering if I should even bother updating or not...It seems there are more complaints about 6 than praise.    I know that (I actually prefer that subreddit), but my friend really wanted one Luka-centric. So I gave her her subreddit...and tried to explain it wouldn't grow that large.    Absolutely.    I didn't put it there, actually. My building skills are quite horrendous. And I was on creative and like to use glowstone instead of torches around my house.       At least he didn't click an NSFW links...from what we can see.     The fridge seems like a good deal until you realize that $100.00 buys about 3-4 bags of decent groceries.             If they do take out all of the well known characters for 4, the movie will do as fantastic as the final seasons of G1. Once the characters people know and love are gone, they stop watching.       Back in 6th grade I had the pleasure of watching one of my classmates do an oral report after having vodka for lunch. It was hilarious. He never got in trouble. Just suspended for doing other stupid shit.    GET SOME HOT SAUCE ON THAT SHIT.      I was playing Minecraft and noticed the sun looked a bit odd. It was a solar eclipse! Has anyone else witnessed this? If so, how often does it happen?   I honestly found the Bount arc terrible. And I thought it was canon back then-so it was supposed to be awesome!   That's a dub I haven't heard in a long, long time.     The only person I am super picky about, is Kisuke MUST be played by Owen Wilson.   You have a problem with pictures of a dead fetus posted online yet you're on r/WTF?    Fake.   Honestly, you should try to stay around people as much as possible. With this, the last thing you should do is isolate yourself. That's when the bad stuff always happens; when people get the logic of "I'll stay alone to save others." If he is truly this crazy, you being out of the way wouldn't necessarily stop him.             This belongs on facepalm (facebook post) and it shouldn't be here (it's a screenshot, check the rules). Also, I really don't get it...   Hetalia has mentions of WW2 and focuses on the Axis and Allies.    Well...I am quite the Hetalia fan. So, whilst I was in social studies, we were already getting rather off topic and in my corner of the room, we were talking about WW2. I decided to blurt out "I love the axis! Germany is lovely!" My teacher didn't appreciate that and I had to go through and explain Hetalia to a room of non-anime viewers.   What's the age range?         Austria.   I think this is pretty awesome for LP and Transformers fans like me...but I'll never get one.    It's a my little pony extension for google chrome (ponyhoof).          Bidding ended at about $250.00. Little less..But that tab makes scary sounds.          J-just take all of my upvotes!!!   how...did...you...FIND THIS??? I could hug attack right now!!!            More like Italian.    My friend wants to be buried in a tomb of anime plushies...mostly Sasuke.    We all remember in the first movie when Hagrid went and got Harry from his house after the attack, right? Well, what about when in the last movie it was Snape to get Harry out of the house? This is definitely the biggest plothole I have seen in the series. Feel free to correct me, Potter fans, if I'm incorrect on something.    Break Stuff -Limp Bizkit. My I'm pissed off song.    Skillet is a Christian band.    Don't mean to brag or anything...but...crotch scratches are nice.    One does not simply...get sick of pasta.    I really didn't realize how many pics I went through until I was done! That was quite the adventure though! I didn't think it would look so nice towards the end after seeing everything torn apart. Well done!   Will you be a redditor when you're older?      My sister works in a salon and gets hair splinters in her feet all the time.   Considering how anti-9gag reddit is, at least crop out the logo to avoid ridicule.       We were talking about alliances and stuff...I got sent in the hall after laughing about Germany invading France...three times.    Boxers or briefs?   My brother in law has worked countless hours in factories for the past six years to support my sister, my niece, and now my newborn nephew, and my sister doesn't even give him a birthday card or say thank you. He's sacrificed everything down to his laptop (she kept hers though) to keep them out of the streets and she is asking for a new otter box. She also hasn't had a full time job in the whole time they've been together...spent the past six years on an assistant teacher degree that she dropped out on a month before she would have finally graduated.    World is mine hatsune miku         GerIta, USUK, Spamano   Psh...once you've seen blue waffles, you've seen it all.      It was probably the only time Italy ever followed orders from Germany!    A walkthrough had to be a mood killer XD.    He has to be a little impatient...Italy probably has no idea what he's doing!   That might just break the internet...in the most awesome way possible.   	89
 Its just a question of being smart and not inviting trouble. i used the strap on my camera to attach it to my forearm for safety, but its more important just to not draw attention to yourself or invite unwanted trouble. If you look like a tourist, you are a target. If you look like a seasoned travel without a penny to your name, people ignore you. Just don't make it obvious you own valuable things!   That is generally the rule, but I actually really like Kathmandu! I was followed by a drug dealer (they are depressingly common in the sub-continent) and I'm sure the intention was to rob me as westerners are generally assumed to be rich wherever you go!   Thank you!    Networking with other travellers is easy, in generally most travellers eat and sleep in the same places and are usually very willing to chat to new people and share stories, experiences or advice! Most international travellers use English as a common language, so it helps if you are fluent!  Do you mean you are from South-East Asia, or you want to travel South-East Asia? I've tried my best to give good advice on most things in this thread, have a read of some of my comments, I hope they help! Feel free to ask any other questions though, I am happy to share advice with others who want to see more of the world! :)   haha, agreed! I have tried food from all over this world and New York Pizzas do kick ass!! They don't quite measure up to Cambodian chicken sandwiches though! France is probably slightly cheaper than the UK, both are expensive but France is nicer. Both the English and the French are rude as a rule, so watch out! Thats party why I moved to New Zealand, the people are actually friendly here!!   Thanks! You don't need to worry too much about travelling if you are a young woman though, I answered another couple of questions along those lines. Basically it is safe in most parts of the world to travel solo as a woman, in some places though you should be a little more mindful of how you dress, i.e minimum bare skin and nothing tight fitting or revealing, and just be a bit more mindful about where you go (stick to crowded or busy places) and where you go at night. These are just basic safety precautions anyway, you just need to pay a little extra attention if you are a woman. Lots of young women do travel solo though, so don't rule it out!   Happy travels! :)   [Here is a link!](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14dbv0/i_travelled_around_the_entire_world_solo_when_i/)  I hope you find it useful, I am happy to offer advice to anyone planning some travel!      Thanks for the tip about the subreddits! I have answered lots of questions about what you want to do, read a few of my comments and that should answer most of your questions! I am happy to offer advice though! South East Asia is a good call, check out Thailand, Cambodia and Viet Nam. They can all be done on a budget but be warned, there is quite a bit of poverty, especially in Cambodia and the touts are sometimes quite aggressive, so it is not for the faint hearted.  Your parents are justified and right to be worried, it is a big deal! I am extremely grateful to my parents for supporting me and trusting me to have the brains and the balls to pull it off. World travel is not for everyone, you need to be an independent, self-aware person but you learn that while travelling. It is normal to feel overwhelmed at the start of a journey or trip, so watch out for that! Your parents are right to worry and you should be glad they do, they just need to be able to trust to you be smart and brave.   Depends where you are. If you're European then see more or Europe, if you are American or Canadian, go to New Zealand or the European mainland! If you are adventurous go to Thailand or Viet Nam! If you are reckless go to India!!   I travelled breifly accross America, I chose to spend my time and budget in Asia and New Zealand though. I went to New York and Los Angeles. I like New York and would go back. You couldn't pay me to go back to Los Angeles.  If you don't mind me saying, it is an unfortunate fact that a disproportionally low percentage of Americans bother with international travel, which is a shame. Of  course there is a lot to see in America, but more of your countryfolk should see more of the world, if you don't mind me saying!   No, sorry! If you think it would be worthwhile I could keep one next time!   It is worth seriously thinking about it! There are surprisingly good few reasons not to! If I could do it at 18 on such a small budget anyone can!! At least give it some serious thought, and I am happy to give advice!   No not really. You meet other travellers from all over the world all time and I made some great friends from all over the place! Obviously you miss your family and friends etc, but its totally worth it. Travelling alone does make you much more independent.   I didn't have one best place, I loved Wanaka New Zealand though, as well as Northern Viet Nam and Khumjung which is a tiny village deep in the Himalayas. The worst place I went was Los Angeles, easily, although New Delhi was no picnic.   One backpack is all you need. Just take a few changes of clothes and a medical kit, everything else is optional.  You are talking about 'inter-railing', you used to be able to get good prices but it is much more expensive these days, it depends on your budget. I never did europe by train so I don't know much about it, sorry! I got round most of Europe by flying, it can be done very cheap!    I haven't decided yet. I loved Asia so much I thought I might head back in that direction!   Nope!   Flights are the only expensive thing, but theres plenty of apps and websites and travel agents who can do you a good deal. Try the app Skyscanner if you have a smart phone. I personally wouldn't recommend the UK, but I am biased as I grew up there and just emigrated to New Zealand! Europe is awesome, lots and lots to see, but expensive. If you can afford it, try Italy, Germany, France and Norway.   I did it alone because it gave me much greater freedom and I didn't know anyone who wanted to go as far or travel as wide as I did!! Travelling alone gives you much more freedom, for example if you are bored of one town you can take a bus to wherever the hell you want, you don't have to get anyones agreement or permission. Besides, you meet so many people on the road I was never lonely for a second, and if you meet sufficiently cool people you can team up and travel with them for a while!  Make sure you pick a good travelling companion, time on the road can stress out even a close friendship! You need someone who understands and listens to your needs and above all will care about you if you are upset or ill. Expect arguments, don't let them ruin your travels!    I worked solidly from when I was 16 to just before I left just after I turned 18   1. The trip all told cost me around 6-7000 GBP  2. The trip lasted just over 9 months.  3. It depends where you want to go! I would hugely recommend New Zealand to anyone, it is as beautiful as it looks in LOTR films! I also loved Viet Nam and Laos. If you are a little more adventurous I would hugely recommend Nepal!  4. I have shared loads of tips in this thread, read a few comments. If you have any questions I haven't answered feel free to PM me!!  5. Meeting people really isn't difficult, I made some great friends with people from all over the world. Meeting fellow travellers is very easy as most tend to eat and sleep in the same places and all are keen to chat about shared experiences or share advice on where to go and not go. I also did my upmost to talk and help locals as much as I could, which is a lot more fun! I once spend an afternoon in Northern Viet Nam drinking Whiskey with a group of elderly men who couldn't speak a word of english, it was such a great laugh!!  6. I stayed in all sorts of places! stuck to hostels in western countries for the sake of my budget, in Asia guest houses are cheap and plentiful! I also stayed with locals in some places like Nepal, which was very cool! Staying safe is a matter of having the brains and the balls to avoid trouble and stand up for yourself if its unavoidable. I never got myself in too deep, I can look mean when I need to, which would have been hard to believe if you had known me before I left! You learn fast how to look after yourself when travelling alone, and it can be a very strange or seriously cool feeling knowing you are completely responsible for your own well being and no one on the same continent as you knows who you are or what your name is.  I hope this helps! If you have any other questions I am happy to answer them!!   I took as little as possible with me, in fact the thing that took up most room in my backpack was my medical kit! That is the most important thing, you will need bandages, malaria pills, rehydration sachets, more bandages, a good disinfectant like Iodine and some extra bandages. Other than that clothes(you don't need many, I took 2 pairs of shorts and 5 shirts), a good camera, a diary (writing a diary on the road is hugely rewarding, mine is now my most treasured possession) and a good book, which it is common practice to trade with other travellers once you have read it.   I started planning simply by deciding that I definitely wanted to see the world and which bits of the world I wanted to see! I settled on a route that took me to New Zealand, South-East Asia and India. That was it for planning though, I deliberately didn't plan too much to give myself extra freedom to do what I like when I was there, best way to do it!  Travelling as a women isn't a problem, you can still go to most places without having to worry. There are a couple of extra considerations, like making sure you dress sensibly: Keep bare skin and tight fitting clothes to a minimum so as not to attract unwanted attention, and just pay extra attention to where you go after dark. This is being over-cautious to a degree, as almost everywhere is safe (or not abnormally unsafe) for women travellers, but maybe bare this in mind on the Indian sub-continent or Middle East. Also in many countries women are expected to dress modestly out of religious deference, but it always greatly got on my nerves when people looked down there noses at me for religious reasons.  If you want any more advice feel free to PM me! :)   I worked solidly from when I was 16 to when I was 18, it can be done very cheaply though if you shop around, the only things that cost any real money is flights and insurance (you **must** have insurance!!) I recommend South-East Asia if you haven't done much travelling before, its a lot of fun, theres plenty of other travellers and its cheap!   I stayed in all sorts of places, stuck to hostels while in western countries for the sake of my budget, but once in Asia guest houses are cheap and plentiful. In more remote places I stayed with locals, mostly in Nepal and India. Feel free to PM me! I am happy to give advice to people, I only got as far as I did thanks to the kindness and advice of others, so I am always happy to pay it forward!   Thank you, it certainly was an awesome experience, but instead of envying me, emulate me! If I can do it on such a small budget and at such an age, anyone can! Its is worth giving consideration to, and I would be happy to offer any advice!   It depends where you are. In many places giving gifts is considered a great compliment and a good way to repay a local for kindness shown. I gave all sorts of things as gifts, such as foreign currency, my photographs, my books and drawings I made while travelling.   My answer won't be what you expect, but the best meal I had on the road was a chicken sandwich and a sprite in Sihanoukville, Cambodia. I have no idea how they cook the chicken, but I have yet to have a tastier meal!! Kangaroo steak is also tasty, as is crocodile and yak meat. Do not eat snake, its disgusting!    Yes, I feel it changed me and my perspectives hugely. I was a much stronger, more independent man when I came back from travelling, all my old friends commented at one time or another how I had changed, apparently I had a stronger walk when I came home, which I was quite flattered by! I did gain a much better perspective on the world and what people can do to one another under certain circumstances. For me I reflected a lot on the nature of Capitalism and Religion, I won't rant about either but you certainly get a lot of perspective on both once you see enough of the world.  Plus I lost a ridiculous amount of weight, I barely existed by the time I got home!   It has been on my list for a long time, although it is slightly out of my budget. You should try Cambodia and Viet Nam!   I have several favourite experiences! Climbing through the Himalayas was incredible, Northern Viet Nam was also awesome, especially drinking with the locals who didn't speak a word of english! Travelling did change me enormously, I had a great deal more self respect when I got back and am much more independent now, plus being a lot more wise to how the world works in some places. You do look differently at western culture and capitalism after leaving it for an extended period of time!   I did try to do an AMA as an expat a few months ago but the mods deleted it!   [Here is the New Zealand immigrations website](http://www.immigration.govt.nz/)  [Here is a list of employment areas they are currently seeking in New Zealand](http://www.newzealandnow.govt.nz/working-in-nz)   Nope!   roughing it just means eating basic food (you can eat very well in Asia on a minimal budget! The trick is to eat where the locals eat!) and basic accommodation. The cheapest room I stayed in was in Namche in Nepal, cost 50 ruppees, thats about 20 english pennies or 35 american cents. A little competition I sometimes played with fellow travellers was who had got the cheapest room. I always won! (I did tip extra when I left!)  I started in England and travelled to: USA, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Laos, Thailand again, India, Nepal, India again, Doha, Italy, Vatican City, England   That was roughing it, but you can do some decent travelling on much less though!   It all came to around 7000 GBP, which isn't that bad considering.   There were many times when I felt at risk, I injured myself in many crazy ways (falling off motorbikes   skateboards) I also swam with sharks and poisonous jellyfish (without meaning to, and came within 2 feet of a 12 foot Nurse Shark, no cages, nothing) I saw dead bodies in India with needles still in their arms and was followed by a drug dealer in Kathmandu, but the only place I genuinely feared for my life was when I got lost in Los Angeles at night.   I alright thanks   I was never bored! I explored wherever I was, read lots, met fellow travellers and locals etc. I would occasionally team up with other travellers to travel with for a while, sometimes I would deliberately stray off the beaten track!   Where are you going, where are you from? I actually wouldn't mind a travelling companion this time around, private message me if your interested! I will most likely be heading to South East Asia again or maybe India!   Thank you, I don't know you either but you just made me smile!   Not a huge amount of trouble. I broke a bone in my foot and added several scars to my skin, I also ended up in hospital in Laos but never had any legal trouble. I nearly got attacked in Kathmandu but I can look scary when I need to   I emigrated as I really loved the country and didn't see a future for me in England! Google 'WWOOF New Zealand', the idea is you work for anyone (usually farm owners etc) in exchange for food and shelter. Great if your low on cash and an excellent way to meet very cool people! I actually originally came here on a working holiday visa myself, although I used WWOOF rather than get paid work, as if you get a job somewhere you still have to pay for somewhere to live and food etc. I live in Wellington and there are plenty of jobs about though, useful websites are [seek](http://www.seek.co.nz/) or [trademe](http://www.trademe.co.nz/jobs)   What I did depended on where I was and how I was feeling. Sometimes I would team up with other travellers, sometimes I would deliberately go off the beaten track. I made a habit of talking to locals as much as I could wherever I was and made some good friends from all over the world! I would usually stay in a place 2 or 3 nights until I got restless then ask other travellers or locals where they recommend I go next, its a cool way to live! To counter culture-shock or homesickness I would usually try to eat western food about twice a week and kept in touch by email with people at home. I got hooked on chicken sandwiches in South-East Asia, I have no idea how they cook them but I have yet to have a meal that tastes better than a chicken sandwich in Cambodia!!  Yes I am from England originally, but I live in New Zealand now. Are you American or Canadian? My advice before going to London would be to abandon any romantic ideas about the place, its hardly a land of fairytales! I never liked going to London, although there are a few places worth seeing, like the museums and Tower of London etc. My advice would be to see a bit of England outside London, I grew up in the countryside in a county called Norfolk, I recommend it! Stephen Fry is also from Norfolk!   My parents were actually very supportive, for which I am hugely grateful! Theres not many parents that would let there kids hit the road on their own (and in all fairness, its not something anyone can do), but my parents trusted me to have the brains and the balls to get it done and supported me throughout, for which I am grateful beyond words.   If you ever go to Thailand, watch out! Not all is as it seems...   I worked pretty much solidly from as soon as I was 16 until just before I left when I was 18. All told the trip cost around about 7000 GBP. It can be done a lot cheaper though, you could travel South East Asia on a shoestring budget without much trouble, as well as India, although prepare for serious culture shock! The only expensive things are flights and travel insurance (you have to have travel insurance!!) but you can get good deals on both if you shop around!   Thanks! What sort of non-touristy things?   Haha, cheers! I deliberately didn't plan ahead so I could move as freely as possible, stayed for about 3 months in New Zealand, then about a month a piece for everywhere I went in Asia. I would stay in one town or city for 2 or 3 days, then ask other travellers where they recommend I go next!   Ah brilliant, good tip! I have been researching doing a trans-siberian rail journey, and have always wanted to visit Ulaan Bataar! Any advice you could give me would be very much appreciated!!   I went travelling after leaving college (I'm english, college means something else in America) then went to University afterwards. I've just finished uni.  Yes travelling does pretty much force you to grow up fast, especially if you are travelling alone. It is a strange feeling knowing you are entirely responsible for your own well being and that no one on the same continent as you knows your name or who you are. I became extremely independent and had a great deal more self respect when I got home. People said I had a different, stronger walk when I came home, which I found quite flattering! I suppose world travel does look good to a perspective employer, shows that you are a very organised, self-reliant person. I've never really thought about it from that perspective!  My parents were actually really supportive, which I am hugely grateful for! I know many parents wouldn't dream of letting their child loose on the streets of Asia alone, but my parents trusted me to have the common sense and balls to pull it off. I cannot put into words how grateful I am to them for that.   I'm a guy, I answered a couple of other questions about the difference between travelling as a guy than as a girl, you can still travel almost anywhere if your a girl, just as long as your smart and don't take unnecessary risks or attract unwanted attention.  My coolest experience...thats not an easy thing to answer!! Trekking in the Himalayas was unbelievable, you can't even imagine what it's like until your there! Exploring the Angkor temples was pretty epic, and jungle trekking near the Burmese/Thailand border was pretty awesome as well! Good to hear your planning a trip, if you feel like you could do with some advice feel free to PM me, I only got as far as I did thanks to the kindness of others so I like to pay it forward!   Hmm, I would actually advice against moving somewhere without seeing more of the world, its actually not a good idea as you probably have romantic ideas about what its like then when you get there you will probably be disappointed. So many people go to India then leave after 2 or 3 days because of this, I know someone who booked a 6 month trip to India, then went home after 48 hours!! Culture shock is a real thing and it can be huge, especally if you haven't ventured outside the western world!  I recommend you and the Mrs take a holiday in Thailand, Google Koh Samui or Koh Chang, it would be an awesome trip for you and wouldn't be too huge a culture shock!   Its not advisable, I'm sure pictures exist somewhere though! bribes weren't big, $2 here, $5 there.   I didn't spend much time in America, I chose to spend more time exploring Asia. I visited New York and Los Angeles. I would go to New York again, you couldn't pay me to go back to Los Angeles!   There probably aren't many good reasons why you can't still do it! You don't have to be gone for years and it can be done quite inexpensively these days! I would definitely encourage you to at least think about taking a trip, you don't have to go round the world, just venture outside your comfort zone, you will find it so rewarding!  Language barriers weren't really an issue, my trick was to learn the basic phrases like "hello" "thank you" "yes" "no" etc when i went to a new country, but most people at least understand basic english or sign language. One of my fond memories from the road was drinking in a remote roadside 'bar' (for want of a better word) in Viet Nam drinking whiskey with a group of old Vietnamese men. We had no clue what the other was saying but had a brilliant laugh anyway!    I actually bought myself an SLR while travelling, and I'm very glad I did! I got a Lumix DMC-FZ28, ideal for travelling as its compact, hardy and does all the usual photographical tricks without any extra bulk or gear. Taking a huge DSLR and a massive lens is totally pointless as it is pretty much guaranteed to get lost, stolen or damaged, but travelling with a camera is a must, especially if you have an eye for taking good photos, and there are plenty of compact, inexpensive cameras out there, like my trusty Lumix!   I meant being given preferential treatment because I was white was very uncomfortable.   Well obviously I couldn't go everywhere I would have like on my time frame and budget. I visited: USA, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Laos, Thailand again, India, Nepal, India again, Doha, Italy, Vatican City, England.   By "around the entire world" I meant in a literal sense I circumnavigated the globe, not visit every country or continent.   Yeah, it is a pretty accurate depiction of *aspects* of India, although obviously nothing is like experiencing these things for yourself.   I would definitely encourage you to at least seriously consider travelling! You're only young once and the world is worth seeing!!  Things to consider: obviously cost is a big factor. How much you have depends where you can go and for how long, places like India and parts of South East Asia are cheap enough once your there, but flights and travel insurance (you have to have travel insurance!!) are pricey, not to say you can't get good deals though!  If you can get yourself to Bangkok though, you're sorted! Travelling south-east Asia isn't difficult as plenty of westerners do it so its very easy to meet other travellers and see lots of awesome things, most people understand english and travel options are plentiful and cheap! India is also a cheap and rewarding place to travel, although it most certainly is not for the faint hearted. You can expect a big culture shock when arriving in India and if you fly into Delhi or Mumbai expect to hate it passionately at least for the first day or two. Once you get out of the cities though there is a huge amount to see and lots to experience!  If you happen to be female you need to take a few extra considerations, mainly just obvious things like be careful how you dress and where you go at night. Generally though keep bare skin and tight clothing to a minimum and stick to crowded places are good advice, and being female is not a good reason not to travel, plenty of women travel solo without a problem, just avoid certain arabic countries such as UAE or Qatar, who regrettably still have a very medieval attitude to women.     Obviously there are loads more things to consider with something this big, if you have any questions feel free to PM me though and I will do my best to answer! I only got as far as I did because of the kindness of others, so I feel its important to pay it forward!   Tough one to answer, probably either the Himalayas, the Taj Mahal or Angkor.    Keeping in touch via email or the internet is pretty easy and most places have a connection. Obviously you miss people being away for so long but its so worth it and you become far more independent when travelling alone.   Touts. buying souvenirs is usually okay from street venders, but never book hotel rooms or any kind of travel arrangements from anyone who is not either employed by the hotel/travel bureau or travel agency. Also you should never buy anything or give money to child beggars. This sounds awful I know, but the gruesome fact is in a lot of places children are deliberately denied and education and forced into poverty as child beggars earn more money. In some places children are even deliberately disfigured or blinded, it can be genuinely upsetting and disturbing.    Its usually pretty clear when someone wants bribing, but important not to offer a bribe to the wrong person, that can land you in serious trouble! Certain places it is simply expected, on the border between Laos and Viet Nam it is the norm, there are even hand-writen signs up saying how much standard bribes are. Bribes are only necessary for tourists though. In some places it is the opposite, for example on the border between Nepal and India being white gets you a lot of preferential treatment, the border guards refused to search my guitar bag, because I was white. I was on a local bus and one of only 3 other white people, it was a seriously uncomfortable experience!   I worked solidly from when I was 16 to when I was 18. It was a relatively cheap trip, cost me about 7000 GBP all told.   Nice one, 14 months is pretty hardcore!! I've not decided yet, I'm either booking a flight to Delhi or Bangkok then going to make it up from there!   Thats a valid question, yes I am a man. It's an interesting point, in a lot of places your gender doesn't make a difference, but unfortunately in some places it does. For example, in India I travelled for a short time with a girl I met while travelling, and when we went into a shop or to a market together, the shop owners would only address me, even if she asked a question, the norm being that as a man, even though we barely new each other and were the same age, I was still responsible for her, because she was a girl. It was very strange. In most of the world (the exceptions being those governed by religious bodies such as many arabic countries) it is safe to travel as a woman, although obvious more care must be taken on matters of clothing and personal safety. If you happen to be a woman and planning some travel of the beaten path, always wear sensible clothing and nothing skin tight, and be sure to pay attention to where you go and when, i.e sticking to crowded places and be careful where you go after dark. It is an unfortunate state of affairs that this is still the case in some places, but it is important to be mindful of these things nonetheless.   Europe is cool, but very expensive!! Cheap accommodation is very hard to come by in most of Europe, especially the parts that are considered 'touristy'. I try not to use any networking sites while travelling, I find it is best just to talk to other travellers about where to go, what to do etc. It depends how much you want to spend and how comfortable you want to be, for Europe I recommend the website laterooms.com, usually good for finding cheap hotels etc. Places of the beaten track... try Norway, especially the north (make sure you go in summer!) and Bruges. Depends what you want to see!    All the predictable stuff. You have to provide a police check (and have a clean record) and proof of any qualifications you have. If you are deemed valuable (for example have good qualifications or useful skills) it is easy enough to get a residency visa. You have to remain a resident for a few years, during which you have to work, then you get full citizenship. I am still just a permanent resident of New Zealand, I think I have to do some kind of test in a year or two before I am aloud to be a citizen.    My long term goals fit quite easily around my travelling, as I try not to have any long term goals other than be happy! After I finished travelling I went to University in England whilst at the same time starting my emigration process to New Zealand. Now my emigration is underway and education is finished and I have a spare bit of cash on the hip, I decided to hit the road again!  Okay, a list of countries I visited in order, I started in England by the way: USA, New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, Cambodia, Viet Nam, Laos, Thailand again, India, Nepal, India again, Doha, Italy, Vatican City, England.  Epiphanies, excellent question! a lot of people ask similar questions about travelling, usually something along the lines of "did you find yourself". This is a misunderstand of what travel is about (usually spouted by people who spend a summer in Australia or Florida and then say they '*found themselves*'). It is true that during travelling you can, or have to develop a totally new persona, especially if travelling alone. It is also true that if you stray far enough from the beaten path and explore not only the beautiful, but also the grotesque and the despicable, you do start to ask certain questions about the human psyche, good and evil and, in my case, the nature of religion. So in a broad interpretation, with enough time on the road you can discover more about the workings of the mind and the parameters of your own sanity. However, the one thing the people who talk of discovering themselves fail to take into account is what happens if you dont like the man you find?   I used an international credit card, easy enough to get! It is always important to keep a stash of a few different currencies though, just in case!   The Great Pyramids of Giza, as they are the only one of the seven wonders of the ancient world that still exist!   It can be, I managed to do it relatively stress free. The emigration process takes a long time (obviously it varies country to country) but the biggest issue I faced was shipping all my stuff across the world and saying goodbye to important people I left behind. Its easy enough to stay in touch though and shipping stuff can be easy enough, depending how much money you can spend on it!   Nah its not more expensive, it all depends on how you do it! If you are willing to sacrifice **ALL** your creature comforts it can be done quite cheap, depends where you go!  The most remote place I reached was tiny isolated mountain villages in the Himalayas, one called Khumjung and another called Tengbouche, which has a famous monastery. It was a wonderful place to be, the scenery was just beyond imagination, it was breathtaking (literally as there was only 30% normal O2 levels at times!)  Visas are easy to sort out, the only countries I visited that demand visas in advance were India ($60 US in advance) and Viet Nam ($40 USD in advance) Usually just showing up on the border and bribing the border police works (I once had to bribe the same border guard twice on the border between Viet Nam and Laos!) I have a british passport which is still well respected, its not hard to sort visas out. The only thing is if you have an Israeli stamp in your passport a lot of Arab countries will not allow you a visa, so watch out for that!   Language barriers are easy, you simply learn a few useful phrases like hello, thank you, yes, no etc but english is a universal tongue, most people will understand what you are saying if you are patient.  My emigration process to New Zealand has been fairly smooth, although they have just changed the rules, I'm not sure what it's like now. I have a University Degree which makes things easier.   Lots and lots of flying, the most fun was flying in a tiny twin-engine from Kathmandu, Nepal into Lukla, which is officially one of the most dangerous airports in the world as it is carved into the side of a mountain with a too-short runway, which the decided to fix by making it extremely steep so the planes just drop off the end! It felt a lot like the scene from Aliens when their spaceship is dropped onto the planet! Anyway...  I used lots of local transport, especially in Viet Nam and India, the worst journey being 40 hours from Kathmandu to Delhi on a local bus, an experience I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy! Other than that there was a couple of motorbikes (I fell of one going down a mountain in Nepal, still have the scars!) and a skateboard (fell of that one going down a volcano in New Zealand, still have several scars from that!!)   Varanasi, India was seriously freeky, I answered another question about that [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/14dbv0/i_travelled_around_the_entire_world_solo_when_i/c7c1udp). I'm not sure about creepy, but I visited the S21 jail and killing fields in Cambodia which was extremely sobering and frankly deeply disturbing (do a google search, theres loads of info about Cambodia's Khmar Rouge history).   Tough one to answer! I broke a bone in my foot and was stuck in Wanaka, New Zealand for a few weeks on crutches and could not have been happier. So happy in fact I emigrated to New Zealand! If you haven't been to New Zealand, go for the good of your soul, especially South Island! Other than that, I spent some time deep in the Himalayas which was an incredible experience, and northern Viet nam, also an awesome place and awesome people!!   Varanasi, India. Insane place! It is the holiest city in hinduism as it is right on the Ganges and is said to be the ultimate place to die if you are a Hindu, so there is a hell of a lot of dead people about! Right on the river bank there are what are called 'Burning Ghats', which is were the bodies of the dead are cremated in the open air, as many as 200 a day per temple. However, bodies of children, cows or people with infectious decease, such as leprosy or malaria are not aloud to be burned, so are simply weighed down and dumped in the Ganges. Yet, it is also considered spiritually cleansing to bathe in the Ganges in Varanasi, so while you can have 20-30 bodies all burning away right on the river and the constant dumping of human and animal remains into the river, you have hundreds of people all along the river bathing. Insane.   I was raised in england (I now live in New Zealand) and the legal age to start employment is 16 in england. I applied for work the day after my 16th birthday and pretty much worked none stop up until just before I left, which was about a month after I turned 18. All in all the trip cost me about 7000 GBP for a nine month journey, but that was doing almost everything on the cheap. Totally worth it!   I am now 22 and about to do it again. The journey took nine months and was planned, financed and undertaken entirely by myself. If you are planned a bit of travel or backpacking I would be happy to offer my advice, especially if you are a young traveller or on a limited budget, or if you feel like doing something incredibly adventurous, heroic and foolhardy!    "Jesus Loves You"   I have a faint scar on my right elbow and shoulder I got from skateboarding down the side of a volcano in New Zealand, having never ridden a skateboard before and a clear scar up my right shin from falling off a motorbike driving down a mountain in Nepal, having never driven a motorbike before! I'm not sure, do I get epic or dumbass points for these?   its cool bro, I hate being wrong as well. Just to reiterate: This is men playing without pads http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIZQdf_zw3Y  Because we are not poofy americans, we tackle hard in NZ without pads, but have fun with your pillowfighting!   [I don't know who told you the tackles aren't as heavy in rugby, but they were talking shit.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5KkpW79o4w) And saying they are different so can't be compared...just what? I say rugby is less wimpy much as kittens are more wimpy than chainsaws.   Sorry I couldn't hear you through all that padding...   If I may be so brave: Rugby.   I sympathise with your point of view and you are of course right in much of what you say. There are christian-run soup kitchens and clinics and all variety of aid available, especially in the western world. However there are also all of these same things organised and put into motion by secular people and charities. Personally I find this form of rewardless altruism far more moving than a religious charity giving stance, but I digress. The unfortunate truth is the Catholic Church is a lot more picky about whom it grants aid to than any secular charity. Oxfam provide famine relief, support and aid to all manner of people in all manner of situations completely regardless of who or what they are, even entering war zones to do so. The same, regrettably, can not be said of the Church.  Disclaimer: Please don't look at this response as an attack on you or aggression of any sort, I am merely attempting to address and discuss your argument, and I respect your point of view.    you managed to fill all that space without actually saying anything. Impressive.   Not sure if sarcasm...   Please allow me to be the first to say you are an idiot and you're fooling no one.   I think you will find most atheists (yes, there are a lot of mindless plonkers on this site who just like to poke fun) can see there is some good done in the name of religion. However, we also see the amount of evil done in the name of religion. Being open-minded is about balanced and objectivity. Yes the church obviously gives a great deal of aid to the world, but they do a lot of harm, and have caused untold suffering. weigh up both sides, as many other people do, and come to your own conclusion. merely saying both sides look like idiots only shows your ignorance. I refer you to [this comment.](http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/comments/13rd6i/til_the_catholic_church_is_the_largest/c76phgr)   Lets break this down. First thing to notice is the word 'non-governmental'. Lets face it, there are very few non-governemental aid organisations, and since we grant the Catholic Church their own sovereign state (Vatican City), how can they be considered non-governmental? They simply can't, and I would be interested to see their percentage of wealth and capitol spend on aid compared to that of other countries or charities. I dare say it would not stack up quiet so well.  Second. All other charities in the world, save those dreaded few sponsored by religion, help those in need and in famine, they make no demands upon the suffering, they simply give aid. It is commonplace (I am not just ranting, I have seen this for myself) for christian charity to only be given to christian people, that is to say if you do not believe in Jesus and the christian doctrine (or the wickedness of condoms) you simply are not aloud aid. No other charity includes indoctrination as part of its charity, and this should not be considered anything but wicked. Also, lets just quickly look at where the catholic cash-bags come from. Before modern globalisation the Catholic Church was by far the most insidious imperialist nation in the world, and the cash flowed in from all corners of the impoverished world. Look at the damage done by Christianity in Africa. Other charity organisations take money from those who can afford to give and apply it to the poor. The Catholics look at the money they already took from the poor and think they aught to give some back.  Third, let us examine the inference of this claim. This is wikipedia, it does not make this statement true. I highly doubt it is compared to organisations such as Oxfam, who I have worked alongside.  EDIT: Instead of just downvoting me, why not offer a response? I will reasonably address any sensible response to this comment.   She was one of my ex-girlfriends best mates. Nice girl!   just thought I would say, I know her!   On the same note, I could circumcise myself with scissors if i wanted to. Just because something is possible, doesn't mean it is to be done!   You can see in this picture I think how uncomfortable Goering felt sitting next to Hess, whom he considered (probably accurately) to be insane.   Maybe the world doesn't need religion to be the basis for a government? Maybe?   Its called American Politics. That ain't democracy chaps!   Nice try Jean-Claude   Greedo still shot first   GREEDO FIRED FIRST!!!   With it's consent.   [Made in Heaven](http://imgur.com/lI2Tp)   To get the ball rolling I will share possibly my best story: I once woke up in a graveyard about 2 miles from the place I had been getting drunk. Not entirely sure why I was there but I didn't feel all too healthy!   I also got kicked out of the same Irish Bar twice in one night in Auckland, then found an ATM receipt for $150 in my pocket with no money and no clue where the money went!   [Oh yeah? Well I was once so drunk my gafliberty couldn't zip zop my pudding pop!](http://imgur.com/KNjAO)   This is a topic I have given a great deal of thought to (as have many people, obviously) and have come to my own conclussions which I will atempt to elaborate fairly, so please no one mistake my for a fire and brimstone /r/athiesm-ist.  The idea of an afterlife, or of somehow in any respect surviving ones own death, is obviously a hugely thought over and discussed point, possibly the most in history. It seems to rely however on there being something in the body (some might call it 'soul' or 'spirit') that is somehow separate from the whole. When a human dies, the physical body decays, inevitably. Therefore, something must exist beyond physical realms. Furthermore, this spiritual something must carry and bare hallmarks of the individual it 'belongs to'. Forgive my cynicism, but such a thing, as far as all material evidence and cold logic is concerned, does not exist, furthermore most likely *cannot* exist in this physical world we inhabit.   The idea of surviving ones own death is, to the best of my beliefs, the pinnacle of wishful thinking, as anyone can see. Obviously most people would sincerely wish to live past there death, or more so that loved ones might who have already died, and this leads us to hypothesise on ways that it may be possible, giving rise to various things that is a whole different discussion in itself.  Some may say this view is cynical or I must be a pretty miserable/depressed person to hold such a view. However I see this life, and my youth, as hugely significant and precious beyond words because I know it will never come again, I have one chance to live a full and worthy life, I better not waste it! I encourage at every opportunity anyone else to think on the issue along those lines. Obviously given the choice almost everyone would want to have an afterlife, but consider for a moment that one day you will breath your last, and that will be the end. Doesn't that fill you with the appreciation for the miracle that is the body you inhabit and how amazing and precious it is, to be alive.

 Been there, done that. Also: Kim Peek, inspiration for Rain Man, was *not autistic*, and do people ever listen when you say that? No, no they do not.   Spelling and writing are more "crystallized" than speech and take longer to change. Also, our orthography is something we are explicitly taught long after we have learned to speak.  Finally, the question you need to ask is "considered right by whom and in what context?"  Many words are roundly condemned despite being in common usage for a very long time. Consider "ain't" or the "aks" pronunciation of "ask". There is no official body to say "this is right, this is wrong". Instead, right and wrong are largely considered on the grounds of what wealthy, educated people consider to be right and wrong... which, unsurprisingly, overlaps strongly with how they perceive themselves as speaking and writing.   Iris is pretty light skinned. Her children, especially if she marries a white guy, could easily come out looking lighter than she is. And if they continue the trend, there's no reason her grandchildren couldn't look white. And if they look white and identify as white, they effectively *are* white, race being a social construct and not any sort of science. Quite a lot of people who consider themselves white in America are walking around with black ancestors, they just don't know it. (Or they do know it and don't consider it terribly relevant, because unlike in Jim Crow days "one drop" is just not that important to us.)  At any rate, Eobard is ~16 generations removed from Eddie, not 1 or 2. (Going by the wiki, which says he's from the 25th century, and assuming 25 years between generations. That's the rule used for gathering demographic data.)   What.   It was so futuristic he had no idea where to start.    It's tragic what's happened to Grimm.   He may have actually found bodies, but it's claimed he specifically found the bodies of Major's two dead kids, so either way he's definitely using these people as a cover-up.   On the one hand, clever way to move those missing kids! Well, until people notice that kids are *still going missing*, which they *will*, and then it's just going to scream "cover-up".  One question: How'd he place the bodies there fast enough to be "discovered" without being seen?   I'm faster than your av-er-age bear.   Yes, it was definitely one of his grayer moments. His Maquis opponent was right on the money, too - the Federation *does* "assimilate people and they don't even know it". They just wake up one day, drinking the root beer. But Sisko is so deep in root beer that he can't see that this might be a problem, ethically speaking.   Eobard went back in time specifically to fight the Flash in, I guess, 2024. He's really from the 25th century, according to the wiki.                           Oh, yeah, because *that* wouldn't tip him off.   So maybe The Flash killed his mom. Or maybe a third speedster did it. Or maybe his dad did it, and he made it up, and coincidentally it looks like the marks left by The Flash. Or maybe....  "It was a speedster" is not going to clear things up without a name to attach to the speedster.   It's part of his costume. Because he doesn't believe - hey, that's how Iris figured it out! Barry didn't believe strongly enough and broke the fiction field.   If we don't believe that people in costume are unrecognizable, all secret identity plots fall apart. That not only takes down a great number of superheroes, but also huge swaths of opera, Shakespeare, and the occasional fairy tale.  I'm not willing to destroy Western culture for the sake of Iris West.   But lots of people work with Eddie, Joe, Barry, and Cisco - namely, *the entire station*, and also the pizza guy and the janitors if we're using the "dropping stuff off = working with you" definition.   Not as valuable a hostage as Iris, who was *standing right there*.  Though point 1 makes sense.   Wait, does she know that he's buddies with all of Barry's friends? (And hey - doesn't Barry have any pre-lightning friends who *aren't* Iris?)   Hm. Shouldn't that put him at a higher risk of cancer?   Why would he bother to save Eddie - who has been dead for centuries, naturally - if Eddie isn't in a direct line of descent?   Usually run through the schools, which lately have become paranoid about letting unrelated adults in.   And evidently, if you DO follow comics you shouldn't worry either, because they don't make any sense.   This sub will never give Iris credit for anything. She could save the world and they'd just bitch that she was a whiny Mary Sue. (Admittedly, if she DID save the world that'd give some real credence to the Mary Sue argument.)   It must be a relief after having to play Wells for a decade and a half.   Maybe Iris suffers from voiceblindness.  http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128412201   I eventually googled it. Short answer? He's crazy. Long answer? He's *really* crazy, and also a bit of a sociopath (in the informal TV definition).   So, again, Eobard could've just strolled right through, so long as he didn't vibrate or run.   Okay, so why did Barry *run* into the thing to test it? Why not just stroll up and press his hand against it?   If time travel exists in the future, it exists now. People who aren't time travelers simply aren't able to use it.   The Central City Bocce Club.   That's a big assumption to make considering that about 40 - 50% of marriages in the US eventually end in divorce.  Even if it does shake out that way, that doesn't mean that Eobard couldn't exist. Eddie could cheat. Iris could die young, causing Eddie to remarry without divorce. Eddie could donate sperm to a friend or stranger (who happens to also be one of Eobard's ~65,500 ancestors alive today). They could have fertility issues combined with a wacky mixup at the clinic. They and Barry could form a stable poly relationship.  Lots of options!   Yes, and? We're talking *hundreds of years*. One drop is just not that strong.   Then why did they let Barry careen into it like a nitwit?   So... wait. Cisco made a forcefield that stops people when they're speedstering, but not when they're moving at a normal pace? What the hell is the point? Surely he realized that Barry and Eobard can walk like normal people when they choose.  Also, them in the vault: Look at the cool costume! Check out that byline! Yeah, glad to see you guys have your priorities in order.  Edit: AND WHY TELL IRIS TO GO HOME? RF knows where she lives! Tell her to go to a hotel!                                    It is? Which rule is that? Can I see the book you got that from? Who wrote it?   Same reason he needs to actually hold a tricorder rather than using holographic tricorder eyes.   Well, that's you. I don't really care about the weird aliens or the technobabble unless the *people* have a compelling story. If it's all about aliens and technobabble, why have a constant cast? Why not just do stories like on Outer Limits or Twilight Zone?                  They were toxic, yes, but the one does not preclude the other. They took child abuse to a pretty heavy level.  Also, how many "things" did they do? Did they go on an outing every weekend, or one every year? They certainly were with Harry more often than not.    Aaaaah, could it be one of the Lisa, Bill, and Jed mysteries by Peggy Parish?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Parish#Liza.2C_Bill_.26_Jed_mysteries                        Well, do Trills have a, um, non physical afterlife?   And one on Dropbox or something. Seriously, guys, get it together!    But he's also an antisocial square, devoted to a conception of personal honor that he hasn't realized is just set dressing for a culture of political thuggery that has repeatedly spurned and assaulted him....  Putting aside your main question, I want to take a second to defend Worf here.   I think Worf really *does* realize as an adult that Klingons do not all match up to the ideal he formed in his head as a child. The trouble is that his personality was formed as an adopted Klingon child living on a Federation colony. He didn't fit in, and he didn't fit in with Klingons, and like any child he rather simplistically decided that if he could just live up to everybody's ideals, he could fit in with everybody instead of his actual situation, which was fitting in with nobody at all.   So he threw himself into being Worf, son of Mogh, SUPERKLINGON while simultaneously trying to be Worf Rozhenko, FEDERATION. The end result is, well, Worf the grown-up, whose idea of meshing the best of both cultures led him to be quite a serious individual. And an epic buzzkill. Even when he grew old enough and knowledgeable enough to realize that Klingon society isn't all honorable all the time (and that humans don't all live up to their vaunted ideals either, nor does any other species in the Federation or out of it), he'd put too much effort into this to easily ditch it and become somebody a little less uptight.  This is still probably a bit healthier than the path we see for other Klingons (or part-Klingons) raised primarily by humans, such as B'Elanna's approach of simply rejecting everything she perceived as "Klingon" in her personality or Alexander deciding to just randomly sign up on a Klingon ship despite being really *really* underqualified.   Now, with that said, I can see why Worf and Jadzia would take up with each other, and even why their relationship works on a storytelling level. From Worf's perspective, Jadzia is somebody who can accept him for who he is, both Klingon and Federation. She enjoys Klingon culture on more than a superficial level, and she also appreciates Federation ideals. They have a realistic level of culture clash. I don't know that their relationship would have really lasted all that much longer if she hadn't been killed, but it's not all that uncommon for people to enter a marriage and figure out three or four years down the line that they screwed that one up, should've remained friends. Not every long-term relationship on TV has to really be forever. That's what's really unrealistic.  (Alternatively, they could have continued to try to adapt and make it work, and had they gone that route it probably would have lasted if she hadn't been killed.)  The one thing I find really unrealistic is that despite them both having been married before, neither had the common sense of a gnat. Before getting married, you should discuss all major issues like "what about vacations" and "childrearing practices?" and "budget!" (not sure if this is an issue for starfleet, but I never really believed they have no money) and, oh yeah, "what about the afterlife, are we both going to the same place or what?"   Well, it's in the public domain, isn't it?   That's a survivorship fallacy if I ever saw one. You look at the few ones we remember decades later and take them as representative.   Additionally, who's to say that they'll last another few decades? They certainly might - once something has been in print 50 years, it'll probably be in print another 50 - but sometimes things do fall off the cultural radar. For example, although kids today certainly do know about Michael Jackson, do they know about MASH? (Source: Have two young nieces, had to endure months of Michael Jackson worship. They've since moved on to Katy Perry, which isn't really any better.)   It's psychosomatic.   Has he ever been punched before?   "Compensate!"  Uh, yeah, I hadn't thought of that. Good thing we have you to give the orders around here.   He gets along great with Janeway too. It's apparently only *Sisko* he can't stand, though I doubt Ben's crying himself to sleep over it.   That whole episode fixed on a ridiculous misunderstanding of evolution, but then, does anybody on ST understand evolution ever?  There was the one where Worf's (adopted) brother was trying to save that species and Picard was initially all "can't, prime directive" about it. Yes, I'm sure an uncontaminated culture will be a *huge help* when they're all *dead*! (And any other episode which runs along those lines can equally go rot.)   I thought nobody died, they all managed to evacuated in time. Plus, it wasn't made uninhabitable, just uninhabitable *to humans*, meaning that they were able to swap with the Cardassians. In the long run, probably made both colonies safer as they were effectively out of the war, couldn't be invaded. (Well, except by the Jem Hadar, I suppose. Or by some other Federation species that wasn't human. Or by some other species entirely. And I guess there's always the Borg, but you know what I mean.)   Boredom. Isn't that always his motivation?    I agree with a lot of what you are saying, but remember that the Federation does not equate to Earth and humans only. The Vulcans are part of the Federation.   As are the Andorians, aren't they? And now the Bajorans. A Vulcan (or Andorian, or Bajoran) colony would be one set up by those governments either pre-Federation (prior to joining the Federation for the Bajorans) or that is limited largely or entirely to those species. (Which sets up an interesting question. Can or will the Federation charter a colony that is set up to be just one species?)   In Deep Space Nine, during the baseball episode, we find out that the Captain's Vulcan nemesis heads an all-Vulcan ship. An all-Vulcan ship in Starfleet. In Enterprise and Voyager, viewpoint Vulcans give us an idea of how frustrating it can be to be a Vulcan surrounded by non-Vulcans.  It seems plausible to me that some species, such as humans, are more willing to be part of a mixed crew than others, such as Vulcans. Since humans aren't likely to be interested in watching a show that's 100% non-human, we see the human-dominated ships, with the human captains. There is no guarantee that this is the majority of all captains, though.   Additionally, as much as it's possible for some species to have an easier time living with others than other species, it seems likely that some are simply more interested in space exploration for its own sake. This can be backed up by looking at the stats. The Vulcans have been flitting around the galaxy since 900 BCE, the Bajorans since the 1600s (at sublight speeds), the Klingons sometime between the 20th and 21st centuries, the Andorians since at least the 20th century. Yet the galaxy is not full up on Vulcan (pre-Federation) and Bajoran and Klingon and Andorian colonies. There are still plenty of worlds for the Federation to site colonies on.                  It's not a fish tank, it's a self-contained ecosystem. So long as light goes in to keep the plants growing, it just keeps going indefinitely.   The Woman in the Wall   Except many people don't have the freedom to live in an area without an HOA, because they need to live in a certain area and all neighborhoods in that area have HOAs.   I live on Staten Island. No HOAs. Our sidewalks are maintained, we have playgrounds and parks, garbage and recycling is paid by taxes, the garbage truck picks up large items once a week (Mondays, same day as recycling, Thursday is just for regular trash), we have community yard sales and parties and all organized by the community frequently throughout the summer, and our block has an annual block party.  HOAs are not needed for quality of life.   Some of us are lucky enough to live in parts of the country without them.   Ooooh, with the Powerpuff Girls?   That's the same argument that's been used to bar selling homes to blacks/Jews.   Because in some areas, if you want to buy a home, you pretty much are stuck with one under an HOA. And if you already are signed up for a job in that area, you can't just say "screw it, I'll commute in from Maine instead" (or wherever).   In some areas, it's pretty much impossible to buy a house that's not under a HOA. Rather than blaming the victims, why not *rein in the HOAs*?   Some people with disabilities really can't wait for a toilet. They are incapable of holding it in, or holding it in will give them a huge bladder infection.  If you have a choice, it's better not to use the disabled toilet. You definitely shouldn't use that one if you think you're going to be there a while.    Person first language.  Okay, I get the reasoning. Sorta. I think it's really *weird*, but I get the reasoning, and more than that, I understand that a lot of people think it's always the best and most polite way to talk about PWDs. That's what they've been told, that's what they believe.  Me- and I'm not alone in this - I find it stigmatizing. You don't call somebody "A person with Asian-ness" or "A woman who happens to be beautiful" or "A man who has homosexuality". No, that sort of workaround is restricted to disabilities.   I also think it's weird and insulting that something that is a huge and important part of who I am, more important than my gender (and people can't get through three sentences without labeling you as male or female!), should be treated like it's minor and unimportant in the name of  being "polite".  But because I am polite and have good manners, I'm not going to jump all over people who use person-first language. They mean well.  Now, is it asking so much to want them to show me the same basic respect? If somebody says that they are "an autistic individual" or "a blind dude" or "a Deaf woman" and the very first words out of your mouth are "I think you mean *person with autism*" (or whatever), you are *doing it wrong*. If they had meant that, they would have said that, and you are being *so* rude and disrespectful.  Don't do that. Don't be a jerk. Also: if you know for certain that somebody prefers this usage over that one, try to use that one! But definitely don't "correct" them.   Though it's important to remember that many individuals with various disabilities *loathe and detest* person first language. I, for one, find it overly stigmatizing. Nobody speaks in a funny way, after all, when referring to positive or neutral traits.   It's not God's gift to human discourse.   There's a diversity of opinions on the subject, as you might expect.  Two things to consider:  1. It is possible - I don't know this boy (I assume he's a real kid, not a character?) - that what's making his life difficult is not the autism per se but the disabling attitudes of society. (When you hang around with entirely the wrong crowd, phrases like "the disabling attitudes of society" come trippingly on the tongue as easily as "hi, how are you!")  2. The real concern about a cure is not that a cure might be available, but that it might not be *optional* - or that at *best*, it would only be optional *to the parents* and the autistic individual themselves wouldn't get a say, being cured (or not) before they can make their own medical decisions.   Kind people, when told "stop doing this", don't whine about it. They just *stop doing it*.    I've been told by DOCTORS that I don't "look autistic".  What do they think autism looks like?   Interestingly, the majority of main Ferengi cast members were played by Jews. So I guess the stereotyping is okay...?   Lawns are convenient places to feed your pet goat.   And where you can't hang up a clothesline, like, ever. FFS, HOA's are freaking unAmerican. Whatever happened to freedom?   Well, if they'd *scanned* all those books into a database by now, they'd be safe.   Not to be all PETA about it, but I bet the boars aren't sobbing.      Which is why it's such a silly choice for lawns in arid areas.         But also assholes. I mean, Hermione is a spiteful, vindictive *bitch*. What she did to Marietta was really unjust, and the birds? OMG the birds.  Not that she wasn't provoked that time by the fact that Ron was being a jerk, just like he was back in third year. Or fourth year, for that matter. Actually, he had his little moments fifth year as well, as I recall....   McGonnagal had a muggle father. Her mother and all the children being magical caused no end of family strife. She may not have been an unbiased source.   Nobody else was with him for ~3,500 consecutive days.   Wow. That... actually makes sense.   I mean, I think it's more likely that Petunia was just a narcissist at heart and that she probably *had* been overlooked and ignored in favor of her sister (familial dysfunction is frequently inherited), but both things can be true.      During a drought???   HOAs oughta be outlawed, or at least their powers *severely* limited.                                    No, it was called "the orient" because Asia is to the east of Europe, and orient in that sense means east.  At one time it was common for maps to be made with east at the top, one reason that "to orient" means "to find a direction", but that's not relevant.   Maybe next time you could use do not link.  http://www.donotlink.com/  Why give them increased visibility and clicks?   That man certainly has a bad case of stripes. Luckily, as I learned from the book of the same name, he can cure that condition by being true to himself rather than trying to fit in with the majority or worrying that his preferences will be considered "weird".   H. M. Hoover is an underrated author.   Nope, NYC. And the first grade teacher was Brooklyn-Italian. The logic was that it counts as a vowel in pairs like aw or ow.            But if we're arbitrarily categorizing letters, can we at least exclude y from the vowel category? I never really thought of it as a vowel letter anyways.   You certainly may, but other people aren't likely to go along with it.  Interestingly, when I was in first grade I was explicitly taught "and sometimes y *and w*", which apparently nobody else ever was taught.                            There was also that one where they met the evolved dinosaurs that fled Earth.  Okay, theoretically possible... but there's *no way* that the Holodeck could predict the one and only "evolutionary path" for them to have, uh, taken.    Here's the thing to remember: The writers weren't/aren't any smarter than you are, and they think the viewer is damn stupid. If it's making your brain hurt, just assume they didn't understand it.   Sorry I couldn't save you from that.   Beast, Donna Jo Napoli   You don't really want to watch it.   I'll believe it when I see it.   Let's back up. You said, and I quote:   Ask the majority of English speakers how many vowels English has, and they'll say 5. Just because they never took a linguistics course doesn't mean they're not wrong.   As near as I can figure, you're saying that the *mainstream definition* - the one used by normal people who aren't speaking in academic or linguistic terms - is *wrong*, and those people who speak casually are simply *wrong*. It's not that they're using a different definition of the word (one that runs "a vowel is a member of the category of letters 'a-e-i-o-u-and-sometimes-y', every syllable has at least one vowel"), they're just wrong.  Which is rather akin to saying "Tomatoes and bell peppers and cucumbers aren't vegetables, they're fruits" and getting pissy when people say that in normal parlance, they're culinary vegetables.  Also, not sure where you're getting "English has 11 vowels" from. Different dialects surely differ. Is this some sort of average, or...?   What were you doing, regenerating?   I'd watch that.   Worf would *have* to be grieving to make jokes that bad.   Warp drive is sci-fi handwavium to explain away relativity precisely so nobody has to worry about that sort of thing.   Just a major hub. All the Borg get destroyed (more or less) in one of the novels.   Wait, wait, wait. You're saying that there is only one correct definition of "vowel", and that's not the one in common parlance?  Where did you get your degree again?   Yes. Except in the Mirror Universe, where I think she crowns herself empress...?   Well, Seven *and* all the knowledge she brought, but still, she still could've shown up sooner in Seven's human lifetime.   I always figured that she got to Earth, sat down, and said "That's it. Nobody's going to EVER drag me off-planet again!"   Its not well-enough written to be visionary. To be visionary, it has to be *consistent* and *believable*. The currency situation on Star Trek is neither, even within the episodes from a single series.   DS9 didn't have credits, and latinum was used by the Ferengi and other non-Federation (or, at least, non-human) species.  Which sorta works, until you ask "but... uh... how on earth were the humans getting root beer out of Quark?" I mean, they had to have been compensating him somehow!  It may be possible for a complex society such as the Federation to operate without any form of money. It is not possible for the Federation *as written* to do that, no matter how many times they tried to shoehorn "no money in the future!" into the script.  Also, I get that they're post-scarcity, but post-scarcity doesn't mean that everything is available to everybody. If you want to eat at Sisko's Creole Kitchen, and so does everybody else, there has to be some way to determine who gets a seat and who has to wait. Post scarcity means that everybody gets food, but it doesn't mean that everybody gets Syrup of Squill during the shortage. Everybody gets a roof over their heads, but they don't all get 1,000 sq ft of prime waterfront views right in the heart of the most fashionable neighborhood. Everybody gets an education and health care, they don't all get the best teacher and doctor... and there has got to be some way to allocate who gets the most desirable things and who gets the merely functional ones. If they're not using "money" as this system, then they've done a darn poor job of explaining what they ARE using instead.   She was playing it cool, secretly taking pics so she could post them later all "The Flash showed up, and I acted like an adult instead of badgering him for his autograph, this is the coolest city ever!!!!"    How do you know whats a vowel and a consonant if you ignore the sounds?  "A vowel is the letters a-e-i-o-u-and-sometimes-y"   I thought that for whatever reason, letters were arbitrarily divided into these categories.   That is exactly what most people think.   But not HIV, chlamydia, syphillis....   I've got a copy of it on my bedside table right now.   And what if your daughter gets raped?   Because they might be raped.  Because when they get older, they'll probably, at some point, choose to have sex, and it's better to already be vaccinated at that point.  Because why not?   A lot of girls just get vaccinated when it's due, not because they made the choice but because their parents did.   Heroes of the Valley, Stroud.   You do that :)  Though I won't hold it against you if you forget!   Highly recommend everybody watch that video, as it's pretty awesome.   Bats and dolphins can do that via echolocation. Neither of those species is blind, of course, but they could be and they'd still be able to navigate pretty well.   Pretty much. His super power is "not being blind". If anything, his "sight" (echolocation and just generally extremely good hearing, sensitivity to temperature, a terrific sense of smell... I think....) is better than most people's.   Oh, good, I was worried I'd entered lecture mode and just annoyed the crap out of you. (I'm working on not doing that.)  And yes, by all means you should go to the doctor you're comfortable with. Besides, taking up space in a clinic if you don't *need* to is unfair to the people who don't have a choice as to which doctor to visit. It's not first world problems, it's... compassion for people who hate waiting!  I have my fingers metaphorically crossed for a good test result.   So it's hard to push own the thoughts that I'm already unlucky so of course I'll get cancer.   Well, bad things come in threes. Anxiety attacks are 1, ovarian failure is 2, and losing your insurance a while back after having that jerky ex is definitely 3 - so maybe you're safe :)   I know the feeling. It's just looming over you, like Schrodinger's STD. But you know of course that once it's over, at least you'll know. It'll all be hunky-dory, or it won't, but at least you'll *know*.  Ugh on taking a whole day off of work. Maybe a clinic in your area has weekend hours?   Exactly which STDs do you think this vaccine prevents OTHER THAN HPV?   Well, I suppose so? The elder kiddo got hers done recently, we didn't even say what it was for, just "Look, at 11 you're due for two shots, so let's get 'em done and on the way home we'll grab a doughnut."   Sometimes STDs aren't a matter of being responsible, but just of bad luck. What if you get raped, say, or you're in a monogamous long-term relationship but don't realize your partner is cheating on you?   Religious conservatives, mostly. They think that if you get your kid a vaccine, or teach them about condoms, then they'll just go out and screw like bunnies. If you keep them utterly ignorant and unprotected, though, they'll stay home and knit. Or something.   *hugs*  I know it's scary, but you should go anyway to get checked out at Planned Parenthood or someplace.   Don't worry about that. Even Terry Pratchett got that one wrong - and that is *not* something I have cause to say very often.   Eobard doesn't consistently have his speed back, making operations based on speed dubious at best, and this is the first rule because moving the body is suspicious behavior. You dig up the body, leaving evidence that *something* was left there. You transport it great distances - even at superspeed, somebody might notice something, and when Barry gets news that "The Flash" was seen somewhere he *knows* he wasn't, he's going to know something's up.   Trying to hide the evidence carries the risk of leaving more evidence around.    That's a fascinating question. On your next watch-through (if you're here, I take it as given that you intend to watch the series a second time!), put on the audio description and find out. Then you can report back if you're so inclined.   And for reference for people who have never heard of Robert Moses, let me say this: despite being dead for the past 34 years, there are people who *still* actively curse his name, who spit it out only to state how much they hate him and what he did to the city.  I just headed to /r/nyc and searched up "Robert Moses" and a rough tabulation of comments that are effectively "Fuck him" is enlightening, to say the least.   HIS heart? What about OUR hearts?    Maybe he wasn't really that guy.   It's called a *loveseat*.   Turn too many people into zombies, though, and you start running into supply issues. He wants clients, not  a horde.   *Really* awful. Continuous time in solitary is roundly condemned as inhumane, and it does terrible things to the mind. Plus, they don't even have any toilets in there, or books, or TV, or ANYthing. There is not even any pretense of rehabilitating them so that the least criminal of them could ever rejoin society.   Yes, it seems odd to me that in a show with a female protagonist, we rarely see either of the other two female characters.   Okay, the show is wrong. Ring Around the Rosie is NOT based upon the Black Death. That little story didn't show up until some time *after* the first appearance of the song, which itself didn't show up until a couple of hundred years *after* the Black Death - and, as it's an oral tradition, you should be unsurprised by the fact that its first appearance sounded nothing like the most common iteration today. No ashes or falling down.  http://www.snopes.com/language/literary/rosie.asp  http://blogs.loc.gov/folklife/2014/07/ring-around-the-rosie-metafolklore-rhyme-and-reason/      He's certainly getting paid for his show.   He was right, though. That video *is* pretty damning.   Yeah, how *did* this guy know where Barry lives?           	200

 i'm pretty sure they do, maybe not in the off season though. although i dont really know what the off season is like in LA.    american apparel   Heltah Skeltah - The Art Of Disrespekinazation  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MbL8bwxhzo   dont forget about the nighthawks    my character has been created and I've had him for about 40 hours. I'm absolutely not golden.    offer 100. 160 seems high imo   shoe goo   I thought both the new consoles were supposed to be able to output at 4k.  how about we just wait and see about the framerate. not to mention 4k tvs/monitors  probably won't be in the average consumers houses for another 4-5 years anyhow.   and if we're talking about the far off ps5 future I'm sure tech will evolve so as to create solutions keeping costs about at standard price. last gen was a much bigger advancement making the jump from 4:3  to 16:9  imo.   Every GTA game has come out on PC eventually, why is everyone so down like this one wont.  I'm not saying it will be soon, but it will likely happen eventually.    my computer has also been hooked up to my tv for 8 years or so. so I guess I might not be the target demographic.    most of the games I pay are in the steam eco-system. but not all of them, that sort of worries me.   If you're trying to get in shape, and new to denim I would absolutely go sub 200. Probably even cheaper. A. make sure you actually like wearing raw denim. B. It would suck spending a considerable amount of money on denim then losing weight.  Personally I would wait until you are happy with your weight and arent going to fluctuate much before spending big money.    buying multiple pairs of sub $200 denim rather than one pair of higher quality denim    rogue didn't cost 270 million dollars to make.   dreamcast  had a killer lineup.  jet grind, sonic 3d, shenmue, alot of other weird obscure imports. not to mention you can burn games on cds without modding  if your info that.  the rest I'm impartial to, they are all good bets, but Saturn games might be a tad on the pricey side, if that matters to you.   2 out of 5 are free.  the rest combined are probably cheaper than this pack costs.   Somewhat interested in picking up a ps3. What are you looking for before I bother you for pics   My thoughts exactly.   Looks like they are working on it though.   "The game isn't running on my Windows 8 machine. What do I do?We're sorry to say that Rogue Legacy is not officially supported by Windows 8. Some people have successfully managed to get the game running in that OS, but we can't provide support for those versions. We will be releasing an official version for Windows 8 along with the Mac and Linux versions."   Rogue legacy doesn't support win8. Maybe you could try running in xp compatibility mode. But not sure if there's any way.   Do you have windows8?   Trying something radically different than my usual slim fitting work wear.      normally don't care for pocket stitching, but those are absolutely beautiful.  Love the details.  Would love a fit pic when you get a chance!   not to mention, no matter how fast your network is you would have more latency streaming it to your pc than plugging your console into a monitor.   suspect ass mw3   shin megami tensei IV, Animal Crossing, Monster hunter III/IV.  If you are in the market for a handheld system then its absolutely the way to go.   It will look alot better on a smaller 3ds screen, and pokemon games have never looked particularly good.  They are fun and charming.   co-sign, maybe I'm just getting old. But I'd rather just pay per month than having nonsense multiple currency forms and feeling bullied into paying potentially more than $15 a month on silly micro-transactions.     "wink-wink nudge-nudge, you could be doing this faster if you pay $5"   beautiful    because nintendo wouldn't and shouldn't give us the opportunity to fund anything, least of all being pokemon on a tv. If they thought it was a good idea im pretty sure it would have happened 10 years ago.   24 hour codes dont work with the free game promotion   UB201's.  they wont have the metal pocket rivets, but they don't have pocket stitching. If you dont mind pocket stitching then the levi's would work fine and probably be even a little cheaper. http://theunbrandedbrand.com/collections/all/products/ub201-tapered-fit-indigo-selvedge   steam  @ entangel   28k modem?   measure a pair of your own pants that you like the fit of, and compare.  Just buy the one that most closely matches.   making this post implies that you are still alive. in which case you should probably have enough time to finish downloading all of them.  How is this a problem.   in store as well.  Went in and picked up the faded twilight microdot today. I believe it was off any full priced shirt.   http://www.reddit.com/r/malehairadvice  might be of more help, maybe a portrait as well as your 3/4th view picture would help as well.   tidy up/shave beard, remove earring.  If you want fashion advice don't post from shoulders up..   Has anyone worn andrew marc shoes? never owned a pair of chelsea boots and figure if the price is right i might as well give em a shot.      they have a button bar at the top with a search box, and they have panels... same as most websites. greenmangaming fits right in the middle.   I miss Filene's Basement :( haha     Having a good time (vita) took a few hours before I was able to concentrate on my character with everything else going on. I still get lost from time to time, but its not too bad. About 4 hours in myself, waiting to unlock multi-play. absolutely recommend on vita, cant attest to ps3 but im sure its great as well.   Not to mention OCBD's might not work depending on what he does for a living. absolutely plain tee's, maybe try out a colored denim chambray. (personally think its a bit more casual than an ocbd)   If you want the 5 panel style, but don't need the brand behind it check out the ASOS brand. They are around $20, I haven't had any experience with them but for that price i recon its worth a gamble. http://us.asos.com/search/5-panel?hrd=1 q=5+panel    they've been 35-50ish for years.  roughly the same price as a 5950 authentic fitted cap. the price will vary dependent on brand, and no they probably arent worth 25% of the construction/material price.  How would a company, particularly small brands make money if they were closer in actual vs retail pricing.         But we already lost Lincoln, JFK, and Hendrix... Wasn't that bad.   fffff.... a lot... soz   Getting an awesome computer.... To play f2p games and minecraft.  You could save alot of money by buying a less awesome computer...  Real talk though, you could check out the stalker series.  Probably be able to pick them up for cheap, and the modding community is great.  It might not look great vanilla, but it will make a modern computer chug with some of the graphical overhauls.   mine have been holding pretty strong, although I wouldn't have got em if it wasn't for $30 nordstrom rack deal.   http://www.amazon.com/Madden-Mens-M-Gamer-Boat-Shoe/dp/B005MWN5C6 Got these last month, rarely take em off.   75% off everything   site looks real shady, anyone have any experience with em?      people are really standing up for kanye, this blows my mind.  http://images.freshnessmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/nike-sportswear-kanye-west-air-yeezy-black-570x453.jpg   I dont care how he dresses.

Gonna be more pointless than n f's gimmicky jeans   steam summer sales are always tuesday, its always cut in the midweek madness.   Cheers, exactly the sort of info I'm looking for :)  I'll def check it!   I'm not looking for a single $1000 item, I'm looking to go shopping in Paris with $1000 for clothes which I believe is fairly frugal. I thought quite a bit on where to post it, and took a shot. But im guessing in /r/expensivemalefashion they would tell me i'm being unrealistic and frugal.   because I'm not asking how to dress myself properly,  I'm asking for places to shop at under a budget. Perhaps local insight, if there are any French users.   Anywhere I should check out, looking to get a few interesting key pieces.  I know I could easily spend way more than $1000 on clothes in Paris, and am looking to make it stretch as much as possible. Normally I'd consider myself to dress in the grey area between street wear and high fashion.  APC's/naked and famouse/Jcrew/and all sorts of different boots. Also am specifically looking for things that would be hard to come by in the US.  I'm in Boston, so average high fashion is readily available (barneys, saks, neiman, riccardi)  Maybe some interesting mid-range french brands. The best example I can think of would be Supreme NYC, not that I would normally wear supreme but when im in NYC I go there because its such a hassle to get supreme outside of nyc. Sorry to ramble on, and thanks in advance.   http://www.dsw.com/shoe/aston+grey+rockcastle+2+boot?prodId=280808 productRef=SEARCH  Sorry been away a few days, I'd recommend going into the retail store if you buy them.  Normally I wear a 12, and had to size down to 10.5.   thanks for the input guys, and yes the left pair is navy blue.    I wore the same pair of apc's to work atleast 4 days a week for about a year.  The only reason I stopped was because they developed some noticeable holes, and I didnt want people to ask why I never changed my pants. Granted I work in a factory, so im guessing this is much more acceptable than day to day office wear.   "There are always the people who get a coat and they just look like pedo's." priceless.   personally i'd go with a 5 panel cap if your gonna go with a cap at all.  Granted I guess it depends on your style. HUF, Stussy, if your on a budget asos.  	72

 Fiind presedinte, parerea sa e cam irelevanta. Gorghiu ar trebui sa zica ceva.   That's what you get with shitty Atom processors.   WTF is Office "preview"? I'd rather get OfficeSuite or Drive for the full ability to edit.   Law enforcement agencies are completely and utterly unaccountable these days.   I'll hold off for the 16k version. I hear that when you'd look at it the pixels would get projected directly *into your brain*.   "DOJ employee  was later seen exiting the building with a few bags of cash on his back."   Actually Microsoft had a very serious vulnerability in Windows servers, too, but it hasn't had half the awareness of rootpipe (names help, I guess).   Prea tarziu pentru asta. O sa intram in era educatiei online si mult mai private. Sunt de acord totusi ca acum nu e bine pus la punct invatamantul online, niciunde in lume, dar e clar ca e doar o chestiune de timp pana noile generatii o sa faca scoala doar asa (2-3 decenii maxim).   It's not really about making more money from developers with that fee. It's more about filtering out bad developers/apps that would simply upload random crap to the store. If they have to pay at least something, then they are less likely to do it.  Whether this is actually working and whether the benefits outweigh the drawbacks remains to be debated.   But what if I hate Cortana but love Windows?! THEN WHAT?   Forget the NSA, criminal organizations and foreign governments/competitors could easily intercept your phone calls too for such stuff. All they need is the phone number:  http://www.zdnet.com/article/invasive-phone-tracking-new-ss7-research-blows-the-lid-off-personal-security/  http://www.slideshare.net/zahidtg/ss7-locate-track-manipulate  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQ0I5tl0YLY   The good news is that you don't even have to "give up on using a phone" or anything like that. Just install RedPhone/Signal on your device and get your friends and family to use it, too. Still a barrier but not nearly as big as the former option.   Surely those FBI experts will now be fired and never asked for their opinion on law enforcement issues again - right?!   Displays don't have transistors so the process node is irrelevant. Display tech does get improved every year, though.  That said I don't think they *should* go to 4k. The way it works is that the same *brand new* display tech could be even more efficient on 1440p, and even more efficient on 1080p, and so on.   Samsung could use Nvidia's GPU tech (which they are supposedly licensing) or even AMD Radeon which apparently Mediatek is going to license.   Not the Onion.   This is a good easy to use PGP-email alternative: https://peerio.com/  You could also do the phone thing, but only if you use something like Signal/RedPhone and talk through that. Think of regular phone calls as "plain-text" (even if they technically have encryption, but they are completely wiretappable).   How do you tell them the password for it?   Also, unlike iMessage, it doesn't have end-to-end encryption (you should disable syncing for iMessages, though, otherwise Apple has your messages anyway, cancelling out the end-to-end design).   I know, previous Samsung phones sucked in low-light department. The S6 is better than iPhone 6 Plus (so probably the best on the market now).   They should do *20 cores*, because that would obviously be *twice as good*.   Nu stiu daca se mai merita PFA cu noile taxe propuse de guvernul Ponta.   NO DEAL!  Kill the merger and Comcast will be *forced* to compete against TWC in its markets to expand - and that's *exactly* what everyone wants.   I believe they are synced by default. The problem is that unlike LastPass Google can see your passwords.   There are a lot of movies about cyborgs and such, but people need to understand that humans *don't like* to "put stuff in them" like that. Whatever technology we'll use it won't be by sticking needles in ourselves or putting chips in our brains. At best we'll ingest nanobots, but even that is probably going to take a long time before most people agree to it (they will if their life is threatened, but not for entertainment purposes for a long time).   Yup.   Ce-i asta? Secolul 2?   As if government certifications actually mean anything. Most FIPS certifications for example even *require* the use of broken crypto.   I don't know about SCTP, but MinimaLT sounds pretty good to me, and it has encryption by default, but I think its implementation is further behind than Google's QUIC:  http://cr.yp.to/tcpip/minimalt-20131031.pdf  There's also Trevor Perrin's (TextSecure's Axolotl creator) Noise, which sounds even better/simpler, but that is probably even more behind:  https://github.com/trevp/noise/wiki/Overview   Basic income in 10 years? Highly unlikely.   First SPDY, now QUIC. Get it?   Hyperbolic much?   2015 is finally the year where Android users can choose between premium feeling Android devices with materials that include: glass, metal or leather. No more cheap plasticky-feeling flagship devices.  That said, what annoys me about Sony is that it launches its devices in a weird cycle like September. This means it will end up with an obsolete chip like Snapdragon 810 or 808, when 820 could arrive in devices in November. And this has happened more than once with the Z-series. Quite frustrating.   Sony should be planning its devices according to when a next-generation chip comes out. Samsung, HTC and LG always do that.   I'm waiting for the day it will be integrated into the screen itself:  http://www.tomshardware.com/news/qualcomm-sense-id-touch-id,28660.html  There's also research that says that for capacitive fingerprint sensors (like Touch ID/GS6), the smaller the sensor, the less accurate it will be (since it can't identify too much fingerprint data-points - which makes sense).   Only half as stupid as having a 4k screen on a 12" device.   Doesn't Sony use them?   Biggest disappointment about Galaxy S6 - lack of USB-C. I'm surprised not more reviews make a note of this.   Boycott the Microsoft shills!   Awesome. LET'S DO THIS!  Also, the $45 billion it intends to use to buy TWC could buy themselves quite a bit of fiber throughout US. So how about Comcast does that instead? Heck, it could even use that money to go into TWC's territories and get TWC's market share the old fashion way - through competition. I know - crazy idea, right?   So material. Such stock.   The [NSA-influenced](http://arstechnica.com/security/2014/01/nsa-employee-will-continue-to-co-chair-influential-crypto-standards-group/) IETF crypto-review group.   I don't think BLAKE2 needs HMAC? At least according to their site. Also BLAKE2 is 3x faster for 32-bit and 5x faster for 64-bit (which the vast majority of devices will be in 5 years). So you could argue that the software-based BLAKE2 is still faster than SHA3-in-hardware.   Why Ireland of all places? Surely Switzerland would've been better?   These strict protections you mean?  http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/19/norway-nsa-snooping-on-phone-calls   Indeed. Screw Microsoft accounts. I want local ones. In fact, 2 of the [top 3 Security requests](https://windows.uservoice.com/forums/265757-windows-feature-suggestions/category/87210-security-privacy-and-accounts) for Windows 10 refer to allowing local accounts   So meta.   You can't jail free speech, my friend.   No, but Comcast seems to want to expand. The much "safer" way to do that is for them to buy TWC. But if they can't do that, they might be forced into going into TWC's markets - which also means TWC will respond by going into Comcast's markets.   Op's headline is BS anyway. Doesn't he know apps DON'T ACTUALLY RUN in the background on Android? They get paused. Entering the app again is just a "resume".  If he was referring to the fact that it can HOLD 5 games in the background *in RAM*, that's different...but still I don't understand how we've had 3GB of RAM for more than a year now in flagship smartphones, but all of the sudden just having 33% percent more RAM than that (which was plenty already) is "revolutionary" somehow.   So who will become Universe's super-power? Milky Way or Andromeda?   His Name Is Null And Database Administrators Hate Him!   What's the progress on Firefox's Elecrolysis sandboxing system? Weren't they supposed to ship it in the stable channel by now?   Sony's design language + metal unibody? Yes, please!   I also believe boosting the immune system is the "magic bullet" to curing most cancers (until nanobots arrive). It just makes sense. After all cancers are just mutations the immune system wasn't strong enough to kill.   I assume that average counts cars on the market, which would mean older cars with poorer mileage. The 60% improvement is for the latest cars/batteries.     I think proper testing and a lot of real benefits can counter this well.  But that's the problem, isn't it? With companies such as Monsanto which basically sell whatever they want on the market thanks to massive lobbying (an increasing phenomenon even in EU now), we *can't* really be sure if there has be "proper testing".  I'd rather not find out after 20 years of eating a GMO fruit, that the fruit causes cancer...   Alternatively (to HSTS) everyone should be using EFF's [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/HTTPS-EVERYWHERE) extension to force HTTPS. In the latest version you can even *block all plain-text HTTP connections* by checking a button.   *Believing intensifies!*   So his argument is BS. He's talking about an imaginary charging method nobody uses and then comparing hydrogen to that.   Right up there with Ballmer's or RIM's predictions for the iPhone.   Oh please. This has nothing to do with "nuclear worries". As if it's such a big surprise China is just as big of a nuclear power as the US is. The real reason is another - possibly China's latest moves against US companies.    "We are freeing you from Google's tyranny!"  "We're now selling you out to Microsoft's tyranny..."  I think they're sending a pretty conflicting message there!   Au revoir Cyanogen.   Exactly. "We're going to free you from Google's tyranny!....only to hand you over to Microsoft's tyranny."  "Progress."   How do I feel? I feel "YUCK". Good thing most CyanogenMOD-based ROMs don't have to come with any apps by default. I can continue to use CyanogenMOD without Cyanogen's stench of betrayal.   Java was definitely losing rankings as a "top language" before. Becoming less popular and nobody using it are two different things. Of course Java would've still been used 2-3 decades from now. That's not the point though. Imagine if Android used Go instead from day one. Go would probably be almost as popular as C++ now.   This "bug" was caught 2-3 years ago, too. And Facebook said it would fix it.   [Blake2](https://blake2.net/) is much better than SHA3 anyway. SHA3 may only be slightly faster in hardware, but imagine how many chips out there would have to support it. We don't even have SHA2 support for the majority of chips on the market (including mobile here). So why bother?   Checkout this, plenty of good options:  https://www.privacytools.io/   What he's trying to say is that NSA has access to all the "regular phone calls and text messages" - a.k.a. the carriers' networks.  What you need to do is use something like Signal for iOS or Redphone/Textsecure for Android. Also, if you root the phone you can install the SnoopSnitch app (Android) to protect yourself against fake cell towers they have installed to capture radio signals and intercept them. However, rooting also invites easier hacking on your phone, so it might be best you don't know that. Just use the apps I mentioned and careful what you say over the carriers' networks.   Turns out they *are* out to get you...r genitals!   Trolls Royce.   It's also funny how so far they've been saying that they "can't" upgrade their networks any faster. And as soon as Google Fiber gets in  some place, suddenly they all upgrade by 2x, 3x, or even 6x their speeds - for free.  Huh, go figure. So it was possible to upgrade the networks and give customers much better Internet after all!  That said, I still believe they will be using shenanigans, and even if your connection on one of these ISPs is 200 Mbps, Netflix will probably still be throttled, or you'll get a much lower average speed most of the time.   Or he's not intercepted. I think SnoopSnitch is better, though.   Yahoo should buy Blekko already. It was pretty good when it was still free.   Because Apple could sell ice to an eskimo if it had the Apple logo on it - and you know it.  That doesn't mean the category itself has been validated. And maybe after a year the whole thing will die off after everyone sees how confusing Apple watches are.   I'm sure that number is misleading and it probably refers to collecting millions of people's data. Who knows what "once" really means in this context. They turned the device on "once" for 3 months straight?!   Take it easy, Hitler.   I actually have no problem with you not using PGP, especially if your method is "better" than PGP (while still remaining end-to-end and having client-side encryption). I just want you to make it as clear as possible how it works.  Even for ProtonMail which has gotten a lot of publicity I'm still not sure it uses proper end-to-end encryption (I think it's server-side). But I'm not completely sure either way because they don't make it too easy to figure it out (perhaps on purpose in their case).   Is that going to be more efficient than storing directly in batteries and using the energy directly afterwards?   I wonder what are the types of bugs/exploits most encountered in that Go version, and would a Rust client have been able to alleviate most of them?   I wonder if this could be used to audit the keys in Google's End-to-End project.  https://github.com/google/end-to-end/wiki/Key-Distribution   Tutanota is interesting, however I think they are making it *really hard* to figure out how they are encrypting their stuff. You have to scour through 50 small-font FAQ questions on a third party site where each has to open in a new window, and after you do manage to find the relevant questions 30 minutes later you're still not 100% sure you understood how they are doing it.  At the end, the best I could get is that it's *not* using PGP but some kind of custom RSA/AES based "end to end" encryption (?!).  Compare that to Whiteout, where you get a pretty good idea of how it works from a single page:  https://whiteout.io/technology.html  Also, any reason why tutanota.de gets a green HTTPS icon, but tutanota.com doesn't?   It's hard to tell for now, really. I would say it won't be until at least Android M or even N, when we can really answer this question.  Stuff like ART or the Material Design didn't rise under Pichai, but Rubin. They were both 2-3 year old projects when Lollipop was announced.  If anything, Pichai is *limiting* Android, but not *allowing* the developers to turn it into a "desktop OS" as well and *really* compete against Windows, just like they used Android to create Android Auto, Android Wear and Android TV - all having quite different interfaces than the phone version of Android. They could do the same with "Android PC".   Just add a taskbar, multi-window support and encourage developers to optimize their apps for the desktop and OEMs to put it on laptops/hybrid devices. Why do that through the "backdoor" with the browser-based Chrome OS, one app at a time? (Android apps don't work *automatically* on Chrome OS).   Indeed. My phone is great with 5.1 on it. And I do love the overall design change that came with lollipop as well as most of the animations.   Hillary Clinton didn't believe in gay marriage until recently either.   It's funny because Hillary is the Romney of the Democratic party.   Ron Wyden would be great.   Wish US adopted the approval voting system. It would make it so much easier to actually help the *better* candidates to win than whoever the bigger parties support.  http://www.electology.org/#!approval-voting/   Except for when it fires 90% of the workers. Then I guess not "all pieces" go to Microsoft.   Use ChaCha20.   uBlock is definitely the best out there now. However, I sometimes have issues with it, and I have to press unblock on certain pages. So they still need to work on the kinks. But that's expected considering it's not even version 1.0.  I'd also like to see a much more intuitive interface for unblocking certain elements. I don't understand what all the pluses and minuses mean there. It would be better if it would be marked what's allowed with a green icon and with red what isn't.  I've heard 2 of the main developers (including its creator) left the project. But I assume something as popular as uBlock already has a big enough community to support its future development.     Hey, as long as they are using HUGE LOCKS. I wouldn't want my privacy protected only by some tiny ass small locks.   "We wouldn't want to rape you, so it would be better if you *agree* to us fucking you."  Is what NSA is basically saying.    They'll just say a FISA warrant is enough.   Indeed. If you go can go Google Fiber - DO IT! That's the only way to make sure that:  1) Google's Fiber business is *sustainable* (if only 1% of the cable customers subscribe to Google Fiber in all cities, Google Fiber will fail, and we'll lose the main incentive for Comcast/TWC/AT T to keep upgrading).  2) Google Fiber continues to *expand* in other cities as well, so  the competition increases in those places, too, not just in some places.  Besides, it's very likely Google Fiber will either have the faster speed, lower price, unlimited bandwidth, or a better "constant speed" than these guys anyway, no matter what they're promising now.   I think they will.  http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/02/12/google-10-gigabit-internet-speeds/5421709/   Oh, so then NSA and some other agency we can trust, such as DEA, can keep the second key right? Cool, sounds like a great idea...  Who the fuck are they trying to fool? Even if the key is split in *12*, not 2, the NSA would still have all the parts for one, and second who's going to make sure the agencies don't co-operate in the first place? Our "strict oversight" intelligence committees? HA HA!   More like dystopia.   So annoying LG still hasn't given up the mentality of copying Samsung and following its lead at all costs. Then this is what happens - implementing an idea a year after Samsung has given up on it. LG needs to update its design philosophy just as much as Samsung had to. Those designs are boring and ugly belonging to a bygone era.   And [China's Great Cannon](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/11/technology/china-is-said-to-use-powerful-new-weapon-to-censor-internet.html) can hurt US and other countries e-economy. What's his point?  Google gave China an out. They adopt Certificate Transparency which would make it easier to audit their certificates for forging in the future, and they would put them back in. So why isn't China doing that - unless it intends to forge more certificates in the future ?!    we're about to see much slower progress than we used to  Moore's Law is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things. The rate of progress will continue with or without "Moore's Law" (which specifically states that the number of transistors per die area will double every 18 months).  Here's an example to understand what Moore's Law is and isn't. Let's say we come up with a new type of transistor, like one based on graphene, and once we reach the physical limits for the size of tranzistors (close to an atom's size), we'll use something like graphene transistors to *increase frequency* every 18 months or whatever. Then, even though we won't have a "doubling of the number of transistors per die area" every 18 months anymore (so no more Moore's Law), we'd still have this "doubling of frequency" every 18 months (just an example). The point is we'd *still* have a good rate of progress even without Moore's Law. And that rate of progress would once again confirm the law of accelerated returns (even if we find another name of the "law of doubling frequency" - that would be just a *niche* within the law of accelerated returns).   He would say that, since Yakuza is entrenched in Japan's elite class:  https://news.vice.com/article/this-may-be-the-most-dangerous-and-most-costly-photo-in-japan   So stuff like passwords or private keys aren't automatically included in that encrypted partition, or are those just encrypted separately by the apps (in general)?  Also, what's taking so long to adopt F2FS in stock Android? Google used it like 2 years ago in Motorola devices.   Keep this in mind as well when reading that pdf as well:  http://theinvisiblethings.blogspot.com/2013_09_01_archive.html    It does remind me of this:   The IPSEC standards also mandated support for the "null"      encryption option (plaintext hiding in supposedly-encrypted      packets), for 56-bit Single DES, and for the use of a 768-bit      Diffie-Hellman group, all of which are insecure and each of which      renders the protocol subject to downgrade attacks.  https://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg12325.html  As we've seen with the recent SSL3 attack, it's sometimes easier to break an encryption scheme if you can downgrade it to weaker algorithms. It helps if you make the whole protocol overly complex as well to the point where it's *easy to mess up*. That sounds like a very sound strategy for the NSA to use within standards groups while still preserving "plausible deniability" and being relatively subtle about it.   Incearca [paint.net](http://www.getpaint.net/index.html) atunci. Sau [Pixlr](http://apps.pixlr.com/editor/) (online).   Wat.   I bet he's a Russian spy trained from birth, sabotaging America one Motherland wallpaper at a time. Before you know it Putin has a 93% approval rating in the US. This shall not stand!   Or check you at the airport...oh wait.   The fuck is happening to the Land of the Free?   Well in this case it may be accurate, because you're just throwing multiple chips together and counting their performance liniarly.  But if we're talking about say a single PC chip, Moore's Law as you "understand it" is absolutely NOT true anymore. The doubling of transistors per die area *is*, but not the "doubling in performance" every 18 months.   Intel's Broadwell Core i5 isn't 8x faster than Core 2 Duo or whatever its equivalent 5 years ago. It's more like 1.5-2x faster at best.   We all know the NSA, the agency he's running, will actually have all the pieces - and that's exactly why he's proposing this.   Microsoft puts a "lot of effort" into Android because it has no choice. As a platform, Android is bigger than Windows now (yes, you read that right).  Windows phones and tablet market share on the other hand are in low single digits market share.  And just like Microsoft, Google *also* builds apps and such for the desktop Windows platform - why? Because it wants to? No. Because it *has to*, since the Windows platform is still huge on the desktop.  None of them are doing it out of the goodness of their own hearts. That's just PR bullshit that intends to make Microsoft look good.  Apple doesn't give a f%#k because it makes 98% of its money from hardware. Both Google and Microsoft make their money from services and software. Of course Microsoft would want to build an Office app for Android. If Office is not popular on Android, then something else would become popular for soon to be 2 billion users. If it makes its app on Android, then Office still has a chance of remaining popular.  Do you understand now that it has nothing to do with "being a good guy" or being selfless?! If Microsoft was a good guy they'd stop harassing OEMs with bogus patents and extorting billions a year from them. But guess what? Microsoft only cares about what makes them money. And in this case, it's Android.   Interesting about DNSChain, I haven't seen that.  Lavaboom seems to have experienced some issues lately, including a DDoS attack and losing a developer:  https://twitter.com/LavaboomHQ  Peerio as well as miniLock are open source:  https://github.com/PeerioTechnologies/peerio-client  https://github.com/kaepora/miniLock  Audit of miniLock (although in this case an audit of Peerio itself would be preferable): https://cure53.de/pentest-report_minilock.pdf  I think what isn't open source about Peerio is basically the storage service. Their monetization model seems to be like: "Allow users to encrypt end to end with native clients, but they can store those encrypted files on our servers for easy access/transmission - 1GB free, after that you pay". So in that way it's kind of like Spideroak, except you can actually "communicate" through an e-mail like interface with Peerio.  Peerio without a "third-party" storage service is essentially miniLock (encrypt and send the file over whatever medium you want).   OMG! China is going to have a nuke, too!   Kind of a useless information without knowing how many units there were right?    Privacy schmivacy! Bring in the iPhone sale billions! - Apple, probably.   "Bug" - how ridiculous. They were caught with this years ago, and they said the same. How long are they going to use that excuse?   Welcome to *Freedom*, motherfucker!   Now the coal industry will do another survey with the question:  *Do you hate jobs*?  Yes/**No**  "95% of our respondents said they don't want renewable energy!"   Avantaj: probabil niste economii la conversie si posibil ceva crestere a turismului  Dezavantaj: nu ne mai controlam moneda si nu o sa mai putem stabiliza inflatia cum vrem noi.   There's another encrypted email service I keep seeing pop up, but I haven't looked too much at it: https://whiteout.io/  There's LavaBoom, too, but again I don't know much about it: https://lavaboom.com/about  There's also https://peerio.com/ which is more like "closed" email system, though (only works with Peerio accounts). I guess you could add it to "email alternatives". The main encryption system behind it, miniLock has already been audited, including by Matthew Green.  You might want to add [DNSChain](https://github.com/okTurtles/dnschain) to the DNS list, too.  You should tweet your site at https://twitter.com/sggrc . He usually loves it when he stumbles upon "security tools charts" and such. He might give it a shout out in his Security Show next week. Worth a try.   Doesn't that mean Facebook's Tor traffic is only protected by TLS, then?   Fake accounts for organizing protests, etc. People already build fake accounts for that, but I would imagine it's a lot easier for the government to identify you that way.   They can use the Taiwanese ones.   All they need is the instruction set, and there are several they can choose from: MIPS, ARM, OpenPOWER, [RISC-V](http://riscv.org/). All "open" architectures (although for the first 3 they have to pay royalties - but they could also pirate it as others have said). Then they can just build their own cores on top of that.   This is Intel's "pay off" so they don't sue the government over the new export restrictions for China.  But this still ends up being bad for Intel in the long term, as 1) the gov may or may not continue to use Intel for DoE supercomputers in the future, and it may just be a one-time deal, while in China it would've been a longer-term deal, and 2) China will still end up making a competitor.  Also, this way the US gov screwed Nvidia, too, as it would've been Nvidia or possibly AMD the one to get this contract (as it did the last time).   Cray is so cray-cray.   More competition and fewer opportunities for Intel to abuse its monopoly power in PCs and server markets by transferring the profits there to its mobile chips, so it can sell them under-cost to steal market share from ARM.  If the only way for you to be in a certain market and competitive, is to sell chips at 1/4 of their regular price, by subsidizing 75% of it, then you don't deserve to be in that market, let alone have any chance of "conquering" that market in this way. Because it just means that as soon as they "conquer" it and most ARM chip makers are dead, they'll go back to selling for 100% of the price again. So the consumer gets screwed.   I think everyone *but* the US government can foresee that.   May I get a "Hooray for competition!"?   The solution is simple: if the citizen is not yours, then fuck off.   Also, Alibaba is already building datacenters in the US. So now you'll have Chinese companies offering online services to Americans, and then the Chinese government gets to access the data on those American users.   What if a Chinese company builds the next Facebook? Or Instagram? Or big chat app?  This is not even an argument that I'm making alone. Here's what a former NSA chief said about this just [last week](http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dont-let-america-be-boxed-in-by-its-own-computers/2015/04/02/30742192-cc04-11e4-8a46-b1dc9be5a8ff_story.html):   In a perverse way, as the saying goes, what goes around comes around. Precedents we set will be followed  or exploited  by others in an economic system that becomes more globalized and hence more interdependent by the day. Already others point to U.S. activities to justify their own, often nefarious, efforts. Witness the Chinese trying to create moral and legal equivalency between legitimate U.S. intelligence and their massive theft of intellectual property, or their placement of newly minted restrictions on U.S. IT firms. One wonders what the Russias and Chinas of the world will demand if U.S.-based firms are forbidden to create encryption schemes inaccessible to themselves or the government. Beyond the realm of speculation, the Chinese company Alibaba has announced plans to open a cloud data center in the United States. **How will we feel when a Chinese court orders Alibaba to send data on Americans back to China, citing our own behavior as justification?**   These are serious, long-term questions requiring serious, strategic answers. Possible second- and third-order effects  such as **generating a stampede toward data localization or a Balkanized Internet**  need to be considered alongside a still-important calculus based on more transient, tactical advantage.  A Balkanized Internet will hurt the US the *most* since it's the US that has the most to gain from the Internet right now, yet it's the US directly or indirectly pushing for that Internet to become much more limited, just like it has tried to limit the computation capabilities of its own companies in the past so other countries can't have access to them (more about this in the article as well).   But seriously, how did they get it so bad the first time around? I wonder if Sony helped them as not to put their sensors to shame.   Just update it with [Servo](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item px=MTgzNDA) already! (supposed to come to Firefox for Android [this year](http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item px=Mozilla-Servo-Engine-LCA2015)).  Wait - is it me or are links terribly hard to see with this new theme?!    You want to use Photoshop or any other desktop apps on your phone?  Also, isn't it bad enough that now Intel has a *monopoly* for Windows tablets (100%) with Windows RT being dead, and also for Chromebooks (something like 90%), which allows them to charge 5x the price of a similarly powerful ARM chip for an Atom chip?  You want them to do that in smartphones, too?   This is no different than say Qualcomm building reference designs...which it has. Nothing out of the ordinary here.   Yet the US gov seems to have shit all over the 4th amendment, and most in Congress also step all over it with the new laws without giving it a second thought.  For the 2nd amendment, neither Democrats not Republicans dare to do much to restrict it - even though I believe the way most 2nd amendment defenders understand it is *wrong*.   The 2nd amendment talks about a *regulated militia's* right to bear arms - not everyone's. It's more like how they gave weapons to militia in Mexico to fight against the cartels, and registered them as militia. It's not about everyone and their grandmother having the right to own a gun.   Wake me up when they have proper end-to-end encryption *by default*. Until then it's no different than many other chat apps out there.   Will it be open source then?    CSM: Toi cetenii, indiferent de funcia ocupat, sunt **imuni** n faa legii   "Consiliul subliniaz c toi cetenii, indiferent de funcia ocupat, sunt **egali** n faa legii i susine c principiul separaiei puterilor n stat trebuie respectat, n primul rnd, de reprezentanii celor trei puteri, legislativ, executiv i judectoreasc", arta CSM.  Uh..nu e acelasi lucru.   You joke, but I'm pretty sure that could end up hurting you at the border - at the very least in the sense that they'll keep you there for 10 hours to "justify stuff" and miss your flights. Certainly not a minor inconvenience.  Just use "clean" PCs and phones when passing the border. Download your stuff later when you cross the border. It goes without saying that you shouldn't be logged into your browser (where you might also have tons of other login credentials saved).  And by clean PC I don't necessarily mean a *formatted* PC or phone. Remember that stuff can be easily recovered (if they want to go through that trouble), unless you've always used encryption on your hard drives.   Microsoft charges twice as much for theirs.   Best [dick pic](https://cantheyseemydick.com/)?   Here's what I find ridiculous about prosecutor charges/plea bargains.  Let's imagine the prosecutor charges Aaron Swartz with 35 years in prison. But then the prosecutor wants a plea bargain that would put Aaron in prison for *only 2 years*. But let's not imagine, because that *actually happened*.  So which is it? Is he a terrible danger to society that deserves 35 years in prison - or is it a relatively minor offense that should only get 2 years?  In reality, it's neither. Because for all intents and purposes Aaron Swartz was "innocent", innocent in the *spirit of the law* sense, not in the "everybody commits 3 felonies a day" *letter of the law* sense.  But prosecutors can abuse this plea bargain power and get even innocent people to accept prison time that only seems *small* in comparison to the initial exaggerated charge. In reality, for someone innocent, even that is too small - but they have may no choice, and would rather take "only 1/15th" of the initial prison time.  Back to the point, I think the jury would start *cutting through the bullshit*, and if he's indeed dangerous and a real criminal, then he will get maybe not 35 years that the prosecutor initially asks, but 20 years. On the other hand, if he's dangerous, but the prosecutor once a "sure-fire" 2 years in prison "win", then again the jury will stop that from happening.  If the whole thing is bullshit, and the guy is innocent, then the jury may save him. I think that would be a lot closer to "real justice" (regardless of whether the guy is innocent or guilty) than leaving everything to the prosecutor.   Theme engine.     Astept reactia lui Base.   /u/brutalistu? More like /u/rasistu - amirite?!   Is that the one where they start calling everyone who got it for free pirates?   More!   The speed limit thing was also introduced by Ford a while ago.   The fact that when the Patriot Act was announced - just after 9/11 mind you - they said it's going to be used "against terrorism...and *drug crimes*" should've been a HUGE FUCKING RED FLAG!  So you're telling me that you're in a hurry to pass a "new" law that wants to prevent the kind of terrorist attacks that have just happened....and you took the time to introduce *drug crimes* in there, too?! What the fuck?  The aspect alone should've made everyone think that the Patriot Act  was just another way for the government to expand its powers and remove more rights from citizens.  Lo and behold, more than a decade later, the Patriot Act and "National Security" Letters are used in something like 97 percent of the cases for *drug crimes*, not for actual "national security" issues (and that's ignoring the fact that in many instances the feds just claim "national security" for no good reason).   Now do it for the new "Celerons" and "Pentiums" (which are actually Atoms now, and not based on Haswell or Broadwell anymore - yet they cost just as much).   Why the hell doesn't Android still not have a theme engine? CyanogenMod has had it for years now. It didn't ever cross their minds that it would be a good idea?   Not sure how Tutanota encrypts stuff (the AES-only for "external email" sounds a little weird), but I would recommend [Peerio](https://peerio.com/) (still quite new, but the main encryption mechanism behind it, miniLock has passed an audit) instead if you want something that's easy to use. TextSecure/Signal is good.   Ofticat rau ca s-au luat de Elena lui. Pan'aici!    Sadly, it's been happening far too often lately. Basically FOIA has been neutered to the point of being useless for important stuff that the people *should* actually know about. Either they reject FOIAs now because "it's secret", or if they do release the docs, 95% of the text is redacted - again making the release useless.  FOIA needs to be completely overhauled and made much stronger if we want to stop pretending that we have "government transparency".   Before passing the law: "We promise to only use this power to catch terrorists and child pornographers!"  After the law is passed: "Sooo...what else can we use this power for?!"  It always happens with surveillance and censorship. ALWAYS!   LENR "fusion" might do the trick - if it ever becomes real.   Going by the same chip in a Nexus Player which *can't* play 1080p that smoothly, probably not.   Benchmarks are misleading. They give scores to "cores" almost linearly. So an Atom core might get 500 points while the Core 2 Duo gets 1,000, but the Atom chip has 4 cores, while the Core 2 Duo one had 2.  Yet in the benchmark both will appear "equal", even though that's far from the truth, because a Core 2 Duo core is *twice as fast* as an Atom core.   Except, not really.   It actually sounds quite overpriced. You can get a whole Chromebook with the same specs for $150.   The sooner Firefox and Tor are rewritten in Rust and use Electrolysis sandboxing, the better. If it weren't for these projects already planned, I'd probably recommend Tor to switch to Chromium. But I think with Rust (and assuming Electrolysis is more or less just as good as Chrome's sandbox) Firefox has the potential to be even more secure than Chrome in the next 2 or so years.   The NSA actually does seem to look at your dick pics:  http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/04/04/the-shrinks-who-only-see-cia-officers.html     8% per year means either the price of say a 200-mile battery will be cut in *half* within 8-10 years, or you'll be able to get a 400-mile battery for the same price you get a 200-mile one today.  So what we're seeing is basically a sort of Moore's Law for batteries, but instead of the performance "doubling every 2 years", it doubles every 10 years.   Still not bad at all, and a rate of improvement far greater than what we've seen in gas-powered cars. If this rate of progress lasts for 2-3 decades, we could see batteries at a given mileage be 10x cheaper than they are today, or last 10x more at the same price point.   UK has been wanting to turn into China for a while now (basically since Cameron came to power).   Building medical robots instead of military ones is an idea I can actually support. And it's probably going to be almost as profitable for Google.   Care to elaborate?   They didn't even count RedPhone? And since when does the Facebook app have *real-time* VOIP? I thought it only had audio recording?   I find Swiftkey significantly worse these days, and I think I can track the beginning of when it became so bad to when it announced some big "performance improvements", I believe at the end of last year. They probably sacrificed some accuracy for performance then.   Does it also steal your credentials like "Outlook for mobile"?   More secure, too, especially when combined with grsec. However, if they would do this from scratch, it might be better to actually innovate, and create some secure kernel design by default instead of continuing to use patched-up kernels from 20 years ago.   I call bullshit on this.   Also, I thought Title 2 would kill investments...?! If anything it seems to have *spurred* investments. Well, either that or Comcast just wants to play the good guy now until its TWC acquisition is approved. Then all bets are off.   Costs too much. Should've been $50, and it probably would've been if it wasn't for the overpriced Atom chip.   Yes, I think even the 4k streaming on Netflix uses like 15Mbps max. However, I bet even this Comcast connection will somehow end up stuttering it.   Gresit. Ar fi "pus in pericol viata politistului" si l-ar fi impuscat direct in cap probabil - de 2 ori sa fie sigur (si ca sa nu il dea in judecata daca scapa - I'm not even joking, this actually happens).  In SUA politistii cred ca le "pui viata in pericol" si daca vii cu mainile in buzunar de la 20m spre ei. Au impuscat si copii in parcuri pe ideea asta.   At only 6x Google's price.  I don't get tech sites that are so eager to write positive announcements from Comcast and AT T. It's like they aren't Americans and don't know how shitty and untrustworthy these companies are.    No, but I'm sure they launched this on April Fools to make everyone think it might be a joke, just like they did with Gmail.  However, they already announced ARC last year, technically.   Eh. Super misleading headline. Now that Microsoft calls everything "Windows" on all platforms, the you can't just say "Windows devices" unless you also consider PCs. Combined with that, the growth was likely negligible.    Wow, this is *huge*. Good job, Google! Hopefully Mozilla, Apple and Microsoft will follow.   It won't matter how many rules there are, if FCC isn't ultimately going to enforce them (and not just by making the carriers pay a $2 million fine every 5 years!).   Heck, I bet it even has better app support than Windows for phones.   And it's going to improve even more this year once it moves to the Servo rendering engine:  http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item px=MTgzNDA  http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item px=Mozilla-Servo-Engine-LCA2015   You're forgetting the keyboard isn't actually included. That will probably be another $130.  $630 is pretty pricey for a low-end notebook with mobile processor, with 64GB of storage and 2GB of RAM, no?   Expensive for an Atom machine.   Definitely for phones I know won't be receiving too many updates.   I see how it goes. So when Pentagon officials or other elites use strong encryption, then that's fine. But when the plebs use it, then they must be pedophiles. Because we all know the elites couldn't possibly also be [pedophiles](https://news.vice.com/article/uk-police-investigating-five-alleged-pedophile-rings-involving-highly-influential-politicians).   As for Silent Circle - have they updated their warrant canary yet? Last I checked they made it sound as if they already received some kind of *secret* warrants to give user data.   I lost track of how many 180's Obama did on his promises.   Literally the most transparent administration in history.   Ar trebui sa li se asigure si jacuzzi de la stat ca sa se relaxeze de la stresul provocat de DNA cand ii acuza.   Doar nu suntem animale.   They're changing the model this year, and I think the new one is much nicer. I would wait.   Have you even tried to introduce them to Drive?  The problem with this is they will still run *Windows* and for tech illiterate people Chrome OS will still be far better.  Chrome OS is a much bigger advantage in simplicity than the disadvantage of not having Office and having to use Drive.  And doesn't Microsoft have online Office now? That should work on Chrome OS, no? Unless they're still requiring plugins for it like in the stone-age.   It's probably not that useful for most other stuff, but for the stuff it is, it could still be game-changing.   Make sure you have at least half of your battery charged.   So Facebook's *future* is...Second Life?  I feel like we've "been there, done that", and it wasn't that great, except for a small number of people.  There are so many great things VR and therefore Oculus could do. Building another Second Life is not one of them, and it's actually *exactly* what I was afraid of when Facebook bought Oculus - that it would take it down this bad path.   And it's not encrypted end-to-end like Signal either.   If it doesn't "work" as it's intended, then it's not encryption.  Would your bank want to us only broken encryption?  	200
 I once owned a dog that was smarter then you   side note it has some bad language, i don't know if that would make it NSFW so I'll just leave the post as it is.      The Adventures of the Taxi Dog and If You Give a Mouse a Cookie      Halo had a remake....   Kingdom Hearts series. It may look kiddish but if you really get into it, you'll never be the same.   my dad gave me his old laptop he had lying around, the Google search bar was full of mother son porn. weird stuff.   http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1biedv/people_of_askreddit_what_are_some_questions_you/   would it be too much to ask if you could send those people our way?   just don't forgot to upvote :)   man, i just remembered that   herbie... you poor bastard   a change I noticed was in Episode 2, when Obi-Wan is talking to Yoda. While they are talking Obi-Wan says he was trained by Yoda, but he was trained by Qui-gon. It's one of the ways I think George Lucas made it so you can ignore Phantom Menace.   I think we can add this to the list of terrifying N64-era enemies. Something about the graphics back then make things scarier than in games today, I think.   Edit: I forgot Dark forces wasn't on N64, it was just in that generation of games.   i don't think it's that much of a spoiler, but you never know with some people.   it doesn't say its against the rules to ask questions and this question didn't pop-up in my search so I would like you to share how you discovered Star Wars, maybe with some interesting stories :)   sorry, my fault, just spur of the moment      but you'll always know......   "I was frozen today!"-Suburban Commando http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC8zz95rm8s   I never liked Lord of the Rings. Mostly because I don't like old medieval type settings, I love futuristic Sci-Fi.    Star Wars Jedi Knight. Mainly because I love Star Wars and I would like to attend the Jedi academy.   http://imgur.com/yqui2mR   http://i.imgur.com/Fnm4qMO.jpg      I always wanted to be Robin. I don't think I'd be able to fill Batman's role.   Characters from books, movies, tv shows, whatever!   care to elaborate?   you should tell your husband, "if you didn't look like my first crush, I wouldn't have given you a second thought." I kid I kid   what is the value of it?         "you're my density"   lol i wish. She didn't know anything about the movie apart from the title so she was surprised during the opening scene.

 Check out this VFX breakdown of [Gone Girl.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvwS_E91fZA) Lots of great stuff in there.   I used to like Armagaeddon. I watched it again recently and ah... yeah I don't like Armagaeddon.  	2

 Serbian here,and stereotypes go towards everything here.But it goes more like an internal joke and less as an insult   I personally turn of system sounds quite early.Dont worry,you are perfectly fine   Ever tried Pringles with Chocolate?   Well post some funny/interesting things online that i would usually keep on my phone and show to friends as a silence buster   Screen-Five!(It's like a highfive just you slap your monitor and pretend like i did it at the same time you did)   Completely dry?That doesnt sound as good as you think   Now imagine all those facebook statuses all rolled up there.The horror.   Lets hope he gets more lines this time.   So i ran upon the game on gamestop,and it seemed interesting though i never heard of it before.Im usually into RPGs,Action and Adventure games,but usually the strong story is the key.   For some reason,now i want to go to the russian youtube.   She blesses the vampire,which are in some stories afraid of holy things,such as holy water,crosses...   Tell me you saw a bunch of cute puppies and you kept one because of the eyes.Please tell me thats true   "Thanks for shopping with us,come again!" "You too."   Your life story would be much better if you gave those girls a chance.   Well,now you have 227 more than on your last one   I always thought the lower boundary is 65%.Well atleast thats how it used to work here   Its even worse when the other guy is wrong,so you get hope you are right,then you end up wrong aswell   He also shaved his beard!   Id say you should try out Dead Island,its a decently fun game worth its price.As for borderlands,yeah,definetely get it   Lets fire a few rounds on it and see what happens   Whoever wants to play something can feel free to add me,Doctor Von Foster or pm me your gamertag.I have Dead Island,Fable 2,Halo Reach,Forza 3 and MK Vs DC,so if you need help wih anything or just want to have fun im here!   Hell im up for it if comes to it.Hit me up a pm if it ever happens   As a galio player,i get you bro   "Call the priest!"   Hes just waiting,dont be fooled by its appearance   Then blaspheme we shall!   Tequilla.Lots of it.   They should,as long as the games are purschased they should work just fine.The only problem is the free to play games,they tend to dissaear if theres a region lock   Just a random question,what genre is the game?It looks pretty interesting   This and Wait and Bleed go hand in hand when it comes to workout music.   Just let him hide under the bed like he wants to.   What mod is on it?Im pretty new to he game,dont judge me   Oh i see.Though mount and blade has very large,well done multiplayer battles,the SP factor of it plays a bigger role   Back in my days we had cats that would eat that mouse in seconds!Twice!  	34
 Bright Lights, Big City      When men don't wear belts.    When will there be a Gattaca sequel?   Check out the Hyperion series by Dan Simmons. Keats included.    that doesn't charge hundreds of dollars for new ink cartridges. I have a Konica Minolta Magicolor 4750DN and to replace everything (toner, ink, imaging units) costs more than a thousand dollars every 6 months. This is for less than 5,000 pages printed. Any thoughts?   But his ideologies ARE kind of reflected... Ender was never supposed to exist. The Wiggins had him so that they could procreate as their religion said they were supposed to.    I'm the best man at a wedding this fall and have the whole bachelor party planned, but it's expensive and as I've never done this before I don't know what the protocol is. Anyone have any experience?      eggs and lots of toilet paper.          Favorite is relative to you. There is no wrong answer.    Ahhh what an evil bloke   You have my vote- but Atticus. Scout got all her good grace from him.    I found a list of the top 100 fictional characters of the last 100 years and I just don't know how they came up with them. Love to know your opinions.             I'm reading we are anonymous by parmy Olson. Really well researched.   Dan Simmon's Hyperion. I dare you to read it and not enjoy.   Check out Dan Simmon's Hyperion or Orson Scott Card's Enders Game. Both have subsequent books and will hook you from the starts.     	23
 Thanks for the tips. You are all awesome.   I assumed if they had milkshakes they would be tiny and pricey? True fact?   And don't say a fast food place like McDonald's.  I'm craving...   Do you think this might rebound in the future? Is it worth holding if you stepped away and came back to see 50% hit?   Still in AVEO? Target PPS?   In that case we would have this thread all over again.    To each their own. I find these movies unwatchable.    Yeah, to say he didn't get over the courting of Harbaugh is juvenile and shows he doesn't take responsibility for his portion.   Not saying Sparano was a great couch, just saying Ross should not have tried to hire a guy for a filled position.   Miami has 104, 106, 109 tomorrow. fast and furious.  they got 106 and 109 for their 2nd 3rd round pick.   any idea what we got?   I think it's coming up ...  shit actually don't know.   I love Incognito. I'd like to see him and Rex in the octagon. I'd pay good money for that.   I'm drunk, so there's that.  Mayock likes him.   Well there's a tackle. I don't know shit about him, but 2nd rounder he must be decent.   He's their best player at this point.   If Geno Smith or Tebow start you will still have your chance.      but they aren't smart...so...starting QB week 1...Jamarcus Russell.  Write it down.   eh, not worth the time.   seriously, don't help him!   that would be as good as a wet dream.  Sanchez, Tebow, Garrard, Smith...let's see what a complete fuckmess they can make this team   and I would have deserved it.   Mike Mayock looks disgusted on NFL Network :)  Asked about who is started QB week 1 he said "I have no idea what's going on". When a guy that good at what he does says that...it's good to be a Fins fan!   First, I hate the fucking Jets. But I'm starting to feel sorry for some of their players, like Geno. Damn they are fucked. Can a team lose 20 games in a year?   nuff said.   I have a friend who can't seem to get movies on his One. He plugs it into his computer and copy/pastes to the movies folder and then a message comes up that it's "converting". The battery (even though it's plugged in) drains before it finishes (about 2gb mp4).  First, why converting?  Second, the transfer should not take hours.  Anyone else tried to put a movie on?   and the jets didn't get better. trade revis for milliner...yeah, not better.   What a terrible movie description.   we got a deal   the giants won superbowls because of great pass rush   love it. crush brady. I know everyone wants secondary or OT, but a great pass rush can mask a weak secondary (though i'd say our secondary is slightly improved), and if we're quick to get rid of the ball our offense will be fine.  oh, and fuck the jets.      too bad, want to see it.   Reload damnit!   Factor in the cost of Internet access. With cable you are paying for that access as well, so netflix is a bit more expensive to you than just their fee.    Every down vote from a jets fan is a badge of honor.   Keep 'em coming you low-life fucktards!   You heard the man, to the boobs!   First post? Check.  Female? Check.  Hawk? Check.   To the front page...   Awesome, thank you! Seems likely enough!      Amazon Instant Video tops my list.    Any one else notice the influx of "church planters" the past 5 years? I have met a few that moved here recently to start churches and neighborhood prayer groups. Literally, that's what they moved here for, with their families, and no jobs...just took whatever job they could get.   Things like that can end up upsetting a community. Let's hope we stay open.    Add me: Endif  I've played survival in the past, mostly scavange now. Play mostly at 9pm eastern.    Figures ...  I appreciate the info though, probably saved me some cash.     I have not tried that (wasn't slow from the "get-go"). Have you found that to be helpful?   The Nexus 10 is more than twice as much ($250 vs. $560 for the 32gb). Otherwise I'd make the jump. I'd like something more affordable with a great screen that won't shit the bed in a few months like the first Asus Transformer (still works but is just about as slow as you can get).   It seems like this is a great tablet from the specs, the only shortcoming being the 8gb of storage, though it accepts microsd cards for more.  I'm looking for a tablet with a great display for primarily watching movies, and I want access to the Play store (hence not the Kindle), though I will likely only install a few apps. Is there something I'm missing with this one? Seems super cheap.  Stats from Amazon and link for reference: - Super HD definition with up to 2048 x 1536 pixels resolution - 9.7" capacitive 10x multitouch capacitive IPS display - Google certified with full access to the Google Play Store and its 700.000 apps to download - Aluminium back casing     Front and back cameras with autofocus mode (2   5 MP)  http://www.amazon.com/Archos-Titanium-Tablet-Android-Storage/dp/B00B0C8UOU/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1364297943 sr=8-1 keywords=archos+97+titanium+hd   the 3d makes this messed up.   Nope, false alarm.    I need to give it time...let it sink in.    They will be so bad they find a way to go 0-20   When he fucks Giselle he thinks about Wes. You know it's true.    Yeah, he'll really help the Pats for 8 games next year.    Thanks for the context. Love Philbin so far!   I'm lost. What is this in reference to?    Overthrowing isn't always the quarterback's fault. I've seen plenty of passes by Big Ben where he just heaved the ball and Wallace just ran to get it.   The Dolphins didn't have a guy who could do that before.    Agreed. That's the worst ting about the movies subreddit.    The answer is 'no'.   It's what everyone wants but will never be provided. Oh the ability to just buy a movie and watch it on any device and without an Internet connection! What a dream!  This is why people still download illegally. It is literally easier to steal the content than to pay for it. Major content providers may never learn.    Nice, thanks!   Anyone have links to videos of "pros" playing Scavange? In games I occasionally hear people talk about them but have yet to find any online.    Have you tried changing your aliases?   Acting sure doesn't look like much fun anymore.    Smoke.   Weapon.   Flying debris.   Yep, poster for action flick!   I did this. I'm ashamed of myself now :(   All Star Wars.   All Lord of the Rings.   All Kill Bill.   Bring on the down votes.    This.    Came to see the girlfriend. Was not disappoint.    That list is laughable. Don't quit your day job!   I've been reading comments, and it's interesting to read other perspectives.   I admit I could be wrong (time will tell) but I don't see the pistol as a fad. I never thought the wildcat would last, and it hasn't, but the pistol is a much different threat and harder to defend. With the pistol you actually have someone who can throw the ball involved, rather than a Ronnie Brown who didn't offer much threat there.   If I were to select an offense, I wouldn't utilize the pistol much for the same reason others said, injuries. RG3 is amazing, but I think his career will be limited by injuries. Wilson and Kaper might hold up better though.   We'll see!   Sure, not exactly their offense but it sure has helped other teams (WAS, SEA, SF). Does Tanney have what it takes?    49ers because for some reason Ray Lewis gets an absolute free pass for possibly murdering someone. He's talked about like a god and no commentators bring this up. He can choke on a dick.   Fuck the Jets.    Looks like nothing but black screen.    I have that same calendar. I hate to say it, but that calendar reinforced to me how depleted our roster is (I blame Parcells).   Also, why the hell is Vontae Davis in the calendar when he left before September? They didn't keep track of trades before the season!   It's photos like this that make me feel we have totally lost our minds.    "If you find pussy for less anywhere else...fuck it."  For my pimp interview.    Curious about this too, especially since it's also a Kubrick film.   And ours played better this year.    10 million?  He's shooting high as a negotiation tactic. Like the guy, but he just isn't worth it.    And cover the shit with pennies.   	79
             On par with Zimbabwe, right.      I guess there's not much to adjust since the number of shootings in the other three countries is zero.           	10
 Ha, not the first time someone's said that   I wish that was the case   No more like small north eastern state school of about 800.   Haha couldn't be more opposite of a school    Like picking up after a person who weighs 180      Can you make these into backgrounds?   Number one is so obvious but so easily ignored.  I'm in the process of creating a startup and all the books and articles you read focus on growth and don't really mention retention.  The fact of the matter is you need both.   Don't care didn't ask.  Edit:  maybe if I had posted is this a good place to put my tv your opinion would have been relevant.    \_()_/, I'm not sure of what the specific insulation is, but it isn't very knew.  It looks sorta like stuffing, so I wouldn't be cutting through plastic building wrap, and I think i could sorta stuff it back in.  I suppose the next question though is should I?   I honestly have no clue.  Is this the point I call an electrician?   Definitely going to copy you.  	12
 This is real. I'd love to give you some sort of proof, but any other picture I put up can easily be considered photoshopped if you already think this one is. I'd do more than that for you, but I have a final to worry about, so you'll have to wait if you're eager.  And yeah, I have a final I'm supposed to be pulling an all-nighter for right now, and the biggest thing I've accomplished so far is getting one of our facebook posts on the front page of reddit. I'll be successful one day.   One day.   It's a guy. To the left of the picture.   Yeah, this is referring to Plano, TX. There's definitely an abundance of those kids here. We tend to refer to Plano as a city in it's own little bubble.  I grew up here too.         I wouldn't normally say this, but considering there's 10 slots open, I'd love for *Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2* to get at least a nod for a Best Picture nominee.

I'm ready to find my power animal.   Not exactly at the bottom. Bikini Bottom's somewhere in the middle of the sea. If you remember clearly, Rock Bottom was one of the dark cities in the sea where Spongebob couldn't bear to be.   ...I just realized how badly I need to start studying for my exam.   You'd be surprised how often I see that joke annoy the hell out of girls. I wouldn't be taking this a bit seriously if I didn't see that happening.   I'm commenting this again here so people will hopefully see it:  To everyone pointing out the hypocrisy of men when they call out girls for stuff like this: I wrote a earlier here explaining how I hate diagrams like this because it's the exact way of thinking a guy can have towards a girl *and* the broad-mindedness a girl can have towards a guy. I deleted it because it was getting downvoted for whatever reason. I call out my guy friends everytime they make another borderline pathetic "make me a sandwich" joke, and I make damn sure I respect everyone I have the pleasure to meet; man or woman.  But in case guys haven't noticed this either: *we* are part of the problem as well.   I just lost my front page virginity.  To everyone pointing out the hypocrisy of men when they call out girls for stuff like this: I wrote a comment earlier here explaining how I hate diagrams like this because it's the exact way of thinking a guy can have towards a girl *and* the broad-mindedness a girl can have towards a guy. I deleted it because it was getting downvoted for whatever reason.   But in case guys haven't noticed this either: *we* are part of the problem as well.    NOPE NOPE NOPE  **NOPE**   Scumbag redditor.  Buys iPhone 4S  Starts planning on killing themselves      How the hell did this go from 7000 upvotes to 5000 so fast?   You can't expect a band to sing about masturbation and being bored for 15+ years. They're around 30-40 years old now. Their music will change as they do, along with any other band that actually grows up.   I don't know about you, but reading this random submission on Reddit just slapped me in the face to get back up and work on my goals. Reading those words from his dad gave me hope in fulfilling my goals to be as good of a father as I can be in the near future.   Sometimes people could really benefit from reading something as simple as a letter like this. Don't feel urged to ignore that and accuse a person you don't know of something he probably didn't intend for in the first place.   Reading this reminded me of all the sacrifices my dad has made for me as I've grown up. I can't wait to get married and be the best father ever to my unborn son. There's nothing I want more in life than to give to him what my dad's given to me.  Thanks for sharing this. Your father sounded like he was one hell of a genuine guy. I'm going to start working towards my future now, which means getting back to studying for this exam tomorrow.      I have no questions. I just wanted to thank you for being one of my role models through my four years of high school. I never thought a sitcom  could hit me so close and stick with me throughout all these years. JD and Turk are pretty much the reason I can be proud to say I have a bromance myself today.   Thanks for everything. You're a genius. All I wanted to say.   This might not mean much coming off the internet from a random redditor, but it's never too late if you try. If you want something, go get it.   Don't.   What's Louis, my niggah? What's Chewie, my niggah?   Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II.  The opening scene with the dementors frozen in fog midair just haunted the hell out of me.   Got any...

Unfortunately, no tornadoes were around at all, but it felt wicked to be in the middle of a storm like that. I was pretty ecstatic about it.  My advice: go out there even if it's just a thunderstorm.         ...Dr. Grant?   Oh, wait.   How was it like looking at yourself almost exactly as you looked 25 years ago? It would be so surreal for me to see a moving, acting, younger version myself.  I read the AMA in your voice, by the way.   Edited.   They're still up there for me. Don't know what's going on. but in any case, I took screenshots beforehand. I figured they'd probably come in handy if we are able to take some sort of legal action.  The girl that passed away was an organ donor. She saved 11 lives after her death.   http://imgur.com/a/n9I1e  (NSFW/L)   I'm trying to find a way to contact the person that made the page. I'll send them this link and see if they can keep screenshots of everything. Thanks!      I don't listen to you guys much, other than your Umbrella cover, but my brother has always been a huge fan. Just wanted to say thanks for coming out and doing this. It's always awesome to see someone from a big band come out and take the heat from people on the internet to answer questions for their fans.   My question is, I'm aspiring to be an artist sometime in the future as well. Either through music or film. What advice would you give for someone who doesn't necessarily want the fame or the big life, but to at least be heard for what he does?  Thanks!   I may not listen to All Time Low, but my younger brother happens to be one of their biggest fans, and he's always been the one to pick up after the shit his friends do, and look after his friends because of the stupid stuff that they do. He's the one who makes sure our family stays sane in times of tension, and he's always been there for anyone he loves. My brother is 16 years old, and I can already see more balls in him than I can see in you, if I was even to be given an entire biography on your predictably sad life. I'm willing to bet on that.   Don't bring your useless throwaway account into this community and attempt to be a Negative Nancy to people who have a taste in music that you don't like. Don't attack someone on a personal level because they're different from you and have not done a single thing to you in their life. People like you make me sick.   Sorry for the incredibly late response. Studying took me over the past two days. But hopefully you read this.  Okay, so these passages were the passages I knew people would ask about, and there is good reason to. If I read something like this, I'd surely feel threatened too. So why is it in the Qur'an? The defenders of the Qur'an will always tell you you have to look into the context, but that's an overly stated and under-explained argument, in my opinion. I'll try giving you the full reasoning.  The Qur'an was not released as a book back in it's time. The Prophet Muhammad was given, so we believe, these passages over a series of an Islamic lunar month (which you may know today as Ramadan). They were speeches given to him by an angel named Jibrail who made him memorize these passages. This was a time of war for him and his people. It wasn't a great time for them either. People didn't like that Muhammad was speaking of the idols they worshipped as false, and that he was asking them to see that there is one creator of the universe. It turned into the dark ages for them. Muhammad's many family members and friends were actually killed and tortured for the sake of angering him. These conflicts escalated, and during that time, people looked to him for guidance because he's been their leader this far. They trusted him.   The passages you gave (2.191-93) was given as speeches to him to guide his people down the right path as they entered this war. And the thing is, these attackers could have murdered their families beforehand, yet this passage specifically ensured that the Muslims kill only when they're being attacked. If anyone surrendered at all, then show no hostility to them. This passage wasn't given as an order to kill any disbeliever anyone sees, but an order to fight with defense against an army in a time of crisis.  To make the best metaphor I can out of this, imagine your parent's parenting history put into a book. Should I have gone back and read that your mom said "I'm going to beat you", I'd be all 'WHOAA. CALL CHILDRENS AID. NOW.'  The exception is when I would have to go back and read the history of what was happening at that moment, when you probably did something to get her mad. The main thing the Quran has in common with what one learns from his parents is that they both have issues that deal with everything. There's violence, and peace, but all of them are told through interconnected stories to bring through one message: be a good person.   As for believing in god or going to hell, I have my thoughts on it as well. We all interpret our religions our own way, and I think that these people would have had the proff right there for them. They've seen Muhammad cut a moon in half, and miracles that would be unbelievable. The disbelievers in the time of this scripture tended to be unkind people, and I think the Qur'an, as well as any other scripture, stated that if one has seen the truth, but chooses not to believe it, would await whatever judgement that god sets on him. In the end, I honestly think it comes down to be a good person, and to help humanity. The Quran gave passageways that explained not to ever forcefully place an ideology, even Islam, onto a person, and Muhammad carried this out by making Constitutions with monks and christian villages that established freedom of religion. But that's just my two cents on it.  I'll end this with another passage that can hopefully sum up howthe Quran is not a book of rules and guidelines on a list, but rather a series of stories from times of hardship and basic human problems and the morals we must overall learn from them, whether we believe in a God or not.     If anyone slew a person unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land it would be as if he slew the whole humanity: and if anyone saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole humanity.  This was one passageway that allowed me to choose this religion if I'm going to believe in a god. I like the fact that it's struggling for the better of humanity as a whole.  Let me know if i made anything unclear. Again, sorry for being so late!     Wow man. You're a douchebag.   Your friend was trying to match it together to make it seem as if God really did just want us to decrypt the science out of the book. My view is basically the assumption you made of the Quran being a metaphorical book of signs. And by the way, please don't hesitate to ask me on any passage, nasty or not! I want to do the best I can at explaining those too. And thanks for being respectful while making criticism. :)   Which is why i read it first. I simply said translation to clarify that I read it in Arabic. Sorry for the misunderstanding. :\   I do think that is a valid assertion, like the many subreddits we have here, people see things in their own ways, and people fit text with meanings to see something in their way. I've done this myself.  To make it clear, nothing ever convinced me that God (or Allah) is real. I am not at a point where I know for sure that there is a god. I was faced with a simple question: whether there is a God or not. From everything I've known and experienced, I chose to *believe*. Choosing Islam was a second step. Basically, it supported what I *wanted*: belief in a divine creator, and the fact that religion and science can come together. I gave it the most recognition. It made sense to me. This won't be the case with everyone.   I think I spoke in the wrong way. I was trying to state that it was brought up in a metaphorical way. Agreeing with what you said.  I think in order for humans to understand something so great, metaphorical poetry was necessary. It's a way to connect. The Quran is not a book of science, but a book of understanding the picture. Science is the anatomy which we have been told to study.   I like this.   I don't think you understood the part where I said during my agnostic phase, I was studying everywhere about this. Agnosticism = knowledge. I get it. AMA still relevant.   And sorry, but r/atheism isn't some secret club where you need to present yourself in a certain way to be 'accepted' by the community. People come, people talk, regardless of belief, if it's on the topic of atheism. I came here to hopefully give people a better idea of what a religious guy can be like. I'm not an asshole. I came to talk like one would at a bar. Thanks.  	57

 Ohhhhhhhhhh.    Karen Gillan was in doctor who from 2010-2012. Looked like a young adult on the show and had a husband, I feel like she'd be to old and out of place for a student   ODST is by far my favorite.   Or hunting      Firefighter for three NFS. Them some hardy men.   Doing society a favor good sir   I don't understand. Vets are animal doctors and doctors are meant to help, heal, and bring life to their patients. This is like a doctor killing someone, then claiming they are "doctor of the year"   It completely goes against what a Vet is.   Many many people absolutely love halo 5. It's not a joke. Plus the campaign hype.   Halo Online is legit halo 4 on roids. It was a cheap money grab by Microsoft.    But will I have an expanded version of the experience I got in the originals?   Yeah, so... what is happening here.   No. I'm an honest man. If I don't think you're beautiful, I won't say it. I will generally say what I think (amazing, cute, pretty) On the otherhand, I hate insulting people.    It's halo 4 on crack. But I think its because people dummy expect much from it and they can mod the living hell out of it.   If it is, we better get to see an updated old forerunner architecture style.   Aha. But then..... what truly defines reality? Our senses? Perceptions?    This version is great. Especially with the trumpets   Hey   It really sucks. It should have been a reskinned and updated Waypoint.    I'm fucking dying lmao   Well, the official Ben G account tweeted at moreconsole.

Now I wanna know what he said   Mod me u dank slut   Quidditch world cup would be nice to see. To check out all the nationalities. Especially american wizards...   Redheads are always winning   Do you want to know why? Nothing is mutually exclusive as to why they are moving. The answer isn't to literally force them to stay with legislation. It would make the issue worse.   Has to be a nice one. Not some neckbeard shit from walmart   Do you want to lose US business? Because this is how you lose US business   Is his beginner program for muscle and weight building worth it? I saw it on YT and seemed solid. But I wasn't sure   Yeah, Bungie had this weird thing where they had tiers for the legitimacy of their canon. It went: games, books/comics, then advertising. So they had no problem throwing away the book for the game.   He seems to be enjoying himself   Wait bro, it just appeared there!? Nobody put it there?    Yeah. But that look (albeit slightly different) had looked badass for a hundred years. The faggy mullet was just an 80s thing, just like the bieber cut was a 2000s thing.   Bellatrix on point.   These are beyond badass   That's pretty sweet   Gears of Halo Theft Auto 5   Honestly, half the guys on here think their appearance is the reason they aren't getting girls. Unless you are a 1 and have horrible personal hygiene, it's probably your mindset and attitude.    Would date   You're definitely not ugly.    Great eyes. But need better pic   I think you're really cute.   Reach has 25k tops. Impressive, but it's not that high   Yeah, clearly that's Kevin Bacon   That's awesome   Best candidate in the race at the moment. He signals a wave of change for the party as it stands.    Well.... DID IT WORK!?   Most certainly.    I'll vote for him over fucking Hilary.    Well, America did do that.   Solid 8.   I always figured he was the guy that founded the S4's. Not sure though   Shit. That was my pre-halo game.   All. No two ways about it.   All   - Ben: But I.. - Sully: Glassed planets have bad records - Ben: found people.. - Sully: GLASSED PLANETS - Ben: That.. - Sully: GGAAAAALLLLAAASSSSED PLAAANNEETS.   fuck Ben we've been over this. Shit   Seriously. Fuck this bitch. Even if you're a democrat. You shouldn't vote for her. Reminds of season 1  2 Claire underwood.   Communism.   I think it's the dude you play as in that Nintendo game where you smash pots.   Dislike haircut. Everything else on point   He emailed 343 to confirm it   He emailed 343 to confirm it's legitimacy   I am buying it. I'm just saying..   Should have put an option for non buyers.    That's hilarious   First pic is the best. Brings out dem big eyes. What you're worried about isn't a big deal.   Yo hmu sometime. You're super pretty and your eyes go great with your hair. Fuckin love redheads.   Brah you fine   Not ugly   Official twitter for reference: https://twitter.com/22052124e?s=09         You can find it on YouTube   Stop. Just stop.    Redheads. Yes.   Yeah, us. I'm hoping halo 5 has a file share system, and a quality theater system that doesn't rely on that fucking upload app.   I miss reach in general. NBNS MLG settings are EASILY the best of the series.   THAT THEREZ A KEEPER.    Hagrid and his dad   I like it. I accept it   I'd feel horrible if my sibling got a letter and I didn't. I'd be like "good for you"     Fuck   Please explain more.    I laughed. Wtf even is that   Honestly, start watching videos on tips, tricks, callouts. Start playing in PGL ladders. Sign up on their site and work your way up   - Forge world  - Target locator  - Pelican   I want spartan ops back. It didn't go well because they did it so cheaply, mixed it with firefight, and never released a new season. If they actually had good environments, more seasons and made it a legitimate episodic campaign with seasonal storylines from around the universe. It would be the greatest thing ever   And people still trust the government to control the internet. Lmao   I enjoy his views on this. But on /r/futurology. There was discussion of him talking about a "guaranteed basic income"    Yeah, I've died multiple times because I accidentally scoped in on the sword. I was thoroughly embarrassed.    Unjerk. I got into a debate on r/halo about it. The thread about stop saying halo is dead. And I mentioned this exact video and got called on it. When people, especially YouTubers do this, it hurts halo.   GOD DAMIT. I didn't really want her involved.   Edit: Damn. I got negged to shit. They killed her off in halo 4 in an epic way. It would be cheap to bring her back and make the whole reason chief went AWOL, and by extension Locke's mission about cortana. So we're going to spend  that whole campaign hunting chief or playing as chief......   for cortana. Come on. That's so cheap and predictable   Is this official? It looks like cortana or...   Yeah. Classically liberal is close to libertarianism. But liberal doesn't have the same connotation anymore.   Pertaining to MCC. They do deserve the criticism. But at this point its beating a dead horse. Going on about it at this point does nothing. They put their name on games like spartan assault, MCC, and others because they are the franchise. This doesn't mean they focused on it while taking away from the main project.  I wouldn't say their priorities are broken. They had a very specific timeframe to release things with two completely separate teams. Plus, they needed to have enough time to implement beta feedback. Why delay the beta and put that project at risk because of MCC. To many chefs in the kitchen isn't a good thing. And the overwhelming majority at 343 are on h5.  343 aren't the ones working on ODST and relic. Saber and certain affinity are the ones on that. They didn't even start ODST until after release.  They released Forge Island based on feedback, changed in game H4 settings for feedback, H5 is being changed based on feedback. They are listening to the general consensus on things  343 is a competent company. Only real fuck up this gen was MCCs release. Everything else has been fine. It's just that Dobbins is beating a dead horse. 343 knows that MCC had a shitty release and they know people disliked h4; they've heard it a million times. At this point it adds nothing to discussion and Dobbins perpetuates this attitude toward halo that doesn't help.   No, his anger and frustration are what is needed for 343 to get their head out of their wallets and realize what people want. It's the ignorance of so many people like yourself that just assume 343 is going to pull through when their record shows they have failed at everything they have done before.   Halo 4, fail. Did they alter anything quickly to fix the problems, hell no, they were focused on MCC. MCC, fail. Have they altered and patched the problems accordingly, no. They have taken their time because the majority of their team is on Halo 5.  You assume that they fully developed MCC. It makes no sense to take people off halo 5 to work on MCC. None at all. Plus you assume they could have just altered some shit and and it would have been all hunky dory.  Now with that track record, the only record 343 has with games, what makes you think H5 is going to be any different? Dobbins and others who criticize them, like myself, don't wish for Halo to fail, but want people to stop accepting and promoting 343 to just keep doing what they are doing. All he is saying is don't listen to this bullshit 'Locke vs. Chief' hype and pre-order or buy this game before you know what you're getting.   You assume people dont know what they're getting, even though they've played a beta that they enjoyed. One that ran more smooth than MCC. Criticism is fine. Making click bait circle jerk titles like "you hate halo if you pre-order halo 5" is not.  Look at it this way, Bungie took 3 years to produce each of their 4 games from Halo CE to Reach, 343 will have produced 3 games in 3 years with DLC already in the works prior to H5 release. Priorities have been set for 343 and it's worth betting that they have not learned from their mistakes with the way things have been going  You straight up assume 343 has hands on developed every halo title. They had other studios do them while they focused on the main title at hand (H5) You also assume they have DLC in development. The MCC dlc is being done by separate companies while 343 is focused on H5. They still stick to the 3 year dev cycle.  You also assume 343 hasn't done anything right. Even though we have HCS, good lore, and had a well received beta.   You also seem to assume they aren't listening to any feedback, even though they have the feedback program and made a halo 5 update post where they flat out implemented community feedback. Just because they aren't listening to *your* feedback, and dobbins. Doesn't mean they aren't listening.   Dobbins really is leading an overreacted crusade against nothing. And hurting halo in the process.   You're making a lot of assumptions there   At least that was black and white. Shoot the big blargy aliens. It was an epic struggle.   But if the UNSC and humanity are flung into a legitimate civil war, the floods possible return, Halsey/Jul with the Janus Key, and covie religion making a comeback. I'd say that's pretty bad. But I doubt it'll happen   I'm calling it now. At the end of the series, Ben gets offed after he releases his info. The UNSC and humanity descend into complete chaos as ONI lies are revealed    The competitive scene won't die in halo 5. Plus, a huge amount of people enjoy the game.    Think about it bro. A legitimate inter UNSC civil war, covies and Halsey getting ahold of the Janus key hellbent on revenge and a flood return.   - HCS is rising and the competitive scene is beginning to rise again - Lore has been handled wonderfully with books, comics, and merch. - Halo is gaining more content creators, YouTubers, and fan sites. Compared to the dying of Reach and 4 - Halo 5 is looking extremely promising so far. From a story perspective and MP - MCC is functional, 343 is working around the clock to bring the next TU. - no longer is this sub and every halo forum filled with anti 343 circle jerk. We are seeing discussion, awesome clips and more.   Halo isn't dad. We just have to accept that halo isn't the top dog mainstream game anymore. And work to be a friendly community newcomers want to be apart of.    Dobbins posted a video called "if you pre order halo 5 you hate halo" the thumbnail was "do you hate halo?" And he acts like he's in some fucking crusade to save halo by bashing it.  His intentions may be good, but perpetuating halo hate is undeniably bad for the franchise. The comments on that video were just a huge circlejerk that said fuck 343.    I'm referring to this generation.  	107

 It exists, and it has one reader. Awesome.   And more importantly, why the hell are they seeing mine? I really don't need the melodramatic song lyric I was quoting as a high school freshman shuffled into everyone's perception of who I am now. Who the fuck thought this was a good idea?   [*Synecdoche, New York*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9PzSNy3xj0)   Yup!   If this works reliably, it could be great. Big if though.      Yes.      The worst part is that I refuse to stop when it starts snowing again. Sweet sweet delusions.   You know what's cooler than a gagillion? A frafrillion.   Even though I'm worlds away from Synder on policy, I really did like the way he ran his campaign--hell, I still do. He wasn't peddling any of that socially backward anti-intellectual Republican bullshit, he was selling himself as a "tough nerd," playing up his intelligence and business savvy. While I was at odds with nearly every element of his platform, it felt like this was at last a noble conservative movement that I could engage with intellectually.  Now this shit.   Awesome, thanks!   Well, it seems as though we're both willing to be big supporters of somebody's movement--alas, I'm no politician. Too many compromising photos.  To be quite frank, I'm not much of a patriot either. Michigan is a beautiful state with a terrible government and an even worse economy. If it doesn't offer me a future, then I have the blessing of my family and friends to seek fulfillment elsewhere, just as I would wish for them. There's some sentimental regret in that, but so be it.   Fair enough. Give me a time and a place, 32koala--I'm based in Lansing and I'll show for a protest. I don't know that demonstration will hold much sway with an administration that doesn't recognize locally elected officials, and when nothing changes I'll be out, but I really am down to put in some good faith effort before cynically taking off as I fully expect to.   Yup, I have quite a few friends who were taken in by that "twelve point plan." He just didn't mention that Part 11 is taking emergency power and Part 12 is building the death star.   Exactly. Not scared, because I can leave. Pissed off because I'll have to.   This is one of those rare internet moments where somewhat perfectly articulates a widely applicable and wholly rational point of view that *had somehow never occurred to me before*. You have a small legacy in my worldview, Lochmon.   Wasn't familiar with that Ok Go track, but it's pretty sweet. Well done Rock Band.   awesome      It's true. I weave mounds and mounds of lame, lame bullshit, and then I gather all my friends around to congratulate me. There is merriment and feasting, laughter and song, and for one brief moment I feel... *human.*   No, Egodeath, I don't. I was trying to figure out why you were running an annoying joke predicated on your unsupported sense of superiority into the ground, and I figured that in the absence of any approval from those seeking discussion here, you might have a private audience of people who favor pointless snark over interpersonal engagement--turns out it's just you, super. I believe that's called "trolling," right?  Predicated: founded or based on.   Well hey, you genuinely expanded my perspective on post-modernism. I'll call that a good day for Reddit.   Oh sorry man--Explicated: made explicit. Didn't mean to go all verbose on you with that one word.  Actually, I hope that doesn't ruin all the fun you're having. When you gather your friends around the monitor to show them how cute you've been, they might raise their eyebrows at your characterization of my post as verbose--trs embarrassing.   Neofaust, I'll preface this comment by saying you're probably better versed in this stuff than I am and that I will likely cave under the slightest amount of pressure, but it doesn't make sense to me that post-modernism can somehow eschew definable "essence" and yet claim so many self-identified post-modernists--perhaps not so much in serious literature, mind you, but around the campus so to speak. Kids identify as "post-modernists," they're largely united around criticism of truth and obsession with constructs... couldn't we call that the movement?  Personally, I enjoyed the submission because I can relate to the author's frustration: I'm sick of arguing that logic is not only the best interpretation of reality, but it's a prerequisite of any arguments against itself. I think science should be a component of art and vice versa, and am sick of their increased "post-modern" segregation. I'm frustrated with the arguments I'm getting from my English department full of undergrads *calling* themselves post-modernists, so isn't indulging a parody of these trends somewhat justified?  I guess the question is--and maybe you can help me on this Neofaust--do I have a beef with post-modernism, or with "post-modernists?" I think I agree with you on what post-modernism *should* be--a transitional nebula of modernism criticisms--but it's being organized, revered, and evangelized by a certain social strata of trendy youngsters and it's irritating. And ultimately, I'm pretty sure that's what this Jenny Jones submission was about: this label is a source of pride and identity for many, and yet it's not much of a movement at all.    I mean, you can either choose to engage with the discussion or not, but calling it *lame,* perhaps literally the most shallowly trite of all possible dismissals, certainly looks like a defense mechanism. I'm not trying to psychoanalyze and I'm not saying I know anything about you or that *you* are shallow or whatnot, I'm just saying that I'd love to see your reservations better explicated.   Jesus. Yes. Thank you.   Comedy works when it addresses truth. If a joke is genuinely reinforcing misogyny or racism or other baseless bigotry, then it's not only unacceptable but probably not all that funny. If a joke is crafted to deal frankly and/or critically with the presence and absurdity of such hatred in society, then nothing is off limits.

Does anyone have any insight as to how one might approximate that distinctly "film" look when using consumer grade HD digital--I'm thinking plugins and processing software, though shooting techniques are also welcome. Thoughts?   Does anyone have any insight as to how one might approximate that distinctly "film" look when using consumer grade HD digital--I'm thinking plugins and processing software, though shooting techniques are also welcome. Thoughts?   I sure hope not. I happen to think that all of this lovely post-modern thought shoots itself in the brain and dies when it divorces philosophy from the real and rational.   When I say I respect someone's opinion, I'm generally saying that the logic of their opinion is at least least internally consistent, even if I might disagree with the likelihood/ethics of their premises.   *Portal 2*, my PC sucks and I don't have a next-gen.

The writer is saying that beyond objectively appreciable gameplay elements, Dead Space 2 transcends the sum of its parts to succeed as an engaging work of game art, thus necessitating acknowledgement of the critic's subjective position. Accepting that the game works on that level and was presumably intended to, the author clearly states his intention to address the game primarily in terms of impact, as is common practice in film and literary criticism. The author chooses to do so in his own voice: this likely precludes the review from consideration for traditional print journalism as it ignores established journalistic conventions--the ignorance willful and the conventions largely arbitrary, mind you--but it's perfectly suited to the author's intent. The more one explores a variety of authorial styles through criticism of multiple media, the less strange this choice will seem. Ya snob.   It is a "comment" on the sudden wave of uninformed writing criticism, one I felt would work best in the same format as the trend I was addressing: a submission about writing.   (before edit) This really has nothing to do with gaming.  Well, it has about as much to do with gaming as the line by line red pen critiques popping up. It's more to do with the nature of game criticism, and that seems to be hot right now.  As for the propriety of posting it as its own submission, I think this perspective merits as much space as the condescending review edits.   Yes, middle schoolers use a bunch of "I" statements and acknowledge themselves as writers. And then you get to high school and they tell you not to. And then you become an adult and you write in your own damn voice.  Yes, that seems strange to high schoolers. Clearly. But acknowledging one's subjective position and focusing on impact over summary doth not bad criticism make.   I don't think that Cartesian skepticism necessarily endorses the cognitive *over* the physical, it merely accepts consciousness as our necessary starting point. The existence of the doubter could just as easily be physical as metaphysical; the main point is the potentially physical but quite definitely subjective nature of the mind.   Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww   Good and evil are human constructs, but they're real and valuable constructs nonetheless.   the trick is... is that conclusion false?

I feel like people aren't talking about this film's style enough.

 Joseph Ferdinand Gould (12 September 1889  18 August 1957)[1] was an American eccentric, also known as Professor Seagull. Often homeless, he pretended to be the author of the longest book ever written, an Oral History of the Contemporary World (or Oral History of Our Time). He inspired the book Joe Gould's Secret (1965) and its film adaptation (2000), as well as being a character in the 2009 computer game The Blackwell Convergence.  Interesting read.     	2
 To read what happened before now, go here. (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3cw6dx/i_think_someone_is_stalking_me_please_help/)  Thank you to those who commented some suggestions last night when I posted my dilemma. I wasnt familiar with memory gaps, but I can assure you I have no mental health discrepancies and something like this has never happened before. I just figured I should keep whoevers reading this updated. Things have gotten worse.  I barely got any sleep last night. It took me a while to type out what was happening, and the entire time I couldnt shake the feeling that I was being watched. I closed my drapes and closet doors so that there were no peepholes into my bedroom, but I couldnt lose that eerie feeling that seemed to hang over me, weighing me down. Early this morning, I decided the best thing to do would be to talk to campus security. Like a couple of you had suggested, I figured that occurrences like this had to be somewhat common, or at least not completely foreign.   I walked down to the station with the photograph in hand. I tried my best to explain to the police officer what had happened, but he regarded my situation with little interest. He speculated that I may have gotten too drunk to remember this Ez guy, and that one of my roommates had put the photo in my room. As Im sure you could imagine, his answers were far from settling. I insisted that he look at the hallway camera videos from the past couple of days to see if anyone had snuck in to plant the photograph. Begrudgingly, he did. We watched a time-lapse video of everything that went on in my hallway and outside my dorm room from the last 48 hours, and to my demise, nothing seemed especially odd. I saw my roommates come in and out, sometimes bringing food or friends with them. The only thing that miffed me was my own patterns. According to the video, on the evening of July 9th (two days ago), I didnt come back to my dorm until 4:30 AM. I know I went to a party that night, but I dont remember staying out that late. I guess I hadnt really kept track of the time. It tends to fly when youre having a good time.  After finishing the video, Campus Patrol guy was even less interested in my claims. He shooed me away and told me to come back if anything else happened, but not to worry about it right now. Quite obviously, this didnt solve anything. I kept asking what else I could do, or who else I could talk to, and he finally suggested that I talk to Mr. Stoltz, the head of the Anthropology department, about the camping trip I had heard so much about. Luckily, Stoltz was still on campus for the weekend to help students with coursework. I rushed to his office to see what information he could provide. As soon as he saw me, he said Oh, Sunny! What a pleasure to see you! After the trip, I was starting to worry you would never come and visit me. How have you been? Hearing Sunny freaked me out no less than it had when others had said it. I calmly tried to explain what was happening, and I showed him the photograph with the scribbled-out face. He kept giving me these puzzled expressions, and opened up his laptop to show me more photos from the trip. Sure enough, there she was. Gripping a hulking backpack. Setting up a tent with other students. Throwing a fishing line into a lake. I assured him it wasnt me, it couldnt be me, there was no way I was a part of that trip. As I talked, I could hear myself starting to sound more and more crazed. After my ranting, he stood up and put a hand on my shoulder. He said something like, Summer, Im not really sure whats going on, but I think it may be good if you went back to your dorm and got some rest. Maybe then youll start to see things more clearly. I left feeling even worse.  I went back to my dorm room. I really didnt want to get my mom involved, worried I would scare her too much. But I figured she was one of my last options. Ive called her over and over, but it seems shes been busy. Im praying shell call me back soon. I want to go home. I want to go home so badly.  Ive been in my dorm all day, worried to go outside. Call me paranoid, but all of this is too much for me to take in. I know Im safe in here, and I know that no one else can get in without a key card. But guys, while I was typing this I got this email and Im freaking out. I think Im losing it. This is the message I just got.  sunny, i bet you thought i wouludnt find out. i bet you thought that dumbass wouldnt spill. but im not stupid and neithher are u. i kno what u did to heather nd ur nothng but a sckanky whore sunny so dont think ull get away u messed with a bad bitch sunny and dont think ull get out of this easy. dont bother watching for me im coming when you dont expect it. your gonna wished you never screwed me over sunnyy  It came from this jumbled-up email, and when I searched it on Google it said it no longer exists. Im so scared, and this Ez guy, hes been calling me all day, and Im too terrified to answer. He keeps sending these texts urging me to call him but I just cant. Im blocking his number. Im freaking out. I dont know what to do. Im terrified. Whoever this girl is, shes done something really wrong, and I dont know how to convince people that she isnt me. Im terrified. Please help me, please help me please help me please  	1
 Not sure read it on a few sites a while back. I think it's supposed to offend the ghost... either because it's afraid of god or is bitter that it found out there was no god once it died.  My ghost just literally noped out of that question    If you added in some mundane parts of us at a strip club, at the firing range and getting drunk you could probably space the entire thing into a 90 minute indie movie yes    Plot twist: later found out there was a guy named John Slaughter who was historically significant in the area. Someone pointed this one the first time I posted the story.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Horton_Slaughter   spirits and god have nothing to do with eachother other than that neither one is proven to exist.  I think you can believe in one without the other.   there is no logical explanation for a car console closing on its own.  Logic would tell you that some unseen force did it... whether that be the combined psychic power of 4 focused people or a spirit... who knows.  Can't think of any known scientific explanation for it... but I think the paranormal is science that has been neglected study due to stigma and the inability to reproduce consistent results... which is the crux Of validity in the science community.  can you reproduce the same behavior results over and over talking to a person who knows you want consistency and fucks with you?  Exactly   I'd like to know how to get my writing maximum exposure. I'm more interested in feedback and people enjoying it than I am money but I'd love to quit my job as well so there's that    Someon Brought this dude up the last time I posted the story. Gave me chills   Looks like green getting "*triggered* without *warning*" wooshed over everyone too.  It's all true don't get me wrong, but I couldn't resist throwing in some dank easter eggs   I would argue its no different than breaking bad or game of thrones.... eventually when the stories done you keep the site up and make a new booksite. it's like an interactive ebook that is regularly updated    I don't think it's an ultimatum... otherwise no sites with content would make money. I have an online magazine right now that earns money but the articles are not fiction/stories.   Traffic = money. Has anyone ever considered self publishing a book that way? You could illustrate the site with a wiki all kinds of resources on it etc, and could actively gauge interest and get feedback.   /r/just90sthings   We left a few, part rubber and part shit!   In nosleep yes. It's a true story though so I posted it here too   Well THAT'S just *nasty*   What's your take on why we got away? Did we really outsmart it or did it let us live?  Also do you agree that they obviously have mathematical limits on their range, etc?   Nothing about the air or any of my senses stood out.  The surrealness of it all made me jittery with a pit in my stomach so that sensation corrupted me from being an accurate barometer of the environment.   I've had quite a few, and I would love to but I don't have any friends to go with me :(   Because it's the military, we address eachother by last name. Thomson learned it via a conversation I had with him at one point, but most soldiers don't often bring up their first names.  I suppose they could have seen it on a sign in roster or something, so it's possible they knew it, but not likely.   Season was fall I believe.  No smells or sounds that stood out as abnormal.  I remember the first spirit responded pretty quickly, and the second one seemed very labored and took a while to respond.   Not in this experience, but in other experiences I felt dizzy.   Nope, I was there for my AIT and left. Only lived in AZ for 10 months. What did you want to know?   I did originally, but it's not bullshit. 100% true.  Was it a ghost? Ideomotor? Hallucination? Prank? Not sure, but regardless of the cause, everything happened and I'm willing to answer any questions anyone has on it.   I wanted to start out by saying this story is completely  true. I posted in in /r/nosleep before, and while I've written fiction there as well, I stand by everything in this story as 100% fact.  Do I believe everything that happened actually happened? Not necessarily, Im as skeptical as you will be, and I welcome any explanation as to how the events that occurred were not supernatural. It could have been an elaborate prank on behalf of my friends, but there are several reasons why I find that hard to believe. Mass hysteria maybe? Who knows, anyway here is the story:  I enlisted in the Army in 2009, and had my AIT (Advanced Individual Training) in Fort Huachuca, AZ.   Pretty much any soldier stationed at Fort Huachuca (often nicknamed Fort We-Gotcha) has above average intelligence. Most of the MOSes require a very high ASVAB score. Needless to say, the friends I made were a unique bunch, many of us gaming nerds.   Huachuca is about 20 minutes from the Mexican border and about 40 minutes from the infamous Tombstone, AZ.   One day we were bored and swapping ghost stories. One of my buddies bought a Ouija board at Walmart for us to play around with. Well call him Jackson to protect his identity. Im not sure Jackson believed in the supernatural, but when your disposable income to free time ratio is skewed horribly in the wrong direction, you buy stupid shit to entertain yourself with.  Jackson and I attempted to use the Ouija board in our barracks as the base is extremely old and rife with hauntings. Unfortunately, the barracks we had recently moved to were brand new, so the Ouija didnt work.  Tired of strip clubs and flirting with the Mexican border, we hungered for a unique adventure. I brought up the idea of travelling to nearby Tombstone. Jackson lit up when I mentioned this as he had just heard a story of a haunted house in Tombstone he wanted to check out. We came to a quick, ghost-hunting consensus and invited our buddy Thomson along for the ride.  We arrived at tombstone shortly after dark. It was not quite how I expected it. I had pictured a literal ghost town, with a few dilapidated Wild West buildings and the obligatory tumbleweed blowing through the street.  This was not the case at all. Even at night its basically a normal town with a few historical buildings and tourist traps. In addition to the downtown stretch, they have a residential area just like any other small town in America. It was in this residential area that we began hunting for the supposed haunted house. We got to the area we thought it was in, but werent sure which house it was. After a few minutes of circling the block, the group decided to take a break to piss.  Everyone went a separate direction to pee, but I could not find a place private enough so I didnt go. I was the second person back in the car. I climbed into the backseat and asked Jackson Wheres Thomson?   I dont know, hes been gone for a while, Ill text him said Jackson.  All of a sudden, Thomson (looking whiter than he normally does) comes sprinting towards the car, and frantically tries to open the passenger door. Jackson calmly unlocks the door, and lets him in and asks  What happened?  Dude, youre not going to believe this shit Thomson gasped.  His southern drawl tightened like a cello string,  I was in this house that looked abandoned right, so I go in and look around, and decide to have a smoke. I look down at my phone to text you guys and tell you about it when all of a sudden something touched my shoulder!  Holy shit, what was it? I asked.  Nothing, there was nothing there. I sprinted back to the car  Pumped with curiosity and stupidity, I suggested we go full Mystery Machine and park in a nearby lot and use the Ouija board from inside the car.  As soon as we could get parked (roughly half a block away) we anxiously pulled out the Ouija board and put it in our laps.  As the person designated to ask questions, I began:  Is there anyone there?  To my disbelief, the planchette starting moving. It slowly but surely moved towards YES.  Were you the thing that touched Thomson?  YES it replied again.  Are you the ghost in the haunted house we were going to visit?  NO it answered.  Now this is what took me by surprise. If this was one of the others trying to scare us, why wouldnt they take the obvious bait? Claim to be the ghost we saw and commence scaring the shit out of us. I mean, thats like a Nigerian scammer writing you about your long lost fortune, and then responding no when you ask if hes able to give you $6 million instead of $5.5 million.  At this point, I had a flashback of just about every creepy Ouija experience I had ever seen or read about. They always started with some clich questions like lol how did u die and ended with OMFG and a flurry of telekinetic activity. I wanted this session to be different. After all, we were a handpicked bunch of intelligent people, not a group of scared teenagers. If this was real, I wanted this specter to break history with me.  So I took a moment and started thinking, what would I want to know about a ghost? What questions can I ask that arent clich? What can I ask that will break the linear decision tree where all Ouija boards end up telling you they want you dead?  I realized any questions I asked had to be extremely specific, and offer no chance for creepy deviation in the answer. I suppose I could ask it for the coefficient of Pi, and it could just respond with die bitch over and over, but I had faith in the ghost.  So the first question I asked was:  Name one thing the building you touched Thomson in was used for.  The planchette slowly started to move again. HA! I thought to myself, this thing cant possibly get creepy from this question. I bet it will say like General Store, or Post Office, or  S L A U G H T E R  Pucker factor 9. Good game ghost, have an upvote I guess.   But seriously, I again realized this was probably not one of us joking around because slaughter has not been used as a common term since the 1800s. You dont log on to CNN and see Man slaughtered today in small house in Arizona, details at 11. If my friends were pulling a prank, the easiest verb would have been something like Murder or Buttsex.  Intrigued, I decided to ask it why it touched Thomson.  H E L P it replied.  Thinking this would lead somewhere creepy, I asked when it died instead.  1 8 6 7   I again started thinking of questions I could ask that no one ever thinks to ask a ghost. I remember hearing on some website that you are NEVER supposed to ask a Ouija board about God. So I did the only logical thing an Atheist would do at that point:  Why arent I supposed to ask you about God?  NO came a terse reply.  So I tried to be more creative, I asked it:  If you were playing World of Warcraft, what class would you play?  Its gonna say Undead Warlock, I guarantee i.  NO it snapped again.   It was weird, despite being an entity that couldnt directly talk to us, you could almost sense its tone of voice through how it moved the planchette.  I wanted to continue asking it questions, but our First Sergeant interrupted the session with a frantic phone call. He ordered all of us back to base for 100% accountability due to someone losing their weapon. Disappointed, we packed up and headed back.   The next day we were telling the others in our platoon about our experience the night before. After many bullshit and eyerolls, another soldier named Green showed interest. We decided to try to talk to the ghost again and take Green with us. He had an SUV which would give us more room to set up the board.  As a soldier, my first instinct was not only to plan our arrival and departure time, but safety contingencies as well. This was especially on my mind after the previous night. I briefed the group in advance that if anything creepy happened, we were better off with a pre-identified plan on what to do so as to take the spirits by surprise. Our ghost hunting SOP was as follows:  At approximately 2000 hours we will depart for Tombstone. This will allow us to arrive after dark. We will take two vehicles: Greens SUV and Jacksons coupe. Jackson and Thomson will ride in the coupe, while Green and I will ride in the SUV.   *We will set up our session in the SUV so as to allow for a quick departure if anything spooky happens.  *We will leave any weapons or sharp objects back at the base. Spirits can only harm others by proxy. If there are no objects around to throw (or possess someone into using), then the only physical danger will be soiling our underwear.  *In the event of one of us feeling creeped out beyond belief, or an impending sense of doom, we will give an obvious signal to the others to quickly pack up and leave. Each soldier will return to the vehicle they traveled in and take off back to the Base. Upon leaving the scene, the vehicles will immediately establish contact via cell phone to ensure safety and share in a moment of Holy shit what the fuck just happened.  So it was settled. We had our plan and were feeling confident. The undead were no match for Arizonas finest soldiers.  We parked in the same lot we had the night before and eagerly took out our Ouija board. There were four of us now and we were feeling confident, but I wont lie if I told you that I was jittery as fuck. Literally everything I knew about life and the universe at this point was challenged by what we had seen the previous night. I felt like the equivalent of someone who discovers a six inch tall genie in their closet that only they can talk to. It literally felt surreal, like a movie.  Green was especially nervous about being with us as he was raised Catholic. Though he was no longer religious, he still had that strongly ingrained fear of Ouija boards. Green opted to just spectate as we placed the planchette on the board. There were three of us controlling it.  We started by asking if anyone was there, and received a very slow, strained YES  I asked if it was the same being we talked to the previous night, and it said NO  Going off the same theme as last night, I wanted to mindfuck the ghost. I did not want to give it the opportunity to be creepy, and I wanted it to answer questions no one would think to ask.  I wanted to expose the ghosts vulnerabilities. As of now, the ghost was this mysterious all powerful being. However, as any logical person knows, the paranormal is just science not yet discovered.   The ghost MUST have limits I thought. It isnt God and therefore has things it cannot do, things it cannot have. So I had the bright idea to ask:  What is one thing you want that you cannot have?  L I F E it answered.  I wasnt sure whether to feel like an ass, idiot or both.   Before I could decide between shame and stupidity, the interior light in Greens (brand new) SUV flickered.  Holy. Fucking. Shit. That doesnt just happen. The only time Ive ever seen a light flicker in a car was when it was being started. This was getting a little too real. This spirit was alpha, and it was asserting its ethereal dominance.  After regaining my composure I began to brainstorm more questions.    Youve been askin it all the questions, let me give it a try Thomson contested me.  Fine, go ahead I said.  What do you want from us? he asked, in his defiant Georgia accent.  S T E V  Dude theres no fucking way.. I thought to myself   My name is Steven and all, but there is no  E N  At this point I was terrified. No one there knew my first name but Thomson. Also, the planchette was moving in a puppeted fashion, *away* from Thomson when it spelled it out. The best way I could describe it was an invisible thread, straight from the front of the car pulling the planchette, based on how it twisted and turned. There was no one in the front of the car.  Before I could even react, the center console which was about five inches ajar, closed by itself. I calmly invoked our military plan of action:  Ok guys, it just spelled out my first name. Lets get the fuck out of here  No one said a word or hesitated for a second. Thomson and Jackson scrambled out of the SUV and into Jacksons Eclipse. Green and I piled into the front seat of the SUV. Green immediately shifted to drive and peeled out of the dusty lot. Im not sure a Ford Escape has ever been used in such a literal fashion.  Green was in shock and so was I. My Atheist brain was questioning if God might actually be real and Greens devout brain was pondering the opposite. Our trance was broken by Greens Alt-Rock ringtone. It was surreal hearing pop culture in that moment, when our brains were so far removed from reality.  Green answered the phone. It was Jackson and Thomson. Their car wouldnt start! They had never left Tombstone!  Green slams on the brakes and bangs a U turn that would put Vin Diesel in diapers. He floors the modest SUV. We were going about 100 MPH, heading down Arizona 82 back towards Tombstone.  Dude slow the fuck down I yelled.   At this point I was far more afraid of Greens driving than the spirits.  THEYRE OUR FUCKING FRIENDS, WE CANT LEAVE THEM THERE  We knew the general direction back to Tombstone and arrived rather quickly. Tombstone isnt as tiny as youd imagine, and we couldnt quite remember where we had parked at. As I am trying to figure out where we are, Green freaks the fuck out.  OH MY GOD  What dude?  I CANTIM NOT DRIVIN THE CAR ANYMORE  What the fuck are you talking about?  I CANT MOVE  As if it couldnt get any more frightening, I realized in the middle of Greens outburst that we had inadvertently ended up at the parking lot we left!  Im always trying to think logically, so I deduced the following.  At this point, two things are possible:  1. Green is possessed by a butthurt ghost who basically told me to check my living privilege. 2. Green is experiencing a psychotic breakdown.  Either one of those is a threat to our safety at this point, so I just started shouting at him with simple commands. If he was possessed or simply psychotic, simple instructions were the best course of action.  GREEN STOP THE CAR  GREEN STOP THE CAR  GREEN STOP THE CAR  I ordered in a commanding voice.  Eventually, logic and reason fought off whatever had possessed him and he pulled over. I switched seats with him and began driving. Right after I took over driving, Jackson called and let us know they were safe, and about 10 miles down the road towards base.      Green was still in a trance, but once we got about a quarter mile from ground zero, whatever triggered him without warning originally had left. This leads me to believe that if ghosts are real, they have the effective possession range of a quarter mile.   Throughout the ride, we struggled to comprehend what had happened that night. Green told me that he could tell the ghost wanted me, and that it was telling him to drive down an alley, but that he came to his senses in time. He said it wanted me bad, and it wanted him to kill me. It probably would have had him attack me before we left, but our pre-meditated escape took it by surprise, so it stalled Jackson's car to lure us back.  I asked him why it didnt just kill me itself, and he told me Probably because Im bigger than you and more emotional. You think very logically, youre a lot harder for a spirit to manipulate. Plus I was in control of the car. This made sense, and was pretty chilling to think about. If the spirit had succeeded, it would have simply hit the news as Soldier murders other soldier in Tombstone. PTSD suspected. I imagine thats the case when you hear about mothers spontaneously drowning their children in a bathtub, or other inexplicable murder suicides. Its probably a ghost or spirit, but gets blamed on psychosis.  About halfway back to base we stopped at a gas station. Green, still not *completely* in his right mind, opened the hatch of his SUV, took out a sunshade that came with his car and threw it in the dumpster.   What did you do that for?  I dont know, it just felt evil. Really evil he answered.  That was the final straw on how real this was. It really drove in how much this was probably not an elaborate prank. Why would he go to the extent of throwing away an expensive OEM part of his car to freak me out when I was already emotionally exhausted?  To this day I am still an Atheist, but I do wonder about the paranormal, as it could very well be science not yet discovered. I would imagine that communicating with a spirit is the equivalent of trying to talk to an invisible man in the room, who cannot touch anything. His only way of communicating is holding a portable fan, and blowing paper suspended by a string from the ceiling. He blows it right for yes and left for no. I imagine this is why they communicate in such slow and brief answers.  I did a little more research on the location and posted a map and pictures for you guys below.  Ironically, we were in the parking lot for the OK Corral, the famous haunted location where the outlaws had their shootout in the 1800s. From what I can gather, the gunfight happened well after 1867, but keep in mind we talked to two separate spirits. I cant help but wonder if the second one was one of them.  Map showing key points of interest: http://imgur.com/twnP7r2  Streetview of the parking lot we were in: http://imgur.com/L2guyXG  Also, I have heard of the ideomotor effect, so if you would like to help me come up with logical explanations for what happened, keep in mind I am aware of that and it does not explain the light flickering and the console moving. I am also aware of Occams razor, and would welcome a shave at this point as I think it would save my sanity.   So please Reddit, convince me Im crazy.  TLDR: Used a Ouija board in a ghost town, asked it all the wrong questions, friend got possessed.               	23

If you've ever been in a live-action video, you'd probably understand what an uncomfortable experience it is. You have these bright lights on you, a camera pointing at you, a microphone dangling over your position, people behind the camera watching, and an audience in the future will be viewing your every move expecting to be entertained. The main thing that defines good acting is the ability to put that awkward situation past you and be entertaining or funny or portray a character with emotions.

 http://na.op.gg/summoner/userName=crs%20piglet  (Yes, i know theyre all smurfs, just look at the cs levels)   Oh that's even stupider then!   So will the entire tournament or just the first rounds be on the S5 patch? Either sounds incredibly stupid.   Plz no   Poppy has a 100% win rate in competitive play.  Alistar, Zilean and Maokai were pick or ban at worlds. Renekton and Jax weren't picked once.  Kassadin is finally balanced for competitive play.    He's got a 50% win ratio, many pros have said he's still strong, even competitively viable as a niche pick. He's not as strong as he was before, but he's still in a good place, especially compared to some picks.   Yeah that's what I'll do. The good thing about bronze is that 90% of people have any idea of wave control, so I can just freeze by my turret and end up outcsing him by a large margin. Still annoying though as the only way to guarantee wins as top lane in bronze is by wrecking your lane opponent. Going even doesn't mean anything in an elo where there is often 50/60 kill games.   Irelia top, and I hate darius. Here in bronze, if I pick irelia, I'm guaranteed to have someone 'counterpick' a darius. Like i am not even kidding, the last 10 games I picked irelia, 8 times they picked a darius into me. While I don't feed him, it's still annoying to know you will have 0 impact on the game for a long time. Especially in bronze where teammates are at best unreliable.   Pingu   Jax's E, counterstrike. One of the strongest abilities in the game, but all levelling it up does is add 25 base damage and a slightly lower cooldown to it.   You can't jungle effectively without runes. They make a HUGE difference in the early clears. You will climb so much easier in every role if you get some. They basically give you a free 1000 gold in stats at the start of the game.   AP chogath. You have insane base damages AND ratios. Like your Q is something like 300+ 1AP, your W is 280+ .7AP and your ult is 720+ .7AP true damage! You can bully lane if you play him right, and if you get an early kill you will snowball out of control. Going ROA, Zhonyas, abyssal, etc. will make you fairly tanky, and still able to one shot their carry while chunking the rest of their team if you can land your Q consitently.   Jungle jax shouldn't,  you will already have an extra wars from your flare anyhow, and someone who is as gold dependant as him can't afford to waste that early 800 gold, especially on a junglers income.   It has an amazing splash art, and is IMO the best model of her skins too.    I would go ancient golem over flare on volibear however. The 25% bonus health is huge on him.    That just looks painful    He actually goes only 5% CDR blues, this lets him have 10% at lvl 1 with masteries, and 40% with a frozen heart and spirit visage.   Smokey the volibear   My favorite NA team and my favorite EU team are going. Today is a good day    Jungle jax is actually really good   Cho'gath is actually really good built as an AP bruiser. He has insane ratios (his full combo does more then most assassins) and really good natural tankyness. If you build items like a ROA, Abyssal sceptre, Zhonyas, you can delete squishy targets while still being a decent front line.   I skimmed through most of it, and it looks pretty damn good. The build is a textbook lux build, with plenty of good information too. If you're a new player trying to learn her it is perfect. Don't blindly follow the mobafire hate train, the highly rated guides on it are good nowadays, just be careful for any 'troll' ones.   How do I help carry low elo from top lane. Unless I get stupidly fed it feels like I have 0 impact on the game. There is no dragon fights or wards to tp to to gank, and roaming will just result in my jungler farming wraiths while we dance around mid turret and my laner splitpushing like crazy.    Try to salvage what lane is least behind. There are some games that are just unwinnable though. Even LCS players lose some games when climbing through the lower ranks.   I prefer it like this. It's history   The shiv proc will crit, giving him extra burst, plus it is cheaper, gives him more movement speed, and he can still get 100% crit chance with proper runes.   If you aren't auto attacking as ryze, you are playing him wrong. Especially early on in lane, you can weave several autos into your combo for extra harass.   With riven you should basically all-in him  every time he even looks at a minion. Try to stand in front of his minion wave so he has to walk through you to stack, and your AOE damage won't push the wave that way. Eventually it will reach his turret, but by then he should either be low enough to dive with a jungler, or he should have barely any stacks. Once he starts freezing in front of his turret, or he becomes too tanky to realistically kill, you are free to roam and start snowballing your team while he tries to farm his way out of being a witherbot.   It depends on the jungler, you should rush damage on someone like Kha'zix, but not somebody like Jarvan. (except for an early brut or hex) Vi is a bit strange, as she can be built for both damage and tankyness depending on the team comp and how you're doing.    They just played fusion again, and stomped them. Robert got a penta   Robert, bubba, and prolly were the were the reasons why I liked complexity so much this year. I sure hope they actually want to try to make the lcs with this team, because I will be a fan 100%   Jax. A full build jax can 1v1 99% of the champs in the game, arguably the best splitpusher in the game, and can blow up any squishes in teamfights.   A game I played yesterday, we were down 5 kills to 12 early on. I was 5/0 at the time. It was something like a 0/5/1 orianna, 0/3/2 teemo, 0/3/0 Morgana, 0/2/0 ezreal.    Lux. Lets hope we never watch any comedy movies, or crack any jokes, or anything that makes her laugh.   implying sneaky doesn't 420blaze with Meteos all day   I'm honestly starting to wonder if they are secretly sponsored by chipotle at all. As tasty as it is, no man can physically eat at much as Meteos reportedly does   Anyone have a link to the article?   A hypercarry is usually considered as a champion that during the late game can almost single handedly carry a game due having insane damage, with innate safetyness due to range/tankyness/invulnerability.   Some examples are Jax, Tristana, Ryze, Kog'Maw, Poppy, Tryndamere Nasus. Some debated ones are are Master Yi, , Vayne, Karthus.   There is 0 reason to sell flare on warwick. It synergizes so well with his ult, and by the time it comes around to sell it, it should have enough stacks to make it worth keeping.   Just FYI on why nasus players rush armor, it is because of his passive lifesteal. Let's say he is gaining 50 health per Q, if he has 1000 health he would gain 5% of his life back, but if he has 1500 health, he would gain 3% of his health back. It also makes potions and all of that more effective allowing him to sustain longer in lane.   Usually you want an assassin if there is one or more high priority targets on the other team, that you will reasonably be able to blow up.  You shouldn't pick them against a team with a way of stopping or mitigating your burst (kayle, zilean),    You desperately need to build some tank after your Triforce, or you'll Just get blown up before you can do any damage. A Bork would work as like a last item, and if you ever get to be full build, you should 100% of the time build a Bork to replace your lizard.   And talon   Bronze 1 is actually the best division IMO. Everyone wants to get to silver so they try hard, and everyone knows they're subpar players so there is no flaming.   ADC item changes made hypercarries such as Tristana and Kog'maw very strong in the bottom lane.  There is more of a 'hypertank' meta in top now, notably with Maokai and Alistar. AD nidalee is currently pick or ban status.  Exhaust nerfs, plus a need to eliminate the hypercarries in bot lane have brought back assassins. Talon and Zed are notably strong.  Nerfs to Lee Sin, Evelynn, and Elise have made them less oppressing, but still strong. KhaZix with a W max has made a resurgence.   Just build full tank with a sunfire. When you're fed as Mundo you basically become unkillable, and the enemies have a choice of trying to kill your team and letting you slowly kill them or to focus you and let your damage dealers tear them apart.   Proc is basically a term for activating an effect. Like you proc your guardian angel when you die, or you proc Vaynes silver bolts on her third hit.   It's more of a trade-off. You are guaranteed a safer laning phase, and you can even bully some tanks (excluding Ali), but you also have little kill pressure and less roaming potential. Since Akali is all about roaming and snowballing off kills, I'm personally not a fan of Akali top unless you pick her into a strong matchup   Ask them if they secretly had "the fappening" opened back stage and that was what inspired them to win   I've actually found a ton of recent success with him in the jungle. He has a earlier powerspike then lane Jax with a feral flare+Triforce. He has fairly strong ganks and decent clears, and great sustain (counterstrike basically makes camps do 0 damage, just be careful about running OOM) You need to be careful about early invades (especially pre-3, where you won't be able to ward jump to safety) , but you aren't a sitting duck like Amumu either.   KogMaw OP please nerf rito   Unless you think that you could burst one of them down with a few autos and a E+R combo, just rocket jumping away is the safest choice. Just remember that your strongest points levelwise are 2, 6-8, and then 13+. Itemwise you are the weakest ADC in the game after the first item is completed.   Max your E first, or at minimum put a couple early points in it before you max your Q. This gives you much stronger trading in lane, as a AA-E-AA does pretty decent damage. You aren't going to be needing the extra attack speed much early on, as you shouldn't be doing more then a couple autos in a row in lane.   Also, I find that building a Statiik shiv before an IE can make tough/behind lanes a lot easier. The shiv synergizes so well with your E passive, giving you great wave clear to let you farm easier. With Tristanas weak mid game you won't be duelling anyone anyways, but if you jump on to someone, E in mid air, auto(+shiv proc)  and then ult them away, you have quite high burst early on and can grab you some kills if the opponent is missing some health.   Heres a couple for top.  Poppy has a quite weak laning phase, but has one of the best team fights in the game. A full build poppy is the strongest champion in the game IMO (Excluding unreasonably farmed Nasuses/Sions/Veigars)  Malphite can't do much in lane, but has amazing initiations  Mundo has a weak early game, but becomes an unkillable monster who deals good damage in teamfights.   Jax has trouble early on but then goes into Jax-mode later on.  Nasus is like a poodle at the start but is a Great Dane if he gets reasonable farm.    Hey summonerschool. I play a ton of Evelynn, however recently I have been having some troubles. I usually come of to a great start with her, (my last three games ive been something crazy like 10/0/2, 6/0/4, and 5/1/6 at the end of laning phase) I still have found myself unable to carry. I understand the point of evelynn is to get your laners fed, and that is what i try to do. However, I often find myself just barely killing them as they go under turret, or getting a double kill in a countergank where my laner died, leaving the kills to me instead of my laners.  The problem with this is that if i ever find myself in a position of being the most fed member on my team, I feel useless. I do fine in laning phase and small skirmishes, but as soon as teamfights come im useless. Since I have to be in melee range to do any real damage, i just get CC'd, and bursted down. If I build tanky to counteract this, I wont be able to actually kill anyone.   My usual build order if I'm ahead is Elder Lizard, Mobi boots, Triforce, Randuins, Maw, and a situational item. I'm thinking that building a Maw before a triforce might help, as that will make me less reliant on autos, and give me slightly more survivability during the first teamfights.  (I'm at Silver V, if that makes any difference for anything)     Learning how to turn off your caps lock might help.   Alright, that actually helps a lot, thanks!   You can smite while stunned? TIL! Must just be the fact that they will suddenly panic and focus me, forgetting bout the drag long enough for me to steal.   I'm currently at something like an 80% win rate with jungle jax, (in low silver however). He just seems  so good. His clears are decent, he synergizes amazingly with feral flare, his ganks are pretty good, he scales like a god, and he is actually quite good at Dragon/baron steals (AOE stun). Too bad he's basically permabanned at my ELO.   Yeah, to teach them how to beat weak teams :\^)   Her core items are Hextech Gunblade and Zhonyas Hourglass. They both synergize so well for her that you can't pass them up. After that (+boots), she could build either a deathcap, Lich Bane, or void staff for her fourth and fifth items. Her sixth item is usually a guardian angel, but a banshees veil or another damage item also works well.  Playing her is basically playing extremely passive until level 6 (assuming your playing mid), then back with hopefully enough gold for a Hextech revolver. This lets uou get your ult charges at the same time. You then have a choice between trying to kill your laner, or roam. Akali is one of the hardest snowballing champions in the game, so it's worth taking a risk to get a kill.  One of the main combos you can do on her is throw a Q, wait a few seconds, R to them, proc your Q with your auto, throw your Q that just came of cooldown, and proc with your E. This can take someone from 60-0 in the span of a second at level 6.   Don't listen to the other people saying you can't jungle without runes. As someone who recently levelled to 30, I started jungling around lvl 10. This is especially useful if you want to play draft pick mode, where you are expected to jungle.   However, the only three junglers id recommend are Warwick, Xin Zhao and Fiddlesticks. They all have enough inherent sustain to let you jungle without worrying about dying to the camps early on. They are also all mechanically easy to play, so you can focus more on learning how to jungle instead of learning how to play the champion.   Hey if you want you can add me in game, I'm a new enough player that I still remember what it was like to learn the game, but I have enough experience to help teach you what you don't know, or answer any questions you might have. Just PM me if you want my in game name.   Lich Bane all the way. A Triforce only outdamages a Lich bane if you rush it, which is a terrible idea as gun blade and Zhonyas are so incredibly core. Assuming you build Lich/Tri third, a Triforce only barely outdamages a Lich Bane in spell blade procs, but Lich Bane also has 50 extra AP (which gives you much more burst), and is 700 gold cheaper. If you get it fourth, a Lich Bane massively outdamages Triforce in every way.   /r/leagueoflegends needs more shitposts. I present to you, this thread.  (   )    The "meta" way to build her is like jax, Triforce and BOTRK into tank. This lets her be a strong dueller and splitpusher, as well as not letting her get exploded if she jumps on a carry in a teamfight.   I thought I was in /r/bestofbronze for a minute. Hell, I'm in bronze 2 (held back by feeding teammates otherwise id be in Challenger) and I have done outplays better then this. NAKorea confirmed.   Don't downvote me for this unpopular opinion.... but I believe that Faker is a good player. Might even be up to an LCS level.   Thresh has been nerfed, but not heavily enough to warrant not playing him. It's mostly just that the meta has shifted to supports that can counter him now, like Morgana. He's still a very strong pick though.   Roam like crazy. But when you roam, try to give what kills you can to the laner you are roaming to. Far too often you see akalis have basically all the kills on thier team and once they get focused down theyre useless. If you can feed your bot lane or your top lane on your roams (assuming you are snowballing already) you will do MUCH better.   The only problem I see with that kit is his W seems overpowered. It's like a nasus wither and nocturne ult combined on a 10 second cooldown. With 40% CDR you can basically permaslow someone and remove all of their allied vision at the same time.    Mobility boots are also super useful on evelynn. They synergize super well with her passive, and help scare the crap out of the laners as she can basically show up top, and then gank mid way before anyone would expect.   She doesn't have too high of a skill floor, but her skill cap is quite high.   From what I got of it, the changing just allows for people to switch spots. Like if Wildturtle is #1 in Master tier, that means he will be in challenger. The next day, he will still have the number one spot in Master, so he will remain in challenger. But if 'billy' was the 200th place in master, and thn goes on tilt and drops to 250th, he won't remain in challenger the next day.   There's a diamond 1 Malzahar jungle main, it takes a lot of skill to learn but it's actually quite effective. Can do 4 min dragons and that sort of thing.   Mostly just low bronze, Bronze 1/2 has some players that aren't considered good in any means, but it's not like they're brain dead   You ban lee sin so your teammates don't use him   She's squishy early on, and relies on diving in and out for her combo. She will also run OOM fast if she is forced to spam her heals. Because of this, playing someone who has the ability to do two of the following will work: out trade her, outpoke/outsustain her, or have the ability to jump on to her and stick.   For example, Xin Zhao has the early damage, sustain, and sticking ability to give her trouble. Pantheon can stun her and then out trade her if she ever tries jumping on him, and he can block a bunch of her poke + poke back. Gragas could outsustain her, and do a hefty amount of damage if he gets jumped on.    They did for ahwile, but it's back now. I had the same problem for a bit.   It seems like the new ancient golem would be a good item on him, his E has a 6% max hp ratio.   I'm definitely gonna try a ancient golem jungle Gnar. It'll take time to learn, but his ganks should be deadly.   Damn, he sure could have some deadly all-ins. When you near max tantrum, try to get some Hyper proc's (14% max health each) (a ghostblade might be effective). Then jump in as beast form, and with your loads of CC you should easily be able to destroy them.   Immobile, squishy mid laners are common picks, and they are perfect targets for assassins such as akali and talon to just jump on and kill. They also are unable to prevent them roaming as if they follow they could just get jumped on from a bush and killed. They can also quickly assassinate the hyper carry adc that are so common in this meta.   Ryze is the definition of a "spammy ability champion"   Thanks for the tips! Not to be nitpicky, but isn't fizz an AOE assassin as well?   I keep getting convinced more and more to try Talon. I think he might be my next buy. Anyone have some tips for him?   She's strong against most matchups, especially melee champs that she can just poke down and then zone. The hardest matches she has are champs that can either out trade her, or have the ability to stick on to her. For example, Xin Zhao and Pantheon give her a lot of trouble.   As someone learning J4, how do you get away with such a low death rate? I find that 90% of the time I'll catch a carry out with my ult, get them focused down, and then subsequently die. We'll usually win the teamfight but I'll almost always be a casualty. Like a game would be more like 5/8/20 or something around that.   Focus whoever you can attack that won't put you in a position of danger. The carries are the best choice, but if you get dived and killed just to try to attack then it's not worth   Yes, but you don't flame them. There's times when your teammate needs to be told to get his head out of his ass, but you need to do it in a way that motivates them, not discourages them. Same with league.   Please, whatever you do don't play the Donger support. It makes Csing absolutely hell for the ADC.   She was played twice today in the NALCS. She is quite viable.   The standard build is 2x dorans into Infinity Edge, Phantom Dancer, Berzerker Greaves, Last Whisper, BOTRK, and a situational defensive item.  You can replace the Phantom Dancer with Statikk Shiv and the BOTRK with a Bloodthirster if you want, just that the aforementioned one is the most efficient.    Nerfing a champion is nothing near the lines of jagex removing what was arguably the hugest part of the game for many people. If riot pulled a jagex it would be them doing something like removing the jungle entirely.   I have a ~70% win rate with evelynn at a low level and the build I've had the most success with is Elder Lizard, Trinity Force, Maw of Malmortius, Randuins, situational defensive item, and your boots of choice. You deal enough damage to help carry your team but are defensive enough to not get blown up in teamfights.   Id suggest Shyvana for top. She doesn't have any real weak common matchups, she has a pretty simple kit, and you'll out scale almost all toplaners.   Maim being removed has nothing to do with machete giving feral flare stacks. I'm on mobile so I can't show any direct links, but if you reread the item you'll see.   Play draft pick as soon as your able. Only way to deal with instalockers pre 30.   Lucian. I feel helpless laning gainst him.   Besides the ones already mentioned, there is also Akali and Fizz for some mobile assassins.   As a level 21 noob, Why exactly is this? I find it so much faster to go bluewraithsredgank (if possible) . Wraiths are so much faster to kill and easier on health. Even with farming junglers I have seen a video that shows there is zero difference in time to go bluewraithsredwolves.  	101

 Yes, From Scorsese's Last Temptation Of Christ   Christmas albums are always a bummer      Fan Created Content of the Month or something more concisely worded .   Obi Wan has taught me well.      Thanks for watching, we were gunning for something like a Bladerunner vibe.        Sorry about that, I think it is an issue with the Kavinsky track that's used. YouTube apparently doesn't want certain people to see it. If anyone has any tricks to get around that type of thing, I'd be interested.   Definitely! If you want, I'll try to shoot you a PM when we upload it. It should be soon.   2006 2-disc special edition dvds include these as a special feature. They don't look too pretty though.    Thanks! This is actually a clip from a larger prequel edit. (all 3 Movies are down to one 90ish minute film with a different score and plot.) I tried to choose the best beats to cut to but some (like that one) may have gotten away.  	12

 Under Pressure goes hard. Logic is gonna be big   Miles Teller is a great actor. I'm lookin forward to this movie   Yeah but he can make those regardless. Best player on the planet has to make difficult jumpers in the playoffs   What's wrong with Lebron's jumper? Dude just can't find it. Hope that shapes up as we head through the playoffs   it's a bad angle.    It makes me so sad. Like, you're huge. Get on the block, the actual block not this 18 feet away from the rim post ups, and jump hook the shit out of em.    Kyrie is the most unguardable player in the league off of pick and rolls. You go under, he splashes a 3. You go over, he's goin to the rack where he's the best finisher in the league. You hedge hard, he's splitting you for a 4 on 3 advantage where he is probably gonna get a bucket. Crazy   SO FINE UUUGGHHHHHH   its been bad   Except for his inability to jump through people and dunk the ball. He's got some weight lifting to do this off season   Our defense is just plain awful right now. I'm sad.    my point is no one is that consistent. regardless of the level of competition, no one has been that consistent for that long    To say it isn't impressive to never have a bad first round series in an entire career is insane.    All the "bc hes in the east, come to the west and see if that stays" crap is stupid. 5 years from now, the East is gonna have the 60+ win teams and 8 seeds that have 50+ wins and the west will have sub .500 teams in the playoffs. It flips back and forth, always has always will   Not impressive to never get bounced in the first round? You serious?   I think Kyrie Irving is going to be the most outstanding player in the league until the Finals start. There's just something about the way he plays that makes him seem like a guy who can really succeed in the all-eyes-on-you playoff stage and with that kind of intensity. Big game player.    fuck you, pay me   -Interstellar -Ocean's 11 -The Dark Knight -Hot Rod -21 Jump Street -22 Jump Street -Pineapple Express -Toy Story -The Incredibles -Monsters Inc.    I was just a youngblood when Phantom Menace came out so Pod racing was the shit, Darth Maul was the shit, Obi Wan was the coolest dude ever just catching that lightsaber mid-flip to slice him, Natalie Portman was (is still) the crush of all crushes, Mace Windu's purple sword was always the coolest, all the jedi comin out for a huge battle was the shit, yoda showin some skills was the shit, space battles were the shit, Annakin decapitating Dooku was the coolest ever, annakin slaughtering kids and turnin dark was terrifying and awesome bc the story was really connecting, epic Obi-Wan/Annakin fight was the shit. But again, I was just a youngblood    How much for the one with two different eye colors? serious question   This Bucks team is underrated. Just a team of hungry young guys. Total plausible upset   Oh I gotcha. I must have misread somewhere   Same here, but I still dont have that much hate for em.    Steal the Declaration of Independence.    Mike-Mill-Made-It   I know! ive never seen anything like that before and it just felt like it perfectly fit the song. well done      I think that was dope simply bc they had so much fun doin it. need a collab album   Groot Dammit   I want em to play Toronto just so we can see Drake hug it out with Lebron after his team gets beat   http://imgur.com/lkRkgWl   scratch my hatch   As is the case with CB, when you get twice the shots, you'll score points. That's not a very difficult concept to grasp   Don't tell me 14 pts a game from Wade on a bum knee is contributing. And I never questioned Bosh's pick and roll defense. I agree, he is excellent at that. Guarding big men, however, is another story. He got cooked by Roy Hibbert(!!!) 2 years in a row before *Udonis *Haslem was put on him and shut him down. And he couldn't guard Duncan, or Splitter for that matter, two years in a row.   All of those things aside, when I say Lebron carried them, I'm not wrong. He led the team is scoring, rebounds, assists, and steals for nearly 4 full years. He was the best defender in the league, regardless of who got the award, for 2-3 of those years. so he had to guard the likes of DRose, KD, Tony Parker, Paul Pierce, Paul George, etc. all while leading the offense in every statistical category there is. Yes, DWade contributed at times and yes, CB helped spread the floor and in p r situations defensively, but outside of that, it was '09/'10 Cavaliers all over again.   But, I greatly appreciate you actually contributing information and making a logical argument. Most people just throw aimless comments out there and hope they stick.    i disagree. i also think it's ridiculous to still be upset with him about that. that's the only questionable thing he has done since he was 17 years old. he is a stand-up guy who has always gone above and beyond for his community. and even when he was in Miami, you knew he always wanted to be back home. to not forgive him for essentially going off to college before realizing he was meant to stay home is just immature.     I would love to hear your reasoning instead of just a blind statement.    Uhh... he did. Just because he was getting, what, 22 and 10 before he had the lung issues doesn't mean he isn't past his prime. He was getting twice as many shots and was the unquestionable focus of the offense every time down the floor this season. You're bound to have better numbers when you get twice the shots. But prime Bosh? That was in 2011 when he would routinely get 30 and 15. When Lebron and Wade were out, he would drop 40+ and single-handedly win games. You won't see that from him again   He did. He doesn't score those easy points unless Lebron is on that team.    Prime Wade and Bosh left after 2011. Wade was hurt from '12 to now and Bosh became a jump shooter who couldnt defend 5's, which is what he had to play bc that team had no size. Lebron carried those teams and it's not even an argument.    wait so lebron isnt even in your top 5? _   I just want a realistic spider-man. Like, why is he so witty and funny? Didn't Robin Williams say the funniest people are the ones hurting the most or something like that? Make Uncle Ben's death dark. The whole thing dark. Like The Dark Knight dark. I want him to resort to humor because he's depressed and fight crime to try to *AVENGE his uncle's death. I dont want the same old high school stuff we've seen. Reinvent it. Make it new. I want him to do bad things to criminals because he's so angry. I want dark humor at first until he realizes what he actually needs to do to with his ability. I want Captain America to be integrated somehow and sort of take him under his wing and show him how to be responsible with his abilities. I want Captain to tell him "With great power comes great responsibility," echoing what Uncle Ben told him previously, only this time it actually clicks. Finally, I want him to become an *Avenger. But only because he has earned it and struggled through the pain to become one.    hahaha oh my god   I read every comment in Archer's voice. It was awesome.    What if it turns into an Eminem/Rihanna Love the Way You Lie/Monster type of duo... Could be huge   - Jerry Maguire - Oceans's Eleven - The Dark Knight - Interstellar - A Few Good Men  In no particular order   That's not what I mean. Just the whole homecoming, fairy-tale kind of season it would be if they make it all the way and win. He'd be a hero and even if he didn't have the best series individually, he would get the award.       No matter who has the best series, Lebron will get the MVP. It's one of those storybook ending kinda things   I would! Currently on my phone though so the flash doesnt work. Definitely using that in the future though!   Not watching the game bc league pass is too damn expensive, but is lebron just not shooting well or is he missing easy shots or what? seeing him shoot 5 of 14 always makes me angry   I just feel like we all need some evidence as to how incredible dat ass is before we judge this man for his innocent compliment.... lol   and people be gettin mad at me sneezin 5 times in a row in class.    So, he DID take the suicide squad reading photo then.... clever   I was frozen solid in my seat watching that. Didn't move an inch. So incredibly mesmerized by all that scene took and how expertly executed it was.    A Time to Kill. come on, now   haha he was so awesome to me as that character. so believable. just crazy enough   yes. i understand what it is technically. all im saying is, in terms of quality, this is only a mixtape. hence the excitement for, what he calls, his album.    What im saying is, he didnt put the work/effort into this "mixtape" as he calls it as he will for his actual album. and i got screwed then bc mine said 14.99.    It was actually more than that, so your argument is invalid. And he literally said it was a mixtape. Only on sale to get out of his CM deal. Come on, keep up son   "Do you like my mixtape?" - Drake   Drizzy season and this aint even the album   All of Christopher Nolans films are on this list. Also, Disney is cleaning up   haha goatbrook. his triple doubles dont equal wins, boss   How many almost-triple-doubles has he had in his career? ive always been curious. so many games where hes one assist or one rebound or even one of both away from one. frustrating   if Akon was on the chorus, that chorus was my ringtone. We Takin Over, Im So Paid, Dont Matter, Soul Survivor.    still jam to that. titty boi til i die   but, can you throw it over your shoulder?   hahah ring back tones. those were the shit   I can see him resting em for the last game. Other than that, I think he'll play em. This year is just different with the playoff road ahead. Won't be as grueling in the East but also the pressure to win I think will effect Blatt's resting method. He'll want to maintain the rhythm and flow of the rotation going into that first round, imo   He's in my top 5 most hated players in the league. Dude has hated Lebron forever because he always gets stomped by him.    My favorite is "You sir, have a small penis" and then a detailed cartoon drawing of a man with a monocle looking down from above the urinal.    hahaha get tf outta here   i think they probably have a pretty good relationship. as much these kinds of stories suck, lebron knows better than anybody that stories like this are gonna happen regardless. i mean, he's known the dude since high school   the whole "spaghettified" thing is being debunked right now. Physicists arent sure if that is what would actually happen or not.    Id still give it to Aldridge just because he'll never get it again bc Davis is gonna run the league from here on out   "damn girl you fine... but that dress is bad" "then take it off already" O_o      this would be the dream haha   dudes were tryna hot box the ozone   that's terrifying af. im sad   I found it kind of funny that the plan to repopulate the earth was ironically called "Plan B" lol   well i can think about how 2+2=4 in the shower but that doesnt make it a showerthoughts worthy shower thought   Gulping Chewing with their mouth open Not using their blinker    Aye B, I got your CD you get an E for eFfort   This isn't a shower thought though... Just a normal comment about something   No one has said Oranges yet and that's embarrassing. Oranges till I die    Kids is evolvin bruh   The child in the 4th pic is the only one actually prepared for the meeting.  "Fellas, quit the chit chat. We have some things to accomplish here."   Oh okay. Thanks!    What is Dark Matter/Energy? I just watched an old Ted Talks from 2008 about it but I was just curious how much more we know now?   Yaayyyy:D   Boston wont make it. Toughest schedule in the league from here on out   can we like... be friends?   thats cool as shit. "inception: the musical"   hahaha. not laughing at your comment. flacciddick got me    Feel bad for Earl cuz the album is alright, but comin right after TPAB puts it in the shade   These are too elaborate. "I have boobs" works fine   Thanks. I guess CGI isn't the preferred route at this point for a movie like that? Whatever, as long as it has the quality and grand feeling that Interstellar had, i dont care how it's done   2001 Space Odyssey. I want Interstellar level CGI. That'd be sick   But..... da fuq?   Having fun is an underrated component to playing good ball. He's finally having fun and thriving   come on man. i hope that puts you on a predator list   shes feeling plenty of sounds as it is   Agreed!  	102
 good point   According to Tesla's Giga presentation, construction was originally planned to get started in 2014. Is that feasible now given that there's still no site chosen?   So far there's no word on where the other 3bn may come from. Panasonic remains non-committal, right?   Is the Gigafactory actually gonna happen?   Maybe he's just a germophobe               Holy Crap.. something's afoot         More than performance, I'm curious what it's gonna look like!   Musk also mentioned that the Model E interior may not feature some of the same expensive high-end fit and trim as the Model S   Is the market the Model E is aimed at even concerned with 0-60 times? Sure it's a nice cherry on top, but given the price range for the Model E, the more important factors I think will be range/style.  Also, Musk has said the Model E will have a few less features than the Model S to keep it economical (i.e perhaps not as big a touchscreen display)   Thanks for the info!      Was that about the same margin level Tesla enjoyed on the Roadster?   Elon Musk has said a number of times that every single penny from Model S profits is being put back into the company to further develop the Model X and 3rd Gen car.  I was wondering, just how much money per car (base level car) is pure profit that Tesla can put back into the company?         Was he THE GUY in automobile design when Tesla snatched him up from Mazda?                           Ah thanks. I wasn't 100% sure the model x was being viewed in the same boat as the model S (second-gen).  You think there's a bigger market for the model x than the model s?   Then what about the third gen Tesla?                     lol, timeless   Roy walked away like he knew it was going down like that, like a bowler confidently strutting after a predictable strike   holy crap.. he was lining that up for seconds.. literally stalking  sad to see nog go down like that            guida looks like a nut!   he's won 3 fon type bonuses over the last 4 fights. He shouldn't be hurting for money. he just wants more based on what Gill's getting.  I'm not saying he doesn't DESERVE more.. im just saying we shouldn't be acting like he's getting chump change cuz he's not   That's not the UFC's concern. What diaz does in his own time isn't a factor in what the UFC should pay him.  Diaz opened up a gym to make money, as a business. It's not a normal expense he had to take on.      The UFC shouldn't have to foot the bill for Diaz's side businesses      60 k to show is great. What are you people smoking?! if he goes 2-1 in a year that's 300 large right there. The whole argument about fighters going in, training, putting their health at risk -- all valid points, but they apply to ALL FIGHTERS.  Diaz in recent time has also won THREE BONUSES.  If Diaz should be mad at anyone it's his manager for not keeping him in the loop and keeping him abreast of all the ins and outs of his contract.  What is really going on here, I think, is that Diaz got a whiff of the $ Gill is getting now and is pissed.  I would hope/imagine that something we can all agree on is that Dana doesn't have to be a big dick about it everytime a fighter speaks up. That Dana should show fighters, on whose backs the UFC stands, more respect and reverence should be expected. Sadly, Dana views fighters as expendable and treats them as such   People say these rumors are getting ridiculous. I say they're not getting ridiculous enough!   yes. he's an industrial design guy, not a software user interface guru   That would be a huge mistake for Apple to let christie go   Was this UFC or WWE?          But who wears a watch like that most of the time? It's asking the user to change how one ordinarily uses an object                  And speaking of poor management, where's the branding? natediaz.com takes me to a bakery?!  All I can think of now is Nick Diaz getting the munchies   $300,000 in revenue from 3 fights should be enough for Diaz to live comfortably in any given year. If his contract dropped from 60/60 to 15/15 because of two losses, that's horrible contract negotiating from Diaz's manager. You have to negotiate the upside as well as the downside.   Professional athletes in the NBA, NHL, MLB etc perform much more than just 3 times a year. The economics are completely different, the money is completely different.  For how much money Diaz helps bring in, 60/60 a night seems fair, no?   300,000 a year pre-expenses puts him at the top 2-3$ of income in the entire world. I think he's doing okay. Seems like he's either a) not managing his money correctly or b) is super jealous of Gil's deal      The man sure knew how to make an entrance https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36OHZ51o2qo      Someone needs to get Nate a new manager capable of explaining where the hell his money is going. At 60/60, and assuming just 3 fights a year, that's 300 grand if he goes 2-1. After taxes let's say he nets 210k/yr.  subtract managers 10% that's about 190k before training expenses. As far as the economy goes, that's not shabby   lol well done homie      Voice over LTE is probably the most interesting new detail here. hopefully there will be a surprise or two as well            700 pounder is http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Yarborough   i think matt hughes recently said on twitter he could bench 350   yet where's the outrage that accompanies UFC paydays?!   recently?

Why would Comcast be on board?   The Ben Stiller show once had a great parody of it starring andy dick   missed that, will delete. thanks for the heads up!   Is that Rousey walking to the cage in fashion boots?    Most intimidating guy/girl RW/RR cast members?   Aside from Timmy, any cast members who can bring the funny as well as you do?   To emily?   Do you still keep up with any folks from your Road Rules cast? Any chance you'll be back on a challenge?   Chael seems a bit taken aback.. he likes talking crazy, but think he wasn't expecting Wanderlei to get kinda crazy up in his grill like that   interesting way to look at it   Will have to give them a second go-around   The first few episodes were atrocious. It really picked up steam mid-way through, with a few episodes really capturing the classic AD vibe.   How spot-on that he knew the show was doomed. A damn shame that such was/is the state of TV   Any juicy tidbits? Assholes?   Not that much more than Netflix/month, and when you add in the shipping, still a solid deal   lol no idea   meanwhile, chris weidman is watching and thinking "Yes, but red ball doesn't hit back"   Nothing like a good squint at a progress bar that is seemingly progressing.. oh wait.. maybe its not   Part 2 over here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Jc9AaqGuwU   Some great old footage of Tito and Joe Silva   Kroll show.. wanted to like it.. but seems so amateur. Seems like a recycled version of the Ben Stiller show   Uh oh, that's the kiss of death for his next fight   It's a risky move. If only everything on Yahoo weren't so damn ugly.   Well done joe silva   Needs a bigger win on his Resume, especially with losses to condit and maia   Which one is the ex Appler?   ah, i didn't realize that there was a TRT limit fighters could be on. thanks   so assuming he had a failed test, was it for TRT or a banned substance?    lol what a great character Bas is. If only he was in his prime today   are you shittin me?!   Now this is a headline done right!   Wearing the dogtag for extra badassness   Kind of sad that he's selling it... and that he still wears a backwards baseball cap   And no recourse for victims, of course. Are we honestly supposed to believe that a digital currency like BitCoin is the wave of the future?    Agreed. And McMann isn't going to be intimidated, put off by the big lights like Tate said she was.   If meisha tate didn't keep trying to bull rush Rhonda, might have had a different ending. Rousey got clipped a few times in that fight. McMann won't be getting tossed around like a ragdoll with Rousey, thats for sure   he claims she brings in more money than brock.. wtf?!   For all the naysayers, if you follow any of the stories leading up to this, DC is absolutely pissed at Cummins and they've gotten into heated battles on TV. Cummins has called Cormier out for crying, breaking a code of silence from the wrestling room.. and twisting the story as such to make DC seem weak.  Day what you will about wolf tickets, but that term dosen't apply here.   That's a good point, and often not brought up in these discussions. All hard work does not create equal value. Sure GSP makes a hell of a ton more than someone like Matt Brown, but he generates so much money for the UFC its insane.    Odenkirk was an SNL writer for a while as well   You are correct, that is bob odenkirk. Also interesting is that the dialogue here is almost verbatim what was used on SNL   damn, Nate Quarry is on point. Lots of interesting threads here. The UFC needs to realize its the fighters that make the brand. No one says "lets go watch an NBA game!" They say, "Lets check out the Heat game tonight, Lebron is facing Durant"   Cormier is fired up!   For a retired fella, nick is in better shape than everyone. #triathalon   Shits getting real. If Cesar's team went to bellator, who they all gonna fight, each other? Cesar shouldn't drag his other fighters into this situation   When's the last time you used an iPhone?    I feel like I'm high looking at this and trying to make sense of it   You might say that this photo warrants the description of BADASS   Damn, Weidman is taller than you'd expect   I think it's from this band  https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/1-18/id496870364?i=496870699   Watch em' before every fight :) I'm not who the UFC needs to market to, though, to get to the next level. With fighters often fighting only 3 times a year, the promotional activities can't be limited to a lone Countdown special that airs just one week before a big fight.  The UFC needs to market stars like Aldo and Weidman to the folks who don't typically watch Countdown specials. They need to realize that for the UFC to grow, they need to help make some bankable stars. Look at how much the star power of GSP helped the UFC. And sure, like the article says, creating stars isn't a science, but the UFC, with all of their resources, could certainly doing more in this regard.    Sadly, it seems like companies like Nike and BadBoy are more invested in creating marketable stars than the UFC is.   Best article on UFC marketing I've seen in a while.  "They need stars that audiences will back like their local team sports. They need to highlight talent, and competition, and stories."  This is dead on. The UFC could do so much more to humanize the fighters they want us to pay to watch. With Strikeforce now gone, the UFC doesn't really have any serious competition. Their brand is safe. They are the NBA of MMA and it's now time they step it up and start marketing their ATHLETES.   No mention of IO, where the dudes perform every week. WEAK!   Felony? Really?

Everything you said, but for me, mainly because if I don't believe that everything is going to be okay, it will only be a downward spiral - and a fast one. I have to believe that it will be okay one way or another; and for some reason, that keeps me going. I don't know if that makes sense for you, but I hope it does.

Yes, The Conjuring was a total build up till the end; and I was terrified from the beginning not knowing what was going to happen. Annabelle will be "easier" watching then. Though I'm not a big fan of horror movies, I am starting to become more adventurous...is Annabelle worth a try?   I'm sure you think that I don't understand what you're going through, but I do. It's just that sometimes, our future is dictated by what we are, opposed to what we want.   Nicholas Sparks  I keep thinking about this.

Talented, definitely. His performance in Eternal Sunshine... tore me up.   I just found out about the Annabelle movie (the doll in The Conjuring) yesterday, which was released earlier this month.  The Conjuring scared the crap out of me, and they did a good job making Annabelle a mysteriously scary "character".  Anyone seen it? Recommendations?   Great. Let me know how that goes.

I've always treated work (freelance writing) as fun, so it doesn't bother me at all that I spend 10-12 hours a day working. I thought I had had a good balance, but am totally wrong.

    Anyone have any burnt out boards they plan on discarding?  Obviously shipping them across the USA is more expensive than just throwing them out, but I'd like some practice diagnosing and possibly fixing them.  Printrboards being what I'm primarily interested in, seeing as they have on-board drivers, and are hard to repair if the driver blows.  They're hard, but not impossible, because they use the version of the A4982 driver that actually has exposed leads.  I've got nothing to offer up - and I figure this won't get much attention, and if the worst that happens is some downvotes, I'm still in the positive for at least asking.  PM me for shipping address if you are so inclined.         I think it was at an old E3, back when I was still into consoles.  Someone was demoing the graphical abilities of their console and had reported that everything in the video was done in real-time.  If I remember correctly, it starts out with this large robot in the center of a platform, doing some pseudo martial-arts moves.  Eventually the robot stops...the chest cavity opens up, and a girl jumps out.  She ends up standing next to the bot, again, doing martial arts moves, with the robot in the background copying her every move.  I thought it was the original xbox demo video, but for the life of me I cannot find it anywhere.  I'm looking for it because I remember being _so incredibly impressed_ and I want to take a look back to see how things have changed for me since then in regards to being able to criticize the environment.  If you know what video I'm talking about, any extra information to assist me in finding it would be great.  What console it was for, what event it was at, clarification on the events in the video...anything...         And isn't it kind of mean to make spike gag up messages all the time?      I've got a 120v (edit: 90-115v on the , 2.25hp motor from an old treadmill that I'd like to utilize for a small powerwheels project.  The thing is, 120v DC is a pretty uncommon thing to control.  What would be the best way to control this?  A custom H-bridge made out of power-mosfets?  Would I be better off with logic level fets or a gate driver?  I'm not really looking for any kind of PWM speed control, just forward/reverse.  If this isn't really feasible (or more trouble than it's worth), would it be suitable for a wind-power project?  Maybe hook it up to a suitable gas motor for backup power?  Project ideas would be helpful too.  It's got a pretty hefty flywheel on the thing - I can post pictures if that's of any help.   Hey, has this ever happened to you? You wake up one morning not feeling so hot, you go to the bathroom to get ready for the day, turn on the light, look in the mirror, and find that you have pink eye?! Well what you may not know is that most pink eye is actually caused by a disgruntled ex-Intel engineer named Greg who is angry that hell lacks solder. Every now and then Greg's ectoplasm stretches and he gains access to our mortal plain. He takes out his anger by stabbing people in the eyes with hot soldering irons as they sleep, thus causing pink eye.  Well, a study published in the peer reviewed journal 'The American Journal on Gullibility' showed that there was a strong correlation between soldering ability and the incidence of pink eye. The study found the stronger your soldering ability, the less incidence of pink eye you will develop. No mechanism has been found yet, but it is believed that a mutual assured destruction type standoff ensues, as Greg would not like pink eye on top of eternal damnation.  So if you'd like to reduce pink eye and improve your soldering ability, learn to solder 10AM on September 8th at [FamiLAB](https://www.facebook.com/FamiLAB).

Why aren't hit-spheres used more often?  Does this change between 2D and 3D significantly?  Edit: Mostly concerned with 3D implementations.  A cube vs sphere for collision geometry.  Not so much _how_ to do them, but some discussion on which is easier to implement, which is more efficient, etc.   So, apparently someone was looking for an Ear, Nose, Throat doctor.  http://www.reddit.com/r/orlando/comments/yg3fx/good_ents/  Hilarity ensues.      In the past, I was told about a series of scripts/programs that had the ability to take information and music from a streaming service (I think maybe it was spotify?) and automatically rip it, tag it, and organize it directly to your hard drive.  I checked it out at the time but didn't feel I had the need for it, and I'm having trouble finding it again.  Does anyone know anything about this, where it can be obtained, etc?  Found the program: It's called "Replay Music 3" - and what it does is records from your sound cards stereo output, and detects pauses in between songs.  (Much like MythTV does with commercials)  It then writes each "block" of sound over 30 seconds out to a file.  It also works on pretty much any and all music services that play through your speakers.  Pandora, Spotify, online radio stations, etc.   Are there any WMs out there that provide _just_ window border decorations and buttons?  Maybe some hotkey (alt+tab, etc) support?  Every WM I run across has some sort of application manager, or launcher, or other crap associated with it, instead of just...you know...managing windows.  Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions -- I found my winner for the time being.  In the future I'll be expanding PLWM, seeing as the default arch install comes with python already and xlib is tiny.   I've got some I2C and SPI devices, but everything I'm finding on this requires new kernels, etc and I really don't feel like mucking about with that.  Is there an image out there with I2C support already, and maybe a small how-to on interfacing with I2C devices?   I'm sure the idea behind it is stupid simple, I just don't think I've ever run across a circuit like this.  I'm screwing around with my Raspberry Pi, and have dismantled a mintyboost I soldered about a year ago.  I'd like to have 2 D batteries as backup to the mintyboost, and a wall wart powering the mintyboost normally.  How do I allow this to happen without discharging into the batteries and blowing things up?  Even a point in the right direction would help.  Am I going to need something like a voltage comparison to switch over, or can I do some cheap trick with resistors maybe?  I don't know...it's 1:15am and I can't brain right now.   Working on my 3D printer, I'd really like a small connector for the heater/thermistor combo, but the most compact thing I can find is 2x2 crimp pin header.  You guys know of any connectors which have 4 pins (2 for power), small dimensions, protection against reversed/misconnected ends, enough beef to handle a handful of amps @ 12v on 2 of the lines (like, 3A), and optionally, some sort of clip that keeps it from coming disconnected?  I was thinking a TRRS connector, and put the +12v on the tip (deepest ring on the female end) so that if it pulls out it doesn't short the thermistor? (thermistor leads are only 5v tolerant)  Though, even that is a little bulky I think.  Mouser and Digikey are clearly _not_ good places for browsing connector types.  Lots of miscategorized things, missing info (and missing info causes things to get lost when you start filtering)            There's only a set of 2 poses from [kp-shadowsquirrel on deviantart](http://kp-shadowsquirrel.deviantart.com/#/d3k5wig); I already have those.  They don't fit my purposes; multiple obj files compiled into a single one means that they don't export into a single solid properly...non manifoldness and all.  If somepony knows how to union the "all-in-one" OBJ files into a single non-overlapping object, that would help too. (Gotta get them into a manifold STL format)  There are like 5 3D printers @ my hackerspace, and I'd _really_ like to find a good set of _manifold_ models to make a run of.

She's still in one piece currently (luckily).  Even if somepony who did clay models or something could scan their work with [123D Catch](http://www.123dapp.com/catch) that would be amazing.

I live close to Apopka, in Lake county.  I do _not_ trust the doctors here, as my first radiologist wouldn't even explain to me the risks of radiation and gave me this "oh you're young, don't worry about it" attitude.  I moved my treatment to Shands up in Gainesville, and while I realize that yes, I probably have closer options, when dealing with something of this magnitude I'd really rather have the best people working on it.  Problem is, it's a 2 hour drive.  I've gotta be at Shands @ 11:45 every morning.  Mon-Tues, for 3 1/2 weeks, starting next wednesday.  I looked @ the Hope Lodge, but they require you have a 'caretaker' and they _lock the doors at 9pm_.  You're not allowed to have food in your little apartment area, you have to share a community kitchen where it's trivial for someone to open a glass-front fridge and rummage through your food.  The place has really crappy internet, no wireless, and all around just plain sucks.  I posted here figuring those from the area might have some better ideas.  Anyone have a mother-in-law apartment to rent out for a single month for 2 occupants?      When I setup nginx/compiled from source on ubuntu, the compile flags specified a user:  ./configure --prefix=/opt/nginx --user=nginx --group=nginx --with-http_ssl_module      How do I change the user/group, configure/compile it?  -- Running Ubuntu 10.04   I'm not quite a linux newbie, more like a novice at this point.  I'm running Arch, and I quite like the control it gives me over everything.  I'm also on a quite underpowered eee900a which, while fine for everyday stuff just kind of chokes on video, etc.  Since I'd like this to be a mix between some reddit browsing, occasional gmail checking, and actual learning, I'd like to be able to work mostly in the command line, and just be able to swap over to X when I start to feel uncomfortable.  I'd like to move as much as I can over to the command line though.  I'm a touch typer, and grew up on the dos command line so I'm familiar in the environment.  However, there are a couple of little niggles that I'd like to get out of the way.  First; browser.  What are some good command line browsers?  I use Links, but is there any way to get framebuffer graphics on a command line browser?  Maybe some javascript support, etc?  What command line browsers do you recommend?  Reddit client?  I've seen some reddit command line clients, is this worth even doing?  Text editor? - I'm not very comfortable with vi yet.  I use nano for editing normally, Is there anything that's more similar to the GUI environment where I can use alt + f to get a file menu, etc?  I'm not averse to learning vi, but it's taking me a little longer than I'd like.  I haven't figured out how to copy and paste things from one file to the next very elegantly. (read: at all)  What about multiple apps at the same time?  Do I use screen for this?  I'm starting to get familiar with it, is there something that others prefer?  Console highlighting - worth doing?  I'm using Wicd-curses right now to manage networks, that seems to work out perfect.  Any way of keeping data on-screen most of the time like battery, time, etc?  Is it possible to do 90% of everything in the command line? - the reason I'm kind of submerging myself into this is because I really need to be familiar with remote-control of linux shells.  I saw a command line "window manager" - it was similar to dwm, or...based off of it I think?  Either way, I appreciate any help anyone can give me.  The more familiar with the command line I can be, the more happy I'll be.  One day I might even be a sed/awk guru.  Edit: also, is there a way to get a higher resolution framebuffer?  I did vga=ask in menu.lst, had it scan for more codes, and I only get 800x600x32 as my highest available option.  I guess there might be a way to start X with a full screen terminal for higher resolution maybe?  Since I'm using a netbook, unfortunately, the resolution is like 1024x600, which isn't very standard.  Any suggestions here?   I'm of the opinion that things like LFG tool, Guild leveling, Derp-level pug raids have pretty much ruined the epic-ness of WoW.  Are there any recent MMOs which put some of this back into the game?  I am still a huge fan of World of Warcraft, but after TBC they reigned back the "High Fantasy" environment.  Things are, I guess, more believable/closer to Norse mythology, but it has kind of killed a very vivid storyline for me.  I very much wish to keep the swords/dragons/magic bit; I really dislike space/tech MMOs (Eve, and a couple I tried on Steam)  Any suggestions?         I've noticed skeinforge has profiles for a laser cutter, but has anyone ever done such a thing?  Full Spectrum Engineering are being real dicks to us regarding home-grown upgrades, insisting we buy a new v7 board and a bunch of new hardware in order to install end-stops (the only difference between v6 and v7 are end stops are broken out to headers).  Since they've been so unkind, we're looking for something to generate the gcode from SVGs and provide the control we have with their software through other means.  We do build parts for our repraps using the laser, so it is reprap related. :)   Not for me, for a buddy of mine.  I don't want a link to xda developers, both of us already know how to find stuff there.  I'd like some personal experiences with roms other sensation owners are/have run in the past.  Friend is having issues with HyperSensation at the moment, so looking to move away from that rom.  Not really looking for a full AOSP experience (Like peter alfonso's stuff), something CM7-based is best, and a working featureset as well. (No malfunctioning gps, etc) - Preferring a non-sense ROM.   I'm getting close to the point where I'm going to need a hot end for my Prusa (I'm building it closer to the v1 spec) -- Now, I've played with 2 hot ends so far; a Makergear hotend, and a Budaschnozzle.  The Budaschnozzle seems much better than the makergear, and I was told the reason for that is the metal doesn't travel as far up the filament and start expanding it.  It seems to need less retraction than the makergear, and oozes less as well.  Should I be looking for the least amount of heat-travel up the hot end?  What are some good mechanical properties of a hot end?  If there was no budget limitation, no engineering limitation, what would be the ultimate properties of a FDM hot end?  I plan on using a cartridge heater for the hot end, and oversampling (because the temperature gradient is much higher, and thus much easier to overshoot) the temp readings.  Good or bad idea?    Just got a lathe and mill (smaller ones) donated to my hackerspace.  Was hoping this was going to be a little more active.  Are there any other subreddits that deal with mills, lathes, and general manufacturing, etc?   I was going to write this nice little blurb here on why you should come visit us, but I guess our about page says it a lot better than I could: http://familab.org/blog/about/  Also, read up on what a hackerspace is!: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace  We got a brand new space that is OVER 4000!...sq/ft that is.  We want to show it off.  We want to show YOU what we have in store.  The new space allows a lot more opportunity for us to teach classes we've wanted to teach for a long time.  You've seen me, or abyssknight post here telling you about our Arduino or Soldering classes, but we're going to be doing cooler stuff soon too!  Here's a quick rundown of some ideas we've had for classes:      * Screen Printing * Welding * Laser Cutting (We own a laser cutter!) * HAM Radio * Analog circuitry * Photography * Python/Ruby classes * NodeJS classes * Metalworking classes (Lathe, CNC mill, Manual Mill) * Pottery? (We've got a kiln!)  And some of our ideas for projects in the new space:  * Retro Game Night! (Original NES, SNES, Playstation, N64, Sega) * Green Screen for video processing * Wheatley-style service rail with camera accessible from the internet. * Quadcopter battles * Solar/Wind power * DJ Booth * Maybe let an artist come in and paint the interior?  The NEW address for FamiLAB is **1355 Bennett Drive #129, Longwood FL 32750** -- we're not at the dinky old 400 sq/ft place anymore!  We'll be holding our open house **December 6th at 8:00pm**.  There *will be cookies!*  Come and check out the new place!  We're super excited about it, but even if you don't plan on making it out, post here on any ideas or thoughts you might have, or what kind of classes you might be interested in!  We're all about learning new things, teaching, and providing access to tools most people normally don't have access to.  Also, this is for most ages!  Bring your middle/high school kids too!  We (and by we I mean one of our board members) also run a YoungMakers program which is geared toward teaching the younger generation how to make things!  It's fun for everyone!  We're on IRC as well.  Freenode, #familab -- it's where the most devious of our members hang out. :)  Oh yeah...and one more thing: [Spaaaaaaaaaaaaaacccceee!](http://spaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaccee.com/)   I've got the base of a McWire Cartesian bot made as found here: http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-to-Build-Desk-Top-3-Axis-CNC-Milling-Machine/  I've got 2 pololu A4988s to drive the stepper motors that I have attached to the X and Y axis.  The thing is, a lot of the CNC software out there just bitbangs a parallel port for this kind of thing.  Is there any software out there that supports step/dir/enable line that I can load up on an Arduino to fire out some test patterns with a marker?  I've got limit switches I can install as well.  I'm planning on making this a 3D printer, + CNC dremel machine.       On XDA development forums.  Not going to link in an effort to keep the less technically inclined from flooding them, or doing stupid shit with their devices they have no business doing.   Every curation of dubstep I end up putting into pandora for a 'station' focused on dirty, deep dubstep (datsik and the like) ends up giving me electronica, and rap-hop...  wtf.      Theme was a dark grey, with a thin brightly colored border at the top (it could be blue, orange, white, whatever color you wanted really), and at the rounded corners, the border followed the curve and got thinner until it was no longer visible.  I'm pretty sure it's a common/popular theme, but these damn websites for gnome themes are so horrible to navigate I've given up.  I'm actually going to be throwing Arch on my box again, and using pekwm/PyPanel, and wanted to recreate the theme for pekwm.  It was almost like this, but not rainbow, and it kind of curved down a little on the sides:  http://i.imgur.com/RA3ml.png  It may even be a default theme in one of the distros, I can't remember.      I'm posting this plenty early so nobody misses it.  Soldering is a skill that any respectable geek should have :)  http://learn2solder.eventbrite.com/  This is what you'll be putting together: http://www.adafruit.com/products/14 and you get to keep it of course!  The cost of the class basically just covers the cost of the kit which we provide for you...            I've been using an ATTiny45/ULN2003 as a unipolar stepper driver for 12v, 0.8a operation.  Are there any ICs you guys could suggest for this?  I've seen many people say unipolar stepper drivers are easier to make, etc but all the ICs I can find are $10.  I've created this board for $1.50  Are there any cheap unipolar driver ICs out there that can drive 1.2A peak and maybe have step/dir/enable pins already?   http://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/StepperUnipolarCircuit  I'm using that circuit for some stepper drivers that I've made with attiny45s + ULN2003a -- they're incredibly cheap $3 to make per stepper driver, but I'd like to compress the circuit a little by hiding the 1k ohm resistors under the socket for the ULN2003.  Will 1/8 watt resistors fit under there?  Could I go smaller? -- I'm not totally against surface-mount resistors.  I'm using the top circuit, the 2-wire version.  I've been using 1/4 watt resistors (as is pretty standard with most things I throw on a perfboard) but there is no real current going through them.  It's just 5v logic.      Beginners-level documentation on 3D printers is...well...lacking.  Where can I find a rundown of what is going on with these things?  I hear all about different types of firmware, pronterface, etc etc etc but nobody's seemed to actually explain what all these pieces to the puzzle are.  It may be english to those who have been in it for a while, but there's no rundown of what does what?  FiveD, Teacup, Sprinter, etc...are firmwares, right?  They get loaded on the sanguino/arduino/etc?  The RAMPS board is just for ease of use with the pololu drivers?  Pronterface, ReplicatorG are the software for driving the firmware?  They talk serial to the firmware and send GCode? (In some cases a compressed version of gcode?)  How do you go about utilizing headless mode?  Which of these can handle different tool heads? (Extruder, Mill end, Laser cutter?)      I know that all the Arduino IDE does is basically add header files, compile, and upload "sketches" to the Arduino.  I'm interested in exactly what this entails and how I can set up an environment without the arduino IDE using an AVR compiler.  Does anyone have any resources on this?  What header files are added?  What compilers can be used?  What external program is/can be used to flash the ATMega328p?   http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5170/5239143959_ef66843ab7.jpg  It's the connector on the far-right marked ABCD.  ...I found the header it uses, here: http://www.mouser.com/search/ProductDetail.aspx?R=538-26-48-1245  But I can't seem to find a terminal block that would fit that 3.96mm spacing in order to replace that piece on the board.  Will a 4 screw 3.81mm spaced terminal block work?  Something like this: http://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/TE-Connectivity-AMP/284392-4/?qs=sGAEpiMZZMvZTcaMAxB2AM0YT%252bRZsuh%2fU2JmhF1L2cE%3d ??   Classes are filled.  If you want to be waitlisted, please email classes@familab.org  ~~Get your ticket here: http://orlandoarduino.eventbrite.com/~~   In this "all ages"* beginners class, you will learn the basics of the Arduino hardware, and how to install and use the Arduino software. You will build simple circuits that can be controlled with the Arduino and explore shields that are available to expand the Arduino. Bring your own Arduino and components, or pre-order an Arduino Starter Kit which includes an Arduino Uno, a USB cable, a solderless breadboard, jumper wires, and an assortment of switches, potentiometers, LEDs and resistors.  Members of [FamiLAB](http://www.familab.org)  - FREE (does not include hardware)     Non-Members - $20 (does not include hardware)     Optional Arduino Starter Kit (from adafruit industries) - $45      A laptop will be required to participate (in order to upload new programs to your Arduino). If you do not purchase the Arduino Starter Kit, you will need to bring Arduino hardware to participate. (I seriously recommend the kit though.)  If you don't know what the Arduino is, or even why you might be interested in this class at all, check out this link: http://hacknmod.com/hack/top-40-arduino-projects-of-the-web/   Since /r/Arduino is larger than /r/Microcontrollers I figured I'd ask here.  Some people at my local hackerspace want to create a waterfall printer, but rapidly gave up after seeing that solenoid valves were $13/pop and we would require a *lot* of them in order to get anything decent.  We've had some crazy ideas thrown around, like modifying pens to be valves, etc...  Even if you think your idea is stupid, mind throwing some my way on how I might be able to replace a solenoid valve with some mechanical/electromechanical process?  The only requirement is that it needs to keep the cost down...   http://imgur.com/a/glxYC  No, it wasn't a leaking pipe either.  The previous owner (no idea why) had actually cut the pipe off flush with the concrete block wall, and then drywalled over the cut pipe.  As soon as I can I'll take some pictures, because the stove is in place, the outlets are wired up, the fluorescent light is installed again, and the countertop is installed (I managed to get the whole countertop for $50)...  I had never hung cabinets, laid tile, or most of the other stuff I did to get this kitchen back in shape. :)   Free:     https://market.android.com/details?id=com.jrummy.liberty.toolbox      Pro:     https://market.android.com/details?id=com.jrummy.liberty.toolboxpro      I didn't give this app much credit until I downloaded it today.  I will be removing Titanium Backup,  ROM Manager, and Font Changer in favor of this all-in-one.  On top of the stuff it provides from TB and RM, it also provides things like screen density changer, battery icon changer, font changer (with a pre-downloaded selection of fonts), zipalign on startup, boot animation disable/changer, ad blocking, set wifi-scan interval (saves battery)...  Just all around this is an amazing app.  Pro will set you back $5, but Titanium Backup + ROM Manager together would set you back $13  *edit: Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but it doesn't look as if the backup function actually backs up the user data, but rather only the apk?  So Titanium Backup is still better in this regard...but ROM Manager is $6, this is $5...so still something worth looking at.*   Could someone give me some recommendations for a solution to playing sound clips?  I'd like to play something like 20 sound clips, each 10 seconds (max) length, and be able to easily just trigger them via the arduino.  Just seems like paying $70 for a shield for the Arduino to play sounds is a bit overkill.  Surely there is something simple like this out there?  Or maybe could someone point me in the direction of an IC that might be able to do something like this?   http://familab.org/blog/public-classes-events/  FamiLAB offers some really awesome classes and host some amazing events as well.  Most of these fill up early, so I just wanted to post this up here early in case there was any interest.  We've got an Open House on the Tuesday the 6th, but if that's not a good day for you, there can be a time setup for you to come out that's better suited to your schedule.  FamiLAB is also hosting the Retro Arcade down at the history center through September 25th, so you can come check out the things we do there as well!  It's not just for 18-35 year old male nerds either.  Sept 24th FamiLAB is doing a soft-hacking class with computer-aided sewing machines.  While that sounds incredibly chauvinistic, there are men interested in this kind of thing too and there's a good sized turnout expected.  (This one is free for everyone, so come on out! -- signup is at the link I provided at the top of this post)  Some of the classes are free (to everyone), others are only free to members.  Come on out and meet us!  We're friendly people who are into learning and making.  Some other cool classes FamiLAB hosts:     Soldering (MintyBoost kit provided)     Surface Mount Soldering (advanced soldering classes)     Arduino (a platform that can be used to build almost anything)     And many more will come, as we're setting up a system for anyone to host their own classes...  http://www.familab.org for more information, or the link provided up top is a direct link to the classes we have scheduled this month.    A lot of times once something gets popular, everyone just hijacks replies to whatever the top-most voted thing is.  By adding a parent-only comment view, maybe those actually replying to the OP could get a little more love for using the system as it should be.   https://market.android.com/details?id=org.adwfreak.launcher  Web-market doesn't seem to have updated the "whats new" section yet, but I just received the update a minute ago.  The dockbar that ADW has always had, is much like LauncherPros dockbar in that you can scroll it left and right, with the added functionality of being able to put as many shortcuts in the bar as you'd like.  Since this can now be set as the primary bar, those that were missing the feature from LP can now rejoice. :)  There is also a new folder and dockbar popup functionality.  Native system folders will pop up much like SiMi folder [Example here](https://www.gstatic.com/android/market/com.th.android.widget.SiMiFolderPro/ss-480-2-8).  And by adding a custom launcher action of "Show Catalog [X]" you'll get the same functionality.      The Teensy++2.0 seems to absolutely beat all over the Sanguino and the Arduino when it comes to flash/RAM/eeprom -- is there some major downside to this platform that I'm missing?   I'm working on a "RapStrap" -- a 3D printer that isn't able to print its own parts, but can be used as the basis to print parts for other 3D machines.  Basically enabling me to 'bootstrap' whatever next machine I decide to build. (Primarily also because I'm poor and unable to afford the proper parts for a RepRap/Makerbot etc anyhow)  Some pictures of *roughly* what I'm trying to build are located here:  http://reprap.org/wiki/WolfStrap-English  I built a 16"x16" wooden box, and to be quite honest, it was my very first time doing any type of carpentry whatsoever.  I'm actually very proud of myself for actually getting everything within an 1/8th an inch of perfect square.  Here's the result of just the box I made: http://i.imgur.com/C9ERR.jpg  Now, in the picture of my box, you can see the 2 drawer slides I bought.  Light-weight under-drawer slides.  They look about as close to the pictures on the reprap site as I could find.  After spending about an hour at Home Depot going through each of the slides and judging how much each one of them wobbled, these wobbled the least.  Well -- I'm now asking here for some suggestions.  You can guess why.  After attaching these to the edges of my frame, making sure they were perfectly parallel, and attaching the table as well, I feel that they are just *way way way* too stiff to be of any use.  I am going to be using the belt-drive version of this machine, so I won't have the added torque from the threaded rod. (the threaded-rod method has been reported to be way too slow for 3D printing, but good for CNC routing/dremeling)  I've started my own design in Google SketchUp and would like some input on it.  I've already burnt $10 on the (failed) drawer slides, so I'm trying to bump the DIY up a notch and create my own.  Shoot holes in my design.  Give me suggestions.  Here's some pictures: http://imgur.com/a/ShYSB  The idea is to take aluminum L-channel, and attach roller bearings as such that they grip the side of another piece of L channel, and also rest on the edge.  They won't be *super tight*, but they'll be snug.  Would it be better to grip from the outside, or inside like I have it?  Also, I figure if this design works ok, I can upgrade the edge-bearings to V bearings later on to maintain a little more stability.  If anyone has any better ideas, I'd love to hear them.  Amount of force required to move, and cost are the primary concerns.  I'd like to keep enough accuracy to print 3D objects but that comes secondary to everything else (because the more accurate you get, the more expensive you get)  A duplicate of this post is posted over on /r/DIY, but has had no answers, upvotes or downvotes even) after 12 hours so I figured I'd post here.  /r/DIY is more...home improvement-ish but I can't seem to find a reddit with a decent amount of eyeballs that would know anything about this kind of stuff.  *Edit: *I found at least 1 major flaw in my design: It won't work for anything except a flat axis.  No rotating it up, it would just fall off.  Argh; I gotta find something cheap, simple, and sturdy.   Palm-rejection is the ability for a capacitive touch screen to understand where the hand is resting on the screen and not register it.  For example when writing with a stylus, a capacitive screen without palm-rejection would think you had two fingers on the device.   Trying to setup mingw32 as the default compiler so I can stop doing      python setup.py install build --compiler=mingw32  And so pip will automagically use mingw32 as well.  (Since it just basically runs "setup.py install")  Problem is, I've placed a distutils.cfg under D:\Python27\Lib\distutils and it doesn't seem to be picking up the change.  Here is the contents of that .cfg file:      [build]     compiler=mingw32  What am I doing wrong?  Should this file be somewhere else?  If so, where?  (Windows 7 if that matters)   I mean, seriously.  What...the...fuck.  I recently got "tagged" with this bug, and I am now sitting on a 2.1, stock, unrooted, 100% BONE FRESH SBF flash, and Android OS is sitting at 57% battery usage after 4 hours off of the charger and I'm down to 70% battery.  My battery doesn't last more than a 14 hour stretch anymore (I used to be able to go 3 days).  As far as I'm aware nobody has had this bug until 2.3.4; and it's really infuriating.  What the fuck could persist SO HEAVILY as to completely and unforgivingly stick to the phone even after a full wipe like this?!  I was on 2.3.4 for a pretty long time previously, and this thing hit me out of the blue one night, draining my battery fully overnight.  Now, I *have* found a way to mitigate this bug: Turn off WiFi.  There's a problem I have with that: I don't have cell service on my Droid.  I've used it as a wifi-only device now for a year and a half.  I have never, ever had the Android OS process use more than...maybe 4/5% of my total battery.  Sleep-modes for wifi don't help the situation either.  never, never when plugged in, and when screen turns off doesn't help at all.  Being logged into google services also does not matter in the slightest, this is a bone-stock restore and I've done nothing except connect to wifi...there is no google account even associated with the device.  Therefore as well, there is no syncing going on.  No latitude.  Nothing.  Can anyone suggest what the hell is going on here?  I just don't understand how this could persist through a full SBF flash!  What, if anything, isn't touched by a full flash?  And how could a 2.3.4 build of CyanogenMod trigger it?  *edit:* Why the downvotes? O_o   I keep just wanting to jump into the complicated stuff.  I'm not really able to keep my interest at a low enough level to work through the things I should probably be learning.  I've done a lot of random crap.  I've implemented camera systems, I've toyed around with motion, etc but never really put anything together.  Is there something out there which starts from the basics, with a solid set of goals/design parameters that you can strive to achieve on your own while working toward a more refined skillset?  Like for example:   First game -- Implement a windowed game, with an image at the bottom controlled by keyboard, that will catch randomly falling objects.     Second game -- Instead of catching falling objects, bounce a ball into breakable blocks at the top of the screen Third game -- Implement a full screen game of pong, and add a trail of 5 balls to the master ball.      In short...I need some sort of curriculum to follow, preferably language-agnostic, with a gradual enough difficulty for me to figure out new problems on my own         Doesn't look like your subreddit has any convenient links in the side bar.  Since I'm new to flashing the Wii, would someone kindly point me in a direction to get started? (Say, how to find out which system menu I have, etc?)  I just recently bought the Wii that I have...at least within the past 6 months, so I suspect it's pretty up to date.  What will be my options for breaking this thing open?      Long time player.  Played since beta, non-stop, through all expansions, waited in line for each of them except cataclysm (online distribution ftw).  When blizzard introduced the dungeon finder, as a tank, I was absolutely ecstatic.  Obviously verses DPS this meant no more waiting and I could instant que for anything.  Days and days of dungeon running went by, and I even rolled many many alts and geared them up quickly because I didn't have to wait 3+ hours in order to get what I wanted to do, done.  I was largely happy until recently.  Dungeon finder, over time, has caused a lot of the reason I played World of Warcraft to be diminished over time.  Sure, most people will say "WoW got boring and repetitive" or whatever excuse they may use, but I largely played WoW because I enjoyed the company of the people I met.  Lately, I realized (after quitting WoW just prior to 4.2) that I didn't have any WoW friends anymore.  And it was getting continually harder to make them.  All of the friends that I had played with over the past 5+ years were gone now.  That wasn't a problem in the past, because largely, I made new ones regularly.  Except now, my friends list was barren, filled with a bunch of names but all grayed out, all the time.  I played way more often than I had in the past recently, so...why was I so lonesome?  Then it hit me.  Even through the tediousness of getting groups together was off-putting back in the beginnings of Wrath of the Lich King, it also meant that in order to speed that process up, you would often need to keep in touch with people that were skilled and on at the same time as you.  As you ran more and more with these same people, friendships would grow and you'd have a fun time.  Oftentimes, this wasn't just how I met new friends, but was also the way that I found guilds that I fit in with.  Ever since dungeon finder was released, I had no reason to group with my friends, and my friends no reason to group with me either.  When someone wanted to get something done, they just sat in the queue.  It was often much easier to press a button on the UI and wait your turn.  Over time, I feel a lot of people who played WoW for the social interaction, lost touch with those friends just as I have, and quit, often leaving yet more people without people to play with.  The dungeon finder system was such a great idea, but ultimately it has a huge drawback.  You are depersonalized even moreso within the system because there is no need to ever communicate with the people you run dungeons with ever again.  This leads, ultimately I believe, to people quitting the game not because the game has somehow bored them, or because they've mastered it...but rather because there is no incentive for those friendships to exist.  After playing, non stop -- without a single months missing revenue from me since the release of WoW, I have actually quit playing and cancelled my account.  I miss it, but not enough to come back.  I honestly think this is also why Blizzard is hemorrhaging so many customers at the moment.  However, I believe there is a way to change it.  Blizzard has already altered the dungeon finder to attempt to find people from within your own realm, and match you with them.  This is a great start.  However I have a couple of ideas of my own as well.  First off, the premium-feature for RealID inviting friends to a cross-realm group to queue for dungeons, should be changed to a non-premium, and friend based invite system which spans all realms.  The friend system should be expanded realm-wide much like the RealID system currently works.  This will work for blizzard better than the premium subscription based service and will ultimately foster friendships and more people playing WoW.  This works better, because I feel over time, more people will continue their subscriptions, and also transfer servers more often in order to join their newly found friends. (Thus resulting in more revenue than the premium-system would bring in)  Secondly, I feel that grouping with people from a like-realm, should grant you some sort of 'head start' within the LFG system.  This may sound good in theory, but may not work in practice.  The first suggestion I had may solve the problems all by itself, rendering this idea worthless.  I also feel the fact that it's almost impossible to form a new guild is causing a lot of the same problems, but I'll save that for another post.  What are your opinions?  Have many of you stopped playing also because it seems harder to establish friendships within your realm?  **tl;dr**: Dungeon finder makes it less of a necessity to acquire and establish friendships within your realm and thusly  is making a bunch of people "bored" and quit the game because they don't have any more friends to play with.  Blizzard should allow cross-realm group inviting and cross-realm friends lists in order to accommodate new friendships.  **Without an extra $3.99/month fee in order to use the new cross-realm inviting system, and without having to use RealID (which random people from LFD are reluctant to share)**  *for idiots skimming:* I'm not saying dungeon finder is a bad thing (hell, it's quite possibly the best single feature that has ever happened to WoW at all), or *blaming* anything here...I'm merely saying they need to open up the LFD system for cross-realm inviting and they also need to make friending outright cross-realm as well for facilitation of that.  I've also done the raid thing basically my *entire WoW career*, I've cleared every raid WoW has available pre 4.2, to the point where the guilds I am in, log in on tuesday...clear everything...and didn't log in until the following tuesday.  You don't exactly make strong friendships in these types of guild.  It's raid...then you don't see anyone for the rest of the week.      http://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/iqwew/i_cant_poop_in_my_bathroom/   Most projects, engines, bindings, etc seem to get 1/2 way finished and then abandoned.  Any articles that do exist are way out of date.  Are there any worthwhile game engines (that actually have some documentation?!) that focus on 2D?  Why does this area of python programming seem like a ghost town?  Is there something I'm missing?   or making an alternative to them?  I am far too stupid. (read: Uneducated in C, Pyrex, Cython, etc)  I managed to get as far as pyrex generating a .c file and then spewing 96 or so errors at me once I tried to compile it.  Initially there was an error, "Cannot assign type float to short" so I changed line 525 from      decShorts1[i] = decFloats1[i]  to      decShorts1[i] = shortdecFloats1[i]  in the speex.pyx file.  It generated afterwards, but fuck if I know if that *actually* worked or not.  Now I'm getting errors about missing python.h, bla bla bla, I'm sure I don't have the proper development environment setup for this, and I'm not sure I'd really even know where to start.  I know most of you are very busy, and probably don't have the time on your hands for such a thing for a lowly peon such as myself, and I don't fully expect anyone to pick this up -- but I figured it couldn't hurt to ask.  Worst that happens is I get downvoted into oblivion.  I'm using Python 2.7 on Windows, if that matters.  If anyone happens to take up the challenge, I thank you in advance.  Source available here:  http://www.freenet.org.nz/python/pySpeex/pySpeex-0.2.tar.gz  Or if it's easier, an explanation of how to compile this myself wouldn't be bad either.  Maybe I can trod through it.   http://pastebin.com/NcUURvXC  Am I doing this right? (Ignore Iterator...it does nothing.)  Is there a better way?  If I split MainMenuState/IntroState into their own file, would it even be able to find the global variable? (I know global vars are bad.  Bad bad bad...)  Can I allow my game states to change the state of the program without using a global?  Edit: If possible, please don't just provide a link.  I've read a bunch of different state-machine stuff and it's just not clicking with me yet. :(   Or is this something that doesn't work yet? -- I know Pyglet works, but I can't seem to find any information on getting PyGame installed (I've got pip installed, but it seems to error out on installing PyGame under PyPy)  btw: Windows machine.   EEEbuntu is pretty much dead (their repo has gone missing), so is the Aurora project.  I really don't feel like dealing with the hassle of running Arch on this thing, but what was really great about EEEbuntu/Aurora was the unified manager that was included.  Are there any distros that properly sleep, properly hibernate, properly turn off the synaptic touchpad when typing, support the multi-touch functionality of the touchpad (pinch to zoom, etc), can toggle wifi without breaking it, actually have the function-keys usable, properly shuts off screen when lid is closed, etc?            The launcher is only one tiny little part of these manufacturer skins.  Just because you use LauncherPro, or ADW, or GoLauncher or whatever launcher you use -- doesn't mean the rest of your phone isn't affected by Sense/TouchWiz/Motoblur, etc.  When manufacturers build these custom skins, they change a lot.  They change everything from graphics, to hardware level drivers, to the phone application, contacts, the underlying framework, notification bar, lock screen and even running services.  The only way to get rid of these is to install an AOSP (Android Open Source Project) based ROM (CyanogenMod is the most popular). -- Even if you use a custom dialer, custom contacts, custom music player, etc you still haven't gotten rid of that skin.  It will always run in the background.  Since it's part of the framework, you can't even get rid of these things individually if you so wished. (For example if you got rid of the phone application on a sense rom and replaced it with another dialer app, your phone app would force close)  I've seen a ***LOT*** of people who don't quite seem to understand this in /r/Android and it just creates confusion and spreads misinformation.  I am just posting this in an attempt to clarify some android-related subject matter...   What's the best way to "broadcast" something to multiple classes which inherit (for example) a move function?  I'm trying to make it so in my RPG; if I press left, right, up, down -- each of the character objects gets passed in the event -- I am trying to be nice and clean with all my code, and I'm wondering if there is a way I can avoid having to call each instance of each class in order to send a message (so to speak).  Or maybe there's a way to get a list of all the instances which inherit said superclass and go through a loop to pass the event/message?   I've got a 2tb NAS box, that honestly, I just fill with whatever I can fill it with.  It's starting to get kinda full.  I don't know what to delete, or what not to delete and I'd honestly rather not even think about it.  Are there any programs, or filesystems that would allow me to just throw files at this machine and have it automatically delete whatever is the oldest-accessed item or maybe the least-accessed? (I wouldn't want it to delete a movie I haven't watched in 5 months, but that has been watched every 6 months for 5 years previous for example)   Disclaimer: Python/PyGame, Attempting to code a JRPG from scratch, No expectations on this being a small or quick project, No Engine, doing it for the learning experience.  I know how to animate objects in pygame, I know how to do graphics in pygame, I know how to do basic collision detection and have worked through so many pong clone tutorials now that it's not even funny, but once I start getting into object-oriented territory I find myself hopelessly lost and there's really not any good information on the net in regards to how I would lay out a fully fleshed out game.  Everything I come across is imperative programming, with no object oriented-ness to it except in regards to inhereting the pygame sprite object and animating that way.  Right now, I have a "Game" class, which has \_\_init\_\_, handle_input, update, render, and run (my game loop).  I know probably the first thing I need to start on is the game state management, but I'm not sure if I'm laying this out the right way.  I expect that I'm actually putting *too much* code into 1 class and not abstracting it enough.  Here's a pastebin of what I've got so far : http://pastebin.com/kQTR2mB3 (hint: It's basically just the standard PyGame skeleton and nothing else). The hiccup I'm having is abstraction.  I've done OO a bunch, but haven't really done much inheritance (at least, not within my own code.  Inheritance I've had to deal with was just inheriting classes from an API such as wxWindows).  How do I go about laying this thing out?  I haven't even thrown fill/blit/update/flip calls into my code because I don't want to have to rearrange it all later.  I'm not really caught up on the "how do I actually make things work" part...but rather the..."How do I arrange this?" part...  Any help would be appreciated on understanding how this is normally abstracted.  Ditto as far as game-state management goes as well...  As far as characters in the game world, I've seen things done a bunch of different ways.  I've seen one person code their main character, then abstract out NPCs and even sub-characters from the main character...then in another game, I saw the exact opposite.  A general "Character" class, with NPCs being given their own 'wander' AI for wandering the city, the main character also inherited this class, but movement was keyboard driven.  I like the "Character" class, with the main character inheriting and extending this class but I'm not even to that point yet.  I need a better idea on how I should be organizing to facilitate game state management, etc...   Just discovered these bad boys.  I am amazingly ANAL when it comes to box depth, the plugs sitting at the right depth, and the cover plate not floating or being tugged into the wall.  Have been replacing the electrical in this 1960s house in my spare time for about a week now (while also re-building the kitchen, re-plumbing too) and have now replaced about 7 boxes.  http://www.homedepot.com/buy/electrical-electrical-boxes-conduit-fittings-boxes-brackets/carlon-1-gang-21-cu-in-adjustable-electrical-box-182136.html   https://market.android.com/developer?pub=Emulators+Games  Shark SNES Emulator, Panther SNES Emulator, Hamster SNES Emulator, Eagle SNES Emulator, Scorpion GBC Emulator, Viper GBC Emulator, Tough SNES, Rough SNES, Hawk SNES, Jaguar SNES...the list goes on and on for about 7 pages  Looks like a target to avoid...  If any one knows of a good way to get this guy off the market, please attempt to.   There are some really messed up things that sometimes happen in the hardware with Android phones.  Things like the Xperia Play having a headphone jack on the side of the device (which makes it horrible for pocketing when listening to music)  What are some hardware guidelines that you would like manufacturers to follow?  I'll list a couple of my suggestions:  * Headphone jack on top (or bottom) of device. (Pocketability) * Notification LED on all phones.  Nobody should be able to skip on this. (It adds virtually no cost and is one of the most useful features on Android!) * If there's a kickstand: Charging/USB-port on top or bottom of device. (Putting the port on the same side?  Wtf is with that?) * Recessed Sleep/Wake button (Prevent accidental power-ons in pocket.) * A unified Menu/Home/Back/Search layout would be nice. (but not really necessary.)  For those of you saying Google shouldn't do any of this: Google already has both [Software and Hardware Guidelines](http://static.googleusercontent.com/external_content/untrusted_dlcp/source.android.com/en/us/compatibility/android-2.3-cdd.pdf) in place for manufacturers to adhere to.   I have completely forgotten its name or any portion thereof, the best I can do is explain the gameplay of it:  Back in the AOL days, when 28.8k modems were the best you could buy, I had what I'm guessing was a DOS game, because when I fired it up it swapped resolutions on Win 95/98.  This game was a flying game, but it was 2D, top down.  Graphics were slightly pixelated but you could have called them 'high res' for the time they were in.  The game was amazingly smooth, and a lot like  http://www.classicgamesarcade.com/game/21621/Raiden-Space-Ship-Game.html  But better graphics, the controls were WASD + Mouse (wasd controlled propulsion of the ship), the mouse pointer controlled the rotation of the ship (ship pointed at a little targeting marker), and there were maps you had to go around and grab keys, or destroy enemies to get to the next zone.  The ship could either grab powerups, or they were purchasable (I can't remember that detail) but there were a LOT of them, I remember that much.  A lot of the maps were jungle-themed...lots of trees, lots of little places where it didn't look like you could fly, but were able to fly 'under the canopy' to get to, usually by discovering the reverse side and seeing some empty spot.  Does anyone else remember a game like this? -- I've searched for 3 years using varying terms, and cannot seem to find anything even remotely similar.   Or anyone know of any libraries which would help me start making one?  Specifically some sort of speex binder library that's actually up to date? (The latest one I can find is nearly 8 years old.)   I "know" python.  I'm still an amateur but I'm nowhere close to freshly minted anymore.  I'm really interested in diving deeper but I don't have any itches to scratch (which has typically fueled my learning expeditions) except for my love of gaming.  I know there are a couple of things I need to learn if I want to be a good coder:  Code management.  SVN/Git or some sort of code management -- anything out there that isn't simply a list of commands but maybe teaches you some sort of work flow, how to deal with multiple maintainers, etc?  GIT is a preference, seeing as a ton of projects are migrating over to it from SVN...  Code organization.  Most of my code has been single-file, less than 300 lines of code.  I know that upon scaling up I will need to organize and learn how to utilize code efficiently across multiple files -- this seems like a deeper understanding of python and I've run across some terms that I am pretty sure are part of this, such as "name mangling" (in order to avoid naming conflicts I assume) etc; Any good resources for this or once my code just gets unwieldy enough do I just start splitting portions off into their own .py and importing them?  Math.  Gaming requires a lot of math -- I've done a bunch of stuff on Project Euler but none of it teaches me the concepts I really need, it just teaches me to think in a logical manner and figure out a problem.  Linear Algebra is what I've been told I need to learn (and obviously geometry as well later on) -- what is a good source for this in relation to python?  Other actual game-related concepts/methods of operation, etc -- I know about InventWithPython -- I didn't learn via that method so implementing some of the earlier stuff is a bore and it kind of stops short of doing anything interesting.  I will go through it anyways and code up the examples but where's the juicy stuff as far as tutorials, and learning online?  Tile-based map handling (both character restricted to the grid and non-grid restricted movement)?  AI?  User Interface?  A couple of ideas are an RPG (how typical of me!), I've also thought of doing a [zuma](http://www.popcap.com/games/free/zumasrevenge) clone, maybe a [PvZ](http://www.popcap.com/games/free/pvz) clone, or a [Robot Unicorn Attack](http://games.adultswim.com/robot-unicorn-attack-twitchy-online-game.html) clone...libraries with good documentation for this kind of thing would help a lot as well.  p.s.

 I honestly don't think it will be that much more noticeable just because it's green, it's already very noticeable when it passes and very few people have ever seen it.  If you use mirrors, it will only be visible right after dusk and before dawn, just as it is now, hardly a constant reminder.  In the case of a light beam, very few people would see it as it points at them in the night,  you'll still need to know exactly when it's going overhead.  Just my 2 cents...   What we see when we look up at the ISS is light reflecting over all the surfaces it has, especially the solar panels, so it can usually be seen by a large area of land. A beam of light would be visible only to the people it's pointed at, and even then only barely, compared to the rest of the light coming from it.  I think you would see better results just by getting the message out on how to spot it. My mind was pretty thoroughly blown the first time I saw it, now I show it to people every chance I get.   Edit: I guess that when the ISS is completely in the dark, you could see only the light if it's aimed at you, but it would have to be pretty darn powerful to be even slightly visible.   It would be much better to use big, possibly coloured, mirrors.  Which doesn't sound like very useful payload.   I think the people who are inspired when they see the ISS passing overhead don't really care what color it shines. I personally don't, white is just as awesome to me.   They did translate it correctly. Well, not the conspiracy theorists, but the people who actually study the Mayan calendar. The Baktun does end on December 21, that's perfectly true.  It's funny that people use this "leap year" rubbish to dismiss the doomsday rubbish, as both sides would see they're wrong after 2 minutes of actual research.   I don't see how nuclear power can be "statistically safer" than solar power.   ["The Meaning of Liff"](http://folk.uio.no/alied/TMoL.html) by Douglas Adams has a great section on this, read from CORRIEARKLET to CORRIEMUCHLOCH. I tried copy/pasting but it turned into a huge mess.    Why "from the Hobbit"? Will he be featured in the movie? He's my favorite character from the books (hence the username), would make me very happy to see him somehow squeezed into the movie. (I also immediately thought of him when I saw the picture, btw)   You can find them [here](http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastchancetosee/sites/radio/). I listened to them a long time ago, but when I try now I get the message "not available in your area". Hopefully it works for you. I try to get my hands on everything related to Last Chance to See, there's also a cd-rom with all the pictures they took that I managed to get my hands on recently.   Exactly, I personally dislike well-done meat, but I just can't understand the people saying "he got what he asked for." You certainly can make a well-done steak without burning it.

What I really care about is the explanation.  It would have been nicer if they sent it *before* I inquired about the shipping delay and of course it would have been even nicer if, when I inquired, I was told this instead of ["We have plenty in stock"](http://www.reddit.com/r/Silverbugs/comments/2i93su/interesting_email_from_provident_regarding/). But I probably confused their customer service folks when I asked "Do you currently have the RCM 10 oz bar in stock? If not, when do you expect a new shipment?"  But hey, kudos to Joe Merrick, Provident's President/CEO for being upfront about the situation.  Can't wait for that magnet.  **Update** My order finally shipped out on 10-10.         From Provident's automated email that goes out with order status:  *Your order is in the queue to be picked and shipped. Nearly 90% of orders are shipped within 3 business days after confirmed payment and nearly 98% of orders are shipped within 5 business days.*  I rolled into that lucky 2% today (5 days past "confirmed payment") and inquired about when they think my order might ship out.  This response came in this evening:  *We apologize for the delay. You ordered a very popular RCM 10 oz. bar. We do not like seeing orders going beyond the 5 business days. I have put a free rush on your order, which will push your order to the front of the batch with the other orders that have a rush. We are doing our best to get these products out to you as quickly as possible.*  So it sounds like they don't have any RCM 10 oz bars in stock [even though they're advertised as being in stock](http://www.providentmetals.com/10-ounce-rcm-royal-canadian-mint-9999-silver-bar.html).  So if anyone has ordered any RCM 10 oz bars recently, you might be seeing a shipping delay from Provident.  Pretty disappointing, but on the bright side I'm sure they'll throw in a magnet with my order.  **Update:** When their email came in, I replied asking if they had the bars in stock.  This was their reply that came in last night:  *We have plenty in stock. We are shipping out orders in the order they were placed into confirmed payment. We expect your order to ship early next week going off of the number of orders in front of your order.*  I ordered two bars, still seems odd why there would be this big shipping delay if they have plenty in stock. I mean how long does it take to pick and pack an order from their warehouse? On the price dip I'm sure their orders are up and maybe that's coupled with staffing issues, who knows...Still seems a bit fishy to me.  I also love the fact they gave me a "free rush" which costs nothing. I mean, you can't buy a rush order.  Not free shipping (credit) for the next order, a "free rush" in the queue, lol.         Spot is $16.73 as I type this.  Who is not buying now and why? Are you worried it's going to drop to $X? Are you a short-time flipper?

The point is to determine whether it's worth the trip to go look at beforehand, as it's "somewhat" local to me. If it were in the same town, I'd just go take a look.  When I asked the seller if he knew the make/model #, he replied with:  "The # on this safe is a sticker. It reads 702 in big bold numbers and 10247 in smaller font."  I don't seem to be having much luck via google.  Does anyone have any idea what make/model this might be? I was hoping for a serial # as I imagine if I called American Security with that, they would have a record of what type of safe. Seller can't seem to locate any other markings.  *These are the only other identifying photos he could get from the seller:*  *http://imgur.com/a/RXxgy*  *The safe is reportedly 15-20 years old.*               http://i.imgur.com/pdELfLc.jpg  For those that were in the game back then, how was the market different back in 2010/2011?

Cool piece to add if you're looking for a kilo - great time to pick one up.      I'm doing some window shopping at Scottsdale for a possible purchase on the dip.  I have a loaded up shopping cart and I'm in the checkout section now.  The payment method is either:  * Bank wire transfer * ACH (electronic funds transfer)  I have the ACH selected but it isn't giving me any info for what that ACH info is for paying online.  I'm looking at a screen with my shipping address, payment method, order summary and a "submit order" button.  I don't really want to just blindly click the submit order button.  Has anyone gone through this?  How does the ACH option work through their shopping cart?                     Being tapped out in the silver fund$ department.

It isn't like my order is really large, either, it would definitely fit in a medium flat rate USPS box.  I hate UPS deliveries, they are incredibly inconvenient for me to have to go pick those up.  **Update**: Tracking number shows delivery this Friday.  UPS.com shows the customer center isn't available for a Saturday pickup and they're only open for a pickup M-F until 6pm.  I can't make this time as the god damned customer center is over 20 miles away (one way). No way I'd make it in rush hour traffic. This means I have to take Friday off to sign for my package.  Thanks Provident.  So now every order I make through them I need to contact them beforehand to find out if they can ship USPS.  Looks like I'm done with Provident.

They look to take personal checks as well, which is all I do (for the $ discount).  Anyone done business with these guys before?

US Mint doesn't seem to indicate which carrier they use to ship, just that:  The United States Mint selects from a number of carriers to deliver your package.  It looks like I'm getting the expedited shipping (because I am such a high roller):  Orders with Merchandise valued at $300 or more with a standard delivery option chosen will receive a complimentary upgrade to Expedited Shipping.  I really would like this to come USPS as that is so much more convenient for me. Anyone have any recent ordering experience from the US Mint? What carrier was used and what was the shipping method?

I'm having a hard time finding the actual count for those rolls.  It looks to be 20, but can someone confirm this?  If I order 20, will I get the shrinkwrap roll?  I really want that for stacking purposes because it would just be easier.  I really don't want to end up with 20 loose capsules.  Anyone order any Lunar Series in those shrinkwrap rolls?

What do you all think of this -vs- a gold eagle/buffalo/maple/krug/et al? I'd like to get an ounce of gold by years end and I've been spying this.  Seems like there might be some increased premium/collector value over time compared to standard 1 oz coins?  I'm thinking start with this one and hopefully keep up with the other releases...A save the whales, collect the whole set thing.            From my regular vendor list, Provident has them. APMEX and Monarch have spotted ones, though Monarch doesn't have enough for a tube.  I figure if I'm going to get them (they have a higher premium) might as well spend a little more to get higher quality.  Anyone know of any other online vendors (that take personal checks) that have tubes of 2012 1 oz Canadian Moose?      Not talking about new/mint-direct stuff. If you or I were to sell a couple 10 oz bars, a tube of generics or gov-backed coins, *whatever*, to APMEX, Provident, JM Bullion, Monarch, et al...What do they do to verify that silver before reselling it?

I'm looking to order a full set of Koalas from APMEX tonight.  They look to run from 2007-2014 and all years look to be in stock.  Each Koala detail page indicates they're in capsules and have a diameter of 40.6 mm.  I'm assuming all the diameters listed are really the capsule's diameter?  I ask because I'm looking for a tube to put them in.  I don't really like [the tube APMEX has for sale that says it's fits 40 mm](http://www.apmex.com/product/15341/sure-safe-silver-coin-container) (though it doesn't say 40.6mm).

I'm building a proof-of-concept app for a friend and I'm using YQL to scrape 3rd party website data/content.  YQL makes this so ridiculously easy I had it working literally in 10 minutes.  Started with two 3rd party domains and when I went to add another, it wasn't pulling in the content.  Looks like that content is populated dynamically, so when YQL goes to scrape it (via xpath), it doesn't return anything.  Does anyone know if you can do this with YQL?  I'd love to keep using it because, as I said, it was so ridiculously easy to flesh out a prototype.

Initially, I plan on doing it old-school style, i.e., a notebook I keep with my stack.  Basically I'm just going to document orders like the screenshot above and at the bottom of each page run a total of ounces and cost per page.  I was thinking of perhaps adding an **ordered** date and **spot** price columns. Not sure if I really care to track spot price as I can ballpark that via any generic purchases and the last two columns. Might be something to add, though.  I can average out my cost per ounce by month, quarter or year, which would probably be interesting to track over time.  I'd probably start a "sell" ledger when the time comes as well, document those there and adjust the purchase book accordingly.  What do you guys think?

Overall, no big deal, but it obviously leaves an impression.  Their customer service is very responsive, though, I worked with Jillian there.

Can't believe the size of the box these came in as when I opened it up, [I was a little surprised at the size of the bars](http://imgur.com/a/y1bi7). I thought they'd be a little bigger.  Solid APMEX experience except for the signature deal.         They can't fulfill my 2014 roll of Philharmonics on an order I placed on 6/22/14.  They offered to combine some years to fill the tube but when I order a full tube of year X, I want a full tube of year X (still sealed). They're apparently not getting restocked anytime soon, either. They also offered to exchange it for something else, but it isn't like I had time to go shopping while at work. Besides, I wanted those Phils.  They're sending me a refund, assuming it'll be in with the order, but I didn't confirm this.

CRISS CROSS   My listing package is a video virtual your ($200), Home Warranty Supplied for buyer ($400), agreement to have the house open every Saturday/Sunday for the first 6 weeks and I never use a lock box . If an agent wants to show the property I'm always present because who knows the house better, the listing agent or an agent that's never been inside. With that said I never negotiate commission and a lot of Realtors list for 1-2% and never do anything. Really get what you pay for.   That's like 2-3 days ago on Shore Drive we had a helicopter, multiple boats, and 2 cruisers parked on the Lesner. I was listening on the police scanner from my place and they were looking for a kiteboarder until it was too dark to continue the search. My girlfriend works for WTKR and I asked her and she never heard anything and I never saw anything mentioning the search.    Complete stock newb so be gentle but when I look this stock up I can't find it.   Great post for a newbie like myself. Question... If I still purchased $1000 when it was .10 and I sold it at $20.00 and I was an unknowing purchaser. Could I technically sell and walk away making a huge profit? Or because they are bouncing back and forth would it make it difficult for me to sell?   Thats rouggggh!    I just wish on Monday I put my life savings into CYNK and on Thursday I sold it all off, my weekend would have been delightful   There's plenty of options I'm a Realtor in Virginia Beach - shoots a pm with some contact info and I'll help you out .

I just put a $1000 into GTAT, any other company stocks to look out for?    Where in Va just out of curiousity?    I've put it down for clients before. As mentioned the preparation is everything. I spent 2 days cleaning (intense cleaning, acid etching to pull up the protective layer put on it) but actually putting the epoxy down only only took me a few hours (2 car garage). If you're interested I'll post some pictures of the finished product. We matched the shudders and people loved it. The house sold in 5 weeks, I'm not going to say that's why but it definitely helped the home show well.    	31

 Wish someone made or recontinued this thread:  http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/28whcw/what_is_your_worst_poop_horror_story/   As a fellow gamer, I know what it's like to drift away from an internet friend. Your experience really reflects on my time in the gaming community. You should find this Kelbertinghoess Flappers dude and talk to him. Catch up on the good ol' times before it becomes too late.   Found out about reddit when I decided to type in "worst poop stories" on google just for the kicks... Never in my life have I laughed so hard for such an amount of time   Kamina from Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. Bulat and Sheele from Akame Ga Kill. Kana and the mother's death from Parasyte. And many other surprise sudden deaths in the animes I've seen.   What happens if both sides got pissed on?   Now that's downright cruel. At first I thought she was being extreme but that takes things to a whole new level. My parents more specifically my mom used to resort to physical beatings as punishment and at times I was left with marks on my body. I had a few friends ask me about it as they know my Mom is downright crazy sometimes but I just shrugged it off as an injury I received while biking or something. However, I knew at the very least my mom was concerned for my future and had intentions of me getting into a good college. Your mom is awful and I hope no one has to go through anything you did. I'm glad to hear you're doing better now *internet hug* :)   Crazy ass muggles these days....   Wow, I really feel for you dude! My parents were on the opposite side of the spectrum compared to yours. My mother rather than forcing me to sleep at 8 pm every night, forced me to complete all my school work and other activities even if it means going to sleep at 4 AM. There were other few similarities as she would blame me for being sick, calling me a dumbass everytime I got a cold or a fever. My mother could care less about my social problems, if I received an A or lower she would give me hell for it and most of the time it ended up with severe beatings. I remembered she whipped me with my Dad's belt when i was in 6th grade for getting a C. Part of me feels like that both our parents were trying to be "good" parents but ended up being way too extreme in their child rearing.   Well at least you're fine now! :D   And who gave you the authority to tell him that? He has every right if not more to reproduce than the rest of us.   Oh shit....      Same here! I never learned to spell definately correctly until the 10th grade.      One line from Rebirthing by Skillet is "I come alive somehow" but I always sing it as "I paralyzed a cow"   /u/StickleyMan has more   Freedom of Speech.   /u/StickleyMan has the most comment karma, link karma, and trophies I've ever seen for one redditor.   I never felt full support from my parents in anything I wanted to accomplish. They simply brushed it off or they tried to act like they cared. I never had a social life either which is another thing I greatly resent them for.   The only thing I'm looking forward to is that I'll be in college in less than two years so I don't have to deal with this kind of nonsense. I picked up Reddit actually because it's my form of relief from my parents. To them, Reddit looks like an educational website or something like Wikipedia lol   I couldn't agree more with you. My mother and father have always used an extremely authoritative/restrictive child rearing practice. I was not allowed to have friends over, go to a friends house, and at times I wasn't even allowed to go outside. My mother also has an anger management issue. If she found me doing anything not education related she would flip out and cuss while throwing furniture at me. My dad tried to understand things from my point of view but at the end of the day he just sides with my mom. Because of this, I never really had too many friends, only a few close ones that really help me. While its not direct, when or if I ever have children I've made a vow to myself I would not put them in any form of abuse and restriction my parents have put me in.      Wow! I really feel for you dude. That's exactly the situation for my parents. My mothers a bipolar psycho bitch sometimes and my dad would always side with her no matter the situation. The amount of verbal AND physical abuse my sister and I received is ridiculous. Aside from that she was extremely uptight about the rules and wouldn't let me out of the house for nearly anything except for school and SAT classes. I was never allowed to play games or hang out with friends. One time I was caught playing a computer game when she wasn't around and she began throwing furniture all around the house and at me all the while cussing at me in her native language, saying how I'm a complete utter failure and I would never accomplish anything succesful in my lifetime. My dad just says it's our fault for my mom being crazy.   Love should come to everybody naturally. With that being said, there isn't really anything you should do to obtain love. The only thing you have to do is be yourself and wait for the time to come.   Thanks for clarifying. I agree with you on how their wages should be higher.   Really? Tipping waiters and waitresses is a common courtesy. They make next to minimum wage and actually majority of their income comes from the tips they receive from their customers. And honestly giving 15% of your bill as a tip isn't really asking for too much. Most people think working as a waiter is a simple job until they actually do it. Theres A LOT more work involved than you would think.   I agree with several of the responses here however the thing that irks me the most is when people compare you to others. A constant example would be my parents when they say "Why can't you be like that Asian kid over there who takes 7 different AP classes, has a 4.9 GPA, 2400 SAT Score, president of 4 different clubs, and captain of 3 different varsity level sports". We're all born differently but does that make us any less than each other? No. Everyone has their own strong points and weaknesses. Those who fail to acknowledge that truth are forever ignorant.   My eighth grade Language Arts teacher. She was racist and despite claiming she didn't have favorites, it was clear that she favored white people over ANY othe race. For example, she asked a question and called on me. I answered her question only for her to say it's completely wrong and incorrect. 10 seconds later, a sterotypical blonde hair blue eyes white girl raises her hand and SAYS ALMOST THE EXACT SAME THING I SAID and the teacher congratulates her and showers her in compliments. I'm not the only one who hated her, nearly all my other classmates despised her and wished she would quickly retire.    I have two, You Found Me - The Fray and How to Save a Life - The Fray. Those songs has gotten me through several of my darkest moments in life, even through various times when I was about to attempt suicide. Even now, I still listen to it whenever I'm going through some tough times.  Heres what Isaac, one of the songwriters of this song, said about it: ""You Found Me is a tough song for me. Its about the disappointment, the heart ache, the let down that comes with life. Sometimes you're let down, sometimes you're the one who lets someone else down. It gets hard to know who you can trust, who you can count on. This song came out of a tough time, and I'm still right in the thick of it. There's some difficult circumstances my family and friends have been going through over the past year or so and can be overwhelming. It wears on me. It demands so much of my faith to keep believing, keep hoping in the unseen. Sometimes the tunnel has a light at the end, but usually they just look black as night. This song is about that feeling, and the hope that I still have, buried deep in my chest."       Well said. I completely agree with you but the OP should also contact the police and notify them about this situation.    If I were in his shoes, I would be extremely pissed at my parents. If what the OP said was true on how it was a "small incident", his father should be the one apologizing to him. His father already broke the law by kicking him out of the house before 18 and without giving him at least any notice. These kinds of things are ridiculous.    Thanks, I'll keep this in mind. What they don't understand is that I can balance my work and have fun. I don't need them nagging me about homework, violin, SAT's, or anything else. I think I'm perfectly capable of handling my own activities. Another thing they don't understand is the concept of relaxing or having fun. I doubt there is any human being that can work nearly every hour of the day without having some form of break. In the past I talked to them about this issue and the only reply I got was "Sure, instead of working on schoolwork we'll let you practice your violin for 1-2 hours". Not only that, my mother is sort of a control freak, everything HAS to go her way otherwise she'll literally scream and throw furniture. It's nearly impossible to negotiate with her. My dad I'll admit is a bit more understanding but at the end of the day he still sides with my mother. Really the only thing that keeps me going is the fact that I'll be in college next year. Of course I won't go crazy and party, do drugs, or any other of those things.    I'm actually the president of my school's Chess Club. It's the only actual activity they'll allow me to participate because chess is an intellectual game. However when I'm home, they won't let me play any games, not even chess.   Before I get started, I'm not trying to elicit sympathy. I only want advice and if anyone else can relate to this please tell me your feelings. My parents, mostly my mother, doesn't allow me to play any kind of games. They keep a close eye on my grades and expect me to be doing work every hour I'm awake whether its completing my schoolwork, working on SATs, or practicing the violin. Of course, as a result of this, this also means that I can't go out with friends, talk with friends on the internet, and I can't watch T.V (they even canceled cable television because they think its ruining my health). In fact last year I got into a huge argument with them about me having a facebook because they found out I was using it to talk with other classmates. So basically, it feels like I'm stuck in a prison, unable to do anything but work. Most of the time I these feelings inside but lately after my mother found out I was secretly playing some video games on the computer when she wasn't around, she went completely apeshit by threatening to break the computer, throwing random furniture, and cussing. The worst part is that my dad doesn't do anything to help, he simply says it was my fault for making my mother angry and abusive. I know they only want the best for me and think they're helping me get into a good college and have a succesful future but I can't help to feel that they're being too extreme. Because of this, in the past few years I've suffered from stress and several anxiety attacks. The only form of relief I get in my daily life is actually reddit. My parents think reddit is some kind of educational website like wikipedia or something.   Nice try Jigsaw   Korrasami because Korrasami   I remember bits and pieces of my last dream from a few weeks ago. I was playing hide and seek with one of my friends from school when it somehow ended up with us having sex.   Nice twist!

"JUST WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK I AM!"   http://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/662/092/83e.jpg   "Babies come from daddy. The nuts inside daddy's scrotum (the sack below his wee-wee) make millions of microscopic homunculus every day. Each of these homunculus is a microscopic baby.   Sometimes daddy and mommy will play around when you're not there. When they want a baby, daddy will stick his pee-pee in mommy's mouth or in mommy's poo-poo hole. Hee hee, mommy and daddy think this is a lot of fun for some reason. Since mommy and daddy don't get fun toys that's the best thing they can think of doing to play. Gross. They will probably get very mad if you ask them. They like to keep this weird behavior secret, but that's how babies get started.   Sometimes mommy and daddy will watch movies and read books about other mommies and daddies doing this; these are called "adult" items since they are too gross for others to want to watch.   Anyway, after daddy sticks his pee-pee in places he shouldn't, the many homunculus will travel all around inside mommy. If one of them makes it to mommy's tummy then the homunculus will be able to stay and eat the yummy food in mommy's tummy. Usually none make it there, which is why you don't have a new baby every day. Other times two or more will make it, and then you have twins.   For the baby to breathe it makes a small umbilical cord out of things mommy eats and lets this go out either mommy's mouth or poo-poo hole. The baby uses this like a snorkel.   Oral Contraceptives have been invented by scientists to prevent babies from happening if daddy puts his wee-wee in mommy's mouth. There are no anal contraceptives yet to prevent babies from happening if daddy puts his pee-pee elsewhere, all very bad ideas anyway.   After about nine months of the baby eating inside of mommy then mommy has had enough of this and goes into labor. This is very painful. During labor mommy will squeeze the baby through her intestines and finally squeeze it out her poo-poo hole. This is very painful, which God did as a punishment to people for Adam and Eve misbehaving in Eden.   An abortion is when the mommy changes her mind and decides to poop out the baby early. The baby just goes down the toilet. Actually many miscarriages happen this way. A miscarriage is when a baby dies inside the mommy." -Yahoo Answers   I'm not sure if you want to fully understand human consciousness considering how messed up some people are in this world.

 Oh, Jak 2 had the worst checkpoint system of any game I have ever played. It's one of the hardest games out there IMO. Jak 3 is fantastic, though easy in comparison.   [This art](http://cdn1.gamepur.com/images/feature/the-last-of-us-2-concept-art.jpg) by a former Naughty Dog employee (which might have been from the sequel development) *might* make you change your mind.   This World Ain't Big Enough for the Last of Us   (spoiler: yes)   Ellie has more story left in her. Next game should be about Ellie becoming an adult. That concept art featuring [17-18 year old Ellie with a guitar](http://cdn1.gamepur.com/images/feature/the-last-of-us-2-concept-art.jpg) (Joel said he'd teach her) is amazing. She's got a long life ahead of her, being immune to the infection.      **Edit: provided link**   Only on the Season Pass or Remastered.   It's slang. You read it properly, therefore it worked.   Forgot they changed the name :)   Also the most fun platinum I've ever had. It's extremely short, but the battle arenas are extremely fun and challenging. You have to complete every challenge for the platinum.   Remember to play on Hard.   Ewww, that was clearly an effects bugger-up.   Ditto here actually, except I didn't see the beginning of Season 3 (the first seven episodes) until after Season 4.   Woah, as a massive fan who thought he knew everything about the show, my mind was just blown to pieces.   Wait...is that why she and Jack boned the night before?   Different territories?   Facebook vs North Korea is the showdown the world needs.   Dies. Totally worth it.   I maintain that The Brig (3.19) is a highly underrated episode of TV and possibly one of the best of all time.   I loved the original and I'm definitely curious, so thanks! Probably going to hate it but at least I'll have seen it.   Played the games before?   Easily the hardest Insanity mission for me was the Collector trap. I spent hours on that. It's the second hardest video game level I've ever played.   It took a long, long time for me. That 1% will move along.   So...when Isabella, Jacob and MIB's mother, Ben's mother etc. appear to our characters, are they themselves?      When and when aren't they themselves?     Appearances I specifically want clarification on:     + Isabella - On the Black Rock (because that is her at the end of the episode, right?)    + The twins' birth mother     + Ben's mother     + Christian to Michael     + Ana Lucia when she pulls Hurley over     + Libby constantly haunting Michael   Now play Grounded difficulty :)   After Grounded, I first went back through chapter select to get all collectibles (never overwrite your main save!), and I've finally finished Grounded Plus today.       I initially took 22 hours on Grounded (wasted over an hour on the bookstore trying to trigger the joke), but I only took 13 and a half on Grounded Plus. It's much easier knowing your previous methods. Still need to go through Easy++ for weapon upgrades, but only up to the suburbs for the Shorty.      My advice: go for it.   Or viewers.   Which was the one with his seahorse, Mystery?      "Wee-snaw!"   Did they really change the name in the US to Sorcerer's Stone? Why?   I started played TLoU just over three months after I finished Mass Effect 3 (I'd only played 2   3 at the time, once each). Gotta say I was initially disappointed. The trophy structure was bad, the story progression felt forced (having no choices) and I just wasn't that into the gameplay.      However, after having played so many games since October 2013, I recently picked up Remastered for pretty cheap. I gave up on Survivor difficulty earlier this year because I lost interest (wasn't even very hard); so this time I jumped straight into the new Grounded mode and it's an entirely different game in that it literally feels more "Grounded" in reality. The stakes are higher because resources and ammo are so scarce. I felt an actual connection to the characters because of it. The character deaths don't seem groan worthy anymore. I'm replaying it on Grounded+ after collecting all collectibles and conversations on chapter select.      What I'd suggest to you is to come back to it in a few months on Grounded and struggle through that. It makes the game feel so much more genuine.   If you're playing the PC version of AC2 or the Game of the Year edition on any platform, you already have the DLC integrated into the story.   You're right; nowhere close to two months. Less than 5/8ths of it.      And, yeah, shit should work at launch.   20mb patch upfront and nothing since, which is pretty fantastic for those who have data caps (Unity's updates being gigabytes each and crucial for the game to function is pretty ridiculous).   "Nothing brewing" is a very vague sentence, though. "We have nothing to announce" is what they said about TLoUR on Beyond's Left Behind interview, when we now know they'd been working on it for the better part of a year. It's what Bioware's Aaryn Flynn said about Mass Effect Remastered right before he went on Neogaf and asked everybody for their wishlists.      Let's keep hoping.   [Interstellar spoiler](/s "In hindsight, that does spoil the ending a bit.")   And Breaking Bad.   That would have been disappointing. I like the allusion to the beginning where Joel is running through the hospital carrying Ellie, alluding to him running with Sarah at the beginning. He calls both of them "baby girl" and they're all soldiers with assault rifles and flashlights, just like the one who killed Sarah. It's all so chilling and powerful and emotionally charged.   It must be tough for people who aren't massive zombies fans. My mates and I just got most of them automatically on local co-op, and Sacrificial Lamb took one try while we were biding time. Can't imagine getting the Dead Ops trophies, though. Arcade is boring.      Good job on Veteran, though! I shudder thinking about it.   Not out in the US? I was wondering why it wasn't getting much attention. Those 1v1 fights are so good.   This guy gets it. The title should have been *(Spoilers) The best scene in Gone Girl* or something. It's too specific. She does something with a boxcutter and it involves the heaviest possible spoilers. Most people would believe she's hardly in the movie especially since the title is "Gone Girl".   Otherwise it wouldn't be called the boxcutter scene, it would be called the box scene. Exactly.   They must all be provided with visually attractive templates. [This video is really good](http://youtu.be/VXJiBkFgprQ).   They originally said "other books".   This might be an AC Unity situation where they kept the original pressing date in early October but delayed the game so they could patch it. The Order was supposed to be released this year, so this is actually rather likely. You know what that means: MASSIVE DAY ONE PATCH!   Your money would be better spent elsewhere.   Revelations will be impossible. Matchmaking still doesn't work, and it's even worse now no one plays on it :(   You may be completely right (and probably are). Nonetheless, it's a suggestive title because it points out that the scene where she uses a sharp object is a scene involving, in OP's words, the heaviest spoilers possible.     All I ask is that you don't shower me with downvotes :)   It's quite suggestive if you haven't seen it. I'm not trying to argue.   Depends on what you're after. If you want an even story, this is not it. The weak ending cheapens the better moments of the game. AC fans, like myself, are disappointed with the story. It was not made with franchise fans in mind.      I wouldn't recommend it. How cheap is it?   This article is basically a link to another. Why not post *that*?   Looks just like the poster for Battleship, and 30 other movies.   It's a contextual spoiler. Saying there's a really powerful scene that she uses a sharp object is a spoiler.   *It doesn't?!*   That movie was made to put people into depression.   I'm not reading the text because I haven't seen the film. Don't put that there's a boxcutter scene in the film. I'd suggest reposting without that in the title, because knowing she's dealing with sharp objects feels like a spoiler.   Heartwarming episode right here.   Photo mode was also great for surveying your surroundings during forces combat on Grounded.   The Last of Us was *more* cinematic at 60fps, ffs.    Graphics-wise? Not too much (considering it was always stunning), but get it for 60 frames-per-second, 1080p, fantastic story dlc, most multiplayer dlc and the new difficulty level. Remastered has it all, while PS3 version is just the base game and you won't get an online pass with any used copies, so possibly not even multiplayer. Gladly, Remastered doesn't require a pass.   Never. It didn't even redeem any of my progress in Uplay actions until after I completed the game.      In fact, after a few weeks my entire profile was wiped and I was pushed up to level 13 (where I should have been the whole time).   A week, infrequent play for me. Played through 100% on good, got all good karma trophies, then played through on hard as evil, got all random evil karma trophies, finished game again. One of my easiest platinums.   You actually can hide it from your account, but only through using a PS3.   Ahhh, my first platinum. Loved this one.   You don't remember the Man in Black's name because he never had a name :)   Edge of Tomorrow takes place over three days, though.   Inside porno mags.      EDIT: Well, now my comment isn't funny anymore.   I think I'll make the bet that Hank will die and it will motivate Hope to become the new Wasp (her mother being the first).   The Delicate one is magnificent. Doesn't Hurley's discman break at the end of that one?   Those are some pretty ambitious platinums. I'd think Shadow of Mordor would be the one least likely to drive you insane. So, SoM would be my suggestion.      Last of Us requires you to play the great but depressing story mode more than twice and I think more than a month in consecutive days of multiplayer. GTA V requires you to get to Level 100 online. Dragon Age almost certainly requires over 100 hours of gameplay.   The last four episodes of Season 3 are widely regarded as the high point of the entire series. You're up to a point where you might watch only episodes 3.13 - "The Man from Tallahasse", then 3.19 - "The Brig". A character disappears between these episodes, and The Brig is mostly about what happened in between those episodes (though it does spoil a bit of the episodes in between). They're why Terry O'Quinn won the best supporting actor Emmy that year and they might convince you to get back on track where you left off.   I've watched all of the show, read the first book, I'm two quarters through the second, and I still don't care for the characters. It's like every sympathisable character is the underdog. Even when Danerys became the one on top in Season 3, Season 4 comes around and now it's about her actually kinda *not really* being on top of things. Her storyline goes backwards.       Look, the dialogue, the production and the direction are all fantastic. There are characters, but there's hardly a plot. It's all subplot. Some people like that though and that's perfectly fine with me. I still miss [spoiler](#s "Ned").   **What's your favourite episode of the show (excluding the two common favourites)?**     And, don't diss my non-American spelling of favourite ;)            Mine's definitely The Brig. Ties up Locke and Sawyer's deepest issues with one of the best scenes of the entire show: the death of Anthony Cooper.   Well, the deep trailer voice *did* say "sometimes". Oh well.   It'd have to be an indie title or free-to-play. You'd die pretty quickly, so fun might wear out faster for some.   In many regions, Disc 7 has Exodus part 3 - in the US, that's included in Disc 6's Part 2.   They made it out of sheer determination, obviously.   Advice: Watch the first three episodes in succession!   *Pfffffft*. Yeah? And where is it "hidden" - their wrist or something? What a terrible idea.   They were pretty good, but this is an awesome poster.   But she's not a man!   Third one has some pretty good parts but it was too wacky and tried to hard to be sentimental at the end.   With Camilla Ludddington back, hopefully?   Much better than any other promotional material they've released. Has anyone heard the *horrible* tagline in that 15 second teaser?      ***SOMETIMES THE BEST MAN FOR THE JOB...IS A WOMAN.***   The /Filmcast! For movies fans obviously. These guys are really relatable and don't take themselves too seriously.   Arno and Elise have great actors, but their arcs are far too messy.   So you planned on the ally trophies from the start? God, I've completed it on Insanity without any ally trophies. I can't imagine playing the game 3 more fucking times ;)   So, nothing to address the ridiculous amount of bugs in Remastered single player? Hunters jumping through boarded up or closed windows, psychic and instantly materialising runners, Henry not moving at all when he's supposed to help you, prompts not appearing, prompts appearing and not activating etc.      EDIT: Friendly AI walking in front of you straight away at the beginning of a bloater fight when you should be lining up a quick shot (Bill, you prick), friendly AI running in circles, friendly AI phasing through you (I told you Ellie, you're not actually Ellen Page), hunters never noticing friendly AI when they run into them and against them, clickers not noticing friendly AI when they push into them (Bill, you're still a prick), hunters *not* noticing you when you choke out the person right next to them etc.   I got platinum for 2  amp; 3, but, 1? Yeah that's way too much time. Insanity was enough for me.      Good job persisting! What was your process?   80s action movies in general then :)   No shame in plugging :)   Gladly.   And the horses chase, kind of.   But it's an extra gold trophy. I want it :) There are so many parts to bypass, but some of them force you into combat. It's cruel.   Both: my first platinum - Mass Effect 2. Because having my ass handed to me on Insanity and eventually overcoming all of my weaknesses was one of the greatest gaming experiences I've ever had.   I'm playing Grounded, and man it's soooo cheap. Starting the generator in the hotel: no matter what you do, a runner immediately comes up behind you if you haven't grabbed the keycard. You need to have full health to survive that at all.     Not to mention that all infected are psychic and that you will, thousands of times, watch a stealth-killed hunter drop a loaded weapon and you'll have no way to use their ammo because their gun vanishes into thin air. Fuck Grounded.      I can't imagine the patience the platinum takes.   How far in did you get?   Starts out painfully average, then BOOM: Fitz/Simmons feels.   Close. From what I've gathered, Marvel Studios' new Netflix shows will definitely be set in this universe (there's no evidence to the contrary, so there won't be a source to confirm it); though I highly doubt they'll impact anything else, so you're sort of right.   "The Brig", "The Man Behind the Curtain", "Greatest Hits" and "Through the Looking Glass" are the last four episodes of Season 3, and all pretty much A+. Best succession of episodes in any TV show in my opinion. Breaking Bad S4's final four are fantastic as well.   He provided his voice to the E3 trailer, so the immortal Sullivan will undoubtedly be back.   The Living Daylights is crucial for anyone who loves the Uncharted games.   The end of Season 3 (the last four or so episodes in succession) is up there as some of the best television ever made. Easily the best use of flashbacks in the entire series.   For anyone who doesn't get it, Credit Where Credit is Due plays when the first "Starring" *credits* begin showing along the bottom of the screen.  	102
 So this is only effecting the Dwolla us money transfer correct?   They are making Nickelodeon Gak! Good Memories.   Awe! That's so cute. You just kinda wanna pick him up and put him in your pocket.   If its real silver you might have a couple hundred bucks. A nice investment if it was a sleep purchase.   Ha, clever.

Instead of sending leftovers home with employees, or better yet, donating to a local charities. They had us (Courtesy clerks) throw all the food into the trash compactor. I asked my GM why they didn't donate the food or send it home with the employees and he said "If we send it home with you guys that's stealing, If we donate it we make less than writing it off as a loss." Fucked up as far as I am concerned. There's homeless people rite outside of where I worked.... GIVE IT TO THEM DOUCHES!   Maybe post /r/atheist ? That circle jerk will get you mui Karma.

Once the animals became accustomed to sitting with the trainers (each squirrel was trained one-on-one), they were taught to pick up a nut and place it in a metal bowl. The bowl was eventually replaced by a conveyor belt for the film.

Well, in an era when Star Trek and Star Wars were pretty famous ... im pretty sure people would have watched this too and grow a liking      It's a live action movie adapted from manga.

I'm on episode 104. after i watched the entire original series.   I still don't understand how Naruto was still a genin. He beat Kiba and Neji in the Exams. Explain that to me if possible.   This is truly amazing. I love that Bungie would do that.   I actually do the same thing sometimes.    YES!!

 I'm sure John Mulaney is hilarious, but the writing on this show seems horrible.   "I have a feeling I'll never get booked on Letterman?" "What'd the booker say?" "You'll never get booked on Letterman"  Cue the laugh track and me turning the channel.    I think the world will finally know peace when Netflix decides to add all of the original Law and Order episodes.   Briscoe/Curtis/McCoy 4 life.   How to Get Away With Murder was definitely my favorite pilot. Shonda strikes again.  I've also (kind of) been enjoying Red Band Society. Hoping the coma kid wakes up or dies, though, or they just eliminate the annoying narration. I see it getting canceled, though.  And Black-ish is good, too.    I caught a girl stealing headphones and a bunch of other stupid stuff once. I followed her into the bathroom, she got startled and dropped all the packaging. I said "did you pay for that?" She said yes. I asked for her receipt, she said she threw it away. I said "okay, well let's go look it up." She got all cocky and said okay. Halfway to the register I said if I couldn't find it I was calling the cops. She backed down, opened her bag, and handed me all the stuff. This girl was like 13.   I've caught plenty of meth-heads stealing pens and velcro, but the little girl with the Hello Kitty headphones is still my best thief story.   Customer comes in with a printed page "so you carry this, where might I find it?" It's a popcorn maker or a treadmill or something equally ridiculous. "I'm sorry ma'am/sir, that's an online only item"... " No it isn't"... "Yes it is... it says 'online only' right there"... "Well can you call another store?"... "It's online only, meaning you can only order it from our website"... "Can you just check?"... "..."   We both just got our asses handed to us by our GM. Our DM wanted someone to be held responsible (aka fired) but we were both to blame so it just got forgotten about.  Anytime some idiot cashier puts ink out without a box now I'm all over it. I found a $24.99 Epson 200 tricolor pack with no box earlier and I freaked haha, I don't think the paranoia will go away as long as I'm at Staples.   I have no idea honestly. The Epson one happened on a really busy day where it was just me and two other people. I think someone just came in with an open duffle bag, grabbed the ink and walked out. It would have probably only taken a minute or two and I'm sure the person planned it. We don't have cameras or anything so who knows.  The Canon one happened on a morning pretty close to when the Epson thing happened, so I'm sure it was the same people. I'm pretty sure I came close to being fired for the Epson theft. If there wasn't another MOD there I'm sure I would have been.   A year or so ago someone jacked literally all of our Epson ink, like $5000 worth. So we started alpha boxing all of it. Then the same thing happened with our Canon ink (not $5000, maybe $500) so we started alpha boxing all of that, too.  Now everything is boxed, except Kodak, because no one likes Kodak.   I probably watch three movies I've never seen a month, sometimes more. This WEEK I've watched five or six but I probably won't watch any more for a few weeks.   Every year I set a goal to watch 150 movies I've never seen, and I do really good for like a month. And then I stop completely.   I watched The Rock for the first time today. Pretty good, actually. Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery are hilarious.   "How in the name of ZEUS' BUTTHOLE did you get out of your cell?"   The other day a guy brought back a shredder. I heard him say to my tech associate "yeah I just want to swap it out". He didn't have a receipt so he needed me to look it up. I asked when he bought it he said "oh, I don't know, maybe six months ago?"   I was just like "... no, we can't do that. Our return policy is 14 days." He was just like "I'll remember that next time I decide to shop here."   Also had someone wanting to return a laptop after a year because it was running slow. I asked if he bought the extended warranty, he asked "no, why would I do that?" He started yelling when I denied it and I said "every retail location has a similar return policy, I don't really know what to say" and he flipped out.  We also get tons of non-receipted return requests. Oh yeah, I totally believe you bought three of the same $50 daytimers, two pairs of the same headphones, a Mophie case and a $100 Kenneth Cole backpack. It's gotten to the point where I just say "nice try, but no."   Awesome job!   I think my store's budget is like, $2200 or something. Any store in my district that sells over $3K consistently gets a tech bench, but I think we've hit $3K like... once ever and that was a year and a half ago. We usually hit $1000-$1500 lately. BUT, for the last year we've had like, 1.5 techs (.5 because usually weekends are all they can work) and no SSM.   We usually hit 6% ESP, sometimes higher sometimes lower (this past week it was like... 1.7% or something equally fucking awful, but the week before it was 8%) Goal is 7% but 6% is acceptable.  Talking to customers is the main thing, I think. I do pretty shitty with sales when I'm like "buy the fucking Dell and get out of my face." But when I'm like "hey how's it going, what are you using this for, oh I have a sister named Alice, too, yeah the parade was really cool, oh Big Brother is great this season, blah blah" people are way more likely to buy Squaretrade, Office, Total Support, etc.   Anytime you see anyone over 50 heading into the laptop/tablet section, grab them. Old people are your key demographic because 99% of the time they don't know what the hell they're doing. Mention viruses and you're in.   And you gotta be pretty shady. When my store had a TCE (long, long ago) a customer brought in their computer because they're screen was flipped upside down. Now we all know this can be fixed by pressing a few buttons. My TCE charged this poor old lady the full diagnostic fee. As soon as she was out the door he pressed the buttons and it was fixed. He called her the next day and made up some bullshit.   	13
 Or you could lay it to rest yourself. If he's as crazy as you say, what point will the truce make? He'll hound you no matter what it seems. So, for me, I can kinda see his point that you are trolling him, at least in this instance. Now, being paid of course is probably absurd, but I guess I've heard stranger things.   What I don't understand is that you are offering a truce yet you won't stop commenting. Do you think if you just stop commenting that maybe he will just leave you alone?   Really? Here I thought it was clunky and had pacing issues. But thank you!    May 2015  Morgan Richards, a sixty-three-old retired teacher, watched her husband put the puzzle pieces of their family portrait together. The idea came from Tara, her husband's physical therapist. She had a local toy store create a puzzle using the Richards' photo as its base. So far, Mitchell had half of it finished. It'd taken him a few weeks, but the last few days had garnered an immense amount of progress. Morgan believed he would finish it tomorrow based on his current speed.  It'd been almost a month since Mitchell Morgans had been taking Memorez, a new drug made to help reverse the effects of Alzheimer's. He was 1 of 10 patients in the clinical trial, and he was demonstrating fair results. He didn't have to be reminded where he was every morning; didn't have to be told the names of the staff the hospital provided during the clinical trial; and best of all, he remembered Morgan. The children were coming in a few weeks to visit and see if he could remember them.  June 2015  The kids left awestruck at their father's progress. Morgan felt like she was getting her husband back, that he was overcoming the disease. She went upstairs to be with Mitchell, as they recently started sharing their room again since his violent outbursts had become practically non-existent. She found him sitting at their desk writing in his journal, the one the doctors told him to keep.  Coming up from behind, she looked over his shoulder and noticed him drawing. She didn't have any clue what it was, but she noticed the circular structure with odd symbols placed in specific spots. "What is that?" she asked. She thought maybe it was a memory of something he saw on the television or read in a book.  "I don't know," he said. He wasn't upset for not knowing. Normally, he'd get quite down or frustrated. This time, he sounded more intrigued by the loose memory drudging up from his mind. "Maybe something I saw in a dream."  "Maybe." She kissed the back of his head. "Time for bed."  "Ten already?" He closed his book and put the pen on top.  July 2015  The doctors are flabbergasted by Mitchell's progress. They called it a miracle drug, but they're trying to keep their excitement leashed. None of them want to rush anything by submitting the work to the FDA. Apparently, the other 9 patients are exceeding expectations also. They called the Richards in to run all the necessary tests: CAT scans, MRIs, the works.   A few weeks later, Morgan received a call from the doctors saying Mitchell was healthy as ever. She cried at the joyous news.  Meanwhile, Mitchell returned to his shop downstairs where he tinkered and toyed with various pieces of equipment. As an engineer, he loved learning how things worked internally, so he often broke things apart and reverse engineered it back together. Morgan checked on him often to make sure he didn't accidentally hurt himself, but he seemed to be living life fine.  August 2015  The grandchildren visited the first week before school started. All six of them gave Mitchell a run for his money that week, but he survived and thrived. In fact, Morgan noticed how energetic he was with the children, playing games and camping and going to the zoo or a museum. He'd also returned to his old habit of reading, and he was tearing through books like they were Kleenex. And none of it was light reading. Morgan couldn't understand half of the titles she read.  By the end of the month, she went down to check on Mitchell, as he'd been quiet since the kids went home. "Everything alright?"  He nodded at his work station. "I miss having the kids here. I felt revitalized."  "You seemed to really enjoy yourself," she said rubbing his back. Every day, she thanked God for bringing her husband back.  As if he could read her thoughts, Mitchell said, "I am so thankful for this drug."  Morgan smiled and turned to leave. She noticed one of the many chalkboards Mitchell had hung on the walls of the basement. It had a lot of equations she didn't understand, but she remembered the circular structure from his journal. All the symbols mimicked the same ones she saw him drawing that night almost two months ago.   'Maybe he has an idea for an invention,' she thought.   September 2015  "I don't know how I feel about this," Morgan said to her husband. He had been in contact with someone named Ed White in Arizona, almost 1600 miles away from their home in Tennessee. Apparently, Ed was a metallurgist, a man who studied metals, and he believed they could build whatever it was Mitchell had been working on for the past few months. "The doctors would have to sign off to allow you to leave."  "I don't have time for all that," Mitchell said flummoxed. "I won't be gone for more than a few days. He wants me to meet with a few people, particularly people who could fund our project. Please, Morgan. I think this would change everyone's lives."  "What is it?" she asked, a topic she'd been tip-toeing since he started the drawings. "What does it do?"  "I'll explain it all. I promise, but I have to know if it's even feasible. But I need to meet with Ed's people. See if this will even work." He gripped both of Morgan's hand and placed them in his own. They felt so soft and alert. "I'll continue taking the pills. I'll continue journal-ing. I will even call every single day. Promise."  Morgan gave in with a smile. He was so immensely excited. How could she take that away from him? She allowed him to go.  December 2015  "We found him," FBI Officer Langdon Morris explained to Morgan. "He was with Ed White and a group of eight others. They'd built this structure which turned out to be some sort of a portal. To what? I'm not certain. But all ten of them walked through it. Then, the structure fell apart.   "We contacted the medical facility who was conducting the clinical trial on your husband. It turns out these ten people are the ten patients that were involved in the testing of this drug. The FDA is shutting down production of Memorez, and we're currently conducting an investigation into the conglomerate that's been funding the drug corp making the drug. We will keep you informed should any news come about, especially in the location of your husband."   I love trying to turn things dark or twisted, so give me some interesting prompts or ideas!  Edit: I will get to everyone's prompts. Promise! Sorry for the wait.   Magic hasn't existed for millennia, not since the Grey Order traveled across the oceans and lands gathering the gaseous substance and locked it in the depths of the Earth. Then, a great earthquake devastated Nepal and the nearby regions, opening up the vault where the magic had been kept. It also opened the sacred device created to contain the magic gas, thus releasing the humongous cloud back into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, until the magic is evenly distributed through the air, there will be pockets of magic moving about through the atmosphere causing unintended effects.    I don't have it in me to write a story in that setting, but I could see that Scooby is a part of a genetically-modified litter of pups that escapes from the facility due to his enhanced intelligence and eventually runs into Shaggy Rogers as a young boy. When he finds out Scoob can talk, the two keep it a secret until high school when Shaggy meets Velma, Fred, and Daphne. A kid from their school goes missing and Scooby Doo believes he's being held up at an abandoned house thought to be haunted. As the gang tries to investigate, they go through horrific nightmares (think Saw-like puzzles) in order to save their fellow classmate. Meanwhile, they're being monitored by a masked person who keeps trying to scare the gang off. Velma, however, is great at solving puzzles and seems to be helping figure them out while Fred keeps everyone strong and Daphne gives off a motherly vibe. At the end, Scoob find out the identity of the kidnapper with the help of Fred and Velma: a teacher at the school. Once they save the kidnapped kid, they realize the teacher meant to molest and murder him, as he's done for decades since he came to that town.   I worked at Blockbuster and I had just helped a customer check out a Monty Python movie. I told the customer I hadn't ever seen them as I wasn't big into British humor. He told me a bit about the particular film he was renting and it made me interested. He leave and I help the next person check out a weird, low-budget movie about a married couple who fought zombies. I hadn't ever seen it before on the shelves, so I tell the customer "wow, haven't seen this before." He immediately says, "Yeah, you haven't seen Monty Python either, so that doesn't surprise me." I checked it out to him, but I immediately changed it in the system to where it was late so he would receive immediate calls asking for him to return the movie. Dick.   I agree. Obviously, when he's angry, he goes full rage and kills people, but it was more of a kid throwing a temper tantrum. But then, there was the episode where Gao called him out on knowing Chinese. This was when I realized he's smarter than we thought. Not just some scared kid who grew up with connections capable of doing damage. He brought himself to power by playing a fragile child with issues, and even though his outbursts are still tell-tale signs of him not dealing with childhood traumas, he's capable of everything he's done. The bigger problem I had is that it all depended on the assistance of the others (Leland, Gao, Wesley, etc) for him to get there.   Gay, 27-year-old dude who's down for board games. Got Clue. That's it. Could possibly host depending on amount of people.   In my fourth grade class, the teacher had a program where you got prizes the more you read. If you reached 10K pages, you got to visit the teacher's house during the hour-long lunch period and you got to swim in their in-door swimming pool, provided you brought your swimming clothes and a pre-made lunch. All year long, the teacher took the kids to a local high school to learn how to swim, and I'd forget my swimsuit literally every time. After I reached my 10K pages, I thankfully remembered the swimsuit, but I forgot the pre-made lunch. My mom brought me a Lunchable a half-hour before it was time to go, but the teacher said I wouldn't be able to go because I was too forgetful. I cried during lunch and everyone in my class made fun of me.   I still hate that teacher to this die, and they're probably dead by now.   But I don't want to work on it. I'm unhealthy but that's my decision. I'm happy the way I am right now. I shouldn't have to be skinny to be treated as a human being.    Lumen: Yeah. We all pretty much lead pretty crap lives; a huge reason why we even accepted this job in the first place.  Cyman: We weren't given much of a choice.  Shell: I lost my job and was blacklisted from working on any other unit in an other city.  Aggie: Our lives aren't all that normal, but it could be worse. I actually get to talk with my family in India.  Shell: Because you suck up to everyone.  Lumen: Don't get mad at Aggie just because she's genuinely sweet. You attract more with honey than vinegar.  Shell: She uses something, alright.  Cyman: If you're suggesting she uses her power, Shell, you know they use olfactory depravation when dealing with Aggie.  Shell: I wasn't.   And yet I still don't care nor will watch the show.   Aggie: We are tasked with stopping any Homo-Superiors whose abilities cannot be managed.  Lumen: Basically, all of them.  Cyman: They're sent to DC (Detention Center) for therapy to help adjust to their abilities. Those with minor abilities that cannot be used for anything negatively are allowed to be released, but they're monitored 24/7. Meanwhile, the more major and dangerous Homo-Superiors are quarantined and dissected or medically tested on.   Shell: We also have side missions going after normal people depending on the situation.  	15
 holy shit that looks like a surfboard   holy shit, is this a thing...   They've managed to make the bloody thing suck even more..   God i love that movie, the prison scenes were almost as gruesome as they were awesome. Its one of those movies i have to watch at least twice a year.   i'm always the idiot who drives straight through the explosion... :( thats even more depressing because you weren't even #1...   Haha, well at least 50% is on something in that crowd, a friend of mine works in the camera crew of Q-dance, and his only job is to literally find people who look kinda sober enough to put in the aftermovie.  and ofcourse, you know... filming the hotties.    Don't forget B-front, don't know if you could classify that as raw, but god damn that guy can make some music.  and if you're talking about show, i will never forget standing in this crowd.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IqSdC52Sks   God...   didn't know i was talking to someone who knows what he's talking about, and i agree with everything you say its just a bit to much, on the one hand its all house remixes, and on the raw hardstyle hand its only hardcore kicks with screeches!   But as far as the shows go (and thats why i posted it), you can't disagree that its pretty epic.    yep, facebook has to know you were there i guess.    hehe, it takes some getting used to i guess. But hey, rammstein is also concidered garbage by some, and 600.000 people seem to enjoy it in the picture :D      God   This can't be a coincidence. Two weeks ago i remember waking up in the middle of the night. Still dreaming i'm looking at my phone thinking "well its 02:00, time to take a shower". I'm showering, grabbing my bag for work, i'm fully clothed, i'm almost ready to go make breakfast. While i'm grabbing my phone for a quick look. THATS when i realize its 2 in the fucking morning and i can sleep for at least 4,5 hours before my alarm goes off... It was one of the most confusing things when i slowly started realizing what happened.   and for the lazy: this was this years endshow of Defqon 1.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLYDG5k-LLY  Was really sick.   Look for Qlimax 2014, happened last weekend. Hardstyle maybe is a bit unknown in a very big part of the world. But its growing, and the shows they give in the stadiums are crazy. Lots of indoor fireworks.     Didn't know there was a new season yet. Funny that they rap better than 90% of those idiots who are 'big' these days.    5 days late, but hey, thats good news! Is/was it painfull afterwards?   hahaha, one of those hidden gems in the comments. This is why i go straight to reddit after watching it at home.    Hope everything went well!    Only one hour left, nervous?  	19
 It's the only humane thing to do   I did this once with the glasses that I was wearing   New zombie fortress?

This kinda happened to me once. A girl was flying home for the weekend. I asked if she was going to go out, hit up the clubs. She was flying home for her dad's funeral *sinks down*   Is it just me or does that kid look like an Asian cabbage patch doll?   He beat me in throwdown challenge      YES! upvote for you sir  	26

[FAIRHealth Consumer Cost Lookup](http://fairhealthconsumer.org/index.php) can tell you, based on your zip code and the medical procedure codes, what a medical or dental procedure *should* cost, and how to navigate through the reimbursement process. Here's how this invaluable site came to be:  In 2009, an investigation by then-New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo uncovered conflicts of interest in one system that health insurers used to calculate reimbursement for patients who received care from providers outside their plans network. As a result of this investigation, FAIR Health -- an independent, not-for-profit corporation -- was created to establish and maintain a new database that could be used to help insurers determine their reimbursement rates for out-of-network charges, and provide patients with a clear, unbiased explanation of the reimbursement process.   As part of the collective settlement the Attorney Generals office reached with the insurers, FAIR Health received millions of de-identified healthcare claims that many had used to help them determine their rates.

She's old (19, spayed), but has been in good health until this afternoon, when she started peeing pink in the bathtub and I immediately made a vet appt. for tomorrow afternoon. After a couple of hours I got her to eat (heartily, Science a/d that we had on hand) and drink, and she went to sleep for a couple of hours. But since she woke up a two hours ago, all she's done is try to pee, with almost no success. She's walking back and forth to the litter box, then crouching there, shaking her tail. She produced a small amount of clear liquid, then nothing. She's miserable.  Other things that might be at work here: she's had an impacted anal sac (6 mos. ago) and does suffer intermittent constipation; the vet says she has small kidneys but hasn't done tests to find out why.  Is this situation dangerous? Is there anything I can do before morning to make her more comfortable?

 No, because then part of the series core fan demographic would not be able to watch it without being accompanied by a guardian.   The irony is that it's actually a thing in some countries to floss first.   *sigh, rezips pitck fork case*   Yeah, but sleeping is at least enjoyable.   YOU PEOPLE FORGOT TO FLOSS DIDN'T YOU.    Is the school funding a visit a common thing?  Depends on the field, some have visits before sending acceptances, some afterwards. The ones that send acceptances without requiring a visit, whether they offer visits may depend on how well funded the department is and the culture of the field/department.  If you can't visit, definitely Skype, or if that doesn't work, call. You'll want to do that before committing.   Trying to smell your own breathe doesnt work. What you should do is lick the back of your hand, wait a few seconds for it to dry, and then smell.   Theres not much advice to give other than that youll just have to make a list of what differs and maybe ask current grad students about their experiences in each program. What it sounds like is theres no bad choice.   You are ultimately junior and senior colleagues and are mutually responsible for helping advance each other's academic careers.   Some people in general will be annoyed by jokes in emails. I don't think it's a matter of professionalism. Academics get dozens to hundreds of emails a day, both excessive formalism and excessive extraneous casualness is a drain of time spent on an activity most people would rather not have to do but must. Unless it's like a response to the lab holiday party invitation or something of similar levity and familiarity, I think some people would be more annoyed not by the lack of professionalism, but because it's wasting their time.  Beyond emails, some PIs are very formal, others are more casual. Its a matter of reading whats mutually comfortable. Faculty attitudes also depend on department culture. I'm friendly and casual IRL with my PI, but prefer work emails be to the point which does not implry formal.   Followup question, what ecological opportunities allowed for the return to the sea by various vertebrate lineages e.g. cetaceans, mosasaurs.   Fair enough. Best of luck!   Sure, but I do feel like its not well known among amateur evolutionists.   Learn R and everything in Practical Computing for Biologists by Haddock and Dunn (regex, bash, basic python, some other stuff). Intro programming, as suggested by someone else, would be useful.   Not trying to offend, but I can't imagine that there aren't other anthropology departments with multiple faculty working on various food related topics, it's a fundamental human activity.

These predictions have been correct again and again, and they tell a remarkably convergent story of the evolutionary history of life. There are some very fine details where there's still high uncertainty about the data, but there's no question about the broad (or even most of the medium and small) strokes, nor any question about whether evolution happens. Not to mention, the process of evolution by natural selection *must* happen, it's a statistical consequence which can be confirmed by both mathematical and computational arguments. As Dobzhansky once said "nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution" (something like that).    Macro-evolution happens (generally) by lots of micro-evolutionary changes piling up over many generations, not single leaps.  People make this observation all the time, and I don't feel like it's anything but an obvious and somewhat useless observation. First of all, it says nothing about whether macroevolution *actually happens*, or has happened in the past (which I think is the more important actual question for people who don't understand evolution)--only that if it did happen, it must have happened by the same processes which occur in microevolution. The actual evidence for macroevolution, either in contemporary time, or in historical geological time, lies elsewhere (in the form of many independent lines of evidence supporting the same evolutionary story, and the power of evolutionary theory to predict what we should observe).   Secondly, the statement that macroevolution is lots and lots of microevolution is analogous to the equally true statement that "biology is just applied chemistry which is just applied physics which is just applied math". It's true but not very useful. It ignores the real scientific questions which emerge at the higher level. Macroevolution is just lots of microevolution, and *it isn't*. How species actually arise is a very hard and still open question (along with the question of what is a species anyways), which is informed by the study of the four microevolutionary processes (selection, drift, migration, mutation/recombination), but is certainly not completely explained by them.   For example, the question of whether speciation occurs often in sympatry is a fundamental macroevolutionary question, and there is no answer from population geneticists (who are the people who study microevolution). Most people who study speciation evolution say it's not as important as allopatry, but it's still up for debate.  tl;dr: It's a true statement, but severely lacks nuance.  Edit: My grad student friend who studies speciation agrees that micro+time = macro is not really a meaningful statement.      People who commit fundamental attribution errors over and over.   So you're also going to ignore the socioeconomic/environmental factors as well?   And here I thought he meant to say "canonically". This makes more sense.   pretty sure that was sarcasm. unless your comment was also sarcasm. but maybe my comment is also sarcasm.    I was angry, I felt sick. I didn't know what to do.  Lies. I feel betrayed by OP. Why does this keep happening to me?   Plenty of free online materials to study for the GRE and then ~$30 prep books. All you need is some motivation to invest the time. Prep classes are a complete waste of money. And if you have questions, there are plenty of forums where people would be happy to explain a question or two for free.

"Oh yeah, I think at the time they had already rejected me, so it slipped my mind to mention it."   I would probably send an email to whoever's the director of the CS graduate program or program admissions for advice concerning your particular situation. It won't hurt to ask.   They won't care about your nominal major as long as you have the coursework and research experience. Chemistry with relevant electives will definitely not be looked down upon for cell biology (where chemistry is probably very useful).   Don't forget to floss.   Found great lab and department with great fit, healthy department culture, intellectually satisfying, lots of opportunities and flexibility. Subfield is one where I feel like I'll have (relatively) good job prospects in academia or industry with transferable skills, while also being very personally interesting. Personal life consists of a very social grad student group within department, meetup.com, and admittedly not much outside of that.   It doesn't help you to know.   They're pyramids.   Physics word problems tend to not have extraneous information, and in some sense, the ability to abstract a real-world problem into an abstract model in physics is kinda the whole point of physics. This is not really the case in mathematics.   My opinion is that while the calculus track should be offered for people who intend to go into STEM fields, *everyone* should be *required* to take a prob stats course in HS. For the vast majority of people, it is far far more useful subject, and a far more useful subject for society for people to be educated about.  The other subject that needs a complete rehaul is geometry. It's often used as an introduction to "proofs" but is so far removed from the kind of proof thinking that a mathematician, or physicist, or even engineer would think of proofs. It's completely boring, have no context, somehow made repetitive (the whole point of mathematical arguments is to *avoid* repetition of ideas by abstractions that capture general relationships), and Euclid would shoot himself if he saw it. It sucks, because it was one of my least favorite subjects in school, yet one of my favorite subject in math competitions. Algebra through Calculus are *okay* I guess.   ...Well that took a tur... nope, it kinda just started off like that.   As a math major, I'm torn. On one hand, I wish the standard math track prioritized probability and statistics over the classic calculus track, as very few people outside of STEM ever need to use calculus, but almost everyone (even if they don't know it) are inundated with statistics every day. On the other hand, I wish the classic math track didn't vampirically drain geometry and algebra of any of the mathematical beauty and creativity that appeals to mathematicians.   I loved math. Not math class. Math competitions were the shit. Math class was shit. Same repetitive crap and endless walls of text word problems disguising another repetitive exercise within an "real world application" that is not actually useful in the real world.   WIFE WIFE WIFE WIFE WIFE WIFE WIFE   I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M NOT BUTTER    It might be overly simplistic and maybe even misleading, but statistics aren't offensive.  It's not just over simplistic, it's incorrect. Summary statistics about populations say very little about each individual within a population. 36% of the people you meet within a normally distributed population will be greater than 1 standard deviation from the mean, which can be a very different from the mean if the variance is large. When you refer to individual people, summary statistics about the populations they belong to are useless. Yet this is often the case of what happens in real life, people stereotype individuals as being characterized by a population average statistic.   How often do people do this with people they don't know? 90% of the time? 80% of the time? Let's say 80%. So if person meets many people who belong to a group, and 80% of the time assume that the other person is describable by the group average, then they're within 1 standard deviation 64% of the time. That doesn't seem too bad, you're close enough most of the time. But from the other person's perspective, if they *are* very different from the group average, then 80% of their encounters involves a person assuming they are something they are not, simply because of the group they are associated with. That kind of casual racism gets very tiring very fast. And it's worse when the perceived population average is not even close to the actual.   I think this has a lot to do with shows these days being very much about plot and characters, while I think one of the triumphs of LoK is it's very rich thematic material more akin to that of very good literary works, that have to be reread again.   Context and audience are important though when it comes to "racist" comedy.   Makes sense, "d", English "r" and "l" and Japanese "r" have similar articulations of the tongue. "d" is a plosive, i.e. produced with a stop and release of air, while Japanese "r" is a tap, i.e. produced with a more subtle almost stop and release of air; it also has a "lateral" quality like in English "l" where air moves around the sides of the tongue.    that same standard must be applied to every other race.  And it should be. It's pretty fucking terrible to assume that a Hmong diaspora family is doing well just because they're perceived as "Asian" (whatever that means in any sense other than as a social construction), when many are actually poor, disenfranchised, refugees. Mean earnings say very little about the overall distribution of wealth within a class, and says nothing about individuals and individual families, and it's offensive to talk about *individuals* as if they're population averages. So I'll give a concession: "Asian people" are successful *as a group*, but that in *no way* reflects any particular person's experiences, and to ignore personal experiences is wrong.   I wouldn't say American education promotes creativity, given the obsession with standardized testings and appealing to the lowest common denominator. At least not in K-12 education.  Then there's the obvious problem when people consciously or subconsciously stereotype Asian Americans who spent most if not all of their lies growing up in the US as if they grew up in a completely different system   The one that gets me is "Where are you from?"  "The Mid-West"  "Lol, well, you know what I *meant* by "where are you from?"  Yes. Fuck off.   Oh yes, also floss your teeth.   Floss before masturbating.   at least they come in pairs.   Delaware, it's small, and not really in New England.   Warm, dry heat rises from the bottom.   Yup, beautifully animated western cartoon with anime influences and wonderfully realized world-building and similar use of color is much less relevant to anyone here (except the 100% upvote thus far) than "The Last Airbender has a higher IMDB rating than 50 Shades of Grey" or a dozen "What shows should I watch after Avatar" threads. Here's another thread for you to delete: http://www.reddit.com/r/TheLastAirbender/comments/2un88o/no_spoilers_a_recommendation_post_rwby//   Definitely next on my list!   I respect your opinion, and I completely disagree. I think this overlooks the fundamental difference between ATLA and LoK. ATLA was a struggle against an external threat, as exemplified in its name, "The Last Airbender" is the result of the . LoK was never about the villains, it was, as its name exemplifies, always about Korra. It was never about the external threats but Korra's internal growth as a character. And in this perspective, I thought Korra's final arc was very well done narratively and brought a lot of closure to her coming-of-age tale. Kuvira was never supposed to be a big final external and existential threat like the Red Lotus were, but primarily served as the foil to Korra's internal growth; she is what Korra could have been, and indeed, was designed to be just like who Korra was in the early Books. And when you say "nothing made it feel that this was the final time Team Avatar would be tested" that's exactly the point, the threats will always be there, but Korra is now physically, spiritually, and finally emotionally prepared for anything that comes her way, and there's no longer a question about her future role as the Avatar. It's pretty much spelled out in her final conversation with Tenzin.      Irony: OP is black.    it's coincidence that most of the places on my "I never want to visit that shithole" list are heavily Muslim  Well yeah, it's spatial and temporal autocorrelation.   Ah, well then definitely contact them to see if they're available.   October seems to on the late side IMO--some PI's won't respond for 2-4 weeks, and you want to have a good idea of where you're applying early enough that you can ask for LoR's. Otherwise, I think we had fairly similar advice.   Seems like you're off to a great start! I'm assuming you're applying this Fall. You could start emailing them now, though realize that it is a bit early for next cycle considering most programs are still finishing their admissions process for this cycle, which also means potential PI's have probably not thought about whether they're accepting students next year (which can depend on a host of factors, including whether they get new grad students this year, and whether they're funding situations changes from now until then). That said, it's never too early to start networking, especially if you have the opportunity to meet them face to face at conferences or invited seminars.  When you're ready, I'd send them a 2-3 paragraph email. "Dear Professor X", introduce yourself (name, university, major, if you're currently doing research in a related field "current doing undergraduate research in X" (brief, enough to spark some common ground)); that you're planning on applying to grad school programs this fall, interested in doing research in X, interested in potentially working in your lab and feel they're a good fit for you; was wondering if you're considering accepting/taking on new grad students, and whether you had some time available for a skype or phone interview; attached my CV below; thank them for their time and consideration.  What you want to do is introduce yourself, why you're contacting them, show well-informed interest in their lab, get an answer to the very important question of whether they're actually considering taking on new grad students, and that you are keen to continue the conversation with them, while being both courteous and respectful. The rest of your questions can be addressed in future conversations.  And then just wait.   Wait, but what did she leave thinking why you asked in the first place if you didn't end up asking her to babysit?   Floss.   Yup, since salamander tadpoles have gills, there was an existing developmental pathway--axolotl's are neotenous salamanders.   Define elite.   I prefer "Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of ecology." Context is everything.   I know others have responded but obviously such statistics are not useful except with respect to a particular population of study.   Yeah, we have some great museums. I'll definitely go back to visit   But aren't these transmission probabilities *conditional on your partner having HIV*? This ignore the marginal probability of your partner having HIV in the first place. Not that it's not useful information, but it's ignoring a very important component. Or am I mistaken?   Sigh, as much as I don't want to admit it, I think you're right.   These are literally false statements. Why is this even legal?   Hutchinson, but only for the space museum.   Kansas has surprisingly good public schools in some areas, at least, unless Brownback has his way with the education budget cuts. BBQ. Google Fiber. Sprint headquarters has a lot of jobs there.   http://petitions.moveon.org/sign/recall-sam-brownback   This source says at least 50% of O2 comes from plankton, though the original estimate that is being referenced is from 1998, so it could be outdated http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v483/n7387_supp/full/483S17a.html   And I wouldn't say humans are doomed. Many species will be doomed (which I think is very sad and kind of a shitty thing to leave to our descendants), but humans probably will end up fine, though that's frankly hard to predict (part of it is, we have no idea of what to expect of future technology, while other more predictable trends always have a great deal of uncertainty). What I do think is true is that it will end up being a lot more costly, in terms of the hardships people will face in the next few centuries, and the costs of replacing or substituting the relatively cheap services that ecosystems provide human society. It's not that our predictions are precise, but that even including current levels of uncertainty over predicted trends, it's very unlikely that a business-as-usual scenario will not end up harming us more than if we channeled our efforts into slowing current trends. Basically, while expected trendlines have quite a bit of uncertainty, our confidence ranges are almost entirely in the negative impacts--the mean trendlines are less important than the area under the distribution of potential futures that are bad. The reality is we're affecting the environment in a significantly negative way currently, not just through CO2 emissions, but in many other ways as well, including introducing invasive species, destroying ecosystems for short-sighted development, mismanagement of water and soil resources, and tonnes of pollution. These will have long-term consequences that will be extremely costly to fix, if they can be fixed at all.     To step back from global warming and to look at the wider scope of anthropogenic environmental problems, one of the reasons why we food production hasn't been affected yet is because we're living on borrowed time. Fertilizers come from nonrenewable fossil fuels, and irrigation water is being used much faster than the aquifers from which they come from are replenishing, while healthy agricultural soil is being destroyed by unsustainable farming practices. We're able to maintain a level of food production because we're tapping into resources that have taken thousands to millions of years to accumulate, at obviously much faster rates than they are being replenished. It hasn't affected us to the point of food shortage just yet, but it is obviously unsustainable. Global warming will negatively affect food production by: increasing water usage, shifting climates (dryer and hotter summers, longer and colder winters, depending on geographic region), and increase in pest ranges. It's already negatively impacted the fishing and shellfish industries, as I mentioned with declining oyster populations.  Biodiversity loss has other affects. A lot of useful materials, such as new pharmaceuticals, are the result of studies of nature. Nature is a great resource for discovering new design and new chemicals.  But I think more importantly is the many services that ecosystems provide, such as protection from storms, water filtration, nutrient cycling, carbon sequestration, disease and pest control, pollination of crops, etc. These services can be valued at many hundreds of billions of dollars per year. Disruption of key foundation species in ecosystems due to global warming can lead to collapse of entire ecosystems--robust ecosystems have healthy biodiversity. We're still learning about the many ways in which ecosystems  Lastly, I'd like to give a word of caution of taking economic valuations of nature too literally; value will cycle up and down as in any market, but unlike man-made products where supply can be increased by increasing production, diminished ecosystem resources are lost forever (as far as human timespans are concerned). Ecosystem biodiversity has value in the long-run and preserving yields long-term savings and advancements, not to mention the spiritual/emotional, ethical, and aesthetic arguments in favor (which do mean something to me, but not to everyone). There's a much greater risk/loss when we under value vs over value ecosystems.    Have we ever observed a species decimated due to warming?  Well taken literally, decimated does mean only a 10% reduction, so yes, many many species. Ah, I'll stop being pedantic.  There are plenty of species that have been severely affected by global warming. Polar bears, and other cold climate species or high-altitude species (i.e. cold adapted species). Coral reefs, which are a foundation species, so that affects all the biodiversity in coral reef ecosystems as well. Many economically important shellfish crops (e.g. oysters) are in decline. A recent study found widespread amphibian extinction due to the spread of epidemic diseases that grow more optimally in warming environments. There are a lot of examples in the conservation ecology literature.  Warming means that climates are moving northwards. Thus, the geographic range of cold adapted species living at higher altitudes and latitudes are contracting, including both flora and fauna. Species that cannot move northward fast enough (e.g. venus fly traps) will be at risk. On the other hand, warm-climate adapted species are expected to increase in range; but this is also problematic, as some of these may be invasive, or pathogenic (e.g. mosquito-borne diseases). Ecosystems will also be disrupted, particularly thermally sensitive ecosystems, such as coral, leading to a collapse in biodiversity in those areas. Other problems include ocean acidification, costal flooding, and extreme precipitation conditions (extremely low or extremely high).   Fight Club   Oh man oh man, the feels.   - That's not really true. Not only did Korra save Kuvira's life, but her  belief in Kuvira's superiority, ends justify the means actions, and the irrelevance of the Avatar in the modern world, were obliterated the moment Korra contained that spirit blast. She admitted defeat. This is more or less spelled out in their dialogue. Her motives are not wrong, it's that it takes Korra's empathy for her to realize how her once pure motives had corrupted her judgement. She went from having all the power in the world to having none. Edit: Basically, Kuvira had a god complex, she was undefeatable, all powerful, and her endgoals were rightgeous regardless of the morality of her actions. In the end she was forced to confront the true face of god, was utterly defeated, utterly blown away by the unsurmountable power of the Avatar, and was *saved*, and the Avatar empathized with her. Kuvira, no longer blinded by power, control, and desire, those being stripped away from her, was forced to confront the reality of herself.  - When else would it have been acknowledged? Most of the rest of the series was dedicated to the battle, which is not the time to grieve, but to get the job done. Between the end of the battle and Korra and Asami talking was a few minutes, and the moment where they did address it made the most sense thematically.  - To each their own.  - Probably not, though I felt the opposite, I found he dislikable at first, but he grew on me.  - Yeah.  - Nega Korra's serves a metaphorical purpose in Korra's journey.   That is... odd... I may be wrong then, and it may be that is the case for more medical-oriented programs. I don't see any harm in emailing for clarification though. Avoid making decisions based on assumptions.   As I said in my other comment, most PhD programs observe the April 15th deadline. What did your decision letter say? Did it mention April 15th as a response deadline?   This was not true for any of my offers when I applied (none of which have wait lists), and there's no indication that this is the case here. That said, it's useful to know that this is a possibility. It seems contrary to the April 15th resolution that many institutions uphold. Are you sure your institution is part of the Council of Graduate Schools?   It's generally assumed to be 25 years per generation.   People have livelihoods there.   Nooooo, my honor!   I think you'd be surprised at how perceptive kids are.   The Daily Show hosted by Amy Schumer.   A lot of programs don't care about the writing section anyways. 4.0 is fine. How well you write on your essays is much more important.   Your scores are good enough. Spend the time working on other parts of your application. IMO GRE only matters in the sense that a low GRE can  raise flags.   These are questions you can ask current graduate students and faculty at visit day. If you are confused about something, ask. I'm sure they'll be happy to answer.  I do find it weird that the EE department doesn't guarantee 5 years of funding (even TAships) (I just checked UW EE FAQ page). IIRC, my UW offer (but in a different department) guaranteed 5 years of funding of at least TAships. You should ask current graduate students if a significant number of students have trouble getting funded or getting into a lab after 1 year.   I no longer can vote in KS. However I still have family and friends who live in KS. What can I do to protest the current government?   Better than both being bottomless.   Do you want to do scientific research? Or are you more interested in the advocacy part of environmental studies? It depends on what kind of career you want down the road.   Yes thank you! I was also at the event, but didn't get a pic of prince wu or the early mako sketch. (You wouldn't happen to have a gotten a pic of what I remember to be Lin with a helmet? Long-shot I guess).  Prince Wu kinda looks dandy... space dandy? EARTH dandy.   I'd say it's the opposite. Conflicts of interest must be reported during journal submissions, and are listed within published peer-review articles. Agencies that fund research also have policies regarding conflicts of interest. Institutions also have policies regarding conflicts of interest.   caskett.   Bioinformatics, biochemistry, bio(medical)engineering. The more quantitative skills you have, the better. Learn programming. Biology is becoming more quantitative and computational all around, and outside of biology, those skillsets will serve you well.   All the bme's I know ended up quitting engineering for more lucrative careers in finance, silicon valley, founded startups, and the like, if they weren't premeds (most were premeds). There are a lot of companies who like to hire engineers for jobs that aren't strictly engineering because they have desirable quantitative skillsets. (That said, it was one of the best bme programs in the country, which funnily seemed to not have many people go into engineering). Note, most of them pursued some kind of internship during undergrad in those fields (finance, tech).   If the individual learners could get together and share their knowledge and are able to exclude the "social learners" (who are essentially cheating the system), then yes, they would be able to increase their fitness without incurring the costs of helping cheaters.   I don't appreciate your prejudice. Please educate yourself with this PSA.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdN8sBzv60o   Not surprised, the Lego Movie was great, and over 18 includes college and young adults.   Do I have to pay taxes on the $1m?   20k/y income.   He/She probably means the graduate student union at their institution.   UCDavis offered me a low stipend and *partial* tuition remittance (which was obviously a deal breaker). Some institutions may be great programs academically and research wise but have no funding from higher up.   For deferred unsubsidized loans for which you have flexibility to pay but are still accruing interest, pay what you can, and in the order highest to lowest interest loans. Then move on to subsidized loans, same strategy.   ^Great advice. Also read whatever their program website has to say about it so you can have a more informed conversation, but you shouldn't feel weird asking about funding when it isn't clear to you, that's important for making your decisions.  	109
 looks like a healthy relationship   what advice did it give you?   you should probably add what youre talking about   well if it helps    am i the only one who could always avoid this kind of situations?   someone's jelly over here   so awkward   So this was just random?   Sorry english is not my first language..  I just wanted to say that they are showing how the iPhone has the feature which samsung was advertising strongly on their S5 and apple is just showing that it is also possible with the iPhone without even mentioning it directly.. Its not an attack (couldnt find another word) they're just making fun of them   It's just a small thing I noticed, but I think you guys might like it. In the new iPhone 5s "Powerful" commercial you can see how some guy is using his iPhone to measure his pulse with just the flashlight and the camera (there are tons of apps for this) which is clearly a little attack towards Samsungs new Heartbeat Monitor   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODmfmUWqlSA at about 1:06   yay we are as good as the us   yeah but why cant i just watch them in my photos app?    can't save/show gifs..    They have 3 Million iPhone 5c left..   So what youre saying is "i can't tell what i want, but others also can't"?   As I said, those things have been proven wrong, thats not just my opinion (Look here: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/ttugs/i_was_in_the_library_the_other_day_and_i/c4psdtb)  It is also surprisingly that all of the people asking about the goal of feminism are feminists. (The posts linked to in the sidebar) so most of you guys dont even know what you are fighting for?   Most of those discussions are leading to one single post, which is proven wrong by different people in the same threads.    So, I'm just wondering .. what would you feminists consider a perfectly fine social world? When is your "movement" done? What is the ideal situation to live in? I'm just curious about your mission and whether you have a goal.    thats not making any sense at all   LeBlanc shits on him  	20

 Wait a minute.  You didn't just quit on the spot after being told that?   I think some of the "chefs" in my town just grabbed their notebook...   Really?  Does that upset you?  I don't understand how it could, cause it seems that you sound like a cunt all the time.  Are you afraid of people stealing your shtick?  Do you have a patent on "sounding like a cunt?"  Do I owe you money for infringing on your specialty?   Does  this surprise you?  The old SF sheriff was caught selling stolen police goods and the current(?) sheriff of Rio Arriba is in a world of shit too.  Almost everything around here is corrupt and/or abused and it is a simple understanding that Manual Juan's nephew gets to walk and Uncle Bob's wife gets the contract.  Or if you're friends with the ABQ PD, you get to walk away from a DWI.  The Native New Mexicans around here need to pull their heads out of their asses.  They keep bitching about not progressing fast enough, yet they continue to operate in fashions that drive them back.  I really wish the people here would wake the fuck up.   A quiet atmosphere was mentioned, which is why I didn't say the frontier...   A quiet atmosphere?  Look around the campus area would be my suggestion.   But I got nothing off top of my head.  Sorry.  I could tell you a couple of bars that would fit you just fine probably, but being under age, that's a no go :(   If you say no bars, you are asking for a lot in this area.  Maybe check out flying star?  They stay open lateish.  11pm?  Blackbird is somewhat of a coffee shop that has beer and wine.  But it is a bar style atmosphere...   pork.  the other white meat.   I was there before she got nominated for Beard and left around that time too.  I don't necessarily miss her or her menu, but the room was nice and the neighborhood is awesome.  I'd forgotten about that woman until seeing this post.  One would assume that she has several shops in the Greater Pugetopolis area now?   I miss working at Tilth...   That is a lot of work and a waste of oil when you can get the same results with a steel scrubber and water.

I don't care if you ate all the bacon.  Just don't lie about it.   Fire 'em all.  Or maybe get some training yourself to deal with such things.  Not to be snarky, but conflict resolution training is something that should be mandatory for all management personal in every business.  In all reality, if you can't trust them to clean and prep, how do you trust them with "your" customers?   You'd love my GF vegan sweet potato gnocc...   Move to ABQ.     Sure, you can ask for support.  But without detailing what kind of support wanted or needed, many won't be able to...   What restaurants should I be eating at?  I'm a food guy (many mistake me for some kind of high end fancy chef with the food I make), have been inside 90% of the kitchens in the area, and laughed my way out the back door of most of them due to shitty food.  I've also been asked multiple times to help run some of the BS "fancy" places in town and will continue to tell people no to such things.  So maybe i'm missing something.  Maybe some joint opened up since I've moved here that I've not eaten at.  But I doubt it.  Because i've (seriously) eaten at 99% of all the food serving places in SF.  And because of it, I make such statements as NM foodnis bland and boring.  Which was pointed out that I should refrase that to be "the NM food you can buy and have served to you is usually a waste of money since it is uninspired, unseasoned, and basically terrible."   And if you want and are in US, I'd be happy to take a call with you.  What is your location and menu?   Man, if you can get a % of profits, go for that.  What you're asking isn't unreasonable.   Do you have any numbers to back up the pay you're asking?  Do you know how to cut food cost by at least 5%?    Superglue is nice, but it doesn't kill the throbbing.  Get a jar of liquid bandage and stash it at work.  $5 investment that seals cuts and is a topical pain killer as well...   Fair.   Go if you like.  You will be disappointed.  From the service to the room to food, it's lacking.  They are trying to hard in there and it shows.  I give Ziggy props for keep making a go of it, but he should seriously stop.  Or give up the reigns to someone who can at least make good food.   Crowded.  No garnish.  Your ratios are wrong - bread/crackers, cheese, meat.  You need sweet and acid to balance the salt and cream.  Where is the beverage?   I'm not going to burn you on not making components.  However, the next plate that you post a picture of should be comprised of nothing but home made goods.  Aside from hard cheeses and long term cured meats.  Seriously.  There are tools and resources around to do it all, you just have to buy ingredients.  Many of which you might have on hand if you cook at all.  Examples of what you can make with little effort.  Pickles - (green beans, cukes, onions, radish, etc)  House oil cured olives.  Duck proscuitto  Raw cooked stuffed mushroom caps.  Pancetta  Cece or tapenade type spreads.    Confit tomato.  Candied nuts.  Guanciale  Dates/figs stuff with cheese  Many, many more...   The Coyote in it's heyday was 20 + years ago.  And you just stated a great example in the argument of why Santa Fe is a joke when it comes to food.  There are several prime shops here and another dozen good ones.  But for the most part, the food here is terrible and has been that way since Miller sold the Coyote.  That sale was the end of an era that people here continue to fantasize about and jerk off to.  NM food isn't bland and boring when I make it either, because I know how to season and understand method.  It's not complicated.  Yet many here don't get it and sadly they decide to open restaurants.   Everything you can.  You've started with a basic (stock) now move onto pasta, tortillas, and soft cheese.  Once you've got those down, move into doing bacon and other short term cured meats.  After you do that, you'll develop technique and pallete to do things like kim chi and saurkraut.     Call the companies.  Also, talk to your local liquour distro, they might have a lead or two as they usually deal with random specialty things.     Just charge them a flat rate per meal.   One of these days (I'm going to cut you into little pieces) by Pink Floyd.  Just don't blow your phones on the floor tom pounding...   Your lack of sandwich is disturbing, please let me change that for you.   I double the most expensive food item on their menu and charge that per hour.  Then work appropriately to the hourly wage.  I also won't work on a menu for someone else for less than 1k.  If the owner is to cheap to pay for real advice, they can figure it out themselves.  Also.  You can approach it from a % aspect too.  If you can do all the numbers yourself and they are willing to play ball.  If they are wanting/needing a menu flip that will increase their profits by say 15 or 25%, I would ask for a base flat fee plus x% of increased profits for Y amount of time.  But to do that, you have to work with some across the board.  Ultimalty, I say that if your giving people advice on how you would do it and you have eventual plans to open your own shop, make sure you get paid what you want.  Not what they want to pay...   8/9 a minute sure.  And it actually was in an hour and a half.  I forgot the happy hour had started at 5:30 when the bar opened, not when the restaurant opened at 6.  But it was all plated too ;)  That place was nuts.  $3 for a dozen raw oysters on the half with sauce.  From 5:30-7pm in the bar, monday through friday.  Something like 17 seats and no standing customers.  But we would blow through 45-60 dozen no problem on a busy day.  That was some serious shit.  I watched two people get sent to the hospital working that station.  One of the sickest things I'd ever witnessed happened at that bar.  12 dozen oysters sucked down by one fat man and two dirty martinis.  And of course the fucker tipped our bartender like $3.  I about wanted to puke all the way around.   It depends on what I feel like.  This chunk was a dry cure I believe.   So do I and because of it, the labor is negligible in my book.  You're flipping the meat, which is the labor killer is sounds like.  You said no cryovac, how are you storing it?  Is it in tubs or bags or what?   It sounds like who ever made the decision was over reaching.  I understand the want to do it all in house, but you have to have the foot print to do it.  And in all honesty, if you're making all your bread, you can buy damn good bacon for a decent price.   How long does it take you to salt meat and throw it on the shelf?  Or to transfer it to one place to the other?  30# batches should be around 4 bellies, maybe 5 if they are small.  If it takes a half hour to either salt that or toss it around in the smoker, I would question the footsteps involved.   Ok.  Fix your smoker and do it on the cheap.  Buy on old bakery proofer speed rack.  Now you have an enclosed box with rails for pans.  Now just work in a hot plate at the bottom of the box.  Granted, this will be a cold smoker, but wouldn't you rather shove 6 bellies in the oven over night or first thing in the morning, compared to doing 1/2 of one on your current rig?  How do you currently smoke your pastrami?  On the same rig?   Man, then you are making your bacon wrong.  The only real cost in labor should be in the slicing.  I put down 100# of bacon in about 1/2 hour if my mise is set right.   Please don't call me chef, for I am not one.     They are pretty much gone now.  They start mid to late july and run through right about now.  We got a good rain yesterday, so there might be a few more cropping up, but probably few and far between.  Probably some still out in the San Juans or in the Jemez, but not so much in Santa Fe.  Or so it felt last time I was hiking around.   Jesus fucking christ internet police.  Sorry.  I should have said that "any place that will hire you where everyone is calling each other chef isn't a place you want to work."  Is that better?  I mean, it just makes me sound like even more of a dick.  Is that what you would like?  Here is the thing.  90% of the people that refer to themselves as a chef are a fucking joke.   If you're working for either of those guys, you've already earned the right to the title.  I'm talking about the shitty food tatted up McApple Garden tocque wearing douchebag hipster bitches who think they are a chef for making a grilled cheese sandwich.  That is where the word gets thrown around the most.  You're a chef if you flip pancakes at IHOP.  Whatever.   Chimayo Red Chile crusted and brined pork cutlet  Tomato, lardon, and spinach salad  Green Chile Pancetta zabaglione  Sweet onion jam  Browned pita in garlic butter   You are correct.  Porcini is a mushroom.  I do not understand your objection?   No panini press involved, so I can't call it that.  I wish I did have a panini press though.   a #10 tin can with rocks for a base and to lodge the chip can into place and not burn the box.  The chip can is simply a soup can with holes punched in it and a soldering iron dropped in the middle of the chips.  Worked like a charm.     High Aspen Growth, Santa Fe National Forest.    I don't have a pic of this batch.  But here are a couple of what I find in the area.    http://i.imgur.com/jOhKnHg.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/DHWld3a.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/kKGJP16.jpg    Well there is that part of it too.  But, do you not eat your edibles?      Garlic and Thyme butter basted porcini  Garden Fresh Caprese with house mozz  Wild Rocket  Soft french loaf      Butter basted porcini, garden fresh caprese with home made mozz, wild arugula, and pressed soft french.  What do you do with your mushrooms?         Not of the cheese was pre shredded!   As soon as you learn how to set the standards and not follow them, that is when you will start feeling good about your abilities as a cook.    Any place where everyone is calling each other chef isn't a place you want to work at if you actually ever want to earn that title.     I'm ashamed for you living in that state too.   Depends.  Down in ABQ not so much.  Up here in SF, we can get 6" over night and it's gone by noon.  It can also linger for weeks at a time.  However, it is nuts fucking cold a lot.  But typically freezing at night up here.  It's usually 40/50's during the day in ABQ and cold cold at night.  Canyon road isn't dog friendly FYI.  Not much in the area are here is for the most part.  Being here in the winter isn't the time to be hiking and camping, unless you want to head out on snow shoes.   100# of yukons cleaned and chopped to boil for mashers.  Or 45 dozen oyster, shucked.     Dude.  You don't do that.  You will be sad.  6-8 hours at 135 in the dehydrator, depending on the thickness.  Or, as another said, toss a pan in the oven overnight with the oven on warm and the door cracked.   I don't have a hot smoker.   Very very true, and I've been looking for better bread.  It works, but it is not the same.  I just have to deal with what I can find, since I'm pretty much over the baking of bread :(  The panaderia's near me are strictly Mexican and they only make crusty, crunchy bread.  It's good, but not for this purpose.  I've not thought to talk to the Rican's I know, they are an hour south.  But they might have a spot to check out.  The hard part is that I believe I've been all of the gringo friendly places I know of and a lot of the Latin shops in an hours drive from my house.    I should stop by the pupuseria.  They might have a lead.     Well every thursday is boys night - dinner and a game.  That is where this plate of sandwiches was eaten.  Also, most of the post history I have has been eaten by that crew.  So if you want to be my friend, show up, play a game, and eat a sandwich!   Soft French style.     Get pissed!   Do you play games that involve polyhedrons?     Oh man, for which part?  I don't keep recipes, but can tell you method!   You are allowed to have an opinion.  I would be sad if you didn't have one.  I can take constructive criticism.  However, the people I choose to take it from are those who are educated in the topics they are speaking of.  You do not seem to have anything to base your opinions on, other than your personal preferences.  Oh.  And my stance on proportions comes from those who are much more educated than me.     and another random one that was made this evening...  http://i.imgur.com/ImCa3eG.jpg   I made these and a couple of the others tonight for our weekly boys night.  My friends eat well.  http://i.imgur.com/ImCa3eG.jpg      Make one yourself, it's not hard.  And it's that much easier if you bought most of the ingredients.  Honestly, all you'd really need to make is the pulled pork.   Right proportions of flavor?  How much of "absolutely fucking awesome" do you want or need in your mouth at a time?  Man, stop looking at your food and debating about it so much and start eating it!  Here's the deal about proportions.  Each ingredient needs to be able to stand on its on or in any combination with other ingredients in the dish.  When you have achieved that, you achieve harmony on the plate.   the bacon in question...  http://i.imgur.com/Dd7LX5u.jpg      and the bacon that made it...  http://i.imgur.com/Dd7LX5u.jpg   I can't eat beets.  They make me throw up.  The only food I've come across that makes me feel ill and I've eaten some (IMO) nasty shit over the years.  So I won't taste them.  However, any and every time they are prepped, the question of "Do these beets need more salt?" is always asked to everyone within earshot.  No ifs, ands, or buts about it.  Some people can get away with not tasting the food that they are sending out - the owners.  Other than that, refusing to taste one or two things is acceptable in my book if there is a good reason behind it.  But if you simply don't like something so therefore you won't taste it, I believe the term "get the fuck out" applies to you.   Just because you can turn bacon into something, it doesn't mean you should.  I've never heard of it and I'm bacon/meat obsessed.  That sounds nasty.   All home made aside from the swiss.  French sourdough, red chile pulled pork, green chile pea-bacon, stone ground, sweet hot pickle.     Thanks!  It was delicious.  But I seriously fucked up in making it.  You see, I only made one.  And that's a problem.  One sandwich is never enough.  I don't even think I want to eat anymore right now.  But here in an hour, I'm going to be cursing the sandwich and shaking my fist, since I will have no sandwich.  And I will be sad :(         Christopher Lloyd?  Is that you?   I've been doing the whirled egg thing for almost two years now since I first saw it.  Do it.  You'll love it.   Every time I make pastrami.  But other than that, not so much.      Tickets at this point will run you $100+ if you can find them.   Great show, good inspiration, and a wonderful reminder that all of that amazing food is usually just a trick away or something you could do too.  After all, just remember, at the end of the day it's just food...   Just make one.  They are not that hard.  It's just a sandwich, man.   This pretty much sums in up.   Nothing here in New Mexico aside from clear skies and Green Chile...   Examples that are produced without a smoker and can be done in your space are below.  They can be made for $5/lb or under.  IF you know how to source things.  Simple and a line monkey can do it if shown how.  It's also cheap as fuck.  If you would like to learn how to make bacon, there are people willing to help.  Such as myself.  But you got to drop the "I'm making something similiar type product" bullshit.  You either make bacon or you don't.  I mean, you can.  But if you're not going to, I'm not going to walk you through it.  In fact, I'd  be like the other poster and ask what the name of your shop is so I can avoid it at all costs.  Follow?  http://i.imgur.com/Cm1CTHF.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/Y8nstSy.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/UDml67m.jpg   You are correct.   Winter brined pork Milianise cutlet.  It's light, you use complimentary spice as the pumpkin, the crust gives texture and something to mop up the sauce.  Delicious.  If you really need a veg, keep it simple like arugula tossed in with the sauce after it is finished right before plating.  Or over a bed of citrus   garlic braised greens.  But no kale.  Fuck kale.       is there anything house made in the picture?   The sandwich pre press and an ingredient list.  http://www.reddit.com/r/eatsandwiches/comments/2h5ply/ready_to_press_a_new_mexican_cubano/     Breads a little darker than I like and in the pic it does look burnt.  And as many a greater cook than myself would say, there is nothing wrong with a little char.  There is a fine line between inedible and delicious.    It's also a little hard to control the heat of the cast iron skillet I used as the top weight.  In the very first post I acknowledged that I needed a panini press.  If you would be so kind to be the first to donate into that fund, such an act would kick ass!   I would make yellow mustard, because that is what I come to understand as traditional.  I don't get it.  But since I can't get straight American yellow mustard to taste good, I stick with what I know.   http://www.reddit.com/r/eatsandwiches/comments/2h5t70/the_sandwich_in_question_and_i_wish_you_could/   http://www.reddit.com/r/eatsandwiches/comments/2h5t70/the_sandwich_in_question_and_i_wish_you_could/   That's next!  But in addition to the ham and cheese, it's getting grilled pineapple and maduros too.     Yeah yeah, I know that joint quite well.  Decent folks, better bread, and nice burritos to walk out the door with.  I'm not in ABQ, but it is a SMALL town.   I don't know which was better.  I sliced off a chunk of the sandwich cold and it was awesome.  The pressed hot was awesome.  God damn I need to make another sandwich.    Here it is cold from the other post...  http://i.imgur.com/BGVhZoP.jpg      I really need to invest in a panini press.  And a pic before it hit the pan.  http://i.imgur.com/BGVhZoP.jpg      Hatch Green Chile brine canadian "bacon"  Chimayo Red Chile pulled pork  Taos Sweet Chile garlic pickles   House stone ground  Swiss  French loaf      Good for you.  It's easy, cheap, and lots of different ways to do it.  But remember, just because you can add bacon, it doesn't mean you should.   Dumbass had previously dropped the Robocoup and broke it to a certain extent.  Or I should say, broke 2 of the 3 safety mech's that prevent the operation of the engine.  One of which was the lock on the lid and the other being the pin that actually gets depressed in the final step of turning the motor on.  Douchebag owner in question is to fucking cheap to replace the robo.  Tells moron retard who broke it to use a bamboo skewer to depress the pin and to put a towel over the lid and hold it on.  Holy fucking hell.  There were probably 5 people in a 15'x15' equipment packed kitchen.  How nobody was sent to the hospital is beyond me.  Better question is how the douchebag owner still in business.  This stupid cocksucker was buying ice from the gas station down the street in the middle of summer (sending a dishwasher to get it in a shopping cart) instead of buying a new ice machine.  The people in this world are usually retarded.  How is it that the cream of the crop always manage to make it into our business?   How much product and time lost?  That sucks by the way.  Is the asshole in question known?  I worked ever so briefly for a moron who refused to fire the guy who kept killing the power to the refers.  Then one day he fucked up (I don't know how) using the Robocoup, blew the lid off, and the blade went flying out and hit one of the fire suppression batons.  Setting the ansel system off.  Good times, good times!  I rolled up my knives and walked the fuck out.  Screw up once, all good if you learn from it.  But if you knowingly unplug the refer for a microwave, especially if it's on the line, fuck you get out.     Um... Amazon?   Pork belly. Learn yourself how to make some bacon.  If you need help, there are plenty (myself included) on this site who will help you.  It will be the best thing in the world you've done for yourself.   Well fuck me silly.  I never would have thought about it that way.  Here in the states, it is expected that bride/groom/family pay for everything other than transportation and hotel for people to come to the party.  Food, drink, entertainment, gift bags, etc.  This sounds like something that should be instituted everywhere.  It sounds like everyone makes out a winner.     If you're still up, I know one of the better spots in the area to film from for sunrise.  But it's a drive.  It over looks the pecos valley and the galisteo basin.  Takes about 45min to an hour to get there going north.  Not many people know about this spot.  I'm in SF proper BTW and could be convinced to maybe make a drive...   Damn, that's a good idea.  Everybody just buys raffle tickets and people donate stuff?  To what, defray the cost of the wedding?  Or to pay for a trip?  Couples choice to pad their bank?   Not really.  For which part?  The cheese is a basic ratio by the rennet.  I didn't make the pasta.    The sauce is a basic puttanesca sauce as far as I know.  I just grab and throw what is in the fridge/cupboard into the pot if it works together.  The red sauce base is always a changing event based upon what is on hand as well.  I cook by the dump and pour method and really should write more things down.  	122
 No clue, haha   The app for Excel is incompatible with my device. Lame   I'm not Indian but I really didn't find it that offensive towards Indian people/culture any more than any other shows doing the same towards American culture/people. It was just a funny comedy show   [Is this a joke?](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men:_Apocalypse)   Mine would be Outsourced. It was on NBC for one season and was surprisingly funny.    Also Undeclared   [Takers](http://static.stereogum.com/uploads/2009/09/takers_poster.jpg). Worst photoshopped poster ever   He finally had surgery at the end of Iron Man 3 to remove the rest of the shrapnel, which was the reason he had the arc reactor in his chest. So the issue was solved and there was no need for it anymore. It was iconic for Tony Stark/Iron Man but if it is no longer necessary, it would only be kept for fan service. Plus, it is still a part of Iron Man because it powers the suit   My point is that you tried to make a comparison/connection between two shows who share pretty much nothing in common.    Better Call Saul is like Lost. Only it's just like the flashbacks, without actually being a flashback, has a completely different plot and purpose, is much more focused, and, well, I guess is nothing like Lost.    Ouch...    Yea, that's cool. I personally would have liked to have seen more plot but to each their own   Windows Vista, although pretty terrible and hated, still was functional and used for years by the general public. Apple maps was a terrible product by a company that had yet to fail in recent years. It was an epic failure   Oh, most definitely! I thought that at first too. Either way, great episode   The episode is called Charlie Work by the way. The jazz drumming was said by the cast as a true coincidence. When  they made the episode, Birdman was not released. But it does seem like an homage to that even though it is to True Detective.    I didn't think it sucked but thought it was okay. I had never seen a Mad Max movie but was convinced by the reviews and people on here to see it. It had good things and bad things about it. Ultimately I left entertained but not blown away.   Good: The cast, Cinematography, action.   Bad: weirdness, bare bones plot, action sequences took up too much time of the movie and became repetitive. Little character development.    The motorcycle jumps happened a few times throughout the movie (at the meet up point for the deal and at the end with Furiosa's people), same with the bombs and porcupine car attacks. The only one you mentioned that didn't was the pendulum boarding which was towards the end. But as a whole, it was the large tanker in the middle and then all driving on the the sides and doing a few different ways of attack.   Nope. Kevin James is a funny person who has done some bad roles. Rebel Wilson is not a funny person in bad roles   They were moderately inventive in the first half hour of the movie. Then they became repetitive.   Fast   Furious, Need For Speed, and plenty of other movies used practical stunts for the action  sequences. Mad Max is just following the returning trend of using more practical stunts and effects   I didn't say it was lacking "a" plot, I said lacking "in" plot, meaning exactly what you said, it was a simple plot. There could have been a bigger plot/reason for the movie.  And no, I have not seen the other 3 movies, which is the reason for this particular thread.    I was satisfied, just not blown away like everyone else. The problem though is that every sequence was similar. Yes, it's a chase movie but there could have been way more inventive ways of attack but for the most part it was the same throughout the movie.    I saw it because I was convinced by the reviews and the people on here. I thought it was entertaining but was lacking in plot and was very weird. Great cast and Cinematography and the action was good but it took up too much of the movie. It was good for a watch but I didn't leave thinking "I HAVE to see the other movies now".   I honestly think a lot of people are too afraid to post even if they thought it was just okay because of the potential riotous comments and downvotes but I know my opinion is in the minority so I am ok with it   Definitely Community. Also, Party Down, Workaholics, and Broad City   I don't have a problem with the action sequences. They were entertaining just not revolutionary like some people have suggested. Nothing about the way they were filmed was particularly new. It was mostly the content of the action that people enjoyed. There have been many movies that, besides the content of the scene, have been filmed/edited similarly. My problem was the content itself. It was very repetitive and took up most of the movie leaving little room for me to even care about what the story is, who these characters are, what the history of this world is. Again, I was entertained, but it wasn't anything more than that for me.    I saw the movie and thought it was okay. The cast was great, the Cinematography was great, the action sequences were far too many but decent, the plot was lacking, and mostly it was just plain weird. It was entertaining for sure, and I'll probably get downvoted for this since everyone around thinks it's the greatest movie ever, but to me it wasn't.   Before you come at me hard, I didn't say it sucked and I know I'm in the minority.    This was on Funny or Die yesterday.    This isn't where i parked my car!   I use the Google Now launcher on my phone and it still works fine   I could see that for an episode but not an entire season. It worked in the episode format for Community.    I loved those movies when I was younger. I am definitely open to another one!   Tommy Boy   Good to hear from a similar point of view. I think I'll give it a try.   Perfect, thanks   Star Wars will be his crowning jewel. It's make or break. I have total faith in him for it, and once he is done, I can't wait to see what he takes on next.    So, do the trailers do the movie justice, are they just trying not to give too much away? Because i remember the trailer came out and /Film and other sites were freaking out and as someone who knows basically nothing about the movies, didnt find anything that grabbed me in the trailer.   Thank you for this, this is exactly the type of comments i was looking for.   So, this subreddit has been gushing over Mad Max: Fury Road and I don't have a problem with that. The reviews back you all up. But for us who have never seen the other movies and are on the fence about seeing it, please convince us why we should see this movie this weekend. Personally, i like Tom Hardy and Charlize Theron but the trailer made it seem over the top and lacking in plot detail.  I know I'm not the only one in this boat, so here is your chance to change our minds. If you don't care, then just move along.  If you have seen it already, please hold on the spoilers. Thanks,  EDIT: Well, that was quick. Thanks for the responses, you have effectively swayed me to give it a chance. Keep the discussion going though for others like myself. Thank you.    Amazon has them.   Read the user name I replied to   No. There isn't in the books either. But there are some very good micro brews made specifically for the parks at the Hog's Head Pub and the Leaky Cauldron   Daredevil says Hulk's in the movie. I believe him   I don't know, I don't remember seeing signs for it but I heard about it online before going so I ordered it at the Leaky Cauldron   Yes, I was there in November and it was brand new.    I'd like to see Mad Mad 2: Madder Mad   I've never noticed it, have no idea what you are talking about.    No problem   There are 3 kinds at the Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Frozen which, as someone else said is like a slushy. Cold which is similar to a Cream soda with Butterscotch, vanilla, and a creamy foam topping. Both of those are tasty and sweet but the best is the third kind, most recent addition, and closest to the book. Warm/Hot Butterbeer. It's delicious and comforting. Hints of vanilla and Butterscotch. It's creamy with the consistency of hot chocolate. It's like the best warm beverage you'll ever have.    [Here you go:](http://imgur.com/tflPkv0)   You said "and provide contact information" and I assumed you meant the driver's info to report. So sorry for that. Everything else in my last post holds true except for that.    GPS speed tracking is fairly accurate when you are in a car on a highway but in a metro area it's not. Not to mention, it's only "fairly" accurate therefore not exact enough to enforce. Then the app would need to save the speed and have some way of proof that that was the speed at that time. Then the app would need to recognize where you are for the specific Speed Limit (which I don't believe exists yet). Then it would need to have access to employee records for the public transportation, employee schedules, routes. None of which is legally available to the public. Even if all of that came together, it would be expensive to build, highly illegal, and have no way of enforcement due to it being a unreliable, non-government issued app that anyone can use to try to get a driver a ticket or worse, lose their job.    Request: App that Tony Stark had in Iron Man 2. Ya know, the one used to "Commandeer" government screens in seconds.   That's my request in case someone finds OP's app for which the technology also doesn't exist.    How did you even spot that! Good find   Ye have little faith. Yes, his film and television work has been darker in tone but he is a damn good director. I think he was a great choice and I can't wait   I'm good with this decision. But he has not been officially cast. Just is officially "in talks".    That is true there are different types. In another post on  this thread I stated that in the age of Scary Movie and Not another Teen Movie, Parody has mainly turned into a disrespectful type of comedic Imitation/reference.    Didn't even see it.    Not in high school. Past college even. And my "knowlege" was "dropped" because even people on here weren't understanding the difference.    You used the one example from the villain character of which the entire episode is against. At the end of the episode, that character gets so into the game and he gets invited to play again by Neil who had given up hope until this game.   EDIT: This is your second reply trolling me, why are you trolling?    It was a short gag in an earlier episode. The episode you linked came out a year after Community did their D D episode and i dont follow every episode of The Big Bang Theory, just try to watch an episode here and there to see if my opinion changes.   No, and you're not the only person to bring up an older example and not read any of my other posts explaining that in Modern media Parody has become what I said. And by no means is that the only type of Parody but simply the most popular use today.    Read other comments. Someone else pointed that out and I replied   Like I said, it has Everything! Ha   Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. You get a little of everything, the trio is still at school, some humor, some Horcruxes, it's my favorite movie   I didn't make up that name, I've seen it used many other places. And it's not meant to be insensitive,  it's simply a joke on the Internet. Not meant to be taken seriously. I apologize if I offended you, that was not the intent.    Exxxxxxactly.    Hence the words "Modern Media" in my other post. Since those days of pure Parodies have come the Scary Movies, Not Another Teen Movie, etc. Times have changed and parody, for the most part, seems to come along with a negative connotation or disrespect of the source material today. That's not always the case but is quite a bit and in the case of The Big Bang Theory, their style of parody is with lack of respect to the source material. Usually Community goes along with Homage rather than Parody. Some people, including Community fans don't notice the difference, which is not a big deal, but there is a difference   Ha, yea. Autocorrect on my phone.    Parody is simply making fun of something by way of Imitation. In Modern media it is usually used with disrespect towards something.   Homage is respecting something through Imitation or reference. In comedy, it is used to reference something in respect while also poking fun at it.   EDIT: Not sure why I'm getting downvoted when I explained the definition of Parody and Homage and how they are typically used in comedy today.    Didn't know that but see my reply about Parody vs. Homage. I'm sure it applies   Yea, no problem. I kinda was wondering why this was directed at me. But no big deal. Haha. But the one thing I've taken away every time I catch an episode of the Big Bang Theory is that it is not making nerd culture look good or cool. The best description I've heard is that it's Nerd Blackface.    Not saying they "can't have more" or that they won't have a callback that would surprise me. Just those are the only ones I want and I don't want it to be too many callbacks to the original trilogy just for fan service. But with what JJ Abrams recently said, it won't be   True, but even the "themed" episodes I've seen of The Big Bang Theory are a Parody of something rather than an Homage. Parodies show lack of respect for the source material whereas Homage pokes fun with respect to the source material   These are the 2 callbacks that I would love to see, other than that, I don't want many more   People who watch the Big Bang Theory aren't dumb (well, of the 20 million that supposedly watch weekly, there probably are some.) but the show is standardized comedy that goes for the cheap laugh every time. There is such a thing as Dumb Comedies being really funny, Big Bang Theory is not one of them (at least for me).   Community is Advanced Comedy. It's not for everyone because you need to understand the show and it's references and humor. It's smart in the sense of comedy, not actual intelligence.   I know a lot of actually smart individuals who watch the Big Bang Theory and think it's God's gift to comedy. I completely disagree with them, but they just want to watch something that they don't have to think and that one has a ton of promotion and a ton of viewers.    Not sure where it came from but the best back up to this quote is how each show handled Dungeons and Dragons.   Community: Two full 22 minute episodes dedicated to the game showing how it works and making fun while respecting the source material. All the while having an underlying theme/reason for playing that serves a purpose to further character development.    The Big Bang Theory: A 20 sec gag of the nerdy characters playing it and the girl makes fun of them because it sounds like nerdy gibberish. Makes the characters look weird for playing it and moves on with an unrelated storyline.   I don't even play D D but which one shows more respect, heart, and was funnier? Community.    I like Rainn Wilson and I liked the show but it really wasn't a new concept or that great of storylines. I liked the cast but overall it lost my attention after about 4-5 weeks.     Maybe, I'm not ruling it out   It got better the last few seasons but still not like it was. But those middle seasons were just blah though, you are right about that.   I also am not going to see it because I never saw the originals and this movie didn't pique my interests but let everybody else have their fun.    I didn't watch the show but the title turned me off of it. It's called Weird Loners yet it's a show about a few mostly good looking people who are friends therefore not Loners? Again, I didn't watch the show but that's what the commercials showed and that turned me off to even giving it a chance. Possible bad marketing/title   Capaldi is a great Doctor, writing was sometimes good, sometimes not. Overall, not the best series, but I'm liking 12   This. This. This. This. This. This.    No, Lucasfilm plans on releasing a new Star Wars film each year.   Star Wars: The Force Awakens - 2015  Star Wars Anthology: Rogue One - 2016  Star Wars Episode VIII - 2017  Star Wars Anthology - 2018  Star Wars Episode IX - 2019   Spiderman 3. The whole movie I wanted to like it but was just fighting internally because it just sucked and I couldn't deal with the fact that a Spider-Man movie sucked.    Goblet of Fire is very relevant. It brought about Harry's name which set in motion the events for the entire book   Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire sounds so much better than Harry Potter and the Triwizard Tournament. That sounds like a cheap video game. If we are being more on point with what the plot is about then here are some other suggestions that suck. Harry Potter and the First Year at Hogwarts. Harry Potter and the Time Turner. Harry Potter and the Voldemort Return. Harry Potter and the Death of Dumbledore, Harry Potter and the Battle of Hogwarts.    I'd LOVE to see the Family Guy Star Wars Prequels! There is so much material there   Same thread happened earlier this week.    Same in the US   I dont know which app you use but the Flixster app is quite decent for UV. And any codes you get can be entered straight on Flixster's site. As for the streaming, that must be your internet or app because mine has worked just fine.   UV is included in about 90% of the BluRays I buy. I dont purposefully search it out, but it doesn't cost any more than a BluRay without. I do have a UV library and that has been very helpful.    Yea, a bunch are core apps and pre-installed ones that you can't remove. Then I have pretty much every streaming app (Netflix, Hulu, Yahoo Screen, Flixster, Chromecast,  etc).   But some of my favorites are Twee (for tracking the TV shows you watch. It has an awesome widget that tells you what shows are on what days), Paperboy (RSS/Feedly reader for news articles, best one I've found), obviously Baconreader for Reddit, SwiftKey Keyboard, Google Keep for Notes, and Popup Widget (let's you add the normal icon for an app to your home screen but when you tap it, it opens up the widget for that app as a pop up, really cool and great space saver on your home screen)    Yes, absolutely!   Same here   Haha   Mmmm, I still like Martin the best. I mean, cmon, he's the president.    That is amazing! I've always liked Paul Bettany, I hope this provides a resurgence for his career.    Absolutely disagree. I really like his character and the actor. Maybe I just love Mighty Ducks too much but I'm glad he is on the show   It felt like a middle movie, and yes it had a lot of setup, but I still think it can stand on its own. I maintain that it was really well done   I have a little over 100 apps downloaded. I use labeled folders on my home screens for a lot of them.    Realistically it would probably be Season 7 but I'm kinda wanting the Movie just to fulfill the prophecy. I think I would probably like another season format rather than the movie format though  	102
 Oh I know exactly what you mean! Some people do that to me sometimes, too. "Acting above me" as you described it. I actually think that's quite disrespectful to treat someones feelings this way, since they are what they are and there's always a reason why they are there. They are part of who you are and I think, no one should laugh at you. I also think, that this is not a good way to make somebody trust you. (Don't know if that makes sense outside of my head.)  When you play along, do you sometimes also think, that people think you're kind of stupid or silly things like that?   There's no need to be sorry. :) Everything's fine.   Yes, I also think it should be used a little bit cautiously. :)   Thank you so much for sharing your opinion! I agree that it takes not that much to be plain sarcastic, but more to put sarcasm sophisticatedly to use. Overall I still think, "plain sarcasm" shouldn't be taken too seriously, when it's not used in a harming way.   Interesting thoughts! Thank you very much for sharing and complementing on my English. :)  	4
 answered this somewhere else  China wont allow it because they dont want millions of refugees flooding its border followed by massive American presence on its border. More likely than not the NK elite would flee into China (China allowing it or not) and that would add a whole other level of clusterfuck   China has a lot to gain by keeping NK safe, as much as they dont like them, mainly the fact that they dont want to deal with a massive refugee crisis   ##Weird Way To Spell Island New Brunswick!   ##Alberta Is best Canada   Nothing.  The time was reaching 11:59  We all celebrated, champagne was passed around. It was like new years. Finally for the first time in 14 years no terrorist attack. We remembered the 2006 bombing of the New York Grand Central, the Assassination of the grandfather of liberty in 2007, and our current protector Dick Cheney's ascension after that. But most importantly we remembered the nuclear attack on Los Angeles in 2014, the final straw.  My girlfriend kissed me, and we heard a loud rocking noise from our room. We sighed and laughed. The clock hit 12:00, and for the first time since 2001 the United States of America had been finished.  I looked outside over at the neighbors house. They must be celebrating too. My old neighbor Ali used to live there. We used to watch the games together, and our kids would play together He is no longer our neighbor anymore. Not that I miss him or anything.  It was for the greater good.   The pay is shit, having to respond to idiots all the time, I demand a larger salary  (strikes)  Maybe the troll factory will get pissed off that the 11 year old russians and americans are doing it for free and throw computers into the stret and riot like france for Uber   They told us stories of where we came from, from a place of fjords and the people of the cross. Children's tales, we all thought they were. Vinland  has been our home since the oldest elder remembered. Since we overthrew the red rulers of the land after Odin himself struck them down.  It was the Hr-mna, the month of wildness, when they arrived. Large ships, painted with a red , the cross. General panic ensued, as the nightmare of every child appeared right before their eyes. Many of us got their weapons, however the elders opted to talk to the man.  The ship docks at the port of Straumfjordr, and a stout man in front of a few men holding a machine we would later find out to be called a hand cannon. The man said  "salutations, nous sommes les Chevaliers Hospitaliers et nous exigeons que vous soumettez au pre-fils et l'esprit saint, et accepter Jsus-Christ comme votre Seigneur et Sauveur" (greetings, we are the knights hospitaller and we demand you submit to the father son and holy spirit, and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and saviour).   The man pulled out a bible, imprinted with the unholy cross. The people behind me erupted in a furor, breaking into a chant of "senda  til Hel" (Send them to Hel). The people of the cross, who we now know as the "Knights Hospitaller", recognized the last word, and in a panic put their weapons up. However, there were far more of us than them, and soon arrows littered their bodies. However, the weapon they possessed killed 4 of our brother with rapid force. The ship was boded and a massive battle ensued. We would lose many men, but kill all of theirs. The ship was burned, but these strange machines of death were kept and studied.  We would not see these men for many years. However, tales have reached here claiming that the red empire of Mexaca has fallen. Are we next?   	7
 There Will Be Butthole   I like this!  I need to do this...After I beat the Hydra I kind of just sat there thinking how cool this game is, gazing upon the bottomless lake.  Went up the ladder without completely running around the lake for that golem.  Really trying hard not to use guides except for which weapons I shouldn't be wasting my shards and embers on.  Thanks!   I do have my battle axe at +4.....   I'm level 38, Sorcerer (hi strength, dexterity and intelligence)....Have beat Havel using parrying and backstabs, beat the Darkroot Hydra, and Moonlight Butterfly etc, but CAPRA DEMON !!  Such little space to move around and those dogs!  I can kill one by throwing firebombs over the gate before I go in, but when I go in he just steamrolls me.  Using Drake Sword and Dragon Crest shield....What else do I need to do?!?! edit: Thanks for all the help, really appreciate it!   The thing that bothers me the most is how these anti-gay, self righteous, 'morally just' people can smile while they protest people's right to live and be happy, and free from unwarranted social injustice.  Ignorance IS bliss i guess.   I live in LA and never get to sees stars like this.  This is porn.     BUT does it have Polybius?   I can drink or I can reddit...but I can't do both apparently   Who Framed Roger Rabbit     the animators, who created all the characters.everything involved in this movie is suspect...theoretically who framed Roger Rabbit is a 'biobpic'.  Lots to explore here.   Shit.  "Here's the new shit".  "I am the shit".  "You can't handle this shit".   I stood next to a young woman at an airport baggage claim who was on the cell phone telling the other party that she was in fact "waiting for her shit" to come through the conveyor, then she would meet said party at the designated meeting area.   Presumably to talk shit about each other.   Its friday he gets more than one :)   Katana-Rama!  BANGBANG! BANGBANGBANG!  also chimichangas.   (cracks knuckles) Seeing's how I'm on an ADR stage and waiting for the next 'talent' I thought I'd join this whole ADR, Pam, Pan debate.  If anyone calls it 'Automatic Dialogue Replacement' it's cause you're on set, record a take but notice that an airplane sound (or dogs barking, or a car horn or anything NOT related to the sound sonically) is on the recording.  Well you like the performance but the audio is bad, so you will be "Automatically REplacing the Dialogue" later to preserve the shot. Generally speaking you should think of ADR as ADDITIONAL Dialogue replacement".  Such as Voice Over (narration) or bad quality audio that you don't notice till the dialogue edit happens.  Or if you have to revoice an actor for various reasons.  Hope this helps!  ...and her name was PAM like the spray. edit: Also LOOPING refers to the days when we still used film for the ADR stage, they would just loop the line over and over and the actor would say the line in a loop.  We still do it sometimes these days, but the word Loop just stuck.     Sooooo...you're both assholes?   PRAISE CARLTON   There's nothing more irrelevant and unnecessary than the Republican Party.

 And the chance of the UN making that happen is zero, so saying it just makes them look impotent.    I heard abu zubaydah took the ice bucket challenge...   Saying stupid stuff like this makes them even more of a joke. Its like some little kid telling a grown man he's gonna kick the man's ass. If the kid had made a good argument to the man, tried to reason with him, the man might listen. When you start out with threats/demands that you have no possible way of following through on, you get laughed at.   my aunt who told me that I need to make him come to me  This is really terrible advice. A great way to specifically select for guys who are more desperate/have fewer options. Not so say that guys(or girls) with more options are necessarily better....but common sense dictates that they probably are.    One my good friends went from NYC to Sweden...also married.    Yea...when I interviewed at Harvard (no I didn't get in) a bunch of people were texting the whole time. One girl just left in the middle of the tour to "go meet a friend." I was flabbergasted.    The ER I work in HATES this. Not so much for adults but everyone wants it for kids who miss school. I've never seen anyone refuse to write one so they are essentially meaningless anyway. It's also funny because no one want to waste time meeting a dumb requirement so the letters, in there entirety, generally read something like this: "Johnny is sick and can't go to school. - Dr. XXX."   This is such a non story. "Guy gets mad at business that over charged him." Just an excuse to feel better than someone, like all the stories about beemers parked in front of hydrants.   Yup, frankly the Germans got off pretty light.   lol....if it makes you feel better   Yes, the allies should have accepted millions of more casualties to prevent civilian casualties among a population that largely supported the war's initial aggressors. Sorry no.   So force people to pay to work, those patients will get great care!    Oh believe me, I know all about that. For example: mom with 4 kids in ER "this one has a fever, this one has a sore tooth, this one has a rash, this one won't listen to me." The worst thing is that this is in Massachusetts so she DOES have a PCP paid for by the state.   The truth is you really can't turn away anyone at the ER (especially kids) and if someone is poor and has shit credit there isn't really any way to prevent this. Unless there is a mechanism to deny people care, or actually punish them for wasting medical resources this wont change.   Recently I saw a 16 yo girl who was complaining about sharp LRQ pain. She has no fever or other symptoms, she seems to be faking everything but insists she is in terrible pain and thinks she is going to die. The resident orders an ultrasound just to be sure. Later the girls mom leaves the room and the girl tells the resident "I faked this whole thing because I didn't want to go to school." Too bad. Resident can't tell the mom because of confidentiality concerns and the team decides to go through with the ultrasound. They do this because if she lying now and just wants to go home (has been waiting several hours, already missed school) and something really is wrong, they all get sued.    I'm always terrified I will laugh while giving a prostate or genital exam. It's one thing for the patient to laugh, the physician can gently reassure them that the exam provokes reactions like this in many patients and there is no reason to be embarrassed. If the doctor starts laughing at the patient....how can they really salvage that?    We could raise taxes, cut spending, or decide that there isn't a public "right" to healthcare.   if they want more access for medicaid patients....them's the breaks.    Speaking as a male former Marine....if someone doesn't feel that they are "man enough" or "woman enough" or "tough enough," whichever qualifier need apply....I wouldn't want to serve with them. I certainly wouldn't want things to be changed to make them more comfortable.  When we reached our victor unit, we probably lost 20% of our original strength over the course of six months due to "psych issues," guys running away, guys hurting themselves on purpose, guys purposely getting caught with drugs, etc. These were the guys that didn't want to be there. By the time we went into harms way we were stronger having lost them.   HA....you should really be complaining about capital gains tax rates   This seems like things we have mostly heard before.    They just need to get people to stop giving them money. The homeless have every right to be there but they do frequently cause disruptions, harass people, and are generally bad for business (how many women do you know that specifically avoid Central Square because of this?) If you want to help the homeless make a donation to a shelter, don't give it to someone on the street and encourage this shit.    My point is that these laws just encourage more inane behavior. I'd rather some guy sit quietly against a wall than obstruct traffic or make me think I'm being carjacked.   Doesn't seem to be doing much good. They walk into active traffic and knock on your window in Worcester.   Raise medicaid reimbursement rates and watch this change.    He thinks he did something wrong or that there is something wrong with him. He wants to know what it is so he won't make the same mistake again. You don't owe him anything but you specify that there are "several reasons" why you don't want a relationship with him. It will put his mind at ease and perhaps help him in the future if you let him know. Make it clear that you have no romantic interest in him going on.   and Norway! Fuckin stuck-up jerks of the Nordic states   from massachusetts....dont believe it   Its like all the countries I like are green and all the ones I don't like are red!   4 years in the military   Or maybe they are trying to set expectations. Make it seem like it's gonna be terrible so when the facts come out and they really aren't much more than waterboarding everyone will just go "oh, meh, that ain't so bad."   story of my life :(   Wouldn't it be terrible if private businesses could freely choose with whom to do business?    They just need to import some American rednecks. The redneck will also be costly to your social service agencies but they will keep the radical islam in check and add to diversity.   Drones would probably be pretty useful for targeting their GRADs   I agree. I'm much closer with guys I went to high-school and college with than anyone I went to Iraq or Afghanistan with. Other than occasional facebook stuff I'm not in touch with any of them and have no desire to be. These are guys I lived in a tent with for 7 months, guys who I watched friends die with, guys I saw heard crying. Despite these deep shared experiences...I find I don't have much in common with them. I have more kinship with dudes I took calc 2 with than dudes I got in gunfights with.    it this like a sensitive topic for you?   Street cops. Not political animals like the chiefs of large departments, and the street cops will do whatever their boss tells them.   I would guess the nasty guard has a lot more experience with MRAPs than many of the police officers.   yet I don't get how everyone is going on vacations 1-2x/year  mom and dad   There's nothing really wrong with it. Would you have a problem if she was married to a woman?   Family is smarter than half of reddit, 2/3 of the media, and 90% of the protesters.   Give up, ure arguing with stupid, stupid people.   then please don't ever vote.   OH my mistake....its all about instagram followers. Whats it like to pretend to be part of something?   LOL. People that don't know about it? Do you think people that didn't know about it by this point are going to be great warriors in your social justice army?      *Taxpayers   How about leave the T AND streets open.    I don't know what this means...but I like it.   Funny....I bet most of these people think there should be a mandatory free speech exclusion zone around abortion clinics.   That was on Tuesday night. You know...the one where everyone stays up late because they are going home on Wednesday and maybe have an early morning class that doesn't matter. Perfect time for some pretend activism.   No shit! This has always been one of those tiny, trivial annoyances that made me hate mass.   Thank you, I could not have said it better.    The whole system of permanently removing some of an individuals rights due to a past conviction is wrong and should end. That said, being that the current system is in place and Wahlberg committed multiple, violent, unprovoked assaults. FUCK HIM.   Why the hell wouldn't they be from Boston  I was expressing evidence that in fact many of them are not from Boston.   notice how everything calmed down over Thanksgiving break....?   If you want to inconvenience someone, inconvenience the people that can change things and the people responsible for the problem. Surround the state house and Boston Police HQ. Block access with interlaced arms. Refuse to leave until the state establishes an independent commission to investigate police brutality. Don't engage in activities that specifically inconvenience the people you are trying to win to your side. The cops at the protest are not inconvenienced. They are all making AT VERY MINIMUM several hundred dollars to stand around shooting the shit with their buddies and looking at college girls. They would love if there were protests like this every day.  The "this is about systemic racism" is such a fucking bullshit copout. Racism is real and bad. No shit. I graduated elementary school too. What is your solution? Do you have a specific list of demands or legislative proposals? How do we fix the problem? Right now it is like having a protest against cancer. Yea, I get it, it's a problem, but until there is a message beyond "racism bad" it's like a toddler throwing a tantrum. Entirely counterproductive. If you want to change things you need a specific plan. You can't just whine until someone fixes it like with mom and dad.   Protesting is not necessarily about swaying public opinion or garnering sympathy  Then what is it about? Annoying people? Expressing anger? If it is the second there are much more productive ways to blow off steam without inconveniencing the public and wasting public funds.  Maybe its just about a bunch of college kids that wanna selfie protesting outside their dorm on thursday night.   What a great way to get support for your cause!    It looked like they were all parents there with their kids.    The funny thing was on WCVB the people complaining about the disruption of the performance were black and the people endorsing it were white.   If they want to block things why don't they surround the statehouse or police HQ and block people from entering or leaving, form an arm chain. Blocking traffic just pisses people off. My friend just called stuck in traffic for an hour for the second time in two weeks.   They should do a better job at articulating that because all I hear is MIKE BROWN!!! RACISM BAD!!! They might even win some supporters. EDIT- I'm completely serious. I agree with all your points. However, blocking traffic and screaming "Hands Up Don't Shoot" and "Fuck you racist ass Police" communicates none of them and just turns politically neutral people against you.   You don't fire a lethal weapon at a van full of children to stop a fleeing suspect.      I feel like you're agreeing with me....   As with mike brown and the choke-hold guy in New York. Resisting arrest and being an ass aren't good enough reasons to shoot someone. I used these videos because they very clearly capture exactly what happened (not the case in the first two mentioned cases). They both clearly show officers opening fire in situations when they and others are not in immediate lethal danger. Situations when non lethal options are clearly available.   There were at least 4 cops, in body armor, with multiple rifles, a dog, and non lethal options. The man was retreating. If they can't handle the situation without opening fire they should be fired for incompetence and cowardice.  Source: Infantry Combat vet that has dealt with many, much more dangerous situations.   NSFW: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tpAZObNZfI t=0m51s http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBL6AEkvLbk t=11m30s  This is not a purely black-male problem. It is a police problem. While certainly racism exists in our society and certainly black males are more likely to receive this kind of treatment, framing our national problem with use of force by police as a purely racial issue is a mistake.       How about one banning all public sector unions in the state?    It's great when all kinds of different people can work together in crisis and get something done....even hipsters.   It depends on the country. That shit will work in the EU, the US, Japan, Korea, Australia, NZ, etc. But that shit won't work in China, Syria, or North Korea.   we should start taxing their tea!   No fucking shit, it's laughable. "Naw, man, real life is unfair and hard." Yea, that wasn't the point.    Well if they are in Status Epilepticus you should intubate them, probably best left to a paramedic or doctor   Such a silly argument. What difference does it make if one "race" is slightly more or less intelligent when measured over large populations. Will the people that don't like said race now be allowed to discriminate against them legally? NO. Will said race get some kind of entitlement because they are in some way mentally disabled? NO. Will it still be in everyone's best interest to judge individuals by their individual merit? YES.   Wonder what they're using for footwear   I FOUND A SPY!!!!   that's cute   Looks like the anti-vaccers have found a new ally!   They already had his DNA. They wanted a confirmation from a familial party in the compound as confirmation before the raid.   All the people blocking the road take honking as a sign of support.......yea I'm sure. The people who disagree probably aren't going to make it known when they are surrounded by a bunch of protestors for fear of damage to their car or their body.   Yup veterans and rioters....same thing. Does your case-worker know ure online?   These are the same people that believe cops are racist, thug, enforcers for the corporatist 1%'ers....and the only people that should have guns.   What is the obsession with obstructing traffic? Sounds like a great way to make people that don't really have an opinion hate you.   you ever been?   I wonder how many women and kids were there? Oh wait, its ISIS and they're like super mean so all the normal whining and handwringing goes out the window. EDIT: lol at all the people who missed my point completely or think ISR can reliably determine if non-combatants are present. You learn a thing or two when, you know, you actually fight in middle east.   Maidan and Tahrir laugh at your puny rioting Ferguson   They stole land from people that stole land from other people and now everyone involved is dead.    yea totally forgot...that is like the most hidden grocery store ever   James Mattis   It's called a war. They are unpleasant.    So long as they keep their caveman activity to the mountains of pakistan it sounds fine. Unfortunately they haven't.   absolutely correct   This is too true   To be fair that housing development is a complete waste of resources in Kendall Square, it's all low rises. They should sell it to developers for hundreds of millions of dollars and then use the money to build better, high-rise developments elsewhere in Cambridge.   to be fair there is a 7/11    I'll tell ya another thing: their beer sucks!   Why do you care, it's his life   Pouring bottled water on my corpsman's hands to wash away the blood from our buddy who had just been KIA.   TOTAL BULLSHIT STORY...."when the letters stopped coming we knew he was gone"  FUCKING BULLSHIT....if he had ever been there he would know it takes like 2-3 weeks for letters to get home and casualty notifications are done within 24 hours like 99.99% of the time.   3 year old boy with his dick burned off, it looked like a little piece of charcoal.   fucking disgraceful, especially considering our NCO corps is one of the primary reasons our military is so much better than those built on the Warsaw Pact model.   Just send them to boot camp and put them in "Pork-Chop Platoon." That means half rations and double PT and no advancement until you lose the weight. I still remember the look on those fat dudes faces as we drove past them running through the night....shudder.   This is hilarious  	104
 If you ordered the pizza from a website like JustEat you can probably have the restaurant banned from whatever website that is.   Don't you need really good skills to play in a wormhole? Usually I see people saying you need T3's for them   Ah, the good ol' drake bait.   Sent!   Oops, wrong thread, ignore the pm.    I got linked here from /r/IAmA   You'll be asking yourself that question a lot with the majority of content on this site.   I can just imagine it now -  "The sounds from the flogging is leaking into the recording booths, any ideas?"  "Why not just flog them *to* the movement of every single limb? At least then we don't have to buy some more goddamn absorption panels."   Cool,cheers for the answer.   /r/inbread   What specific dish do you think is best to try if i've never been?   Never been to taco bell, what do you recommend I try if i ever visit?   What? I love how every genuine question in the subreddit is taken as an attack on their intellect, and people wonder why people stay away from the game's community. I really don't know how suspect mechanics work, not trying to argue with anyone...   How can the reps be neutral if you're repping someone that's suspect? Dosen't that make you suspect?    posting something automatically implies you created it  Sounds like the antithesis of reddit.   His character is 10 days old.   You should just take his plex and tell him you lost it on a risky investment.   Tell him to use that ISK to buy a 100mil sp character, at least then he can't complain about not having t2 mods.   Makes sense, thanks for the reply.   Yep, I don't mind it being said in non serious matches of course.   Heard this said on an official stream, what does this word even mean at that level of play? You're not going to see some of these professional players not actually trying to play, or just taking the games as if they were playing normal solo q, playing with their eyes half closed not giving a shit.  Not only that but it's insulting to the player to say that just because someone under performed it means they weren't trying hard enough.  Sorry if this is a bit harsh, but that word is mostly used by people who call people better than them tryhards and people worse than them noobs. It's a really stupid word, and has no place at that level of play.  Thoughts?  Edit: People downvoting, please try to post in the comments instead of just mindlessly disagreeing without an actual argument.   What does 'tps' stand for?   My god, this and all the juicy celeb photos, things that TMZ will pay thousands for.   AFAIK They just nuked the whole facebook page, including the 'apology'. So buttery! Anyone got screenshots?

Hey OP, please don't forgot to give us updates!   Just to clarify, does answering questions about a link you posted count? E.g., you post a guide on x champion, does posting 9 replies to comments/questions in that same post count?   Wow that quote, 2edgy4me.   This is coming from? Ask any pro that's played on both and you'll see the difference. Or even jump on the korea ladder and you'll probably be one league behind your NA  standing.   Don't forget the difference between Plat V KR and Plat V NA is huge.   Better check your tiger privilege, son.   Albeit off topic, that community is so fucking scary - they take that shit way too seriously.   Huge respect, but I can't help but laugh how awkward the reporter must be having to switch from person to person because they all start crying.   Even if it is fake, sometimes ignorance is better - why not just let people enjoy the video and think its real and take happiness away from that?   The pictures are pretty shit, can't actually see what they look like.   Best: One of the richest places in the world, in terms of culture, architecture, etc.  Worst: High cost of living.   Surprised no ones said reddit yet. It's perfect!

My reddit username.   http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/scorpion-takes-a-ride-on-the-tube-9317336.html I'm more looking for the species      It's only one character faster.    Yep. This subreddit takes itself way too fucking seriously, turning into something like /r/shitredditsays where the circlejerk quickly becomes the reality.   Boots has a wonderful Boots brand allergy medication: http://boots.scene7.com/is/image/Boots/10052606?wid=280 hei=343 op_sharpen=1 I think they also have a drowsy one so make sure you read the label.    Excuse me if I don't take the person who obviously has it out for LS and seems to have some weird obsession with how he looks. Seriously, quoting that guy is akin to just linking to Wikipedia as a source.   He's of a diamond play level (he even got scouted by Korean LoL team for top, but they closed the position before he could tryout) , apparently if you ask MonteCristo he'll attest to that.   I think he has a crush on LS OuO! (TBH who dosen't?)   You'd probably be better off posting this on his facebook page, I remember him saying he checks that and answers questions off there.   You'd probably be better off posting this on his facebook page, I remember him saying he checks that and answers questions off there.   Yes because cheating in SC really affects if he's going to scam you out of $45 and lose potentially dozens of future customers. All of my wat.   It seems a bit of a low blow just to try and discredit him over things he did then; and it really shouldn't have any impact on how you view his purely informative guides, it's not like he's trying to put across that he's the most perfect player and person in the universe. We've all made mistakes, as i'm sure you have. We try to learn from them and move on. How would you like it if in every post you made on reddit some guy was bringing up your past begrudgingly?   What did he say?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AS6bc_IbjU   Reminds me of Twitch chat.   -0/10   Just your reminder that Bubba's "worst idea ever" got him into LCS: http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fr1nj/guy_quits_job_to_become_best_support_ever_support/cad3m5l   I feel the need to tell you that you were wrong. Bubba is now in the LCS.  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1fr1nj/guy_quits_job_to_become_best_support_ever_support/cadb5i1    You say that, but the multiplayer in Blacklist is honestly it's best feature, an well worth going through uplay.   That's probably because it's a lot easier to disagree with an idea than to hand over your cash. Also the experiment probably would have been better if they put up a sign "DONT HELP THE POOR" instead, rather than just trying to piss people off with inflammatory comments.

Yeah, no, with the heat in there at some times of day it's pretty impossible to stay awake if you're sitting down. Also I hope you reported it those times you saw it happen.   That SSID/MAC idea is genius, too bad there isn't WiFi in all stations. Although what you could do is set it up so the users taps when he's at one of his stops, the app scans for nearby networks and works of those instead. Not sure if you'd be able to find any in some of the deeper underground stations, however. Maybe you could record the time between each stops after the first time setup, then if no SSID's are available, give or take 5 seconds of when they should be it wakes you up, sort of as a backup for a dodgy phone or network.   You're absolutely right. Who does UKIP think it is, making fun of WW2 like that? Bloody bastards.   That is against my Bushido code of honor.

Edit: This comment really took a nose dive, did I offend you guys by implying that trilbys are better than fedoras?   Maybe you haven't heard - Comic Sans is so 2000 and late, crayon brush is all the new rage in bad graphic design.   You don't go to a comedy show, hear a story about a restaurant then decide on that story if you think it's worth going to that restaurant, do you? Of course not. The comedian is there to make you laugh, and that often entails misrepresenting whatever he's talking about in one way or another. People that don't see that, then complain about how he's misrepresenting whatever game just aren't looking at it right.   You're right, it's shit if you look at it like a review. Too bad his videos aren't meant to be reviews.   Lucky bugger who got that probably lost it moving it through null.   He checks his reddit inbox AFAIK so you can just message him there.   I mean, you say that but you don't actually say how/what program to use. Much helpful, many kind.   /r/respectporn ?   Yeah, fuck men with earrings. Who are they to say how they get to dress?

Hey,  I asked a few hours ago about how I would go about modding one of my Eclipse Phase campaigns. I got a ton of really awesome answers.   I made these wallpapers primarily for me and the people I play, but since you guys are really cool I thought it only fair to share them here.  Please feel more than free to use/share them :   http://imgur.com/qV4lYfv,wLmKDdA,BegnmIF#0   Hey,  I'm looking to run an Eclipse Phase scenario with some of my mates (two) and the only problem is the majority of the scenarios come with a 'required' amount of four players. I however see people/books saying that it is possible to run a scenario with less players, but no where have I read how I would alter the scenario for less players.  Let's say there's four enemys they have to face, do I just halve that down to two enemys? Or would I halve some of their stats instead?  Of course it isn't always as simple as this, so i'd be interested and appreciate any help people could give.  The scenario i'm interested in is Glory, if that helps.  Cheers.            I've heard people use subcap, cap, supercap, carrier, dreadnaught and titan. I'm just really confused as to what the usage of the 'cap' ones are. Afaik the 'cap' ones are used independent of of the other ones? What ships do they apply to?  Cheers  Edit: thanks to everybody that helped, upvotes to all!   Hi, Does anyone have a link to a list of support skills that you should prioritize on making a new character? I've seen plenty of lists but they usually just list all of them instead of which are most important.   Also if anyone knows what support skills are good to train if you don't know what EWAR race you'll be flying but want to generally go ewar?   Cheers for any help.         The goal of zen is to trick the ego, i.e. to trick it into making the illusion go deeper and deeper, until eventually you are able to look back at the game you've played and realise the futility. Only then you can live half as the ego, and half as the God head, as a true genuine fake. Playing the game of life, just as you always did, in the same way as you always will.  Maybe Enso represent the full circle that the ego takes on its journey to be extinguished ?  I think people take the rituals too seriously, but maybe that's the point.  Just some thoughts, take them as you will.      I find myself walking into the enemies because I missclick the minimap way too much.

If I do end up making something for you I don't really mind how much doge you give me, just not a stupid amount.  Will check back later on today and get on any requests!             Hi all, here's my character sheet : http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/twilights-hammer/Enigmi/advanced and i'm looking for some help on where to go next. I'd like to continue tanking, so can I do heroics now or do I have to get better gear before I start them? Where would I get this gear ? Also, I have about 314 Ghost Iron Ore and I was wondering If i should keep them and prospect them when my jewelcrafting gets high enough or turn them into bars and AH them or get a blacksmith to make me gear with then? Any ideas? Thank you for any help!.

It seems to have all the good elements of what a Star Trek series should be, but the only element that stands out to me as being the hallmark of TNG is it's affinity for a philosophical undertone, which all of the Star Trek series have.

Now I always try and wait for the opponent to make their move, so that I can get the card advantage and what not; but most of the time they also wait for my move and so it becomes almost a stale mate. This stays until I play a card and they end up assassinating it or whatever, and they always end up getting more cards on the board. Anyone have any tips that would help someone like me ? Just basic stuff; iv'e watched kripp/ls's videos so far.  Also, can anyone lead me to any resources for building a strong mage control deck ? I don't have any Legendaries yet but iv'e unlocked all the mage basic cards.   http://whois.domaintools.com/hitbox.tv [1]  http://own3d.tv.ipaddress.com/ [2]  He also has Oleg in his G+ Circle :  https://plus.google.com/105814245529036999531/posts [3]  In case you've never heard of own3d :   http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/16rxev/own3dtv_a_beginners_guide_to_being_an_asshole/  EDIT: Please proceed to  this thread : http://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1qv28i/psa_hitboxtv_is_essentially_own3dtv_the_current/         I found a really good website that helped me organize my thoughts, it was basically a note taking website that acted like a folder system:  You could add a list of bullet points, then click on one of the bullets and it would take you to almost another folder, where you can put more bullet points.

 Holy shit that's disturbing.    Voiced by Stephen Colbert.    But can I do it in 5 days?    Fuck cords. Bluetooth is where it's at.

People complain about the weather, traffic, their partners, raising kids.  I think it's morphing into a more complete real world view.    If you sign up to get married and cheat, you're simply a person of low moral character regardless of society or social media.

He blames everything on social media and everything else.  Like it's societies fault people divorce and cheat.  He picked a person who was into such things and obviously capable of cheating.  He's part of the reason why he's divorced.  He made some decent points but he acts like a victim and that society is in general is falling apart.

Unless it doesn't matter.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Callahan_%28American_football%29   In January 2013, Callahan was publicly accused of sabotaging Super Bowl XXXVII by several former players.[5] According to comments by Tim Brown and others, the Raiders struggled on offense during Super Bowl XXXVII because of Callahan changing the game plan from a heavy run attack to a heavy passing one on the Friday before the game. Brown offered no proof for the sabotage claim, but said: "this is the problem we have, because of [Callahan's] relationship with Gruden, because of his disdain for the Raider organization; that's what makes people get to that conclusion."    Rich Gannon defended Callahan, but did suggest that Oakland may have been disadvantaged by Callahan's failure to change the terminology for play calls at the line of scrimmage. According to Gannon, the same play names had been used during Gruden's tenure as Raiders coach, and Gruden had taught his Buccaneers defensive players these play names.   Jerry Rice, an NFL Hall of Famer who was a wide receiver for the Raiders at that time, was quoted as saying, "I was very surprised that he waited till the last second and I think a lot of the players they were surprised also so in a way maybe because he didn't like the Raiders he decided 'Hey look maybe we should sabotage just a little bit and let Jon Gruden go out and win this one.'"   Callahan has denied the allegations, stating that, "While I fully understand a competitive professional football player's disappointment when a game's outcome doesn't go his team's way, I am shocked, saddened and outraged by Tim Brown's allegations and Jerry Rice's support of those allegations made through various media outlets over the last 24 hours. To leave no doubt, I categorically and unequivocally deny the sum and substance of their allegations." Callahan further referred to the claim as "ludicrous and defamatory."   Brown backtracked from his comments a day later, denying having said that Callahan sabotaged the game.   Bryce Petty looks good.

 Completely agree on the first point. In fact, the main motivating factor of my main character is simply the pursuit of knowledge and the general fascination/love of magic.   And I think the idea of tying magic   history together is always fascinating (ie alternative histories), but in this particular story the knowledge that magic exists is not widely known.    It's not commonplace (since it's not common knowledge that there is magic). But essentially you can choose to learn fire magic if you want to, but may never really be good at it. Just like everyone can probably learn to play piano (to varying degrees, depending on the amount of time spent on learning and practicing) but not every person is going to be naturally gifted at it such as Mozart or Beethoven.    This is a very good point. Perhaps it would make sense for magically inclined people to be naturally targeted by a certain group of other magicians so that they would need to learn some magic to at least defend themselves.     Yeah I think that works in your case when the type of magic is something specific, but in my world - it's really up to the person. There are all sorts of magic, ranging from alchemy to pyromancy to evocation, etc etc. You may have more skill for particular type of magic than others, but you can theoretically try to do whatever you want.   The issue then becomes, why would someone want to master fire magic for example? It has very few regular world uses and sure you can have one or two pyromancers who are firefighters or stage magicians but what about the general masses of pyromancers? Why would they even want to bother with something that really is just a cool trick (assuming they are the average Joe and NOT running around to defeat evil magicians or spirits).    Hey guys,   Having a little trouble here and was hoping to brainstorm and bounce some ideas off of the community.   So it's easy enough to create motivations for specific main or supporting characters (it can be something very specific, such as revenge for murdered friend or power through obtain some magical artifact or capturing a specific spirit/demon, etc) but what about the motivations or goals of the rest of the general magical community at large (in an urban fantasy setting)?    Here are some examples of general motivations I've come up with:   * They want to keep the magical community a secret (or not).  * They want to keep the bad guys/forces/spirits at bay.  * They want to influence the human/magical government and policies.  * They have family tradition/responsibilities to uphold.  * They use it to make their regular lives/jobs easier.  * They want to keep magic around (like a dying language or something).   But even still, the problem is what does the average magician Joe want with his magic in life? He's not particularly powerful, he's not power hungry, he's not into politics, and he doesn't really have some sort of old family duty to keep some evil spirit in line. Why does he practice magic and what role does his magic play in his life? To take it even further, our average magician Joe has a rather impractical ability such as pyromancy - how the hell does he use this in his regular life and why would he even want/keep this ability?

I think it's a little bit of both. The first episode is more quiet and serious in tone as well and I think that it suits Capaldi's older and more reserved doctor.    Yup - these are the two I would pick.   Teleportation - for instant travel to places on the other side of the world.  Persuasion - works pretty much the same as mind control, but costs way less.   Sigh... I literally bought this game 2 weeks ago for $26.    Thanks - but it was so sad to see her go. I think she was best supporting member of the investigation squad.    This the snub I'm most pissed about. Brooklyn Nine-Nine was easily my favorite comedy this past season. Plus it won the GGs! It's almost like a slap to the face.    Exactly - I was fully expecting Cranston to win and would have accepted Hamm finally getting his recognition. Instead we get some left field Jeff Daniels win. A definite WTF moment.    I'm baffled that it was left off the nom list. It was easily my favorite comedy last year. It seems like a slap in the face to the show especially since it just won the Golden Globe for both best comedy and best comedy lead.    Basically because HBO wanted to win a Best Drama/Leads awards instead of Best Mini-Series awards. I don't think they should have allowed it as they replaced deserving candidates who are rightfully in the regular categories. True Detective is a Mini-Series.    Yeah... seeing her name next to the likes of Julianna Margulies is just so LOL-worthy.    Evidently... I'm still pissed that he won last year somehow. That slot could have gone to someone more deserving.    Newsroom was incredibly mediocre... I'm not even sure how he won last year to be honest. By giving Jeff Daniels a slot, they robbed more deserving candidates like Mads Mikkelsen for Hannibal, Matthew Rhys for The Americas or James Spader for The Blacklist. It's a complete shame. Also, True Detective submitting for Drama instead of Mini-series also crowds out the categories. (Which for the record, I really don't agree with... especially with Fargo submitting for Mini-Series).    Definitely agree... they should have kicked Downton Abbey off in favor of Hannibal, The Good Wife, or The Americans. The Best Drama category was so crowded already this year, especially with True Detective submitting for Best Drama as well. This slot totally should have gone to a more deserving show. :(    No Brooklyn Nine-Nine, no Hannibal, no The Good Wife, and no The Americans? BOOO :(      Just any other suggestions would help - I'm not sure either.    Foundation's a good spot though beware they only carry American whiskeys. There's also C Grace and Fox's in Raleigh.

Keep on writing everyone - only half a year more!      My friend lent me an older SanDisk memory to use for a bit when I initially bought a camera (and was still waiting on mine to come in the mail). After messing around for a couple of days, I go to remove the pics using my computer and got the "this memory card maybe damaged error". I noticed the gold metal part of the memory card has some marks on it (from wear, no dents or bends).   Wondering if anyone has any ideas on how I could try recover the data. For the record, it doesn't work anymore in the camera either and I've tried using an usb to the computer as well instead of directly inserting it. I've also tried using a data recovery program (Disk Drill) with no luck either. I've pretty much given up the data as lost but there's a couple of pics on it that I'd like to save if possible - wondering if anyone else had any ideas. Thanks!   I'll be there this week.    Agree - the uppity attitude I got there was completely unnecessary and made me feel unwelcome.    I love that Kroger on the corner of Maynard and High House.

Hey guys, I've been trying to get back into playing badminton recently - wondering if there was anyone else interested in playing? There's a new badminton place that opened up near the airport (called Badminton NC) which has pretty nice courts I got a month pass to. I used to play a little back in the day and I would say I'm an advanced beginner or low intermediate skill level.    I tried the Black Knight today when I was at the place and seemed fine to me. I might go for the Nanoray 10 since it's very similar and it's only like $10 more. They were supposed to have one for demo but they were all sold out.    I've recently gotten back into playing badminton and I'm looking to buy a racket. I used to play on my high school team way back in the day, but I'm probably an advanced beginner or low intermediate skill level and an all round player. I'm not looking to play competitively and just want something that will be decent enough. I just looked for something that will suite my skill level and maybe allow a little room for improvement.   Ideally would like to keep it within $70-80 tops, but I'm willing to look at anything in a $50-$100 range. I was looking at the Nanoray 10 and Arcsaber 002 online just because Yonex is what I'm most familiar with and I used to have a Carbonex (before it broke). When I went to the badminton place today, the guy there recommended the Black Knight Impluse 739 which he said was a great value for the price. What do you guys think? I'll also take other recommendations as well.   I'll be watching the US-Portugal match with friends so I'll see you guys next week.    Favorite Dramas:  1. Breaking Bad 2. The Wire 3. The Shield  4.

The trailer makes it look super intense and action packed when the premise is totally wtf really?    Any chance you want to share your script? I'd be interested in reading it.    Yup exactly.    Probably not - though I would say you could always read up through book 3 though.    You put it perfectly.   Some of it was impactful as it should have been. Some characters died who are not dead (which leads me to believe that since GRRM has told the producers major plot points that I need to stop watching GOT or I'll be reverse spoiling the books for myself).   * Tyrion killing Shae   Tywin - not as impactful due to omission of his first wife backstory in the show  * Tyrion and Jaime are still on good terms - what is this future impact?  * Jojen dies - is this a reverse book spoiler?  * Gregore Clegane - minor reverse book spoiler    Especially since it's exactly how book 3 is closed out and I remember almost shitting myself when I originally read it.    It's such a missed opportunity for a total WTF cliffhanger moment (just like it is in the books). :(    I was like maybe they'll have a post credits scene... too many Marvel movies for me apparently. :/ I really thought they missed a great opportunity there - unless they can somehow end the next season on that scene.    Agreed - that's all I could think about the entire time.   Awesome! Let the poopage commence!    Awesome - FYI we've got 6 currently so bring some games that will play that many or 3/3.    That might a good solution. Unfortunately I don't have a dual band router but I'll definitely keep this in mind.    Yeah but I essentially can't use internet unless I reset the router and a lot of times when it happens it'll happen again after 15 mins or so. I can't continuously reset the router as a good solution.    I'm casting via videostream and technically it kills the wifi in the entire house as my phone didn't connect either the last time it did that.    Welp we definitely have enough now.    5 PM    Good point - will add this to the topic.    I've noticed that sometimes while casting, the chromecast kills my laptop's wifi connection. My laptop will show that I'm connect to the internet with full bars of signal strength but websites won't load or anything. The only way to fix this is to manually reset my router. Does anyone know why this is happening or have a fix?    I'll be hosting this week as a bunch of people are out of town. As usual, discuss what games and food you are bringing.

I don't think this is an issue because my router is located 10 feet directly below where my laptop usually sits.    I tested while computer was hardwired to internet - same issues. Any other ideas?    What kind of sander did you use?    Not defending the script or anything as it literally is a giant turd, BUT I read somewhere that in the original shooting script Anakin had a couple of reasons why he joined the dark side of the force and that one of the reasons was that he genuinely believe the Jedi were going to try and seize control. They did some reshoots after the movie was completed to change his reasoning to only wanting to save Padme and I assume that line is just left over from the original script and they just didn't really think much of it.     I'll be there too!    Love it!   I taught in a Chinese middle school for 3 months during a summer while I was in college for a volunteer program. This is completely accurate example of what a school lunch in China looks like (even down to the metal plates. I usually had white rice or stir fry noodles in that large section and then you had the choice of three sides (and there were usually about 6 or so to choose from - ranging from beef to pork to chicken to various veggie dishes). That smaller round hole in upper left corner is usually for a drink, which at my school was hot or cold soy milk.    My favorite to go Chinese dish. I still request my parents make it every time I visit them and they always make fun of me since it's such a simple dish.    Lol ops - fixed.

Hey guys I bought a chromecast recently and have been using videostream to cast local files. When it works, it's awesome, but I've been having some issues I was hoping you could help me with. I'm on a mac also so a lot of what has been mentioned hasn't helped.   - Never finds the chromecast when I initially launch. I must type chrome://restart to have videostream find my chromecast even though other tabs/youtube/etc all cast perfectly fine without having me to do this.  - Stutters like crazy when I try to play large mkv format files (720-1080p). Playing standard quality mp4s have never been an issue, but anything HD seems to stop and go to the point where it's unwatchable. Videos are encoded x264 - is this the issue? H264 encoded vids do not seem to be better.  Also, I have a 2 year old macbook pro (intel core i7 processor) and my internet is 4MB down/.5MB up. My video stuttering is checked to "yes".   Anyone have any ideas as to what can help?    Week 20! Hope everyone is still chugging onwards.   Use this thread for updates and posting your snippets.

Hi guys - I'm currently looking for a cool roomie to share my house.   I have one room available for rent in a spacious 4 bedroom house (2500 sq ft).  You will be sharing the house with myself (female) as well as two males. We are all young professionals working in the RTP area (two at Cisco). Rent will be $550/month and we will split utilities and cable/internet, but if you would prefer a flat monthly rate we can work that out as well. The bathroom will be shared with two people but everyone is pretty clean and neat. There are a couple of large commons spaces and there is lots of extra room for storage in garage and there is a bonus room as well.   About me:   * I'm a big foodie (eating, cooking, you name it)   * I love books, tv shows   movies! * I'm a gamer!  * Going out and meeting new people (and having fruity girly drinks)  * I love traveling!  A little more about the house:   * The house is located right off of Davis Dr. and Morrisville Carpenter Rd * Super convenient to I-40 (20 mins to downtown Durham or Raleigh!)  * Bright and cheery inside the house (lots of natural light and space!)  * Great oversized deck in the back that's perfect for grilling   entertaining!  * Recently renovated kitchen!! Brand NEW stainless steel appliances and tile!   If any of that sounded like your cup of tea - shoot me an PM! Pictures of the house and room can be provided on request. Also, feel free to PM me with any questions! :)    Use this thread for updates and posting your snippets. Don't worry if you fall behind or miss a week, just keep on pace with the current week.

So I got a Chromecast way back when it first came out but wasn't too impressed with it's ability to play local HD video files (stutter, low quality stream, and lack of certain video/audio support) so I gave that one to my parents.   A friend recently told me about the Chromecast + Plex solution that's available now for streaming local files so I'm thinking about buying another one (especially since they're on sale right now).   My question for you guys is this: how is your experience with the HD playback with Chromecast + Plex? My up/down is 40Mpbs/5Mpbs and I would be running plex off of a 4 year old computer that is i5 dual processor and 4 GB of ram. The majority (~80%) of my files are 10-30GB mkvs, but I also have some smaller mp4s as well.    Use this thread for updates and posting your snippets.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_ridge   i won $300 at a casino, then spent most of it at a strip club   i was always running away from something and my legs would feel really heavy, and i wouldn't be able to run fast enough   thank you. i still have some research to do but now i have a starting point   what's the name of waldo's evil twin?   so CO2 emissions cause greenhouse gasses which reflects some radiation back towards earth? and radiation is the same as light. do i have the jist of it?   so then why are you at the mall?   so the earth has always been getting warmer since it was created? what is infrared radiation? which way is the radiation ejected, back towards earth?    why is earth's climate getting warmer?      thank you   I KEPT SAYING "STOP" BUT SHE WOULDN'T. even when tears streamed down my face, she wouldn't just let me run away and lock myself in the bathroom. i think she craved my humiliation, she loved being stronger then me. she loved being on top and dominating me until i couldn't take it any longer and peed my pants. she just wouldn't stop tickling me   ross's is hardly noticeable, i sound like a cartoon character. that's a good idea though, thanks.    already have it memorized, that's how nervous i am. and actually if i think about what i'm going to say before i say it then i'm more likely to stutter. english is my first language, speech therapy didn't do shit   i was thinking about saying my nickname was "boston joe" on the first day of class, but didn't because of shyness and not knowing anything about boston   is it just me or does everyone with down's syndrome look like twins?   i say these whenever i'm home alone   what? that is the opposite of how i was taught. i was taught to curl my tongue backwards. i just tried your way and i can't do that either.   i'm 21 and i've had this problem all my life. i used to go to speech therapy for years until i just gave up (also have a stutter). it didn't do shit.   how far back should i curl my tongue? was there anything specific that really helped you?   ok thank you. i'll have to go buy a mouse so i can do that. this isn't my computer i'm on   ok i'll try that, thanks   thanks. what's a driver and how do i re-install it?   yup   nope. i thought of that, not an 80 year old   yup. testicular trauma its called   THE DOCTOR SAID HE WOULDN'T TELL MY PARENTS ANYTHING WITHOUT MY PERMISSION, HE LIED. one of my balls (actually the ballsack) is a lot bigger than the other because i rode my bicycle into an oncoming car. when my mom comes back in the room. he draws my genitals on his notepad and shows my mom. he then says what size my balls are on a scale of one to ten, and then goes on to tell us what size his balls are.   shit. i guess i should have waited for an answer. thanks for looking this up, you went above and beyond   nosleep. that's it, thanks   that's a good idea but my friend is fishing in alaska so i don't know where to get weed   nothing to do with you if that's what you mean.    do you know the name of that thread for creepy stories?   ok thank you. i've never done this and i can see how this would be helpful. thanks a lot   hmm i'll try that, thanks. your comment might actually be helpful for a change. i like to write strange fiction but i'll give this a shot.   two problems with that: i only have one friend and he's kind of permafried, and i'm too self conscious for that anyways.   my problem is that i can't get my ideas onto paper. i can't even write for 15 minutes without getting frustrated and needing a smoke break   i'm too self conscious for that. maybe i'll put some of my stories on reddit.   the only drink i've ever ordered at a bar is manny's   ok thanks   what sorry? i think i've heard of tonic water. away to google i goooo   ok thanks   what is tonic?   double just means twice as much alcohol right? non clear rum means it was stored in barrels right?    what is that?   really? can is better then bottle?   i knew someone would say this but i didn't think it would be the very first comment   i hate all the women on the daily show   its just that i'm terrified of my parents smelling lotion on me or hearing the noise   i masturbate without lotion or lube or anything like that.   no but last week i started a new job and the day after my first day of work i dreamed that i would walk out of the store and somehow would wind up right back in it. this kept happening until a security guard came up to me and asked to talk. then out of nowhere another security guard comes up behind me and grabs my balls. i don't fight back but it hurts bad. i wake up and think this dream means that society finally has me by the balls.  	72
 People who put raisins in cake should be prosecuted by cake courts.     That's a solid vice.   I'm literally at work.   That took a lot, didn't it?   Two for cake.   Nice.  I like it.  I have one of the flagship year Mazdaspeed 3's but I'm not super into fixing it up...probably b/c I live in a city and almost never drive.   What kind of cake?   Books! Now I'm picturing Johnny-5 tearing up a library, shaking a bit from the large dose of books.      That is a proper full sentence.  Please learn English, bot.      You're doing great!

TIFU  The titles are always misleading that anyone can relate to.  TITLE: "TIFU by going to the grocery store"  TEXT: "I walked around with my cart of groceries, texting, and didn't see the guy on the ladder who I bumped into causing him to fall and knock over a case of soda!"  REALITY: You fucked up by bumping into some dude because you weren't paying attention.  The fuck up was NOT going to a grocery store.   It was so *underground* then!   I think you're beautiful! 9.5/10   Will a hipster still buy its album?   Hi. I spent 4 years in the Navy.  During this time, I was required to do a lot of swimming for my job and I also did long distance running (halfs   fulls) in my spare time.  I also lifted heavy.    Generally gains   distance do not go well together.  I found it almost impossible to keep on weight from lifting.  I was eating A LOT and still, weight would just fall off. I'd be waking up several hours before a race to consume a crap load of high hypoglycemic carbs to fuel throughout the run and dumping on proteins afterwords.  If you're going to prepare for this, know that you will likely lose mass.  On a side note; it's not very good for your joints to carry a lot of mass when doing distance.     Beautiful. Fit. Tall? 10/10.   Good one.   You do not look 19.  Currently 6/10. Some suggestions: Your skin looks dry.  Try cocoanut oil, this might help you look closer to your age too.  You look sad.  Smiling, even if it's forced, makes us happy.  Try it.  And don't just smile with your mouth, smile with your eyes.     Do you actively seek a girlfriend?  What kind of girls are you going for?   9/10 - so hot.   The odds of me contracting a severe STD, based off of the demographics that I date, are roughly 1 in 100,000.  I'll take those odds.  How's your personality treating ya?  Can't get a bf but you're not fat or ugly?  Good luck with that.   Haha, yea man, thanks. Keep being awesome!   Dude, when I was your age I used to think of all these things I could do to look older.  Be patient really is a virtue and it *will* pay off.    I'm m31 living in NYC. I didn't stop growing until I was like 24 and didn't get my true confidence until maybe 27 but now, it's like I can have any girl I want. I love it.  Keep up the gym, stay active, stretch and above all, just believe in yourself - life can get SO awesome!   6.5.     You look very young and as a fellow young looking late bloomer I can affirm that you can definitely benefit from this later in life.  7/10. Get in shape and you'd be more like a 9.  	34
 Oh ok. Well I haven't tried it yet, but it seems the last 3 are kind of hard. And if you have been programming for less than a year, I wouldn't feel bad. The author of the article is a little pretentious.   If it is difficult for you, then  that's means it is a great example for you to work through. I'm sure people here would be happy to help! If you figure it out you will feel great and will learn in the process   You mean it was too easy?   LPT if you can't do this now, create a quick repo with a readme.md that contains the 5 problems. I already made a repository so I can come back to these problems later, and the questions are in my readme file.   My link https://db.tt/5mRlvfGS. I could use some more space for baby pictures!   Cuddle, then maul someone.   Karma.   Welcome to Reddit, newbie :)    These are two different things.  That's my point... you lumped it together. And   Long story short, I've been writing "apps" since a decade before they were called "apps" and long before you had pubic hair  And another way you make yourself look like a d-bag by rubber stamping your authority. It sounds like you are over-compensating for something. Someone with 15 years experience doesn't tell you they have 15 years of experience unless:  * Their experience came into question * They are lying * They are insecure and worried no one will take them seriously  It can't be the first option, because you mentioned your experience before we even began talking. You entered a conversation and jumped in with an irrelevant opinion, and bragging of your experience. You reek with artificial superiority.  But please tell me how you were doing X while I was doing something only a child does. That really makes you appear mature and above childish arguments.   Who the hell refers to iOS apps as 'web apps'? Web app implies an app through a browser. So anything that gets information from the web is a 'web app'? Well that's new! (sarcasm)   Edit: They are called fucking Fig Newtons, I'm reading it off the box you idiot.  wtf?  And I like how you bragged and gloated "I'm the shit and know more than you (even though I didn't even ask what you know) and I've been doing this for 15 years" - when your rant wasn't even relevant, neither was your AMAZING experience in 'app' development. Like who gives a crap? We are talking about naming conventions of the OS versions. If you didn't come off like a pompous douchebag, I probably wouldn't have said anything.   At least I don't claim to know everything. I simply attacked your statements. At no point did I say, "I know more than you" or did I say I have "x years of experience and I am and expert in the field". You put yourself on a pedestal, so I tried to knock you on your pretentious ass. Maybe if you were more clear wtf you meant the first time around (and weren't a complete tool), then we wouldn't be here right now.   Opinion? Can you please tell me what web apps are coded in Objective C or Swift? Most web apps aren't even written nowadays in Java anyway (even though you could).  Either way you were complaining about *Android*, which has nothing to do with web apps or web sites.   I Googled nothing. And again, your rant is irrelevant and seems to show your ignorance and blatant Android hating based on nothing.   Have you ever even written an Android app? Sounds like you have not, which makes your rant really stupid. I say you have not written an Android app because you said:   I've written websites and web apps for 15 years  As if that somehow makes you qualified to give an opinion on coding Android or iOS.  And: WHO GIVES A CRAP??   Yes I guess this is more of a "TIL something I should have known 3 years ago"   Dude no one gives a crap about your rant here... go complain on /r/shittyprogramming or something.    TL;DR ~ I've coded both. I've written websites and web apps for 15 years. I've written apps since before you even knew the word was associated with something other than that small meal you eat before your actual meal.  Um who was talking about 'both'? And what do websites and web apps have to do with Android and iOS (and who was talking about iOS anyway?)  Last I checked Android is written in Java, iOS in Obj-C/Swift - web apps are written in CSS/HTML/Javascript/PHP/C#/etc. So either you are full of crap or too lazy to actually say what you mean.   right      That's hilarious. So much so that I almost gilded you.    instead of just rolling over for public unions.  Except that's what they've done for decades, and that's why we are where we are.   For those who defend Chicago Teacher's salaries with the 'cost of living' - New York City teachers get paid about the same (slightly less actually) than Chicago teachers. **However, the cost of living in NYC is 50% higher than in Chicago**.  I'm calling BS on this 'cost of living' justification nonsense.    The cost of living is also above the national average. Relatively decent pay also prevents people from going to improved settings.  Not compared to other major cities where teachers make *less* money than Chicago, and their cost of living is *higher*. Chicago teachers have it **very well**, even the more so when accounting for cost of living.   Example - cost of living is much higher in New York - yet they make less than Chicago teachers. In fact, if you account for living expenses, it makes Chicago salaries almost 50% higher than New York.   Because its not the CTA   I DECLARE SHENANIGANS   I agree   The article says the same thing - which means it's not giving us proper information. You cannot survive without water for 5 days. Period. So something is missing. I read the article and learned nothing new. My point stands.   Um you can't survive 5 days without water...   [Anyone can learn to code](http://www.Anyonecanlearntocode.com)  I don't know too much about it, but the one person I know seems to have done pretty well. He wasn't job ready, but he was ready for an internship when he was finished. Also while he was working at the internship, he helped out at the boot camp.   Ok but I don't think this forum is for people who care about the financial state of Apple. Not a very interesting answer - although possibly true.   I messaged my friend (who had the internship and now a job). I don't know the name. Will get back to you.   Why? That wouldn't make for a better product. Who cares which manufacture the chips come from?   Tell you I'm pro-life, anti same-sex marriage, and of course, a Republican    Would you mind pointing out testimonials of people who went from zero to employed in 60 days? I can't wrap my mind around that, so I'd appreciate some narratives to guide me through that.  No no, 60 days is nuts. I have a friend I personally know who went to a bootcamp that took somewhere between 4-6 months. He then got an internship, and then got a job. It was a Ruby/rails bootcamp in Chicago. I'm trying to get the name of it. Will report back.      3 months even for 1 language is completely unrealistic. HTML/CSS/Javascript in 3 months? Possibly. Maybe. But doubtful. The boot camp that I know of is longer than three months, and seems to have good job placement. It's small and has a lot of individual attention.     And some bootcamps are worth 10x more than my CS degree  Well there are two years of garbage (humanities english history math you probably will never use, even in CS..). The other two years is a lot of concepts, and coding that you end up having to teach yourself anyway.   My statement was a bit of an exaggeration, especially if we are talking about a 3 month program.   Why does everyone love Uub so much?    Except that long hair is not genetic... you either choose to cut your hair, or choose not to...   I always see a lot of anti-bootcampers here. I think we need to make sure we make that distinction that *some* bootcamps are complete garbage. And *some* bootcamps are worth 10x more than my CS degree.   It's really not that complicated. Research your bootcamp before signing up. There are some really bad ones, and some really good ones.   No need to argue here.   Got this cube the other day. It is just as awesome as I thought it would be. un-shapeshifting it isn't so hard. I got 5 out of 8 corners without a problem. The last two corners might be kind of difficult. It is really a great cube   Need to get 4 paddles and 4 cases for work. The budget they will allow is $100. What is my best option at this price?   Terrorists got killed - no one cares.

I use phpStorm for PHP/HTML/CSS if I need (haven't gotten to Javascript yet).  Anyone play around with VSC yet?   I love the stare-down at 1:17   And? The draft was yesterday. I use an add-on to chrome that's shows Reddit comments instead of YouTube comments. So I posted. Get over it.   He be goin to Da Bears!   Tesla would do a 10x better job than these scheming dealers.   Yes you will need to buy a domain name and get hosting. Good luck!   I've been told [Odesk](http://www.odesk.com) is the best.   I am not voting for any Democrat, but I like to see a good challenger to Hilary. I think it is good for the entire Presidential race to have him on, even if he doesn't win the nomination.    Every account on reddit is a bot except you   Yea I hear that - but what percentage don't have family to take care of? Would it be 50%? 80%? 10%? I have no idea.   Has anyone actually calculated the cost of putting someone on the street vs treating them 24/7 in a facility? The facility could easily cost the taxpayer $100k per year (that's a low number). Is it possible that him being on the street would more expensive than that? Doubtful, but it does have a cost.   The people who voted for Democrats who bankrupted this state need to feel the consequences of their actions (as well as wealthier folk who also voted for Democrats).    can you explain how it will cost the taxpayer if there are cuts?      What about a proper sub? I couldn't care less for English dub. I'd rather watch it sooner in English sub.   Haha yea well its supposed to be funny in context as well   See Cmder   Doesn't Cmder already have Clink?    Digi-Capital has also included revenues from the Chinese Android app stores, which don't stock Google apps and don't give Google any cut of the revenue. Google's suite of apps aren't available in China after all."  Wait so China has their own Play store?   Thanks for the input, will take your advice. I'll fix up the site tonight. last question - in my html for the image reference, should I use the URL, or the local file location? I noticed you used url, but that is only because you wanted to show what it looked like.    img{      width: 100%;      max-width: 900px; /*or whatever number you fancy*/  }  So that makes it look better in the browser, but now on my phone it seems to default to 900px (which is wider than the phone).   Why does that happen?   So on the phone I want it to expand to the edges, but on desktop, if it expands to the edges its simply too large.   I guess ideally I would want the picture to expand to a max number of pixels, which I think someone else has made that suggestion.   EDIT: I like how you restructured the CSS. Thanks! I am actually changing the picture to a different Rabbi, which has a ratio that is taller, and not wider.  EDIT: Although why the specific sizes for the text? Why not just use h1, h2, h3 etc?    Yea I know about bootstrap, but I haven't gotten into it yet. I will learn it at some point, but for now I want to know how to do this with just CSS. I shouldn't need a framework to accomplish such a simple task.   As long as Nestle keeps making my Nespresso, I'm good.   [Here](http://www.askyourlor.com) is a simple website that I am working on. I want it to display some text, and then a picture. The problem I am having is that it either looks great on mobile or desktop: but not both.  I'm using the        meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0"  line to help with mobile (although I don't completely understand what it does). However the following code seems to make the picture too large on desktop:          img {             max-width: 100%;         }  If I change the max-width to 60%, then it looks great on desktop, but the pic is then too small on mobile (it doesn't go all the way to the edges).   Any help out there? EDIT: Any other suggestions on my website are completely welcomed. And don't ask about the content.    Best comment so far   Ah I see. Well Saturday is impossible for me. WOuld I be able to come on Thursday and print out the tickets?   Lol so I gotta fly to Vegas in order to sell these tickets?   So what information are you adding here? That is a cancellation policy in case you don't pick it up. That's not what really what we are interested in.   It says this about Free Transfer Ticket -   Why is there no Transfer button on my event in My Account? Could be one of these:   The venue doesn't offer Ticket Transfer yet (we're working on that) The artist or venue turned Ticket Transfer off for that event/section  So it's possible that you can't. Will you be able to return the ticket? That's what I'm wondering. Their policy says up to 7 days, but this event could be excluded.  I have an Amex Business Plat card, and they can protect returns up to a certain amount (not sure how much).  EDIT: Amex will only cover up to $300.   What is the current rate of warming?   I thought the "Big 4" was Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, and Murray.   Powerball odds are around 1 in 170 million. I would probably say there won't be more than 10 million people trying to get the ticket at exactly 3 pm (and that is probably a gross overestimation). There are 500 tickets. So odds are 500 in 10,000,000, or 5 in 100,000, or really, 1 in 20,000.   1 in 20,000 is significantly better than 1 in 170,000,000.   So your odds of getting one of these tickets is 8500 times greater than winning the Powerball.   Interesting so that leaves Ticketmaster out. I wonder if that is for all tickets, or for TicketMaster only?   those 8000 are probably all promised to people already. Someone else noted that maybe you can't resell. Is that true?   what are you quoting?   So tickets go on sale at 3pm ET. Three places to get them:  * Ticketmaster.com * Mgmgrand.com/mayweather * Calling 800-745-300 (only 9 digits?)  So I guess the questions would be:  * Way to have the best odds of getting a ticket (there are only 500) * Which ticket will have the *lowest* demand? * Which ticket will give you the best return (total return, not percentage)  Since there are only 500 tickets going on sale, it will be almost impossible to get them, even if you go to the website at exactly 3pm.   My theory - call 1 minute early to the phone number, and visit both websites at exactly 3. There is a chance those website won't be able to hand the load, and only those on the phone will get the tickets.  Is it even worth trying?  [Here](http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/boxing/deal-reached--so-tickets-for-mayweather-pacquiao-bout-on-sale-today-190839016.html) is the link describing info.     Coming soon to USA   You failed because you proposed a solution without even knowing what the data is.   Ok maybe, but def not what we have in mind - 1000 people walking around with headphones looking at art.    I should have specified - we want to *do* something - Art Institute is just walking around. I was thinking something sport or fun - not cultural.   It's a jpg for crying out loud.   I definately got a bit lucky. I got an internship for the team I currently work for, because I family friend of mine got me the interview (but not the job). After the summer they offered me a position for $75k. I'm not sure if my family friend had something to do with the salary, as it's corporate, and it's not like he can just throw money at me.  Anyway I have friends straight out of college who went to Seattle and got $100k, so $60-$70k sounds reasonable. Have you tried looking at Motorolla in the burbs? Boeing? CME? I don't know if the BA degree would hold you back after 5 years, but probably did when you first got a job.  As for helping you out, I only know of a position for a serious Oracle DB expert.    I work for a company with around 1000 people and we are looking for a venue for a summer party. We want a place where we can do something (not just hang around) outside - and somewhere we can go inside if the weather is bad.  Does such a place exist? We are located in the loop.   I am learning webdev on the side from my full time Java job - is photoshop really something you need to know? I am lost in the /s.   Ok I was thinking this was a redemption when buying tickets with miles - like the transferring to United and then buying a ticket with miles. I see that this is a bit different, and probably still not useful.      Had to zoom to 400% to read the article. That alone makes this a /r/shittyprogramming candidate   Just for some more data about Chicago - I am a bit overpaid, but I make $75k (in the city) out of college only 4 months ago (I am also older, not sure if that changes anything).  I know that Motorolla (suburbs) pays at around $60k for some interns. HERE pays $50k for interns.  Just some numbers to think about.   at least this is the most upvoted comment    it's about the prisons wringing every last drop of money out of these guys  Um last I checked we *lose* money for keeping men in jail...    Depends on the religion.  As a Muslim, there are  I stopped reading right there.   I had to add 'text-align: left' to the 'inner' class. The bullets were lined up, but the text was centered - so some of the text started next to the bullet, and some lines the text started far away (since there was little text to display, and it was centered).  I've just been googling everything I need to learn for CSS, but maybe some structured and detailed tutorials is what I need. Thanks for the help!  PS - didn't use codepen before - very helpful.  EDIT: my first codepen post- here is a demo of what change I had to make to your suggestion:  [my codepen](http://codepen.io/DanielGGordon/pen/QbLYzj)   Great answer! I tried the Flexbox version and it worked exactly how I wanted. Will try without Flexbox and report back.   Screw IE.   What is wrong with the design of the site? So hard to follow. I just wanted a simple top 10 list with names. Instead we go fancy yet annoyingly impossible to read graphs.    Elixir?   Holy cow flexbox is easy. Is flexbox not compatible with a lot of browsers? why not use it?   Jesus CSS is a pain in the ass. I'm learning it now. All I want to do is have a list of text (ul list), that is centered - but left aligned. So either I get bullets all the way on the left side of the screen, or bullets in the center, but completely scattered (they are not aligned vertically).  Cannot get this to work for the life of me.      I think I can guarantee the line number, or at least I can guarantee what the line will begin with (connection ... etc).  Yea I'm just wondering what too I can use. I have sed but not awk on Cmder. I have never used sec, but maybe that will work.    I like how OP specified that this is homework (not sarcasm).   Hi all!  I was wondering what is the best way to do the following (on Windows)  I have 4 .twb files (Tableau workbook - basically xml). Sometimes I will make changes to one workbook, and I want to copy the changes over the the other 3. The only difference between the workbooks is that they have different connection information. So really there is only a one line difference.      connection authentication = myAuth schema='mySchema'  and so on. This line is different in each file, but everything else is the same.  How would I go about propagating all the changes from the first xml file to all four files - taking into account that the one particular line should not change for each file?   Familiar with Java, so is there a simple library that can do this? Or maybe there is some script (scripting in windows?) I can write? I have Cmder, so maybe there is some utility for that I could use. Just need some direction.    Unfortunately I'd rather have the world be completely fucked climate wise in 100 years when I am dead than to have to live in a caliphate when I am old.  Both of those scenarios are hypothetical.   Would you say that is more of a stylistic thing, or there is a good reason for that? I agree with you that exceptions should be exceptions- but practically speaking I don't see why not use a try/catch for index out of bounds.   I'm calling bullshit on that one.   Because Europe is proving to have sustained a viable economic model? Greece? Spain? France? Even Denmark is showing signs that it's economic is not viable long-term. Not to mention comparisons to countries that are 1/60th of USA is not really a valid comparison.   And you should read up on Sweden. They aren't doing so hot.   Regardless of their attitude, the 1%, **on average**, pay a higher effective tax rate (even when you include state, payroll, medicare etc) than the poor, the middle, and even upper middle class.  	113
                                                                                     Let the battle begin.      "Michael Creel said Dykes kept to himself and listened to a lot of conservative talk radio."            A portait of a pathetic case.                  Yeah you will.                           Time for Democrats to call our senators and the cowardly hack Sen. Reid.         You got that right, dominosci.      If the amount paid is lowered by an "average" of $2500, that does not mean that every person's bill will be lowered by $2500. Do you know what an average is?    The article says that some will pay more, most will pay less. Those who pay more will be getting better coverage that will actually cover ailments or injuries they might get in the future. You can be a 20-something healthy male one day and get cancer or get hit by a car the next.       Is it an individual policy?   Read the article.                            Where have we heard that fraction before?                                 "Other states considering similar changes include Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which share a common dynamic with Virginia: They went for Obama in the past two elections but are controlled by Republicans at the state level."      Ok, thanks for the correction, I edited my post to make the change.         For those saying it would take a constitutional amendment to eliminate the electoral college -- there is another way.   States are allowed to decide how to apportion their electoral votes. To date, 9 states, representing 139 electoral votes, have passed laws giving all their electoral votes to the winner of the popular national popular vote.   This movement is called the National Popular Vote Movement, and it is worth working for: http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/                                                            "Obamas first presidential campaign, and his first inaugural address, were about moving America past our old arguments. His second presidential campaign, and his second inaugural address, were about winning those arguments."                           Updated: It's now 5 people accidentally shot at 3 gun shows.                        "In an age when our frontiers are digital, the criminal system threatens something intangible but incredibly valuable. It threatens youthful vigor, difference in outlook, the freedom to break some rules and not be condemned or ruined for the rest of your life. Swartz was a passionate eccentric who could have been one of the great innovators and creators of our future. Now we will never know."                     People who swear and get abusive in their posts are revealing the weakness of their arguments. Military-style assault weapons were developed for use in war, to kill people. They are inanimate objects that are used by people.  "Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal came out in favor of gun control restrictions in a Tuesday morning appearance on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."  "I spent a career carrying typically either a M16, and later a M4 carbine," he said. "And a M4 carbine fires a .223 caliber round, which is 5.56 millimeters, at about 3,000 feet per second. When it hits a human body, the effects are devastating. It's designed to do that. That's what our soldiers ought to carry."  Said McChrystal, "I personally don't think there's any need for that kind of weaponry on the streets and particularly around the schools in America. I believe that we've got to take a serious look -- I understand everybody's desire to have whatever they want -- but we have to protect our children and our police and we have to protect our population. And I think we have to take a very mature look at that."  So I imagine the general is wrong, according to you. And you know better.   If I cared about knowing the total number of deaths by drownings I would include all deaths by drownings. If you only want to look at murders, then find a report that only looks at murders -- that's not what this one does. But from a public safety standpoint, when talking about regulation, all deaths are more relevant than just murders -- including accidents and suicides.               I think we agree on these points.    Lack of heritability is not the same as confiscation. And historically guns have not been confiscated from owners in this country.    I have not been shooting but do have a family member who is a hunter.   In my opinion, the previous assault weapon ban was ineffective because NRA-backed members of Congress inserted a lot of loopholes.   I'm not an absolutist on an assault ban, though, and think we should get what we can on this issue, such as universal background checks and improved mental health reporting. I predict that the NRA will come out as strongly against universal background checks, though.  I agree on the gang violence -- I think universal background checks, and a trafficking provision, would help there. I live in the Chicago area, and recently read that a large percentage of Chicago gang guns are purchased from third parties who buy them in largish batches from our gun-lax neighbor, Indiana.     So you acknowledge that the government has the right to regulate what kinds of arms people can have, and what types of people should be allowed to have them. We agree.  Also, you realize that corporations and the 1% get a lot of government handouts by means of tax policy, right?    	136

 What exactly would have happened afterwards? How exactly would the history of Israel over the last seven years have been different?  Any thoughts on this?   What exactly would have happened afterwards? How exactly would the history of Israel over the last seven years have been different?  Any thoughts on this?    First of all. Welcome to the subreddit, Israeli friend. I would like to first acknowledge that I wish Pakistan recognizes Israel and establishes diplomatic ties, as this is probably the sanest thing to do, considering the Arabs have never spoken a word for Pakistan's Kashmir dispute.  Great to hear! :) Also, for the record, one can recognize Israel without supporting all of Israel's policies.  The BBC offers scenarios of possible solutions to the conflict: http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/south_asia/03/kashmir_future/html/default.stm  Yes, I saw that BBC page before. :)  I am of Kashmiri heritage.  OK.  The Kashmiris are a muslim majority nation, and are only in India because of Maharaja Hari Singh's (a hindu) decision to join India, with complete disregard to the views of the Muslim masses living in his state, who wanted to join Pakistan.  As far as I know, though, Hari Singh only chose to join India due to the fact that Pashtun forces from Pakistan had already invaded Kashmir by that point in time.  India's PM at the time, Nehru, promised the Kashmiris that their right of self-determination will be met, and "India is not fond of forced marriages". Unfortunately, that promise was not kept.  Well, if Pakistan would have been willing to withdraw all of its troops from Kashmir in the late 1940s and/or in the early 1950s, then maybe a U.N.-sponsored plebiscite would have occurred in Kashmir.  Let me assure you, most Kashmiris today either desire independence or to join Pakistan - and they do not want to join India. And they do not want the LoC to remain a border between their nation.  Well, at the very least, I will say that a majority of the people in the Kashmir Valley almost certainly prefer independence.  An internationally-monitored referendum should be held in Kashmir, with 3 choices: 1. Independence from both nations. 2. Join Pak. 3. Join India.  That would have been great, especially back in 1947 before the British left.  However, it might be both too late and a bad move to hold such a referendum in Kashmir right now:  http://www.rediff.com/news/report/eu/20070306.htm  India will never allow this because Kashmiris will most likely opt for independence or merger with Pakistan. Merger with India WILL NOT happen. I assure you. So I will discuss only 2 scenarios that are most likely to happen.  Well, there is also the matter that, as far as I know, any territorial changes to India require an amendment to the Indian Constitution.  Scenario 1: Independence. Kashmiris from Pakistan and India unite to form a nation. Their flag will be very similar to Pakistan, and their national language will be Urdu, just like Pakistan (most Kashmiris are Urdu speakers). They will form a state very similar to Pakistan and Afghanistan. Over the course of decades and centuries, eventually this landlocked nation will join very close ties with its more culturally-close and religiously native neighbour, Pakistan. They will be so interlinked, that I can predict that within a 100 years of Kashmiri independence there will be a merger with Pakistan or form a very very close relationship, a defensive or economic union.  Good luck getting India to agree to this, though.  Scenario 2: Pakistan merger. Personally, I want this to occur. But I would like Jammu to stay with India since they are majority Hindu and don't want to merge with Pakistan. If this scenario is to occur, it should be everything north of River Chenab to join Pakistan, and below to join India.  I don't think that the people in either the Kashmir Valley or Ladakh (which I think is Buddhist-majority) want to join Pakistan, though. Heck, the people in Ladakh might prefer Indian rule instead.  Also, for the record, my solution here isn't meant to be fair. Rather, it is meant to be realistic. If there is a way to restore the 1947 demographic situation in all of Kashmir, then maybe, just maybe a plebiscite should occur. However, I am unsure if this is possible to do; after all, how good was record-keeping in Kashmir back in 1947?   Two questions:  1. How many people in India and Pakistan are able to prove their ancestors' place of residence back in 1947?  2. Didn't Pakistan allow many people from other parts of the country to settle in Kashmir after 1947?    I know you meant this as a "realistic" solution, but I think your bias is showing.  Well, like it or not, but realities aren't always pleasant.  In every option you gave, it's either "have Pakistan recognise this", "have Pakistan recognise that",  Yes; correct!  not to mention the joke about India paying an "extremely tiny" bit of compensation to Pakistan for the Siachen glacier (that was a joke, right?).  No, it wasn't; rather, it was a serious proposal. After all, why exactly should India give Pakistan a lot of money in compensation for a glacier where no one lives?  Though you may have been sincere in that suggestion, there's no amount of money India could ever offer Pakistan to withdraw it's claim to disputed territory.  Even to a glacier where no one lives?  It's unrealistic to think Pakistan would accept such an offer anyway.  Then I don't think that you will be able to have peace with India.   The most realistic (and fair) way is like /u/GuyOnToilet said, to hold a referendum in Kashmir (with UN oversight) and allow the Kashmiris to decide their future,  Didn't Pakistan, unlike India, allow people from other parts of the country to settle in its part of Kashmir after 1947, though? If so, then such a referendum might be unfair to India.  (However, I will admit that such a referendum *should* have been held back in 1947, before the British left.)  whether India would respect the result of such a referendum is another issue entirely, they certainly didn't when it came to Junagadh.  Weren't the referendum results in Junagadh extremely strongly *in favor* of India, though?   For the record, I myself am certainly *not* a Pakistani. In fact, I don't think that Pakistan even recognizes my birth country (Israel). Thus, to accuse me of being biased in favor of Pakistan here would be ludicrous.   If they don't like it, and they can, you know, move (back) to Israel.   No, she isn't. :)   Huh?   In other words, a pharmacist.   Huh?   This woman needs a lot of jail time, a lot of mental health treatment, or both of these things. :(   I normally hate Assad's guts, but in this specific case, I will say this:  Way to go Assad! :) Keep it coming! :) Woot woot! :)   That would ideally be great, but the problem is that, as far as I know, not everyone who or whose family left Kashmir after 1947 would be able to prove that they previously lived in Kashmir.    It's sad these people will have children  This *can* certainly be dealt with, though. ;)   Donald Rumsfeld and Saddam Hussein in 1983--BFFs for sure:  https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/407/18716078246_f311826c94_b.jpg     Also, what about non-binary people? Or does Iran not recognize non-binary gender identities?   This might give Pakistan an unfair advantage, though. After all, as far as I know, Pakistan, unlike India, *did* change the demographics of its part of Kashmir after 1947-1948.   Sexist Persians. :(   Why *isn't* this funny?   Any thoughts on this?   Homo ... erectus. ;)   No, but they did a lot of other bullshit back then. :(   And yet we are supposed to be fighting for freedom and women's rights there. :(   Unfortunately some Muslim countries are still even more backwards than Hell is. :( What a shame and a tragedy. :(   Well, at least Russia respects the U.S. :) That's certainly a good start. :)   To the Jewish Ice Cream Taste Question. ;)   Nazi ice cream! ;) Run for your lives! ;)   Yep. :)   Any thoughts on this?   I am sorry, but can you please rephrase what you said here?               Any thoughts on this?   Yes, some of them do.   Well, if necessary, Israel and/or someone else can use force in order to achieve this goal.   Also, though, for the record, there *is* another solution which India can try doing in regards to this, but it can get *extremely* nasty:  1. Have India propose my solution for Kashmir to Pakistan. 2. When Pakistan refuses, have India eliminate Kashmir's autonomy and encourage large-scale immigration of Hindus to Kashmir, especially to the Kashmir Valley. 3. If Pakistan responds to this by increasing its support of terrorism, then have India begin supporting terrorist groups inside of Pakistan (such as the Pakistani Taliban and Baluch separatists). 4. When Pakistan will complain about India changing the demographics of Kashmir, point out that Pakistan's friend and ally China is doing the same thing in Xinjiang and that Pakistan always appears to have been quiet about this. 5. Offer to restore Kashmir's autonomy if Pakistan agrees to recognize both the Line of Control and the Line of Actual Control (on the Siachen Glacier) as the permanent international border between India and Pakistan.  There--how exactly is that (other than *extremely* nasty, obviously)?    The nations that would be acceptable to both- Scandinavian countries, etc.- are not nations that have traditionally looked to be international peacebrokers at all, let alone in South Asia. The only exception is France, and even then the French limit their international role to their former colonies (primarily West Africa).  Then bribe the French to agree to do this.   I'm not sure it would, as those factions (e.g., military) looking for total control of Kashmir would see such an action as strengthening the case for the LoC to become the border, thus weakening their stance.  It might be hard for them to effectively make this argument considering that Pakistan has already agreed to the Simla Agreement more than 40 years ago, though. After all, the Simla Agreement states that neither India nor Pakistan will use force to solve the Kashmir dispute and that neither India nor Pakistan will go beyond the Line of Control.   Oh okay, I'd though you meant to use them as an example- African forces (it seems to be mostly Ethiopia and Rwanda) that act as Peacekeepers may work on the small scale in Africa (which is where they tend to be deployed), but a mission to Kashmir would be far, far more internationally high-profile, would demand far more manpower, and would be fundamentally different from their standard role, which is prevention of civil wars in Africa.   I'm not sure African nations would commit to troops in Kashmir- quasi-state-sponsored, seasoned partisans are not the same as African warlord guerrillas.  What about if African nations are bribed enough (as in, given enough money) to agree to this, though? Would that work for this?   I agree, but unfortunately that's not something achievable with diplomacy.  Agreed, unfortunately. :(    Well, there *is* another solution which India can try doing in regards to this, but it can get *extremely* nasty:  1. Have India propose my solution for Kashmir to Pakistan. 2. When Pakistan refuses, have India eliminate Kashmir's autonomy and encourage large-scale immigration of Hindus to Kashmir, especially to the Kashmir Valley. 3. If Pakistan responds to this by increasing its support of terrorism, then have India begin supporting terrorist groups inside of Pakistan (such as the Pakistani Taliban and Baluch separatists). 4. When Pakistan will complain about India changing the demographics of Kashmir, point out that Pakistan's friend and ally China is doing the same thing in Xinjiang and that Pakistan always appears to have been quiet about this. 5. Offer to restore Kashmir's autonomy if Pakistan agrees to recognize both the Line of Control and the Line of Actual Control (on the Siachen Glacier) as the permanent international border between India and Pakistan.  There--how exactly is that (other than *extremely* nasty, obviously)?   Would this necessarily be a bad thing in the long(er)-run, though?   Maybe, but if the U.S. and/or someone else will succeed in removing *all* of Pakistan's nuclear weapons in time, then this civil war might not be that catastrophic and might actually (and ironically) result in some good in the long(er)-run.   Yes, this appears to be accurate. Of course, with my proposal, UN peacekeepers would need to be the ones who will be manning the borders.  Also, though, I would like to point out that if one can resolve the Kashmir dispute in a mutually agreeable way *without* holding a plebiscite there, then one can get rid of the plebiscite part of my solution to the Kashmir dispute. The purpose of the plebiscite in my solution to this was to give civilian Pakistani politicians a way to save face so that they could not be accused of making peace with India at the expense of the Kashmiri people.    Part of their traditional neutrality is that they definitely don't do this kind of thing- they keep to themselves.  In that case, though, what about Sweden or France? Also, Norway or Iceland might work for this as well, as might Austria. Any thoughts on this? After all, there must be *some* country which would be willing to do this and which would be acceptable to both India and Pakistan.  No problem! The issue then is that the original Step 3 (greater interaction/trade) wouldn't be possible as a means of getting a border resolution, as Step 3 would itself need a border resolution to happen.  Actually, I might know a compromise in regards to this: Pakistan might provisionally recognize the Line of Control as the permanent boundary between India and Pakistan (just like West Germany did with the Oder-Neisse Line in 1970) but reserve the right to withdraw this recognition afterwards. Meanwhile, a final Pakistani recognition of the Line of Control as the permanent boundary between India and Pakistan will only occur after a favorable result in the plebiscite which I mentioned (similarly, Germany gave final recognition to the Oder-Neisse Line in either 1990 or in 1991).  There--would that work for this?  Arbitration already works poorly enough in Africa, which can't harm western militaries without guerilla tactics. Pakistan has nukes and India is a rising superpower- this is a whole different ballgame.  Actually, I was talking about using African troops for a U.N. peacekeeping mission to Kashmir. I just want to clarify this part in order to make sure that you understood my point here correctly.  The issue is that the military faction wouldn't let the plebiscite happen at all precisely because of this.  Then have the Pakistanis launch a revolution or something against the military faction in Pakistan. After all, without this, there can probably never be a mutually acceptable peace between India and Pakistan.   Yeah--please say whatever you want to say in regards to this.   I recently thought about what exactly my ideal solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be (this is a conflict which is of large personal interest to me due to the fact that I myself was born in Israel and still have Israeli citizenship right now).  Anyway:  -All Israeli settlements in the West Bank which are located near the border with Israel will be placed under Israeli sovereignty.  -All of the Jewish neighborhoods of East Jerusalem will remain under Israeli sovereignty.  -The Arab neighborhoods of East Jerusalem will have completely free and fair sovereignty referendums/plebiscites held there, with the final border in Jerusalem being drawn as closely as possible according to the results of these referendums/plebiscites.  -The Old City of Jerusalem would either be divided or become an international zone, with freedom of worship for all.  -The Palestinian refugees would be unable to return to Israel proper but they would be able to settle in the new Palestinian state. However, it would also be nice if these Palestinian refugees would get the option of remaining in the Arab countries where some of them are currently living and to acquire citizenship and full, equal rights in these Arab countries.  -The Palestinian state would need to be fully demilitarized; it will be allowed to have a police force to maintain order, but not an army.  -*All* terrorist organizations should be *fully/completely* disarmed, with this being verified by neutral observers.  -It would be nice if the Palestinians (with the help of the international community) bought the northeastern part of the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt in order to expand the Gaza Strip and thus help deal with the overpopulation which is currently occurring in the Gaza Strip.  -Israeli settlers who will end up in the new Palestinian state should be allowed to remain there if they agree to fully respect all Palestinian laws and to become Palestinian citizens. They will be able to keep their Israeli citizenship if they want, though.  -The Palestinian state will receive territorial compensation of equal area and as much equal quality as possible for the areas of the West Bank which Israel will annex/keep.  -*All* incitement on both sides might stop and be made illegal.  Am I missing anything here?  Also, how exactly does this list look?   Yes, I do.    Well that's a good thought. But waiting for decades doesn't seems like the solution. About 15 years should be enough.  Yes, 15 or 20 years might be good enough for this. However, if the first plebiscite in regards to this fails, then there will need to be another plebiscite in regards to this at some future point in time.   And some patriotic Indians will all cry on this thread. They don't think about humanity but fulfill their own selfishness.  Why, though? After all, my solution here is *not* going to cause India to lose *any* of its territory.   Yes, Step #3 here is certainly crucial. However, all of the steps in my solution will need to be fulfilled in order for a permanent peace to be achieved between India and Pakistan. :)  Also, in regards to Russia, I don't think that its problems have as much to do with it still being in land-grabbing mode as with the fact that there is still a lot of corruption and a lot of dependence on natural resources for Russia's economy growth and prosperity.    Pakistan is a 'US ally'- there's no way the State Dept. would ever put itself in the position to potentially internationally arbitrate that Pakistan supports terrorists.  Very good point; thus, what about Switzerland? Would Switzerland work for this?  Except that would involve basically a massive political change/revolution in Pakistan, if not an invasion (... as in 1945 Germany).  Agreed.  Somewhere between India and Pakistan there needs to be a point at which people cross the economic border and are subject to import laws. This means one of two things needs to happen:  1. India and Pakistan set up a customs border along the line of control... which would be a de facto international border, which is really what the whole crisis is about in the first place.  2. India and Pakistan both treat the whole Kashmir region as outside their national borders, meaning people could move freely within Kashmir but would need to cross a border to enter India or Pakistan.  Thanks for clarifying this part. In this case, your suggestion #1 would be the one which needs to be implemented.  They would probably help with the vote itself, but a vote of this magnitude would have a massive danger of violence and tampering attached. You'd need UN Peacekeeping troops, and I don't know what country would willingly supply them.  What about some African countries, though?  I don't think it would- a vote in favor of India would be a massive slap in the face to the nationalistic and military factions in Pakistan.  Yes, it might be a slap in the face to them, but it will allow moderate Pakistani civilian politicians to save face by arguing that Pakistan didn't make peace with India at the expense of the Kashmiri people.   Good luck with that, though. After all, Pakistan already has *a lot* of nuclear weapons.   Does a country need to withdraw all of its forces from a particular area for a plebiscite to take place, though? In other words, would the U.N. be able to keep peace, quiet, and order in Kashmir if *zero* Pakistani and Indian forces were placed there at the time of this plebiscite?  Also, for the record, this plebiscite is meant to allow Pakistan to save face in regards to recognizing both the Line of Control and the Line of Actual Control (on the Siachen Glacier) as the permanent international border between India and Pakistan.   Well, if my first step here is not going to be fulfilled, then I don't think that one can have a mutually agreeable solution to the Kashmir dispute.   OK--anyway, here is my solution to the Kashmir dispute. This solution is not meant to be the fairest, but rather the most realistic in regards to having it be accepted by both India and Pakistan:  Step 1: Have Pakistan withdraw all of its support for Kashmiri terrorists and insurgents.  Step 2: Have both India and Pakistan (somewhat) reduce their military presence in Kashmir.  Step 3: Allow greater interaction, trade, and cooperation between Indian-controlled Kashmir and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir.  Step 4: After at least a couple of decades, hold a plebiscite in both Indian-controlled Kashmir and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir which asks the residents there if they approve of making the current situation in Kashmir permanent as well as in making the Line of Control the permanent international border between India and Pakistan.  Step 5: If this plebiscite is approved by voters in both parts of Kashmir, then have Pakistan recognize the Line of Control as the permanent international border between India and Pakistan. If this plebiscite is rejected by at least one of the sides, then seek an alternative formula for Kashmir, very possibly along at least somewhat similar lines.  Step 6: Have Pakistan agree to make the Line of Actual Control on the Siachen Glacier the permanent international border between India and Pakistan. Since this will give India permanent sovereignty at least most of the Siachen Glacier, India will pay an [b]extremely[/b] tiny amount of compensation to Pakistan in order for Pakistan to save face in regards to this.  Step 7: Have India and Pakistan make love rather than war. ;)  There--how exactly is all of that?    It'd be great if this happened, but:  Pakistan will claim it already doesn't support them, so there would have to be some sort of third-party judgement by an agreed-upon arbitrator as to whether Pakistan supports terrorists or not (and what 'support' means). I don't think any country, or the UN, would put itself in that position.  How about the U.S., though?  Also, without an end to terrorism and to the Kashimiri insurgency, I don't see it being advantageous to India to open up Kashmir's borders. After all, this could allow more insurgents and terrorists to come to India, and India certainly doesn't want that.   Kashmir is pretty much all their respective militaries do, and I don't know much about India's but Pakistan's has massive political power- they thrive off border tensions, and I can't see why they'd agree to a lessening of force.  I would presume that the role of Pakistan's military in this scenario would need to be decreased (similar to how the German military's role significantly decreased after 1945).   How? Where is the customs border?  I am sorry, but can you please elaborate on this part?  Would each country be forced to treat their respective national 'borders' with the entire Kashmir contested region as international boundaries?  Yes, they would.  Also, how does this consider deliberate settlement to skew demographics for the future plebiscite?  How about only allowing those people who or whose ancestors lived in Kashmir in 1947 (or at some other year) to vote in this plebiscite? Would that work?   Again, a vote would need to be run by an agreed-upon international third party arbitrator.  How about having the U.N. monitor this vote, then?  In this case, I don't think it would happen, seeing as I don't think either country really cares what the residents' opinion on the matter is.  Yes, you might very well be correct on this, though Pakistan has frequently voiced support for the aspirations of the Kashmiris. Of course, voicing support for this is different from actually supporting the aspirations of the Kashimiris.  Anyway, though, this plebiscite will allow Pakistan to save face in regards to this.   OK--anyway, here is my solution to the Kashmir dispute. This solution is not meant to be the fairest, but rather the most realistic in regards to having it be accepted by both India and Pakistan:  Step 1: Have Pakistan withdraw all of its support for Kashmiri terrorists and insurgents.  Step 2: Have both India and Pakistan (somewhat) reduce their military presence in Kashmir.

Step 6: Have Pakistan agree to make the Line of Actual Control on the Siachen Glacier the permanent international border between India and Pakistan. Since this will give India permanent sovereignty at least most of the Siachen Glacier, India will pay an [b]extremely[/b] tiny amount of compensation to Pakistan in order for Pakistan to save face in regards to this.  Step 7: Have India and Pakistan make love rather than war. ;)  There--how exactly is all of that?   OK--anyway, here is my solution to the Kashmir dispute.

Step 7: Have India and Pakistan make love rather than war. ;)  There--how exactly is all of that?         Unfortunately, it is not completely original.   Any thoughts on this?   Yes, I know that I am hastily generalizing here, but my point here is still a valid one, especially when comparing science-minded people with, say, Young Earth Creationists.   Can I just buy something with these $10 instead, though?   I am sorry about your anxiety in regards to this. :( Ideally, transgender people shouldn't feel compelled to remain in the closet.  Also, thank you very much for this information about bottom surgery. I've got a question, though--can't a penis pump significantly help with getting erections and whatnot?  In addition, exactly how much does your testosterone replacement therapy cost? Also, did you experience any unpleasant consequences/side effects of taking testosterone, or has your experience with testosterone so far been fully pleasant?   Also, out of curiosity, exactly how much does your testosterone replacement therapy cost?   What exactly does a meta stand for, though?  Also, how exactly do you deal with any possible unpleasant consequences of testosterone replacement therapy (such as an increased cancer risk)? Serious question, for the record.  In addition, how exactly did your emotions and personality change before and after you began taking testosterone?   Transphobes are certainly vile scum, but I thought that money itself does not have any views. After all, the recipient of a monetary donation gets to decide what to do with this donation, correct?  Also, since the Girl Scouts are returning this money, should Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation likewise return all of the money that she and it received from misogynistic and homophobic countries? Serious question, for the record.  Any thoughts on this?   I suppose that the mentality in regards to doing this is "Better safe than sorry."   This question is certainly not meant to offend anyone; rather, I am simply very curious about this: If you are a trans-man and got rid of your gonads, got a penis, and/or are using testosterone replacement therapy, then what exactly is this experience like for you? Is dealing with things such as testosterone replacement therapy pretty easy? Are you pleased with the functioning of your penises (if you already have penises, that is)?  Any thoughts on any of this?    Jesus they take 5 cm!!  Yes--at least, that's what I heard.    Wow. If you don't mind sharing, why?  Because all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization appear to be capable of failure and because castration plus female hormones might end up being very useful for things such as feminizing my face as well as reducing my sex drive.  I can't imagine myself being in a situation where I would even consider those options unless my life was threatened  Well, you appear to be more tolerant of the risk of an unplanned pregnancy and its consequences than I am (assuming that you are a cis-man, of course). Plus, I am presuming that you, unlike myself, don't cross-dream, correct?   No; heck, if anything, vasectomy is actually pretty mild in comparison to what I intend to do (castration/orchiectomy).  Rather, I am simply curious to hear if there have been any known cases of what exactly I am talking about here.   If so, then I would please like to hear your story. :)   No problem! :)   Can't a judge state that one part of the U.S. Constitution overrides an earlier part of the U.S. Constitution, though?   Congratulations to the Kurds! :) Hopefully their success in regards to ISIS will continue! :)      Maybe you are correct on this; I am not completely sure.  However, I did previously see an article in what appears to be a legal journal which argues in favor of having a court ruling get rid of the natural-born U.S. citizen requirement for the U.S. Presidency:  http://repository.jmls.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1287 context=lawreview  Any thoughts on this article?   In such a case, I would be skeptical of their claims, but I would still like to hear them out.            You can't hear numbers. ;)   Not in French, you can't. ;)   Thank you very much for sharing all of this information. :)    At the time the constitution was written, the founders only had to look back a few years to King George I, whose lack of apparent interest in England and commitment to Hanover could serve as a reminder.  OK.  But I recall a more recent example of a head of state of Germany who expended a great deal of energy attempting, with success, to annex his natal country. Needless to say, it didn't end well.  It didn't end well, but this was a result of Hitler being a poor decision-maker--not the result of Hitler being a naturalized German citizen.    Not to my knowledge, but how many countries allow foreign-born people to run for President? Isn't that a fairly common restriction in many democracies?  Actually, I don't think that this is the case in most European democracies.  For example, Mexico requires not only that you be a natural-born citizen, but that at least one of your parents are as well. They also require that you not be an official of any church, nor be currently serving the in military.  I would suspect that any country that based their democracy off of the US model would have similar requirements.  Yes, but this doesn't appear to apply to the democracies in the "Old World."   I've got a question, though--can't this requirement be gotten rid of by a court ruling as well? As in, some activist judge finds something within the U.S. Constitution which he or she claims overrules the natural-born U.S. citizen requirement in the U.S. Constitution.  Any thoughts on this?   In other words, religious people can have an excuse for everything.  Any thoughts on this?   Also, for the record, the question of mine which you quoted here still has a lot of merit. *Have* there ever been any such cases (in any country)?    When the Constitution was written, it was pretty common to marry into the ruling family of another country and use that as leverage to take over. That was pretty much the standard operating procedure of European politics for hundreds of years.  Sure, but the U.S. wasn't a monarchy even back in the late 1700s.   The original intent of this clause was to prevent someone like King George (or a French/Austrian/Spanish king) from running for and winning the presidency of the newly founded American democracy, thus returning to European rule. Remember, a monarchy would have very, very deep pockets to fund an election in the colonies if they tried it (much greater than any competitor).  Yes, I think that you are correct in regards to this.  This wasn't outside the realm of possibility in 1783.  Agreed.  I don't believe the original intent was primarily xenophobic or discriminatory as we'd consider those terms today.  The original intent? Very possibly not, but nowadays this part of the U.S. Constitution is very much xenophobic and discriminatory.   While I think there is merit to discussing whether we still need such a protection today,  If so, then I am interested in hearing your thoughts on this. :)  I'd disagree with your assertion that it had little to no value in the past.  Did I ever outright say that, though? What I think I said was that it outlived whatever value it ever had in the past. In other words, I did not say whether or not it had any value in the past; rather, what I said is that regardless of the answer to this question, this requirement has no value today.   Yes, I think that you are correct in regards to this. :)   My view on this is is pretty simple:  The "natural-born U.S. citizen" requirement for the U.S. Presidency should be eliminated. It is xenophobic, discriminatory, treats naturalized U.S. citizens as second-class citizens, outlived whatever value it ever had, and creates a slippery slope.  In regards to the value of this requirement, let me ask one this--have there ever been any cases of naturalized citizens democratically coming to power in a particular country and then betraying their adopted country's interests in favor of their birth country's interests? Also, Adolf Hitler certainly does *not* qualify for this, considering that Hitler did not sacrifice Germany's interests in favor of Austria's interests; if anything, he got rid of the independence of his birth country (Austria) and allowed his adopted country (Germany) to annex his birth country.  As for the slippery slope part, I would like to point out that, as far as I know, a similar rationale which is used to deny naturalized U.S. citizens the U.S. Presidency was previously used to justify the forced internment of Japanese-Americans (a majority of whom I think were U.S. citizens) during World War II. Likewise, a similar paranoia existed in some Americans' minds when Roman Catholics Al Smith (in 1928) and JFK (in 1960) ran for the U.S. Presidency due to their fear that they would take orders from the Pope. This is what I meant in regards to the slippery slope part.  If a naturalized U.S. citizen who runs for the U.S. Presidency seems suspicious, then the American voters can simply not elect this candidate in the first place, just like they can avoid electing natural-born U.S. citizens who are running for the U.S. Presidency and who seem suspicious. However, in the name of equality, naturalized U.S. citizens should certainly be allowed to run for the U.S. Presidency just like naturalized citizens can already become the head of state and/or the head of government in many countries worldwide today. Plus, it is worth noting that many naturalized U.S. citizens could have been better U.S. Presidents than people such as George W. Bush actually were in real life. After all, naturalized U.S. citizens might appreciate the U.S. and U.S. citizenship more than natural-born U.S. citizens (some/many of whom might take it for granted) do.

In comparison to whom, exactly?         "She" meaning one's wife or one's wife's friend? I just want to clarify this part.   If so, though, then wouldn't that mean that he himself is (secretly) gay or bisexual?   Are you talking about this guy here? :  http://cdn-www.i-am-bored.com/media/thumbnails/carth.jpg   And if it isn't?         Before or after she cleans herself up, though?      Yep. ;)         http://rs2img.memecdn.com/isis-supports-gay-rights_o_4120639.jpg  Well, I can dream, can't I? ;)    That may have been a good clue.  And your statement here may have been the understatement of the year. ;)   What a shame! ;) After all, I already spent a lot of money on popcorn! ;)         Yes, I am aware of Israel's Law of Return. However, when I lived in Israel, I don't think that I was officially considered to be Jewish due to the religious definition of a Jew.   No, I don't think so.   Are you talking about this movie here? :  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_(film)  If so, then No.   Out of curiosity--what exactly do you mean by this?   This badass:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_von_Lettow-Vorbeck   Being Jewish according to Jewish law.   Any thoughts on this?      OK. Will do! :)   Yes; that was a typo on my part.  Should I create a new thread with the correct spelling, or what?   Can someone please fix my typo here? I obviously meant to write "Hungarian" instead of "Hugnarian" in my thread title here.      Thank you, Arnold! :) (not sarcasm)   What if German President Paul Von Hindenburg decided to retire in 1932 after Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck agrees to run in his place?  Would Lettow-Vorbeck have defeated Hitler in 1932? If so, then Hitler and the Nazis probably never come to power in Germany in the legal way considering that Lettow-Vorbeck very strongly hated Hitler's guts. However, since the Nazis cannot come to power in Germany legally in this scenario, do they attempt to launch a repeat of their 1923 coup attempt but on a much larger scale once the Nazis determine that their electoral support has probably already peaked? Also, do the German Communists attempt to launch their own coup in this scenario (with the support of the Soviet Union, of course)? Could Germany have descended into full-blown civil war (between the German government, the Nazis, and the Communists) in 1933 or 1934 in this scenario? If so, then how exactly does this German civil war turn out? Also, how does this German civil war affect the outcome of the 1935 Saar plebiscite?  Also, how exactly would Lettow-Vorbeck have handled the German economy as well as German foreign relations? Likewise, would Lettow-Vorbeck have ran for re-election in 1939? If so, then would he have won re-election in 1939?  In addition, how exactly would German history in the 1940s, 1950s, and beyond have developed in this scenario?  Any thoughts on any of this?

It's just foreplay.  Understood; thanks for clarifying this part.  I'm not even sure what that means lol. I'm me I guess hehe. I'm mtf trans and I'm just like ehh I'm done and I don't see it necessary to spend money on surgery I personally don't need.  What I meant was this--do you identify as female all of the time (as opposed to only a part of the time)? Serious question, for the record.   Nope, simply from a personally curious genderqueer person.    Umm it depends a lot on the mood I'm in, if I'm being actively aroused by someone, and if they are doing things that are particularly arousing. It's like asking herding cats a bit. So I can't really put a number on it, but I'll give a ROUND number of maybe like 30-45 minutes to get good and erect maybe?  That seems like a lot of time, though.  No I don't intend to. I like it where it is.  Understood; also, out of curiosity, do you yourself identify as a binary trans-woman?   Apologies for asking, but exactly how long do you concentrate before you can get an erection using your penis?  Also, out of pure curiosity, do you ever plan to get rid of your penis and to get a vagina in its place?   OK--this is a question which is of personal interest to me (Yes, I am completely, 100% serious in regards to this)--if a genderqueer person who is physically a eunuch (as in, this individual was born with a male body and then became a eunuch) takes female hormones for several years and then begins taking male hormones, then would he/she be able to get erections using his/her penis?  Any thoughts on this?         In your honest opinion, what exactly are the best all-you-can-eat buffets in Orange County, California?  The answer to this question is of personal interest to me considering that I myself live in SoCal and absolutely *love* food. :)      Any thoughts on this?   Any thoughts on this?            After all, I myself love to eat, but I am also *extremely* open to the idea of me taking female hormones in the future. (Also, Yes, I have a lot of desires and issues that I need to deal with, as you can tell by my Reddit posting history.) Thus, is there any way for me to take female hormones and to still have a large metabolism afterwards?  Any thoughts on this?           	152
 I'm sure this film won't be a rushed poorly planned mess at all   I'm not a Kristen Wiig hater, but she looks really lame in this. A female doppelganger version of a male character is such a tired unfunny cliche. I thought the trailer was pretty funny and made the movie look promising, but that part made me groan. I hope it's a small part.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nikQY7Q_lj4   I'm still not sold on Aaron Taylor Johnson. The rest of the cast is absolutely brilliant but I've never really liked Johnson.    I think that's supposed to be Las Vegas   We Australians really don't have any big international pop culture icons at all. But Mad Max was different. Mad Max was revolutionary, and has gone down in pop culture history. All current post apocalyptic fiction is based in some way on Mad Max.   Mad Max was our culture's biggest contribution to the larger pop culture universe. And to just ignore a huge part of the character and fiction is just so pointless and silly. Why take away such an important aspect of Mad Max to just make him a typical gravelly voiced American protagonist?   Mad Max was one of the biggest, if not the most important, pop culture icon we had, it's kind of offensive to try to mess that up.    He means he's keeping his old console as opposed to trading them in/selling them when he gets a PS4 or XBone   I know this probably will never happen, but as someone who never had a PS3 and who lives in an area with shitty internet where Gaikai probably won't ever be practical, and also being kinda OC about my games looking nice on my shelf, this would be a dream.            Don't ever stop posting stuff    But Steven Spielberg didn't direct Skyfa.... oohhhhh   Never even heard of Raiju or Scunner before. Do we have a name for the flying Kaiju? It didn't appear here.   Dismantled a speeding train killing Ras. Drove his tumbler head first into a garbage truck killing the driver. Tackled Harvey off a ledge, killing him. Fired his bat plane machine guns into the cabin of a truck, killing Talia and the driver. Plus he ordered a bunch of hardly armed cops to run into a barricade of heavily armed mercenaries while he was safe in his jet, as opposed to taking his jet straight to the bomb with the anti-blow up device he gave to elderly Gordon to take care of. He also exploded an entire cliff side castle, killing the fake Ras and who knows how many other ninjas.    Superman has the same no kill rule. Batman killed like ten people throughout the Nolan trilogy.   Whoa thanks. It really does sound like a fun concept. I really hope it lives up to the potential.   Hmmm. That seems kinda generic and disappointing.   I was never super keen on the idea of the hand to hand combat. The car battles and open world wasteland were what were appealing to me. Did the car battle seem over the top and fun and disregarding the laws of physics like Just Cause? Did it seem like you could have done lots of crazy stuff during the car battle, and that the player has lots of control over the shooting and harpooning, or was it fairly scripted?  I heard a dev say the map was as big as Just Cause 2 and filled with side missions and random encounters and stuff to do, so maybe there might still be some potential when the game is further along.  Super bummed about there not being any Australian accents though. I'm still really interested in the game but it seems a lot less impressive than I was hoping.   Chopper is up there too   I'm super interested in this game, and I'm surprised not more people on Reddit are as well. It sounds fantastic and fun, an open world post apocalyptic action game in the Mad Max universe from the creators of Just Cause. Apparently there's a demo people have seen, but I'm finding it really hard to find anything about it.  My most important question is are the characters Australian or not  We Australians don't have a lot of internationally known pop culture icons, so it'd be a shame if Max became another gravelly voiced American.  EDIT: Just noticed in the trailer that Max gets out of the right side of his car, not the left, that could be a good sign that this game is set in Australia, despite the American accent of the dude on the ground.   Once my old man saved up and bought a real nice car. It was a Holden Monaro, the nicest bloody car he had ever owned. In fact the only car he had ever owned that wasn't a banged up old ute. He had a DVD player put in the dash, and that night me and him sat in the carport in his Monaro and watched The Castle together. We couldn't have food or drink in the car but the seats were very comfy and reclined a fair bit. It was fantastic. I will always have fond memories of this movie because of that.   That is so awesome. Looks very Alex Ross-ish   Characters better be Australian   Really interested in seeing some stuff for Wolfenstein and the Evil Within   This new Joker designs reminds me of Lee Bermejo's Joker. I like it.   Well they made a point of saying all the cops that were chasing them were the corrupt cops on the villain's payroll. I dunno how they could have confirmed that information but that's how the movie justified it. Plus there was a lot of destruction but we didn't see any civillians getting crushed by the safe. Just a lobby and a bunch of parked cars.   I hope it looks a bit more polished by launch   Oh wow, I didn't realize how advanced the Eye was. I thought it was just a tracker thing for the lightpad in the controller. It's pretty much a Kinect. That's cool.   Textures look rough   Rabbit eared cop? How about a dog nosed cop?   Fast   Furious 7 will surely be ten times as ridiculously awesome   They said that online multiplayer requires PS+, but that all disc based games would not require online in any way.   No, online multiplayer requires Playstation Plus. It says it right there in this video. It was also on the big screen during the presentation.   The script was all Goyer. Nolan's name is just there for marketing.   The David Fincher one would be freakin perfect    I think he's way better than Nolan North   This poster has certainly peaked my interest for this film. Do we have a trailer?   I dunno, the first half of that trailer seemed way too cartoonish    Incest 9/11 rape black people   Apparently there's a smaller rural airport in the north east of the map, and also a military base, which may or may not have an airstrip for jets.    As a half English half Australian guy I am okay with this   For me the Wilhelm scream only works when it's in an appropriate movie, and it seems to just suit "adventure" movies. Indiana Jones, Star Wars, The Mummy, Star Trek, Jurassic Park, Pirates of the Caribbean, and old school western style movies. The Wilhelm scream would feel fine and at home in any of those kinds of movies. Hearing it in a horror movie or serious action movie is weird to me.    How much would figures like this cost?   I am confused by its arms    It was pretty much all plot set up and character introductions, and I was shocked that the monster was revealed so quickly with no real scary build up or anything, but what they're setting up seems cool and has lots of potential. Plus its only issue one, and it seemed like a really short issue one at that. Can't really judge it yet. Snyder is one of my favorite writers and I trust he has some crazy shit up his sleeve, so ill definitely be reading the whole thing.   I'm pretty sure we've seen that gun Michael is using before, but without the sight on it. I am so excited for customization.    I don't know if anyone has heard of the game BC, but I was so insanely hyped for it several years ago. It was an open world caveman and dinosaurs RPG, and it was my dream game. It looked brilliantly fun and over the top and stylized and everything my young dinosaur-obsessed mind wanted from a game. But then it never came out, and it broke my heart. I've never really gotten over it.  But now this game comes along. I don't want to get too excited because it's clearly not the same and I have to be realistic in my expectations, but my god am I ever pumped for this.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BC_(video_game) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POZEB-H_k_0 http://au.gamespot.com/bc/   Joaquin Phoenix, Benicio Del Toro, Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Jena Malone, Martin Short and Sean Penn  Now Josh Brolin.  What an amazing cast. I so badly need Hoffman to be the final cherry on top. There's even a character in the book he'd be perfect for.    That it won't eventually come out on next gen consoles. This game looks perfect to me, aside from the small graphical/technical issues that come with the game being a bit too ambitious for current gen. Things like rough textures, anti aliasing, frame rate drops and pop in are all something that we have to deal with in current gen open world games, and even though they don't ruin the game, it's a shame that it comes out so close to the release of a console that would fix those issues.  Plus I'm not sure how well they can plan to continue supporting the game with DLC and mutliplayer if everyone's off playing the new consoles.   I really doubt Rockstar would go that silly with it   Alright that sounds pretty cool    How would Batman survive traveling at Flash speeds?   Also the art in this series seems to be on a steady downward trajectory...    What? I know. And I said I didn't miss it.   That happens like 4 times in the first movie    As much as the whole underwater thing is really cool, I can't actually imagine going down there too often, and I'd rather have that extra space go to a more dense detailed city and extra content. I didn't miss going underwater at all in GTA IV.    I remembering loving this game and thinking it was the coolest thing back in the day.   I went back and replayed it a couple months ago.  It uh... wasn't great   Yusuf was by far my favourite character from GTA 4 and the episodes   Jekyll and Hide. It's okay. Has some really cool Two Face backstory, but tries way too hard to be dark and gritty and just ends up kinda silly, like this picture.  Jekyll and Hide also features that scene that's been posted around of Batman kicking someone in the head while they eat ice cream.   I'm hoping that's a hologram or vision of his father and not the real thing. Superman speaks with his father through computer holograms/visions/in the afterlife lots of times before as we have seen, so that'd be fine, but surely they wouldn't change the mythos to make him alive, and then spoil it in a trailer   I play original Xbox games on my 360 just as much as I play 360 games. Burnout 3, Destroy All Humans, Vice City, San Andreas, Psychonauts...   I think this is pretty spot on, but I feel like the land area at the top of the map will be a little bigger than it is here.   I don't know enough to decide if this is more accurate or not, but it seems that this one makes Los Santos seem a little bigger, so I like this one.   Most Wanted gameplay with Underground level customization will make me buy it   I knew the city wouldn't be HUGE, and that the map is mostly countryside and whatnot, but this is still smaller than I was expecting.    RDR and Max Payne had similar stuff    RDR had an indestructible horse and a 25% faster dead eye recharge as preorder incentives    Wait, did they just accidentally reveal some of the map   Your wife makes you sleep on the couch?  Hahaha    Aw man, I actually don't think I'd be able to handle a game where I could potentially get all my adorable baby badgers killed if I fuck up   Burnout 3! My favourite racing game of all time.  Burnout 2, Burnout Revenge and Burnout Paradise are also pretty great.   Wasn't the first poster for this film just a list of all the names of the pubs   I hope a lot of people switch over to the PS4. Not because I'm a fanboy or hate Microsoft or anything, it'll just be nice to have more friends to play the PlayStation with.   Whoa, we're starting to get some pretty major looking spoilers in these clips and trailers now   Wait... Robots?  I thought it was going to be more body snatcher alien type stuff. That's... strange.  I'm sure it'll still be great.   I get my posters from this site. Never had any problems    Do we know if Sony is doing a similar thing? I'm assuming their games will be also installing to the Hard Drive. Maybe the disc itself will act as the game ownership license? Like you still install the game, but you can't play it without simply having the disc in the machine, as opposed to an online pass or key code thing. That would certainly solve the problem and make it act basically the same as physical disc games do now.   Does anyone know how Sony is handling this stuff?

It's totally a cool idea I guess, but it's not really necessary and I hope they don't spend the entire second act trying to form/repair a relationship and overcome each other's inner demons or traumatic memories. That could get way too cheesy, even for a movie as intentionally cheesy as this.   I'm more excited for a JJ Abrams directed Star Trek 3 than a JJ Abrams directed Star Wars 7.  His new Star Trek films are solid fun entertainment. The Star Wars franchise has been a mess for too long for me to be interested in more films   They don't look anything alike         It's purposefully cheesy though, if that makes it any better    Fuck you Sam was a hero    Meh, I didn't really like show nearly as much    Wank means masturbate. A wanker would be the UK/Australian equivalent of a jerk-off    Are the action sequences long?  Do we get to see a lot of Kaiju destroying cities and people in the ground running action or is it all Kaiju fighting Jaegers?  How's Ron Perlman?  Is it funny?  How many action set pieces are there? I've heard the big finale takes place in Hong Kong, and that's what's mostly been shown in the trailers, and then the opening action scene takes place in San Francisco. Is this accurate? Are there any more? Is there a big fight in Sydney like in the poster?   I always thought Incinerate was so much cooler than Devils Kiss   As much as the whole underwater thing is really cool, I can't actually imagine going down there too often, and I'd rather have that extra space go to a more dense detailed city and extra content. I didn't miss going underwater at all in GTA IV.    I've heard that the actual city of Los Santos itself is not that much bigger than GTA IV, if at all, but with all the countryside, mountains, Blaine county, underwater areas and rural towns, it adds up to 5 times the size of RDR. 3.5 times not including underwater areas.   That seems strange, since Pacific Rim, another film about a war against giant Kaiju monsters, also being released by Legendary Pictures, also contains a scene in which San Fran is destroyed.   All I want is free roam and some sort of heist mode like in Kane and Lynch   The only thing I'm not keen on is the weird monster design   This is blowing my mind   Obviously Kavinsky has his own radio station, so we got our awesome techno electro stuff there.  A country station is confirmed, as is a classic rock station.  I think we can assume there'll be at least one hip hop station. Maybe a classics and a newer station.  And even thought R* hasn't mentioned it Lazlow will surely return for his talk show.  News shows will surely be back as they were in GTA 4.  Radio Gaga is in there, that might be on the classic rock station. But, hopefully, the classic rock station will be a bit more 'rock'ish and Radio Gaga will be appearing on a Vice City FM type station.  There were a lot of unreleased songs for a Metal station in Lost and Damned, so hopefully we'll get some of those here.  I know R* doesn't like to repeat songs (at least to my knowledge) but I hope Free Bird shows up again.    Yeah in the seconds leading up the the fence 'mystery' while the narrator is trying to sound all creepy you can clearly see the timestamp jumping around.   It'll end with him realizing he's fucked everything up and then going back in time to when he first met the girl and he won't use his time travel powers again, he'll just do things naturally and awkwardly and hope it all works out.  I know it.   Gay Tony added some really cool stuff to the radio. Primarily Vice City radio.   Yeah I didn't love that one    I don't know why you're being down voted. This is accurate. Plus at the end the entire League of Shadows is in Gotham, apparently infiltrating the police force and government, they all know Batman's identity, then at the end Batman kills Ducard and is like "Wellp, that should do it, problem solved!"  I love Batman Begins and Dark Knight, but they both have some significant holes.   Aw man I loved that movie. I better not ever watch it again. As I remember its basically Avatar anyway. Which I hated.   I thought that scene, the big 'game trail' scene with the motorbikes and jeeps, and the San Diego scene were pretty cool. The rest of the movie as a whole is just terrible.   It might be cool to hate on Loeb these days but he used to write some insanely good stories. Long Halloween is my favorite Batman book and its incredibly important and well received as one of the best Batman stories in the character's history.   Semi trailers appeared in the second trailer  http://media.gtanet.com/gallery/gta-5-trailer-two/trailer2_012.jpg   Meh. That felt like Burnout 3.5, and the fact that you could smash into traffic from behind and not take damage was silly and ruined the thread-the-needle fast reflexes strategy that made those games so fun.   Were these made by random people after reading all the recent interviews, or were these made by people who actually saw the game and saw exactly what it looked like?   Whoa    Wait I thought this guy was in space   This isn't Tim   Eric esque, this is just Australia  	109

I've recently acquired a decent suede leather jacket, and I'm wondering if anyone has any advice/experience in taking care and maintaining the jacket.                                                                                                                 	129
 You must go to the rage mode (beat 2 guys to death) and then hit him with melee. On my PSV it didn't crash.  	1
 for the movie of this era, all the actress close up shot was done with very soft light and diffuse filter. making the shot very different from the male actor shot that was in the same scene.   does anyone here know why this style have been abandon in later Hollywood movies?     most awesome scene in cinema history  Megashark eats plane  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUS91CkTN74   because comic books movie are hot, so it get made.  I am just shocked at the crappy CGI they get from 65 mil budget.    will he still be working on District 10?   if you are the police, would you come to the shit part of town at night when guns are firing everywhere?    must be because car burning have become too mainstream   anus bomb are known to be used before. in a attempt to assassinate a Saudi prince. but the bomb used was only enough to blow up the bomber and the assassination failed   Seth Rogen can advice on how to take it all in   would be funny if CNN actually give up Wolf.   that will be a exclusive CNN segment with massive rating.     The students are supposed to help transform Pyongyangs skyline with new, cutting-edge architectural designs, such as the Ryugyong hotel, a 1,000ft building completed in 2012.  that hotel was designed in the 80s, how is it cutting edge?   dont Frozen make more on merchandising this year?   the add in the estimated marketing cost   how is making 15 mil in the first weekend almost no money   they just release ballons that flop into NK, this is more of a publicity stunt for the camera  the movie surely have already enter the NK black market with USD stick and DVD smuggled from china.    it does have some good fight scene. it that is what you like.    for Pompeii they did get their money worth in the special effect, it looks quite good, if only it have a better script.   his version of Hercules is a financial success, he did carry that film   the one that tank is the Kellan Lutz version that have terrible effect with even more terrible acting   how the hell does I, Frankenstein cost so much money, all the effect in the movie looks cheap as hell   they do tweet beheading and mass execution photo   maybe buying petrol from the US at market price to give away at almost free price at the gas station is not a good idea?     execution is the punishment for watch SK tv series. so i would guess the same will be applied    so he plan to honeydick superman?   NK have thousand of trained hackers that have been attacking SK for years   why would it not be possible? NK have military unit specificly setup for cyber warfare. there are thousand of trained hackers in NK, south korea have face cyber attack from them for years.  also the NK can hire outside contractor to do the hack or even pay off insider. they got the money from cooking meth to pay those people.   when he suit up for the interview, that is Bruce Wayne right there.    that is what they mean by not getting theatrical release, movie go straight to video   that is because of the plane are first in canada to move to metric.   in south east asia where this missing plane operate. other than myanmar, everyone have been on metric for decades. why would the same problem happen?   if you know how to read mandarin, the comments there would let you know that many of the chinese people are tired of NK's shit. maybe NK also remind them of the dark days of culture revolution with the personality cult. NK is the country they may have become if not for the reform in the 70s.  many call KJU with derogatory name , or fatty kim the third   it is only legally available in US and later canada, though it is the hottest movie in china   http://movie.douban.com/  in china movie website the movie is currently the most discussed film, ahead of Gone Girl   dont the major theater chains have policy against showing moview that are on VOD sameday release?    The Neutrinos Have Mutated!   this line was deliver like a serious scientific fact    it does not, the small budget movie on limited release will never get the same level of publicity as this movie.  and theater hate same day release on VOD, i believe the big chain have policy to not release movie that are on sameday VOD release   you are forcing you body to lose fat when doing exercise, many people just cannot be bother with it while want to lose fat sitting on the sofa.  this is a absolute blockbuster drug if it work. looking the all those fake fat burning drug on the internet you know there is a massive market for it   it is a Indonesian plane that gone missing   it is highly unlikely anyone to go missing on a plane. people gone missing on land all the time.    so do you go on a car which is much more likely to have fatal accident?   not likely, it is in shallow sea and the plane dont have much fuel on it to go into indian ocean. they are going to find it soon   if flight are cancelled due to the monsoon and thunderstorm, traveling in the tropic would be a bitch, essentially fight grounded for months at time.  in south east asia there could be multiple thunderstorm every single day for weeks at a time.    planes use to crash much more often in Indonesia. the last few years have been good improvement to their safety record after a string of crash shake up the industry   they re-appeared when the wreckage is found   Rodman got totally honeydicked  Skylark represent useful idiot conned into believing all the good thing by a dictator which seen to be a real chill dude.   i dont think anyone there would not be so stupid to use their gov controlled internet connection to download it.  they will get it from black market copy of dvd or USB drive that come over from china.    but the end was the US agent have been manipulated by the NK honeypot into implementing the NK revolutionary plan, not the CIA plan.   i dont see how this is destroying their reputation when they have always been making threats that was never executed.    Sony did not even try very hard to DRM their online release.  likely they do it on purpose to let high quality copy swamp the internet   of course no mortal can compare to the immortal glorious leader that does not shit   they already called SK President a "crafty prostitute" in thrall to her "pimp" Barack Obama.      Nothing gets solved by force  a lot of things are solved by force, most of the border in the world today are settle by war, and many nation only exist because they won their war.    It'll cost a heck a lot less to solve the issue from the root by properly educating the next generation about religion, faith and the actual lack of scientific evidence about these beliefs.  how are you suppose to do that when ISIS is control of the area and if you open that school to educate the kids of that. the school will be blown up soon and the kids massacred    now that is the kind of upstanding organization kids can look up to   where did you get this impression, after the hays code ended anti heroes and villain are often the main character in hollywood movie.  taxi driver, godfather, scarface, unsual suspect, LA confidential, se7en, heat, there will be blood ...   in some countries, it is required by gov regulation that hero win in the end     foreign film can be much more out there with the tits and bloods.  a example is Cidade de Deus, if Hollywood do a remake of this, they would tone down the violence committed by kids in the movie   this are feature of movies from every country, some can be even more over the top than anything hollywood have done.     I have not watch the movie, will I be making a huge mistake if I do?   i afraid the south korea will win that game of star craft even when their internet go out, they are just that good   Ida is literally porn for photography enthusiast, before i watch it i have doubt about using black and white 4:3 aspect ratio to shoot a modern movie. just a few minutes into it i was amazed by the cinematography and how well it help to tell the story with few dialog.    maybe their fax is also under solid black fax attack   what make it more plausible is that the world in PR are very much changed by the kaiju war. they show changes that happen to technology, economy and society.   in Transformers, even after the robots have battled several time in the center of major cities over several years, only minor changes was seen to have happen to daily life of the human character.   Clint Eastwood in Unforgiven,  I've killed women and children. I've killed everything that walks or crawls at one time or another. And I'm here to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.   All right, I'm coming out. Any man I see out there, I'm gonna shoot him. Any sumbitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only gonna kill him, but I'm gonna kill his wife, all his friends, and burn his damn house down.   the entire final shooting scene is just the most badass shit ever   the CGI is much better in PR, there is a real sense of weight behind the robot and monster, you feel the robot running and throwing every punch.   and every robot and monster are much better designed than transformers. each have different looks and ability that allow you to know which is which instantly. a lot of the robot in transformers looks too much alike. which is very confusing when they fight, especially with the way Bay shot those fight scene.   wait, what????   it is a good bet  if they release the movie this week, it will make so much money with all the free publicity   did they do unnecessary arrests and summonses before this?   like that british movie from 2006 about the assination of bush?   because he cancelled the apocalypse   the best movie you will not get to watch  if this is a marketing move by SONY, the marketing guy need a raise   maybe the same guy that counted the 140% votes for Putin   when the screening start, the door closed and speaker start playing the rains of castamere ....   how about the movie that show the assassination of Bush that come out when he is still in office?    nothing weird, all these are factual documentary film that follow Liam Neeson ass kicking career after his wife die.    they will execute you if found with this imperialist pig dvd      there are korean that duplicate USB stick loaded with SK movie and tv show to smuggle into NK.  this is a big concern for NK since people see the huge different in material wealth of the outside world through this video,  punishment is death if you are caught  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/north-korean-officials-publicly-executed-for-watching-south-korean-soap-operas-9825170.html   NK already investigated itself, found that they have the most awesome human right record in the world, a true workers paradise on earth   how is this glorify him? now the entire world know he is a serial rapist that murdered his wife in addition to being a crazed fanatic.    That movie is ender's game   more mindfuck than seeing magneto, professor x, bane and Jimmy Fallon?   the ship will shutdown halfway through the journey and they all die   it fires bullet of peace that cure cancer when enter a human body   The dock scene  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncW0fQnyOJQ  The whiskey scene  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EZYBehUW5c8   This man is a scholar and a genius.  Colbert 2016    we need a TV series about a police dog that struggle with a cocaine addiction while fighting crime   this prove Android is the only way to go for such vital mission.   Glorious hacking for Glorious leader   does this count as method acting?   people still give attention to birth announcement on paper?   never trust someone that ask you to die for something if he is not the first person leading the charge.    and that people will always think he know nothing    there are sect that dont even accept blood transfussion, any kind of blood, homo or non-homo    interstellar is one of the highest rated movie this year on china version of IMDB  http://movie.douban.com/subject/1889243/?from=showing  currently rated at 9.2/10    He was charged with criminal damage, trespass and breach of bail  the guy is out on bail and he break into police station?   did people actually pay money to watch this match?   all hail glorious leader?   damn Chewbacca kiss Leia behind the back of Han, bros before hos, yo   or it make perfect sense   how can the dog live with the shame?   so he need to start taking drug again for his art?   movie are always being remake since the like the 1920s   people will always want to remake previous movie with the latest movie making technology of their era.    it is not about north korea, it is the jokes about north korea in the cultural context of the US will be difficult to understand.   comedy that are not purely slapstick does not do well outside of its home market, foreign market would not understand the cultural context of the joke.   homeopathic people that are offering BS for serious illness should be arrested. they are endangering the life of these people by giving them false hope and keeping them from getting real treatment.   this will be removing entire china mainland internet, pun is everywhere on chinese online forum and their version of twitter.  many people are using pun with different word to avoid harmonization by the internet police.   Tropic Thunder   so the gay cure group is just his way to meet single gay dude?   and those music on vinyl are not compressed?   Freak and Geeks reboot by Seth Rogen and James Franco   this kind of news come up time and again for the last few year, but how many of the people are just buying the record for hipster living room decoration VS actually listening to it?  I highly doubt vinyl is coming back in any meaningful way.   but she will shot you in the head over and over again once you show sign of weakness                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	196

I haven't got the patience to explain how ridiculous this question is.   Vanilla.   I stopped using facebook when I realized that I don't want to spend all day listening to everyone I know bitch and moan about stupid mundane crap while I'm doing my own thing on my free time. I listen to it enough when I'm socially obligated to do so in person.   I also have quite a lot of family members (and to a lesser extent friends) who have views on certain topics that are just appalling in my opinion. I don't want to constantly read their opinions on said topics. I can pretty easily put my foot down in person and say I'm not having a conversation about something.

Once you're actually orbiting the earth you're not accelerating anymore but instead you're free falling toward the earth at the same rate of speed that the earth is curving away from you. You experience g-force during acceleration, so you would not experience any g-force while orbiting.  Edit: Its also worth noting that the speed at which you need to go to escape earth's gravity depends on a number of things but in this situation mostly the angle at which you're moving. At the speed of light, something with mass could orbit the earth at nearly surface level, assuming nothing got in the way, such as a tree, or a car, a building or a human.

       No, but I am so glad that I just let go...I got three wonderful kids and thats all I need...my point is that divorcees nowadays don't sit around eating bonbons all day   nope...raised 3 kids for 20 years, and received child support until the youngest turned 8, and a whole whopping $3000 one time payment of alimony...I refused to fight about it in front of the kids and he got nasty so I just signed the papers...oh and since the divorce he has literally had NOTHING to do with the kids, not even a birthday card...and he earns roughly 100k a year, while I made $20,000...but I do know this, I am MUCH happier now    and Walker himself does not hold a college degree   Im no expert, but it sounds to me like you are watering too often...with my plants I water about once a week, being sure to let the top inch or so of soil dryout before I water again, and yes, remove all dead leaves, this will help the plant....when I water I water until it runs out of the bottom, making sure to let it drain well and not leave any water in the saucer, since many plants do not like their feet wet Hope this helps    Not really, as business doesn't get to write laws without the cooperation of government.  I think you meant to say Government doesn't get to write laws without the cooperation of Big Business.   I have personally worked with quite a lot of people who actually SHOULD have been on disability...bad knees...bad back...one lady who walked completely hunched over all of the time...mostly age related issues, but I had to bust my hump twice as hard when I worked with them, because even though they were trying, they just couldn't do it...I think SS needs to be expanded myself   My charter bill for the same services was about 185 a month, I called a couple of times to see if I could get it lowered, no dice, so I cancelled my cable completely,about 2 months ago which dropped my bill to 95 a month, they called me tonight and offered to give me back my cable for $103 for the next 12 months.  I took it because my bf loves sports and it's only another $8 a month.   nice!!    Republicans do not check facts....they have Bill oReilly do it for them    If this is really what's best for America, then I guess the children of those people who use drugs just deserve to suffer even more than they already do with parents as drug addicts huh?    You can easily make some really pretty plant hangers using clothesline and a ring...google it...it'll cost about $2 or so, and would be nice with a christmas cactus or poinsettia    The Fact alone that 4 BILLION DOLLARS was spent on the Mid-term elections should be a wake-up call to everyone.  Just think about what that money could have done to make our country a better place to live! Public funding only for campaigns really needs to happen.  Our representatives don't spend very much time working for us at all.  They are out fundraising most of the time.  I read somewhere recently that they usually are in Washington 2 days a week tops.   very cool   WOW! AWESOME pic!!   haha so cute!   very cute!   awww...what kind of dog is he?      cute one!  	21
 Now that is funny.  Those poor little fish, but we never really caught many, did we?  And no, but science was always what mattered.     There is a revolution going on in the materials/energy field that is taking place as a result of recent developments in computational methods.  Alan Asparu-Guzik's Clean Energy Project, which you mention, is incredibly interesting thanks to the power of distributed computing, but I should also mention materials genomics.  Kristin Persson and Gerbrand Ceder founded The Materials Project, which could revolutionize the search for materials. To quote the website directly: "Harnessing the power of supercomputing and state of the art electronic structure methods, the Materials Project provides open web-based access to computed information on known and predicted materials as well as powerful analysis tools to inspire and design novel materials."  https://www.materialsproject.org  This approach is really cool.      Hydrogen fuel, when pressurized, has the same energy density as liquid hydrocarbons.  H2 can be generated via solar-driven water splitting, and when H2 is burned (either directly, or via a fuel cell), it produces only H2O, which is carbon neutral.  Here are a few useful links:  The Sustainocene: era of personalized energy: Daniel Nocera at TEDxCaFoscariU https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u92O8LSkezY  Keep an eye on this younger upstart in the solar fuels field (Curtis Berlinguette): http://people.ucalgary.ca/~cberling/  And his company, Firewater Fuels: http://www.fwfuel.com  A detailed chemistry-focused review by Nocera is this one: Solar Energy Supply and Storage for the Legacy and Nonlegacy Worlds http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr100246c   Interesting question that depends upon geography and your local situation.  2/3 of the world is not linked to the grid (power grid), and thus the concept of 'personalized energy' is extremely compelling, in the sense that the way that cell phones have enabled leap-frogging of landlines in much of the world, personalized energy generation may be able to do the same thing.  Inexpensive energy generation that can power lights, store power throughout the day to run household items, etc, does not require ultrahigh efficiency solar cells.  A 5x6 m2 roof with moderate efficiency solar cells (10%) can power even an energy-hungry US/Canadian household on an annualized basis, so don't discount the importance of cheap, stationary energy generation that just sits there, generating power, even if it is not 'high efficiency'.  According to the UN, having a light source a night is a huge factor in keeping kids in school.   For grid people, the answer is convoluted by price comparisons with fossil fuel electricity generation.  I strongly believe that we should be using solar energy as it is the single biggest energy source available to humanity, which has the added bonus of being carbon neutral (!), but the way our economy is structured at present, we will use the cheapest form of power.  So, I strongly support the idea of solar farms in deserts, factory rooftops, new house construction (much cheaper to install during construction as opposed to an after-fit); reality, however, dictates, that these farms need to be economical and cost competitive, which is a challenge without charging for CO2 emissions (i.e., a price on carbon emissions, which is essential).   	4
 Todd I guessed it! I cried so hard when I actually heard it   I've always wanted to do a story, but I never end up actually doing it. I'll have to try that soon!    Yeah I feel like I'm never able to do exactly what I want. Most lucid dreams I have are random and unexpected   Hey Lucid Dreamers! My question for you is what is your favorite activity to do when Lucid? If you have not been Lucid what is the first thing on your to do list in a Lucid Dream? Flying is still my favorite!   I figured out every time I watch tv or listen to music before I go to bed really messes with my dream recall. It's best for me to just go to sleep in a quiet environment.   Looks like he's seen so much   a T.A.R.D.I.S   The WILD technique is where you go to bed wake up after 4-6 hours of sleep, stay awake for like 10 min to an hour (I think an hour is way too long) then get back in your bed, make sure your body is all relaxed. The trick to this is you want to trick your body into falling asleep and your brain remain active. Unfortunately during this technique you might run into sleep paralysis, but you just have to take that with a grain of salt. Once your body is asleep you will start seeing thing, shapes, colors, soon you'll start seeing faces then full on scenes. Don't focus too much on any of that because you will lose all you're trying to achieve. You may even hear some things.One big thing is that you cannot get too excited. You will ruin all of it. There are some good apps/ youtube videos on taking you through the process of relaxing your body and the steps after that. Sorry I wrote this pretty fast, if you have any questions or want other tips just let me know! Happy Lucid Dreaming!   Oh wow! That was FANTASTIC  	9
 They are pretty damned similar   No, actually, I was way more interested in trying to figure out what it was. And also, remembering what I saw. It was amazing.   April 2, 2007. I wrote the event down in my journal   I realized it did not prove an existence of god. For some reason that specific line of thinking made me realize there was no god, as I previously would have expected such an event to prove to me there was.    He did not pull me over or anything. He just basically almost hit me and then got off at the next available exit. His lights were on but his siren was off. I really wished he'd pulled me over and taken some kind of statement from me. It was so strange.   I considered the possibility that I might be going absolutely insane. But my brain is usually pretty spot on. I was alone, unfortunately. I actually wished that the cop had pulled me over. I wanted to talk with someone else I KNEW who had seen it.    Anything by SeeingUfosPa is great :)   I saw this "unknown" while living in Florida. I was coming home from college class at night around 9:30. I had to drive from Orlando to basically Tampa (yea, it was a long way). I was just driving and to my right I saw this red light and then I thought, huh, what is that? And i saw this thing that looked like a red blood cell, and it just came toward me, made a beeline. It was really strange. I am actually amazed I didn't crash the van.   Yet I do not think that aliens in any way mean "there is a god"   It looked like a red blood cell. That blinked on and off, but kept a constant blood red glow to it. The part that looked like a "membrane" or "plasma" caught a lot of the light and seemed to prevent any kind of illumination on things unless they were very close (tops of trees, for example).  I saw it and it came right up to the minivan I was driving. About 25-30 ft away and slightly above my windshield. I saw the center of it. It looked like it was blood red, but I saw the center and it was yellow and white in the very center, and it was washing, like from the left to right, like in spin cycle.  Then it just changed. The "membrane" around it faded away and the center stretched and it became what looked like a metallic remote controlled plane. Only flying backwards at 75mph and moving in a fig 8 pattern. It stayed there until (strangely enough) a police cruiser almost hit my minivan and came in between me and this thing and it veered off to the right and that is about when I lost sight of it.   In addition to going backwards, I was driving at 75 mph, and it was keeping a constant equidistance from me.   It was so close to me for one. So small. It looked like a red blood cell that would blink on and off, and then it shapeshifted into what looked like a plane. But even if it were a remote controlled plane, it would have to be going backwards, and the way it was moving was as if one was holding a baton in the center and moving it in a figure eight movement. It was pretty strange stuff. I have never seen anything like it, but I have seen videos on YT that really seem similar to what I have seen (including the shapeshifting). That makes me think, something is going on.   I understand, UFO is a very specific term. Would "unknown" be better? I saw an "unknown", I actually have no idea what the fuck I saw. :)   This. Is not relevant.   Because it made me realize a much much larger picture of life and how it works. I had always believed "God" had made beings on other planets (the universe is gigantic as all get out) but religiously I had been taught they could never come in contact with us. When I saw this I realized, we weren't the most advanced anything. I realized my insignificance and how amazing it is that I am even alive. And somehow all that just fit :)   3 for rawness   3 or maybe 2   I can't figure out what they're doing over england ....   What if one sees a supernatural event, can't prove it, but does not ever claim that event to be something from god, but something "unknown"??   those girls have bad parents   Sexually, I agree with this and am willing to bet this woman is a sub. :)   Having had my own personal experience, I would lean toward the tendency to believe them. :)  And you're right, they do have a lot to lose.   The government isn't doing a good job of keeping this a secret. The number of former government employees, colonels, astronauts, pilots, air traffic controllers, etc etc who are coming forward in larger and larger numbers are telling the story. If they are to be believed then we have a giant leak instead of a cover up.    I don't feel bad, but I am constantly horny...am right now...damn...   Hello r/UFOs  Crop Circles for 2011  http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/2011/2011.html#OF  You are welcome :)   nosebleed. same shit used to happen to me as a kid. all the freakin' time, too.   Mmm... Out-of-bounds sexual lust :)  My favorite   While I don't know for 100% certain, my personal guess is that animal mutilations are possibly being done by e.t. for some sort of purposes I could only guess at. There are striking similarities between what happened to the people and what is found at animal mutilation sights. I could be way off and wrong, but it's my opinion. :)   Honestly, I remember church being filled with lots of very rotund ladies and gentlemen. They definitely weren't so pretty. Some of them were pretty, but most girls between 15-30, look pretty good. Then a lot of them get fat. And on medication for the depression they suffer from being mormon... bleh   Ok. This is for all the people who are saying the cop did his job and it was a bad situation blah blah blah. He could have slit it's throat, quickly and nearly painlessly. No, he bludgeoned it to death. On top of that, there was physical damage to the guys SIDING. When the fuck did the cop have to smash the cat into the side of the house? I really think this cop didn't like cats and really, he didn't do his job. There are many ways to kill a cat, bludgeoning ANYTHING to death is just heartless and indeed, inhumane. Fuck this officer. If he can't hold it together to realize a better way of ending an injured animal's life, I wouldn't trust him to 'protect and serve' me, my family, friends, or even enemies.   Dylatov Pass Incident. So much high strangeness associated with the case .   ive seen that before, i was a kid but thought it was weird...   I like the way it's progressed or "evolved" or is evolving! :)  It's how, I think, it should happen that way.   The Moon moves farther and farther away from us every single year, it is small but negligible. Therefore your last point has no relevance.   This is her main page; http://www.youtube.com/user/seeingUFOsPA?blend=1 ob=4#p/u/0/uQTi7xwozFc   Volunteer for Mufon, that is such a good idea. I'd like to talk with others about their unique experiences, I know how scary it can be. Almost traumatic in that your view on life changes abruptly.   http://www.youtube.com/user/seeingUFOsPA?blend=1 ob=4   Om nom nom   Heh, that's pretty damned close to what I saw, yes. Additionally, I am saddened that many people have written her and said that she is just filming regular planes or she is using a form of trickery. Having seen this in real life, I can say I don't think what she is filming are real planes or is a fake craft.   Sake House is pretty good :) They are off Durant Rd   bcccl, this event absolutely changed my life. I know that sounds cliche. But it really did. I never looked at things quite the same way, I saw something that most people never even have conceived of. Just seeing this made me recognize how little we really know about, well, anything. We are still just learning what is out there and even what is here. Our Oceans are largely unexplored. We know so very very little, and yet what we do know seems so very vast. It's amazing. And I'll tell ya what, the part that I have cog dis about is really the FACT that I have no litmus test to really know if what I saw was indeed UFO, or of Earthly Origin, or, and I concede this is a possibility, I was hallucinating. I truly hope it is not the last.    A: Nope.  And I don't know why it showed me what it did.  I can go so far as to  speculate that it may have been biological. Yet, I keep thinking it may have been from a Tier 2 civilization where it probably would appear to be biological.  And I will have the diagrams up tonight or tomorrow :)   You have no idea how much I'd like the rest of humanity to witness what I did, albeit maybe not as close up, so that they could see too. Then they would know there is more going on than their 9-5 lives. And it is lonely... I saw something so rare so amazing and yet if I tell people their reaction is that as if you said you saw a unicorn...they don't believe you and think your a bit looney or a lot looney. :(   My dad's reaction shut me up about it and unfortunately I didn't contact MUFON til a few years after the event. Thankfully they took my story seriously and asked me (at extensive length) the full account, details and all. I am so happy I contacted them, being able to talk with someone, even an investigator, was almost therapeutic. I didn't feel as though I was being judged, which was important to me.  I have not been on TV for this event, and I don't believe anecdotal evidence is evidence. It's personal knowledge and until they perfect memory extraction, it remains as it is, a memory. Yes, I am familiar with the account of the vehicle that was hit by a UFO and they collected a powder of sorts. Very interesting stuff, but I have never spoken with that woman.  I wasn't that tired at the time of the event. I stated already it was about 9:30pm and I had been released a bit early from my college class. I had a 1 1/2 hour drive home and when I finally got home and ready for bed, it was actually pretty late. So, when I wrote about it I just watned to get a few things in there about it. Including the initial diagram. I have since gone back and written more in-depth about my account, including better diagrams.  Also, in the past two years I have learned about the kind of UFO I believe I saw. There is a lady on youtube, her handle is SeeingUFOsPa, and the lady has filmed innumerable hours of what I am pretty sure is what I saw. Unfortunately, she hasnt released any vids that would show these craft coming up as closely as they did with me, not even half as close as my encounter. As to your medication question, I was 100% sober. I have never suffered hallucinations and trust me, I still question whether what I saw was real or not. The mere fact I wrote it down when I did pushes me to believe that something happened.

The mere fact I wrote it down when I did pushes me to believe that something happened.   I might try to get some pictures up, I do have a stylus/tablet handy :)   I've already contacted MUFON and the leading investigator for Florida called me. She and I spoke at length about my sighting.  The whole orb itself was not that big, maybe a little wider than my minivan front window(I should say the "plasma membrane" was as wide, the red blinking center was smaller, just think of a giant red blood cell). When it changed, the wings were also the same length as the windshield.   My immediate reaction was to try really hard to remember what I was seeing because I knew I'd never see it again and I had to tell someone. So I paid attention. Seriously. I felt like I had to stay calm, and I just kept driving, part of me wonders if I didn't partly have shock.   I thought I had been dreaming. When I woke up and found that I had actually written it and actually had experienced this I felt like I must have hallucinated the entire event. I thought about it for weeks. I finally told my Dad, and he had some words for me. He told me to "lay off the crack", got up and left the patio. I just sat there, too stunned to cry, but feeling so incredibly hurt. I had seen something so rare and it was thrown back at me.  4 years later, I still feel like I have no answers. I still struggle to understand what I have seen. I contacted MUFON. The lady I spoke with was very interested in what I had to tell her. She sounded very eager to hear what I had seen.  I'd like to also say, I've seen things in the sky before, but only way up high. Nothing could have prepared me for this.   I always wondered that myself. However, I have no idea. It was just very strange.   I don't have a scanner, so I can't do that. Not that it would matter, I didn't go that in-depth with my story in my journal as I wrote it really late at night and thought I was dreaming. I just wrote some stuff and drew a diagram before I passed out.   It was about 20 feet from me. I got a really good look at it.   just shared :) feel free to have a look bcccl   I am going to do this kind of as an AMA-style, but with the questions to have focus on the experience. Having said as such, this is what happened.  It was April 02, 07, around 9:30p, I was on the 408W at about exit 12 or 11. I saw a red light reflecting off the buildings and thought it was funny because of how high up it was, and thought maybe it was some emergency lights. I saw between the two buildings a red, pulsating light that was enveloped in what looked to be a plasma shield. My best way of describing it would be a red blood cell, complete with plasma membrane. I had a funny thought about it, when it turned to it's right and came up very quickly upon me and my minivan which I was currently driving.  This thing proceeded to be about 20-30feet in front and slightly above the van. It was pulsating a deep red and when the little ball would light up the "plasma" would catch the light. I noticed it appeared like a washer inside, as it seemed a 'red light liquid' was washing around an inner 'yellow light liquid' with maybe some white in the very center, as it was very bright inside, liquidy washing around. (so strange)  As I am watching this I realize the "plasma" is.. de-materializing? The center red pulsating ball of light started to spin and stretch and it grew wings. Wings like a plane, in fact, it looked a lot like a drone plane!!(Complete with a silvery finish, and what looked like a cockpit, however there was no 'tail end' to speak of) But...I was driving at a constant speed of 75mph(I don't speed and I had cruise control on), and to make matters more interesting, it was facing me. On each wing tip there was a light, one yellow the other white, blinking on and off back and forth. At the underbelly was the SAME red ball of liquid light, still blinking. It seemed wobbly. The best way to describe it would be if you held a baton at the middle and made figure 8's with your wrist. It would be that motion.  I remember looking back at one point, to see if other cars were around me because I noticed the cars all in front of me had pretty well taken off. I had no luck behind me as well. Not moments later, after looking, a police cruiser with lights flashing but no siren, came up from my left and almost sideswiped my van, coming in between myself and the craft "drone plane look-alike".   The craft responded to this by veering off to the right and it "grew" for better of lack of a term, a spotlight, that I believe was behind the red light and as it had flown up to this brick building, it shined a light on a window on it. I tried to watch it as it flew away and I kinda wanted it to come back, but I lost sight of it. I lost sight of the police cruiser, too. I kinda really wanted him to pull me over, just so I could talk with someone else about what I'd just seen. Somewhere, that cop is out there, and s/he saw it too.  Ok, sorry for the wall of text, but I thought ya'll might want to hear it. It changed my fucking life.   Oh man, you have NO idea. I told my dad my sighting and he had a few choice words for me. It's very upsetting.   I don't doubt you saw what ya saw. I've shared a few similarly to you, and I'll tell you, it's good to know others saw some similar things.   No, my journal is this little diary that I had kept. I still have the it in my closet :)   read above reply :)   I think I might write it out as sort of an AMA on r/ufos. That way, I can tell my story to the right audience and will [undoubtedly] get much better direct questions. :) I didn't know anyone'd want to hear it.   Good thing he saw his far off, I had a nice close up and personal encounter. Left me questioning my own sanity, thought it was a dream, and wrote about it (with drawings of it) in my journal so if I woke up and it wasn't there I knew I was just dreaming. I still have this journal, with this information logged in there. Either I am still dreaming or I have to concede,  I really saw..something.   dude this just happened to me...hoorah :D   I don't know, I think I'd just say, "Please deliver to [name of park]. Please remember plates, napkins, and (if possible) wetnaps. Please announce that this food is for the Occupy Protesters, not to be given to police or media." If the product is not food that can prove more difficult, but this is NOT impossible. We CAN support those in this movement, and let them know We Are In Solidarity.   umm...we DON'T go home and show them that we are really serious? Fuck that meme, we will prove it wrong thru actions that will become a real meme instead of simply sitting on our asses and making a new "no, we will stay, we promise!" meme. Now get out there! And if you can't, there are plenty of ways to keep the protest real for you. Try having products sent out to the protesters, have pizza's delivered, send ponchos, send blankets, etc etc.      Hi Lady :) Did he know if you were a virgin or not before he started dating you? It sounds like the church is a big part of his life, and it is interesting that he didn't say anything about it beforehand. Anyways, do you drink? And if you do, is that also an issue for him?  I am really sorry that you have to go thru this btw. I know that's GOTTA suck. Good Luck, whatever you choose.   A severe lack of the beef.   It's a trap!   Hey Mattato, let's do it. I been looking for some good vigilant justice. haha  But seriously folks, these places need to be brought down and people need to be put in some incarceration. For real.   ^_^ welcome! I hope what you find here helps you!! If I were you I'd check out r/atheism. They are really nice there and give you an idea that not only are you NOT alone but a lot of people are disaffecting from their other religions because of facts.    I agree with most everything except that you kinda got on the people who make the pieces. Most people who are making their own piece should be 'smart' enough to ensure the safety of the wood. Otherwise, unless your in Cali...be careful ENTS   With all the evidence coming forward of the 'seeds of life' as it were being found in asteroids and possible water on Mars, the vastness and HUGENESS of the galaxy, not to mention the age of the freaking universe herself...  I'm just going with they point more and more toward that we cannot only be alone but that there is most likely to be civilizations that are far surpassing us in everything. Not to mention, there is some talk, wish I had the freaking source right now, that says some old life even on earth didn't use O2 the way we do. So... it's just really really likely that we could never have ever been 'alone'. As for ufo's...It's hard to provide strong evidence for what most likely doesn't want to be 'caught' and 'studied'. After all, if you went to a primitive village would you want them to do that to you? (just saying, we are primitive to their tech, hands down)   I don't know if it was doctrine, but I know that is something a lot of my YW leaders would point toward as 'proof' the church was true.   That's pretty hilarious. In fact it reminded me of this: I seem to remember as a young woman there was a big emphasis put on how a temple cannot be damaged by nature, only by man. This is because, once blessed, God protected it and those inside of it.  The Kirkland Temple in Ohio got hit by a tornado and so I asked about it. My teachers said it was because it was now 'owned by the reformed LDS that it was no longer under the same blessings'. Has anyone else heard this?   My cat steals my underwear and puts it in her 'cathouse'. We lovingly refer to it as her "treasure"   This picture is as fake as god. Nothing to see here, move along.   Ooooh them's fightin' words. get those guys. get em good. and get it where it hurts.   ;P Why thank you   I never stated that I was seeing any therapist... And it wouldn't matter. It's normal and healthy to want to feel out of control for orgasms and pain.  Maybe someone should put you in a maid outfit with a buttplug and make you clean their home in heels. They can videotape you and tell you how sexy you look while cleaning up. Then, when that is over, they take the buttplug out of you and fuck the shit out of you...cuz um, you sound like a bitter sub. I used to be that way, then I embraced myself  :)   Wow, I can't tell if you're trolling or are really of that mindset.  But, no, nothing 'happened' to me, my mental health is fine and it would almost sound like your jealous of my openness. Too bad for you!   No no, don't stop. Do go on =p   It's not as easy as it would initially sound. I kind of live off my beau, so now I have to get my own job, my own car and get my shit together, then I can leave. This isn't going to be a quick thing. But, I'll keep you informed should I attend a munch. Fun fun...   Hahah cute!! You should PM me if you really want to get to know me tho. Also add where you stay. Im in NC.   I dunno, the more I learn about it the more I doubt. I just don't think that if they were there,they there was any real "teaching" going on. Probably just abductions like we see today. And sightings, b/c back then there really were 0 satellites, planes, rockets, etc. So when you saw something in the sky it freaking mattered. Probably enough to make carvings in stone. :D   Maybe I should go, at least to one. I know that the munches around here you can't just "go" tho. You have to set up an appointment and meet with the people who run it and they decide if you can attend. I have a lot of anxiety about that and, really, any info they can give you should be right on the website about it. Makes me more nervous than calm to be truthful. But I do think it's a good idea to go. It's a great idea.   Barely got that one time out of him...it was tooth and nail too.   we taste like pork :) Mmm bacon   haha, i see you want to play into my subby nature by making me attend a munch! ^_^ I'm just nervous and shy irl... Not so much on the net, anonymity and whatnot.   I'm laughing really freaking hard. Where you stay?  also some hair pulling and ass spanking would be nice.   It's a little more difficult than all that. However, I have been kinda looking into munches in my area... I'm a little nervous tho.    Doin' great...how about yourself ^_^   I've actually been considering getting one... =P   No I realize in this case, it's not a me or him issue. It's a both of us. I need something entirely vastly different than what he is able to provide for me. There's nothing wrong with what I want. He wants someone to video game with hours on end with sex a strong afterthought. Me? I need to be told what to do and made to feel sexy while being made to be submissive. I could care less about hours of gaming, I'd rather be tied up and have my ass high in the air and spanked. It's two very different people trying to make one relationship work, and it's failing.   Get to know redditors better...that seems like a challenge I can commit to! I love this place!   O.O i need one of you here. now.   you are entirely welcome sir, and thank you :)   hahah   Sometimes, it'd be nice if he just told me what the issue is. Is he not into it? Is he not into me? He said he doesn't think it's mean or bad and doesn't see a single thing wrong with it, but he refuses to do it. And most of the time, he just listens to me tell him about how I feel and what I need and doesn't say a word. He just stares blankly. I feel ... shut out. So, yeah, I think stonewalling is on point.   thinking about that makes my toes curl :)  	98
 i know it's sad.     Agree.  Enters 8 non-major events and wins 5.  Competitive in Masters and British but still  gets no credit.  He will get number 15 but then it will be what about number 16.   Here is the link directly from PornHub http://public.tableausoftware.com/shared/HR9SZ66TW?:display_count=yes   I've had a back spasm. It's unbelievably painful.  You just fall to the ground and hope it ends soon.    Unfortunately I do not.     I have that same putter. Love it!   All heroes die after Trinity event. We all knew it but why do they need to promo the ending?   agreed.  He's exactly right.   Congratulations. I've done it a couple times  and I might as well have beaten Tiger Woods. I felt so proud.    Funny and accurate   Thanks!   She reminds me of Jem from the 1980s http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jem_(TV_series)   Apologize.  I actually looked to see if it was posted didn't see it. I will delete it. Thanks for heads up.    I apologize if I pushed the rules.  Just letting everyone know it released today and that unlike previous game it does have in-app purchases PopCap is calling "micro-transactions."  Thanks for letting me know.  Have a good rest of the day.  PS.  I love the game and so do my children.   It comes out today and it has numerous in app purchase opportunities unlike the original game.  I can editorialize about anything I choose whether you agree or not.     http://www.ign.com/wikis/plants-vs-zombies-2/Microtransactions   I found it entertaining    I read Justice League, Phantom Stranger, Justice League Dark and Pandora book.  Since the Trinity War started, the two main books are Justice League and Justice League Dark.     100% agree.   wins, two top 10 finishes in majors.  year isn't even over yet but Tiger's lost it.  Imbeciles.     Cartman's going to be pissed   Amen!     I had that book as a kid.  Bet my it's still at my parents house.     Thanks!   That's amazing to look at the amount money that golf generates today compared to 59 years ago.  Jack to only make that amount of money is insane.    You're welcome. They look tough!   That's damn funny   Chris Berman and golf don't mix.  actually, Chris Berman and anything don't mix   These are fantastic.  Thank you!     I'm a DC guy so don't know much other than the original movie.  Agree this Loki better than the original (sorry couldn't resist)   My 7 year old sons favorite movie.    i do as well.  Apparently, winning 5 tournaments thus far in 2013 is not enough.     agree with you   This was by far the best Flash Point series   Underwhelming but fitting is a perfect description.    Got 3 boys 7,9   12. They all play and love it. Best dad bonding on experience.   People who shouldn't play the game.    That's nasty   How'd you hit it?   My apologies   They're as bad if not worse than the NCAA   Takes a set of balls to do that   What a deal   And write bad movies. Who would have thought?   Agreed   The mask part 3   New 52   Scariest thing I've ever seen   i will take a lifetime supply please   funny   i want one.  i want one .  i want one   OR THE POST CAN PROVIDE THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE NOT OTHERWISE KNOWN THAT IGN WAS COUNTING DOWN THE TOP 25 WII GAMES OF 2010 THE OPPORTUNITY TO NOW FOLLOW THE COUNTDOWN.   sorry, I was under the assumption it was all 25 games.  my fault.     read slow and read carefully.  it's a wild ride that i am still not sure if I liked or disliked.     Sad so very sad   Go fuck yourself you lazy piece of shit.    I loved the whole run of ex machina.  social and political commentary is well done regardless of your political or social persuasion.   Tiger Woods would be proud!   beautiful!!!  Lucky Kids!   the official r/comicbooks is a good list to start but I would also recommend Judd Winick's "Barry Ween," Bill Willingham's "Fables," Green Lantern saga by Geoff Johns starting with "Green Lantern Re-Birth," Brian K. Vaughn's "Ex-Machina," Grant Morrison's "All Star Superman," Brad Metzler's "Identity Crisis."  I could do this all day so let me know if you need more suggestions. Y-the Last Man by Brian K Vaughn is a great comic book to begin with because it is captivating from page one.    fantastic find    The interview (or portions of it) have been all over various news outlets.  I am not making the assumption about Batman and Superman being together in a movie. I'm just providing a portion of the interview that everyone seems to be focusing on, "We talked about it."  Read the full interview.   I can't wait for this to be released.  It's been too long   agreed.  Winick's run at DC has been less than stellar but Barry Ween is his Starman.     awesome!   sorry, didn't see it but I guess more publicity for this brave little boy the better   Similar but yet different.    who doesn't like big boobs?   Locke   Key is a great suggestions.  Also Image Comics' Chew and Morning Glories are very good and relatively new so easy to jump in to.   I can tell you attended a top notch community college using the verbiage "Dude" and "I dunno". I guess English is not a prerequisite for obtaining a journalism "degree" at the University of Phoenix or other online school you may have attended in your esteemed collegiate career.   Shocking you would use your real name since I have read some of them.  The one maybe two two original articles that you have written during your esteemed journalistic career.  The rest I read on my blog three days prior to you posting them on Geeks of Doom.  I guess it takes a while to duplicate.   the official r/comicbooks is a good list to start but I would also recommend Judd Winick's "Barry Ween,"  Bill Willingham's "Fables," Green Lantern saga by Geoff Johns starting with "Green Lantern Re-Birth," Brian K.

Y-the Last Man by Brian K Vaughn is a great comic book to begin with because it is captivating from page one.    You just proved my point, "Dragon*Con states in it's official policy that if you attend the convention you will be photographed and wave any legal right to ban such photography."    How many other people took a picture of Tron girl?  How do you prove that was your photo?  I assume other dragon-con attendees had cameras and took pictures as well.  Perhaps, you were the only attendee allowed to carry a camera?  Maybe you were the official photographer of dragon-con?    By the way, hard hitting journalism Woodward:  http://geeksofdoom.com/author/techgonzo/.  looks like zero original content to me.  just posting other stories on Geeks of Doom.    Although, your hard-hitting, investigative stories featured in the Nashville Scene are surely Pulitzer worthy.    As Judge Smails in CADDYSHACK said, "Well, the world needs ditch diggers, too"   It's nice to have an objective moderator.  Who knows what would happen if a reddit moderator was subjective in it decisions?  I guess different rules apply for gfest than every other redditor in this specific genre.     Still haven't addresses the legalities of the photo?  You keep ignoring that aspect for some reason.  I guess it's subjective when it comes to journalistic legalities.  It's easy to be the tough guy from a blog but like any cyber-bully as soon as you get in over your head and demonstrate to the world your ignorance you run and hide.     First you proved my point.  We are not the same person because I do not know what post you speak of.    Still didn't address the legality issues.  They teach you that in journalism school?    Fortunately, Law school, 10 years working for the speaker of the House and President of the Senate and now a decade of professional lobbying taught me how to play by the legal rules.  Also, congrats on your journalism career.  Seems to be going well for you.  Everyone hopes to graduate from journalism school and have a sexy Tron photo as their claim to fame.  hard hitting shit   I do attempt to post original content with each post and I do not just post from gfest if you like at my profile.  I give my personal take on that image, story, etc.  I notice that 'tchd' has numerous posts in other reddits that are nothing more than picture without comment.  If i just upload an image (via imgur) like him and then post it (similar to 75 percent of the folks on reddit), am I abiding by the rules?  Will I not be singled out?  Will a thread be blocked that personally attacks me without merit or fact?  Seems to me 'tchd' is cyber-bullying for his own gain.     I apologize for my friend not giving you proper credit for your Power Girl photo.   By the way the photo has been all over the web without your name on it.   How do I even know you took the photo?  Are you the only one that took the photo of this woman in a Power Girl outfit?  Are there 35 photos of the same woman by different photographers? Do you have a signed contract or waiver of liability from this woman that specifically spells out the licensing of the photo?  Does this woman know that you profited off her photo?  Did she give you written permission to utilize her photo for any type of media?  These are the questions that should be asked, prior to claiming ownership of a photograph taken outside of a closed, credible shoot.    I feel sorry for you.  I've never seen someone so obsessed with something so trivial.  Unfortunately, It underscores your age and most likely professional capabilities.  Thus, why you are clamoring for attention over a photo of a woman in a Power Girl outfit. It's really quite sad.    Nightwingblows and I are not the same person.  I have been reading comic books for nearly 40 years and love every aspect of the comic culture.  I Don't believe (or nightwingblows) spam we just put up content we feel others will enjoy.   I am married with four children and have a career.  I do the blog for fun, nothing more. I apologize if anyone has been offended by the blog or it's content.  It's a hobby for an old man (compared to most folks on here) that very much enjoys comics and comic related material.    It's funny because as you get older and become a parent you try your best to teach your children how to develop into a human being that respects all people and not to single someone out and/or bully for personal gain. When I see a reddit post such as this it reminds me that this practice continues on past childhood.   Sources are at bottom of post.  with the exception of the girl post all the others bullets were confirmed by WB, Zach Snyder, Darren Aronofsky and/or David Goyer. Don't mean to span just put up content i feel others will enjoy.  I do the blog for fun, nothing more.     I've always planned on reading thus book kept putting it off good review.  Getting it tomorrow   Now you are all just being picky.  We've all brought home worse at one-time or another.   great list KBPrince0.  Thanks!  Looking forward to heading to these sites to read.   I have 52 issues of countdown that I will be happy to give away to some unsuspecting kids.  It will be the scariest thing they get all night.    well said   Eric Cartman would be proud   You mean Marvel's Whore?   These prints are wonderful and very creative.  I am definitely getting the Batman/Penguin for my office   it was everything i hoped for and more.  Time Travel episode was excellent, "looks like we are going to have to go around again."   I hope Apple TV is good this time around   I agree Bruce Wayne has, is and should always be Batman.  DC is just confusing the the fans with too many titles with too many different Bat-men   The complaint is that Dick Grayson is the Batman in the new JLA   I think it is amazing.  Love the rough sketch. powerful.   my new religious philosophy   From his lips to God's ears   sorry.  should have posted the deviantart link.  here it is - http://mikepmitchell.deviantart.com/art/Darkwing-Duck-175589621?q=sort%3Atime+gallery%3Amikepmitchell qo=0    still the greatest picture i have ever seen   if you read comics and are following the DCU right now then you should not be upset with the post.  DC released the image for a reason.  not a spoiler.     Craig McCracken created the Powerpuff girls not Genndy Tartakovsky Although they met in school and have been very good friends ever since.  Even collaborating on some projects.  McCraken also created Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends.  Tartakovsky created Dexter, Samurai Jack and the original star wars clone wars cartoon.   Seaside Florida is the best in my opinion   Hulk meets the mask   Depending on your age and sensitivity some of these may be offensive but all good places to wet your comic whistle: Bone, Rasl, Preacher, Y-The Last Man, 100 Bullets, Invincible, Walking Dead, Mouse Guard, Boys, Ex Machina, American Jesus, Wormwood, Fables, etc.   These aren't so much independents but are outside the typical comic book genre and most importantly are fantastic reads. Bone, Rasl, Preacher, Y-The Last Man, 100 Bullets, Invincible, Walking Dead, Mouse Guard, Boys, Ex Machina, American Jesus, Wormwood, Fables, etc.   Thanks for the review.  very well done.     Fantastic.    My library books are overdue and i need to pay off my fine   Blackest Night ran in three books.  Blackest Night was a stand alone book but also the story continued in Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corp.    My fingers are crossed that the Ryan Reynolds Costume will not look as bad as it did in the picture.     he's fantastic.  love his art.     no offense taken.  good to chat with you.  least we both love comics.     This is how you pull apart Legos http://enveeapparel.wordpress.com/tag/legos/    yes, i read the book.  I read any comic or graphic novel.  I like the premise of the book.  Millar hooked me with Superman Red Son and American Jesus.     I like the book.  Didn't know it was posted already.     Sorry, did see it on the board before my post. Apologize if I re-reddited    He's weird looking   I'd sprinkle some of my Fairy dust on her   Becareful.  His poop is really dark matter and it is real heavy    Story reads wonderfully.  Superboy needs to carve out his own identity.  He now seems regulated to a background character despite his re-birth.  I also love the Robin/Superboy team-ups.   this will help.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman_%28Earth-Two%29    I agree with you 100 percent about the content of this series, but the cover is nice   Fry Bitch!   poor bastard.  I have four kids too.     This is what I read when I log into reddit this morning, "Hopefully I'm not the only person here who finds that site's "breaking news" updates to be tedious and uninteresting, among other complaints."   It put me in a bad mood.  Hard to swallow when one hypocritical person (Inquiry FM) takes it upon themselves for no reason to start a negative reddit against a blog.   With that being said, If i offended you I apologize.     So it's OK for you to link people to your hour-long podcast, but it is not OK to link people to content on another page?  Seems reasonable.  Or maybe you are just jealous that Gfest blog gets thousands upon thousands of unique visitors a day and it looks like your podcast traffic consists of one unique visitor a day, which would be you.   I don't care one way or another about your thoughts on gfest but it seems hypocritical when you are promoting your shitty podcast (Inquiry FM.) to reddit.  FYI, the acoustics in your parents basement don't help the podcast.   Well hello Tobias Russell, how is the Bluth family today?   sad, sad, I had one of those...   i've wasted hours, days, weeks....   Definetly worth the read.  Jack Horner arc is fantastic and the new jack (jack frost - his son) has been very good as well. No jump the shark.  Hood art and good writing.    Freaking amazing.     I miss it.  BKV never disappoints.    Great post! Great list.  Huge Batman fan excited to read a few of these titles.   blow job   i want one!   Amen!   dead-on   She's nasty regardless   fantastic.  I couldn't even make a square   need a citizen petition to start a referendum to ensure big tit s are not a crime.  I will be happy do the casting for the TV ads.    Chick magnet   Despite what the jackass named crunchmuncher posted below, I like the posts and information.  Thank you.   Can't Freakin Wait!   These are fantastic   Did it pop out of her stomach?   awesome and true   I second the last post   I like spicy food   The graphics remind me of playing the old Atari 2600 but very creative and well done   I'd pay whatever took to kick him in the balls.    I LOVE THIS   Wonder the pulp tasted?   i am laughing but i feel bad about doing so   I hard you were good in Precious Miss Sidibe   well done   i'd hit jake before i was forced to hit that   Three Blind Mice, baby!   beautifully done.  old suit too.  way better than the new one.   i've caught the fever as well   I love this comic.  Damn funny.     wonderfully cleverl   Sweeet   Well written and well drawn.  Kudos for developing such a wonderful story   Agree, terrible pick for Wonder Woman despite what, Morgue, the overly obsessed Tori Black fan believes.     I didn't think you could make Wonder Woman less relevant but DC is working hard to do just that.   I heard Steve Jobs got married recently, but he lost is iPhone at a bar on the honeymoon    Love that book. My boys love it too.    I hope Robot Santa brings this to me for Christmas   I don't even watch soccer and that's damn funny   completely awesome   is that Biden?   Like playing paper mario   Timmy!   Christopher Reeves really is Superman  	172
 Selfie Sticks. Hate those things so much.   Circumcision is on that same line as vaccinating your child. It's your responsibility as a parent to make decisions for your child as they themselves are not able to. If you decide as a parent that the pros outweigh the cons, then get your child vaccinated, and vice versa. Any boys I have will probably be circumcised, and vaccinated, and put into a public school :)   There's nothing wrong with it. Its a parents choice, just like vaccinations. It's a parents responsibility to weigh pros and cons and make the decision based on what they believe is best for their child.  	3

Gj.   Over the past year I have been noting rainfall records broken worldwide. People describing these events use the words: torrential, apocalyptic, unusual, extraordinary. I remember an elderly Japanese lady describing one such event (in Japan last year) in this way "The water was coming down so hard I could barely breathe, I felt like I was breathing water."  As stated, I started noting a drastic increase in these events last year- out of past 40 years of serious weather watching.   [Here is the post I made on it 2013](http://www.reddit.com/r/StormComing/comments/1jzh7q/unheard_of_rains_861388_2013_a_few_samples/).

In my experience this is utterly unprecedented. One '500 year' rain event is striking enough in a year. The past 2 years we have had multiple 100 and 500 year rainfalls over just a matter of a month or two.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/lightning-storms-why-you-can-blame-a-kink-in-the-jet-stream-9613962.html  ----------------------  Note from Kolby:  The anomalous movement of the Jet Stream continues to reflect the findings of Jennifer Francis (Rutgers) and her associates.   In a nutshell: that warming in the Arctic is creating deeper meandering loops in the Jet Stream (Rossby Theory) and that this is *slowing* the Jet Stream, leading to 'stuck' highs and cut off lows. In other words, weather systems that would quickly pass or not be as intense are now intense and longer lasting. For example: two weeks of intense rain instead of an hour or a day. These deeper loops are also pulling in weather systems from deeper south or farther north.  Great little explanatory video: http://youtu.be/_nzwJg4Ebzo  In this case, it is superheated air being pulled up into the UK from Spain by a deep 'loop' in the Jet Stream.                                                                                                         http://rt.com/news/171172-japan-typhoon-okinawa-evacuate/  "There are fears about violent winds, high waves and tides and torrential rain that we have never experienced before," Satoshi Ebihara, the Japanese weather agency's chief forecaster, told journalists at a Monday news conference.               	198
 Smashed my rear windscreen by accident with a guitar amp, called my insurance, someone was at my house fitting a replacement 30 minutes later.

I like to think that it's because I'm becoming a better person every day (that is, moving ever closer to being the person I truly want to be).  Then I realise it's because I used to be a little twat.    This has scared me many a time. Lets say that at the time of the Big Bang, there was this 'point' that contained everything in the Universe. And one day it explode and expanded and here we are. BUT, where was this point? How did all that matter come about? Where did it come from?   What I mean is, what was there before? If there was nothing, then how did it become something? Where did all these atoms come from? Where is the beginning of the story?   That's the best way to explain my thoughts when I think about the creation of the Universe. I've just shit my pants.    Yeah, I second this. Looking between their eyes is easy to do, doesn't make you feel weird, and the other person will think you're looking straight at them.    That was incredible.   Stand backwards in a queue, so you're facing the rest of the line.   What happens?    Amber Attree   This is beautiful.   Is it a Frank Turner song? There's two that come to mind. Let me know and I'll find out for you.    But if EVERY job had the SAME pay, living costs would be low as everyone would have the same amount of money. I'm sure there's a clever way of explaining this but I hope you understand what I mean.

My friend and I have only recently discovered peanut butter, and we are going through a jar every two days. Our new favourite is Oreos and peanut butter. Also a good one is peanut butter, nutella and banana sandwiches: TOASTED.   Bonus points for being high.    My friend pulled down his jeans and boxers and farted in his girlfriend's face at her birthday party. She instantly gagged and threw her glass of wine in his face. We both collapsed with laughter, crying our eyes out and rolling around on the floor, hugging like little giggling babies.   Still to this day I'll think about it and laugh out loud. I always tell this story whenever people ask me why I just laughed for no reason.   Best memory ever. She was a bitch.    Thanks! Great explanation :)   Why does our brain die without oxygen? What is happening in the brain when oxygen is delivered there by the blood?    Good idea.

    Anarchists and libertarians really agree on 90% of stuff once we cut through the rhetoric.   A great read on that subject: [Dark Alliance](http://catalog.sevenstories.com/products/dark-alliance-the-cia-the-contras-and-the-cocaine-explosion-movie-tie-in-edition).   I consider myself left wing libertarian. I just find libertarians in the US unrealistic about how the government corpocracy that we currently have will simply go away. I get how government policies feed these entities and make them grow bloated. I get all that about government waste and red tape. I also get how tax policies screw small and mid sizes companies while favoring multinationals. But how do we change any of that without good regulatory policy? It seems like the one thing government should be doing. I mean get rid of the DEA, the ATF, and the Education Department, cut down the military, reign in Homeland Security, and totally re-do intelligence. But we need a strong SEC. Markets now expand to dangerous levels, the financial system is insanely unstable. Good regulation instead of Fannie and Freddie would have spared a lot of home buyers a great deal of pain.   That's just the thing. Listening to some of those teenagers speaking, they really seemed pretty aware of broader issues. They're obviously going about it the wrong way, but I do see this as a very political event.   Like I said, I was just basing my argument off of what I saw on TV last night. It seems things escalated in a crazy way.   Wondering what people's opinions are on this sub about transhumanism.   Speaking of "keeping bullshit savagery to themselves" I wish you would take your own advice.   Thanks.  The senior center getting burned is really fucking stupid. I admit I overstated my case!   That's really sad if true. I'm just saying what I saw on TV. I could be wrong.   Just my observation watching news footage yesterday, I saw people breaking into CVS, liquor stores, and payday lenders. I saw people throwing objects at cops. In other words, they were targeting the source of a lot of the hardship in their lives, failed health care and banking systems and failed criminal justice system. What I didn't see were any local -non-chain - businesses targeted. Or places where the community meets like churches and community centers. I didn't see any free clinics getting burned.  Don't get me wrong, people burning private citizens cars is just bullshit, and I don't condone the looting. But these kids aren't dumb monsters who are desperate to set fire to buildings and get high just because they're bored. Their anger is real.   Agreed. The Eugenics movement in the US in the first part of the 20th century was the model for what happened in Germany. However, a lot of those Americans became active supporters of Nazism. Also the experiments against Americans citizens have started to come out. People know a bit about MKULTRA but the scope of it is really starting to come out.    I get that's what libertarians believe, but I think that if government regulation of markets is removed then you basically have shifted the government to corporations and to the financial services sector. While I don't like big government and certainly am not claiming that our democracy is in good shape, I like the principle that people have a right to step and reign in excesses in the markets. I see the current shift to corporate oligarchy as being similar to corporate syndicalism. Granted, libertarians probably don't like how things are, but the absence of good policy will result in undemocratic corporate government.   Chem train? Sounds like an Ozzy song.   While some may have been "quasi prisoners", most were not. What the German scientists who were brought over under Paperclip did was to forge an alliance between the intelligence services and scientific research community. This might not have happened without them. And if you believe that most of these guys were innocent technocrats, look up [Hubertus Strughold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubertus_Strughold) the "Father of Space Medicine" with NASA who placed priosners in Dachau in air pressure chambers until their eyeballs exploded. Don't sanitize this stuff. Many of these men were evil.   I'm not confused, I just happen to believe that corporations are now the state.    Thanks, will give that a look. I tend not to see this as a left or right thing. I think it is an ideology that infected people across the spectrum. Mostly it seems to be driven by worship at the altar of technological efficiency. But I'll check it out.   Hear, hear. The man's a fucking hero. There are criticisms that can be made of Chomsky, but he's been on the battle lines forever. If people want to pick on a CIA plant posing as a left wing thinker, go look at Gloria Steinem.   Corporate syndicalism is the link to libertarianism in the US. In Europe, libertarians are usually considered left wing - aka anarchists - but they became right wing libertarians in the US largely because of their belief in the goodness of the corporate model. I think there are substantial differences between libertarians and fascists, but in terms of economic models, they're birds of a feather.   Metformin, another fine product from the folks who brought you LSD. Thanks Sandoz!   Fascism was a very influential ideology with those in power from the 1930s onwards. From  [the Business Plot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot) in 1933 onwards, you could argue that Fascism shaped America more than any other belief system. It has been the model our economy is based on - corporate syndicalism - and it has largely shaped our transition into a militarist society that fetishizes technological efficiency at the expense of human worth. Quite literally Nazi scientists and technicians flooded into the US after WW2 under [Operation Paperclip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Paperclip). The technological elite of the Nazis became the American technological elite. I think it is no exaggeration to say that we now live in their world.  Some good books on the subject: [Peter Levenda's Sinister Forces](http://www.amazon.com/Sinister-Forces-The-Nine-Political-Witchcraft/dp/0975290622)   [Jim Marrs The Rise of the Fourth Reich](http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Fourth-Reich-Societies-Threaten/dp/0061245593/ref=sr_1_2?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1430233232 sr=1-2 keywords=jim+marrs+books)  [Linda Hunt Secret Agenda](http://gen.lib.rus.ec/book/index.php?md5=09AEA9234668F28FF07EBC963FB4B066)  and an article: [Americas Unique Fascism](http://jimmarrs.com/news_events/news/america%E2%80%99s-unique-fascism/)    I am not advocating violence or the killing of cops, but after [the killing of two NYPD cops](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/12/20/man_shoots_and_kills_two_new_york_city_police_officers.html) by Ismaaiyl Brinsley, the NYPD bascially went on [strike](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-nypds-work-stoppage-is-surreal-20141231) with cops refusing to make arrests on minor infractions as a protest against the mayor. The crime rate during the police slowdown fell like over 60%. That includes for serious crimes like rape and murder. NYC had its all time record during that period for days without a murder.   Those regulatory bodies were and are a joke. The real regulatory teeth of the SEC were taken years ago and it ceased to be a regulatory agency after the repeal of Glass Steagall in 98. I'm all for small government, but that includes the unelected government of the oligarchs that we have today. And above all TPP is not about free trade. It is a massive sop to large corporations to the detriment of small and mid size employers. And worst of all is the undermining of sovereign law. If you're against big government, don't buy into the lie that this is about free trade, it's really not. This is about global government and the weakening of national democracies.   The NSA, Area 51, and Amazon.   Still working on this end. They're saying the Orioles are taking batting practice. Jesus.   I agree with all that. Funny though that the two places I've seen looted so far have been a CVS and a payday loans place. In other words, two of the sources of economic hardship for people. On the other hand, fucking up people's rides is just wrong.    Thanks.   I don't think they could possibly know for sure, but at the same time the resistance against the police lines has looked coordinated with groups throwing missiles then retreating to other positions. We'll see as the night goes on what the hell is going on. Pretty crazy, hope it doesn't get more violent.   Profit is a great thing when a product is involved. Should education be a product? There are other ways to think about it.    If anyone can find a livestream, please post a link below.   Great article. Very moving.         From the article: Public Citizen observes that the TPP would provide big banks with a backdoor means of watering down efforts to re-regulate Wall Street, after deregulation triggered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression:  The TPP would forbid countries from banning particularly risky financial products, such as the toxic derivatives that led to the $183 billion government bailout of AIG. It would prohibit policies to prevent banks from becoming too big to fail, and threaten the use of firewalls to prevent banks that keep our savings accounts from taking hedge-fund-style bets.  The TPP would also restrict capital controls, an essential policy tool to counter destabilizing flows of speculative money. . . . And the deal would prohibit taxes on Wall Street speculation, such as the proposed Robin Hood Tax that would generate billions of dollars worth of revenue for social, health, or environmental causes.   I'm guessing then that he means the neo-Cons like Cheney and Rumsfeld who were big players in the Ford administration. Post watergate, those people all came up with their poisonous ideology.   What does he mean by 30 years? That it goes back to the early 70s or that it will last 30 years until 2031?   Communism and anarchism are very different things. Which is it? Do you actually know the difference?   From the Unabomber Manifesto: Control of Human Behavior  143. Since the beginning of civilization, organized societies have had to put pressures on human beings for the sake of the functioning of the social organism. The kinds of pressures vary greatly from one society to another. Some of the pressures are physical (poor diet, excessive labor, environmental pollution), some are psychological (noise, crowding, forcing human behavior into the mold that society requires). In the past, human nature has been approximately constant, or at any rate has varied only within certain bounds. Consequently, societies have been able to push people only up to certain limits. When the limit of human endurance has been passed, things start going wrong: rebellion, or crime, or corruption, or evasion of work, or depression and other mental problems, or an elevated death rate, or a declining birth rate or something else, so that either the society breaks down, or its functioning becomes too inefficient and it is (quickly or gradually, through conquest, attrition or evolution) replaced by some more efficient form of society.[25]  144. Thus human nature has in the past put certain limits on the development of societies. People could be pushed only so far and no farther. But today this may be changing, because modern technology is developing ways of modifying human beings.  145. Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy, then gives them drugs to take away their unhappiness. Science fiction? It is already happening to some extent in our own society. It is well known that the rate of clinical depression has been greatly increasing in recent decades. We believe that this is due to disruption of the power process, as explained in paragraphs 59-76.)  146. Drugs that affect the mind are only one example of the methods of controlling human behavior that modern society is developing. Let us look at some of the other methods.  147. To start with, there are the techniques of surveillance. Hidden video cameras are now used in most stores and in many other places, computers are used to collect and process vast amounts of information about individuals. Information so obtained greatly increases the effectiveness of physical coercion (i.e., law enforcement).[26] Then there are the methods of propaganda, for which the mass communications media provide effective vehicles. Efficient techniques have been developed for winning elections, selling products, influencing public opinion. The entertainment industry serves as an important psychological tool of the system, possibly even when it is dishing out large amounts of sex and violence. Entertainment provides modern man with an essential means of escape. While absorbed in television, videos, etc., he can forget stress, anxiety, frustration, dissatisfaction. Many primitive peoples, when they don't have any work to do, are quite content to sit for hours at a time doing nothing at all, because they are at peace with themselves and their world. But most modern people must be constantly occupied or entertained, otherwise they get "bored," i.e., they get fidgety, uneasy, irritable.  148. Other techniques strike deeper that the foregoing. Education is no longer a simple affair of paddling a kid's behind when he doesn't know his lessons and patting him on the head when he does know them. It is becoming a scientific technique for controlling the child's development. Sylvan Learning Centers, for example, have had great success in motivating children to study, and psychological techniques are also used with more or less success in many conventional schools. "Parenting" techniques that are taught to parents are designed to make children accept the fundamental values of the system and behave in ways that the system finds desirable. "Mental health" programs, "intervention" techniques, psychotherapy and so forth are ostensibly designed to benefit individuals, but in practice they usually serve as methods for inducing individuals to think and behave as the system requires. (There is no contradiction here; an individual whose attitudes or behavior bring him into conflict with the system is up against a force that is too powerful for him to conquer or escape from, hence he is likely to suffer from stress, frustration, defeat. His path will be much easier if he thinks and behaves as the system requires. In that sense the system is acting for the benefit of the individual when it brainwashes him into conformity.) Child abuse in its gross and obvious forms is disapproved in most if not all cultures. Tormenting a child for a trivial reason or no reason at all is something that appalls almost everyone. But many psychologists interpret the concept of abuse much more broadly. Is spanking, when used as part of a rational and consistent system of discipline, a form of abuse? The question will ultimately be decided by whether or not spanking tends to produce behavior that makes a person fit in well with the existing system of society. In practice, the word "abuse" tends to be interpreted to include any method of child-rearing that produces behavior inconvenient for the system. Thus, when they go beyond the prevention of obvious, senseless cruelty, programs for preventing "child abuse" are directed toward the control of human behavior on behalf of the system.  149. Presumably, research will continue to increase the effectiveness of psychological techniques for controlling human behavior. But we think it is unlikely that psychological techniques alone will be sufficient to adjust human beings to the kind of society that technology is creating. Biological methods probably will have to be used. We have already mentioned the use of drugs in this connection. Neurology may provide other avenues for modifying the human mind, Genetic engineering of human beings is already beginning to occur in the form of "gene therapy," and there is no reason to assume that such methods will not eventually be used to modify those aspects of the body that affect mental functioning,    So many of the stories about police abuse follow a narrative of "the bad cop" deviating from all the good cops, but this case in South LA really shows how systemic the problem is when it comes to how the police view and deal with the public.      Don't know if this is connected, but I watched [this amazing 1950s era documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POWR2H89QVY) about the US military building a secret base in Greenland.   The problem is that from our perspective, the education system is completely broken, but as far as the system is concerned, everything is fine. Profits are rolling in, a demoralized, brainwashed workforce is being produced to supply multinational corporations with worker drones. There's no point in trying to fix a system like that. People have to think bigger than coming up with patches to fix fundamentally evil systems. The same could be said for the financial systems that rule over us. And healthcare etc...   So many of the stories about police abuse follow a narrative of "the bad cop" deviating from all the good cops, but this case in South LA really shows how systemic the problem is when it comes to how the police view and deal with the public.   [War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race by Edwin Black ](http://www.amazon.com/War-Against-Weak-Eugenics-Americas/dp/0914153293)     Great read.  Also this doc along similar lines: [War on the Weak](https://archive.org/details/WarOnTheWeak)   A lot of this stuff, especially loitering laws, was used to basically force black people into conditions of slavery again in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Basically anyone who couldn't prove that they were employed would be charged with vagrancy and arrested, then forced into involuntary labor through the prison system.  Nowadays there's more white people experiencing some of the bullshit that blacks and Latinos have had to put up with forever. Here's a great documentary on the subject if anyone is interested:  [Slavery by Another Name](http://www.pbs.org/tpt/slavery-by-another-name/watch/)   I'm finding no sign of sherril_elkaderi anywhere outside this picture. Not on twitter as of right now.   This is some seriously messed up shit. They're not even trying to hide that American democracy is dead, are they?   If by "crazy" you mean sociopath, then I agree wholeheartedly.   I'm left wing, but she makes me ill. I feel like voting for Rand Paul just to spite her supporters.      Before he got murdered? Not sure what he was working on. Apparently his friends called him Grandma because he used to drive so slow. Whatever he was working on, it pissed someone off.      Some people claim the Mahabarata describes a nuclear blast at Mohenjo Daro in Pakistan:  (http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/arqueologia/esp_mohenjo_daro_1.htm)   I sure hope they get their house back so they can go sit in it and just be batshit crazy there all day.   No, I meant that it was highly organized and involved very wealthy, powerful people.   [Jeffrey Epstein begs to differ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Epstein)   I don't know what the truth is about that case, but I definitely had misgivings about how the kids seemed to be pressured into giving testimony by the mother and stepfather in the original video. Even if all this stuff did happen to the kids, they were effectively experiencing another round of trauma by their angry parents who didn't seem to be putting the emotional health of the kids first and foremost.      I actually found her letter hilarious in its exasperation, but maybe you're right. Vice is weird.    I guess the question is: are these fuck ups? They do this with such regularity that it starts to look like an insane plan.               Don't blame the teacher for that. Blame the morons who run the school. They should be fired. And her lawsuit if successful provides a strong disincentive to school officials pulling this stunt again elsewhere.   Because the main thing is not to look weak. Even if it means we look batshit crazy, that's fine, just not weak.   Well put.    We've been using remote strikes to spread terror since at least the Tokyo firebombing in WW2.   We?   Now you people are just getting creepy.   Oh, well that's just a huge relief. I'll go back to bed.    I would hesitate to use the word "our". I'm not sure whose leaders they are, but they're probably not ours. Real democracy has been on its death bed for a while and this treaty is the death certificate.   Maybe it's because people weren't able to "think outside the box" like this crack team of early childhood terror experts.   This legislation will empower corporations giving them a global government that sidesteps any democratic controls. This is the NWO that the elites have always dreamed of and it scares the shit out of me.   This treaty is the legal framework for the global government run by corporations. This is the real NWO.   At some point America has to reach peak retardation. What were these bozos thinking? Of course they're going to get their asses sued to high heaven. Hope she makes a bundle.      I tend to agree, as far as choking them off from the source of their power. But where the money goes can show you what their intentions are. Half of tax money goes to military matters, that means the powers that be are still working to hide the fact from the masses that we are now a military state.   There's a long depressing story about why this vanished. The reporters who worked on this had their careers ended. Someone really went to work to discredit them in the late 90s. CNN and other MSM went from being places where good journalism could sometimes sneak through to brainless controlled mouthpieces around that time.   Interesting article. But as far as the general consensus regarding "changes in vector populations", can you explain the incredible coincidence that the major new North American vector emerged just across from Plum Island at Old Lyme? Especially when the work there involved the weaponization of ticks and other aerial delivery systems? Of course they didn't create some bacteria out of synthetic goo, they would have used an existing strain. Possibly the scientists were able to  manipulate the bacteria on a genetic level to make it more deadly. All conjecture, but they sure as hell were doing something in that lab.   But what became referred to as Lyme disease after 1975, while sharing characteristics of earlier tick borne bacterial infections was on another level. You hear about rashes and skin conditions in Europe that look like the Lyme rash, but as far as I know, they don't have anywhere near the severity especially with the arthritic like pain that happens now. And there's weird stuff with personality shifts that suggest neurological impairment. If this stuff existed before, I would honestly like to read about it. I just suspect this bacteria was somehow weaponized.   Lyme is a lot more than a "chronic skin rash".    There's a great book by Ralph McGehee called Deadly Deceits where he describes his success in doing real effective counterinsurgency in Thailand. When he tried to transfer some of his practices to Vietnam, no one was interested including Colby who basically made it known that the chaos the US created in Vietnam was by design. They had no intention of bringing order to the place, there were too many officers enjoying themselves and too many contractors making fortunes. Sound like any recent wars?   Counterinsurgency is a deeply flawed notion. It comes from the British repression of Malaysian communists after WW2, and the world's military forces hold it like Bible truth that what the British did there worked when in fact all that happened was brutal repression that increased the communist presence in rural areas. Vietnam's hearts and minds program was a major joke, they used to have warehouses full of color TVs and beer like the army couldn't think of anything better America could bring to an ancient culture like Vietnam. Having spoken with some military people about this, my impression is that officers really believe this garbage works but grunts know from experience that the countries we occupy become ungovernable mayhem. It all comes down to money in the end, right? Counterinsurgency equals LOTS of contracts.   I'll check it out, thanks.   No it hasn't. The first reported case was back in the 70s   Something about this attack makes me sad, thinking about the parents whose kids were in that village in Laos and they never got to bury them or hear the truth about how they died. I did research for a book set in the Vietnam War and was finding all these accounts of US soldiers joining the NVA and actually fighting with the North or the VC.   I think that's where I learned about it originally. If you look at a map, the disease vector for the spread of Lyme from the 70s onwards points like an arrow right at the Germ Lab which was a major Cold War Bio Chem research site. Essentially Lyme is a neurotoxin and anyone who gets it goes through hell.   How about Rosebud?      Apparently US embassy personnel during that era received hardship pay because so many workers and officials were developing illnesses including leukemia.     	92

Something to think about if you're into making your device your own.   15 years ago my school had no such question.  I wonder if they do today?  My first roommate asked me if I was gay, told him no.  Probably didn't know what to think when I ended up the President of the school's LGBTQ association "Gays and Friends".

Technically they can refuse warranty service on your phone once it's been rooted, let alone had the bootloader unlocked.   No idea...  https://www.reddit.com/r/LGG3/comments/2ittfe/lg_g3_unlock_is_finally_here_for_all_variants_of/cl5szx1   And yet, it happened.

The frickin laser will be gone in AOSP.   It is.  Folks who say otherwise have problems with reading comprehension.  The devs have been very clear.   Music has never been particularly important to me and now that I don't reallysten in the car anymore.  I am actually getting ready to pull my stereo and speakers out of my car altogether because it just means nothing to me.  I'd rather have the weight savings.   Frankly things like this make it too easy...folks should have some expertise to know what they're doing.  Someone in a different thread bricked their device using Flashify because they had no clue what they were doing.  Three adb commands is really not a big deal at all people.

Try a different LG driver pack - there are several on XDA.   There was no reason for a huge dev community when it only supported a single device on one of the US' smaller networks.  It'll pick up.   Use Tapatalk or the XDA app.   You should really learn how to use adb if you want to mod your device - it's very easy to screw things up, and then you'll just be here or on XDA asking for more help.   Dude, so you used a shortcut method and it didn't work?  Should've followed the directions.  That's why they're there...   It will not see a 64GB card or larger without using a tool to format as fat32 - not a bug; it's a limitation of TWRP.   It says right in the dev's video that it's a true unlock, not a workaround.  ROMs always have to be custom made for the device they're going on - that's nothing new.    "Auto focus"??

Started in physics as that was what interested me a great deal in HS.  First roommate was an EE and I took an intro class for fun, liked it, and that became my major.  I also did significant outside major work in law, business and psychology.  Took the GMATs but ended up getting an engineering job and that's what I've been doing since in varying capacities.  But I wouldn't say my major was strongly tied to the specific work I've done the past 11 years.  Maybe think about what you want to do for work and see what folks recommend?   I have a 64GB Pro card currently in my G3.  Compared to a class 4 32GB Sandisk I used in my truck just as music storage, it is lightning fast.  And the phone in speed tests could tell the difference.  As far as a tangible benefit though, not sure.  I was just thrilled to get it for only $70 back in July @ BB via an Amazon pricematch.

Personally I'm all for technological augmentation.  I definitely don't feel as strongly about it though as you seem to.   You're right, this is Reddit, and this conversation happened weeks ago.  So you don't know what all happened, as I said.  Armchair quarterbacking on Tuesday does no good.   You have absolutely no idea what you have stepped in by commenting on this thread.  The context button does not even remotely tell the tale.  Nice job jumping to conclusions though.  I had every reason to respond how I did, Mr. Thought Police.   They've been talking this over on Slick Deals,and there's a pretty strong consensus that full price orders are not eligible.   No, it's a case of to each their own.  I like the idea that the bezel isn't just a spot for the logo.  That's why I'd never look at an M8 for example.  The G3 is nowhere near that bad but in this case the Note 4 is even more space efficient.   I've done both.  If your want to have your computer setup to talk to your Android, use IO as you'll get drivers setup, etc. which could come in handy if you need to reflash stock.  If you just want root NOW, use Stump.  Stump seems to make the USB Debugging setting in Dev Options not stick on reboot so you have to edit build.prop to fix it though.   Spent some time playing with a Note 4 at Best Buy yesterday.  Very tempting.  Screen is amazing and the camera is faster than the G3.  Also Panorama mode works - I find the G3's to be very glitchy by comparison.  It's right about the same size as the i6+ but slightly wider and thicker, as well as half an ounce or so heavier.  Like I said, very tempting.  And the BB and Samsung preorder deals are pretty good as well.   Well that provides a location for the fingerprint scanner.  Also, the menu and back buttons being in the bezel give you more usable screen area.   You'd adversely effect the phone's signal performamce if you used a metal cover unless you could be sure it was fully anodized/painted such that there was no metal/metal contact.

That means when I was in  high school there's a one in four chance you weren't even born yet.   Don't disagree - have an LG G3 myself.  Be careful doing homework in class.  That got me in trouble back in the day (assuming you're talking college, you'd have been at best a kindergartner or first grader....man I now feel old lol).   Could ypu give me a usage scenario?  What would you need side by side?  I guess it's different for me as I can barely use devices in my job due to what I do for a living.  I see commercials of people using tablets and phones in their jobs and I wonder what that'd be like.   I can appreciate that.  I'm much in the same situation wrt people I consider friends.  I'm always available for a chat if you need to blow off some steam.  I'm sure many folks here feel the same.  I can't guarantee I'll be instantly available but fairly quickly.   I understand.  I heard similar comments when I was younger, but when I came out it was fine.  Yes, there was turbulence, but it was my fault.  I also was no longer loving at home, or even in the state.  Do you have a support system locally?  Friends, your fiance?   I can see this being useful on a tablet but on phones, not so sure of the utility.

New features that haven't been incorporated into the regular builds.  Could be better performance, different fonts, different rendering engine...Just depends on what they're working on.  On  the desktop there are three or four different versions depending on how bleeding edge you want to be.

The best thing you can do to ensure your car lasts a long time is learn how to drive it.

And those nannies, don't turn them off on the rainy/icy/snowy days.  Enough people have already and they always manage to find a guardrail, curb or lightpost.   Nothing like that on my phone...And I have a very dark background.  It does look like a distortion caused by pressure just like /u/chicagostreetwalker suggested.   Any Verizon LG G3 is unlocked (for use on other providers except for Sprint).  However, have you verified that the frequencies you need in Brazil are supplied by a US purchased phone?   Except that messing with the cats is illegal at the federal level and carries an enormous fine if they catch you.  So keep that in mind.  They don't tend to go after individual owners though - they go after the installers and the manufacturers.  But it's still a risk you should be aware of.  http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/7522  (a) Enumerated prohibitions The following acts and the causing thereof are prohibited...

As an example.   Well, given that warranties are time OR mileage, and the first twins were late 2012, and it's only 2014, and it's a three year / 36k mi warranty (in the US)...That's why I went with mileage.   Insurance didn't care whether I had a lease or financing.  They asked "Are you leasing or financing?"  I said yes.  Simple as that.  They only care from the perspective of to whom the policy pays out.  Also, I have no requirement to have my maintenance done at a dealer.  Pretty sure they can't legally force you to do that, even on a lease.  Now, Scion Service Boost gives you maintenance for 22,500 miles (basically, first three oil changes) - maybe that's where you're confused?  I'm in the US as well - things don't vary THAT much on a state by state basis.   They are slowish in acceleration.  6.6 to 60 in a manual.  They are not slow through turns.  Once you get going, if you know what you're doing, you can cut pretty good times compared to other vehicles.  Source - I have one...   Uh...there are tons of people with more than 36,000 mi on their Twins.   I'm on 8.1 64-bit; worked the first time.  I'd already set it up for back when I rooted it with ioroot in July though right when I got it the first weekend so that might've had something to do with it.  It was a major PITA to get the drivers setup the first time.   Firmware update is the screen you want.  A lot of the directions are unclear.  It'll say Download Mode in tiny font then go to the Firmware Update screen.  At that point you're ready to start LGFlashtool and pick DLL and TOT file.  I just did this yesterday.   I did.  Yesterday.  Thread on XDA.  http://forum.xda-developers.com/verizon-lg-g3/general/restore-verizon-to-stock-t2827878  Now yes it says for Verizon but with the right tot file it'll wprk just fine.  Working smoother now for sure.  I disabled all the disableable stuff, then rooted with Stump Root, THEN hooked it to my Google account.   Thanks!   The one I have just looks like a miniature ratcheting socket wrench - the bits fit into the end.  Similar to this:  http://www.harborfreight.com/8-piece-right-angle-screwdriver-92630.html   Hey do you have any more pics?  I've been trying to decide between the red/white and the black/white for my 37J.  Leaning towards the red/white like you have as it lines up with what I've been doing (expanding the red accents on the seats out to the rest of the car).  Thanks!   Penderyn!   Well there was an update today.  Dunno if that'd make a difference for you.  November doesn't really matter though seeing as the G3 only came out in July...  I also rarely text because it drives me nuts.  So I don't know if you're one of the text fiends like most kids these days but I can't frakkin' stand texting.  What takes thirty minutes via text would take 30 seconds on a phone call.   The Sprint version was the last one rooted.  You took a big risk getting that version.  It may never pay off.   The case back you got does have four pins on it right, not just two?  Some folks have been getting scammed on eBay, only ending up with NFC backs...  	102
 181 year old "preserved" head      Yes and make an album while your at it   i thought it was fun and action packed, why are trekkers so ungrateful. im not afraid to say that. i wanna say that without getting treated like i insulted someone whose loved one passed away. it seems as if whiskey is my only friend. Why do I even bother? What's the point?   fuck me right? i thought it was an interesting take, and im looking forward to possible sequels with him. i like his performance.      "Made huge mistake!" "Need favor" "just blue self" okay so it's not the best. But if you want you can contribute   arrested development is so much better a show         Just a non sequitur but seriously though I never once heard any characters mention lasagna   I'm deleting that one      Because if I hear an opinion different from mine I question my place in the universe and the future of humanity, I thought it was fun and action packed. But thi subreddit is like thunder done people starting arguments left and right. Wanna join the Star Trek fandom? It's easy! All you gotta do is say IT SUCKS to everything new and there you go your a Star Trek fan. Also anyone know any good vodkas to help me get through this stressful ordeal? Because I wanna say I like something without getting treated like I insulted someone's disability.   WOAH THAT IS SO COOL!   i have: caveman: "made huge mistake" underwater without breathing apparatus: "bloob bloob bubb boob bloob bloob bloob"   This is one of those few shows were they think of everything. It's like "nope this scene isn't funny enough, lets make it better!"   favorite "board" game   good   just goes to show you that people have taste   let me guess: walmart?   The cast is great you're mental   I enjoyed the movie too. (Go away stevenjohns) I've been defending this movie for ages almost like a mental case. I just don't want injustice in the world   Oh joy! Another unnecessary remake. (It could be good, but I'm being cautious)   Maybe they could do that all along they just didnt happen to do it till now. (Ok maybe that's not the best reason) I don't wanna fight about it I love the movie   IT DOESN'T EVEN FUCKING EXIST AS OF YET! So for all we know its impossible    It's a thing called 'science FICTION' it can work however they want it to work   I think both movies are fun and action packed. I've been defending these movies for like forever and I still feel I haven't accomplished anything. Jj saved the franchise DEAL WITH IT. And if you don't like it TOUGH! I just don't like it when people criticize the new Star Trek. I can tell you why if you want.   ENOUGH WITH THE FUCKING UNDERWEAR SCENE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   i had a few criticisms.... nah i'm just kidding, i loved every second of it   I am quite looking forward to getting this movie   I think I made a bold statement, this fandom needs to get its shit together.   This fandom needs to get it shit together and I mean seriously. I love the new movies. I've been defending them for like forever. From people given them crap. All I want I people to accept change and not be biased based on the writers past projects. So what if they made a couple crappy transformers movies. They made two awesome Star Trek movies isn't that what's important. In fact I'm leaving this fandom until someone gives me a good reason. Try keeping your little franchise alive. I wish you all GOOD FUCKING LUCK!!   cute ass      I thought it was freakin amazing and fun and it a great cast an did great justice to Star Trek.    So that raises the question whether he exists in their universe or they just haven't gotten around to mentioning him, an appearance would be cool what do you think?   I would do that but I prefer not being in jail   I don't give two shits about the extras I just like the movie and the cover that goes with it, if I wanna see all the extras ill go on youtube. But yeah that sounds good cause I don't make much money   oh a grammar nazi are we?   i liked the movie it was fun and action packed. anyway which blu ray edition sounds good. theres nothing wrong with a star trek movie with action    well i like a good action movie THIS WAS ONE OF THEM! its fun and action packed and breathed new life to the franchise,    i thought it was fun and action packed DEAL WITH IT BITCH!   It just does    There's no bond actor in Shaun of the dead but there's one in hot fuzz   These guys are great, if anyone says otherwise, never speak to them again   It also shows they have good taste in comedies   post pictures of your ass!   not sure if i should send to friends and family because its funny and its the avengers, or not send to friends and family at the risk of being disowned   That was a smart move unlike what I did  	49

 Ahhh so it's from a crematorium????  Nice.. Glad I get to spend part of my day smelling that crap on my way to and from work.     Hey sorry for the delay. No I didn't go. My ex had to cancel since her car needed to get repaired. I need to get with her to reschedule it but with the holidays basically here her and I have both been busy with family stuff.     Ok, this is bothering me because I can't figure it out. lol. On I-17 between Jefferson and Grant there is this awful smell. I have to go through this every day and I just want to know what it is. I have even detoured through the area trying to figure it out and I couldn't.  Is there a plant over there? A factory of some sort? I don't even know how to describe the smell other than its awful lol   I thought this was cute till I saw the cast come through.. :(    My brain...it hurts..   They have science consultants on the show. I'd imagine very accurate!  (Source - season 1 DVD extras)   ahh yes.. you are right! my bad, thanks for that correction.. Spinato's is another place I have heard great things about too though!!    The Codfather (Bell Road/16th st) (next to Santisi I think) is incredible. Best fish/chips I have had.  If you are looking for nightclubs, I have been to Axis/Radius and enjoyed it.     lol, well my friend let me tell you. Sheriff Arpaio is anti-illegal immigration. He routinely sets up stings to capture illegals who have crossed the border. Seeing as that we are so close to the Mexico border many wrongfully accuse the Office of being racist toward the Hispanic community. This is not true. The Office has successfully capture illegals from Canada and European countries. The majority is Hispanic however. The media HATES the Sheriff and routinely conducts reports on him. As a result the public has seemed to believe that all employees are racist toward Hispanics. This is not true though. Many of us have no ill feelings toward any culture or race. I am sure some out there have prejudices but I can't speak to that.     I love magnum's. I am not a smoker, but I have been getting more into wines and such. They have great prices, friendly staff, and they are very knowledgeable. I am not a wine expert or really any type of alcohol expert. Anything you recommend I should try? I am not a fan of reds and when it comes to liquor, I typically only drink vodka. I would like to get into some whiskey's and such but not sure what to try and how to try it i.e. with/without ice, etc.   Win!   That poor ZL1 :(   Math 101.. seems about right    Recorded before The Game last year!  BEAT OHIO!   I love Alison Brie!    Which one is the bear and which one is the dog?  mind blown!

    Thanks this, it's very helpful. I do often worry my characters fears are too similar to my own. Think this concept should help me add more range.     Yossarian and the Chaplain from Catch-22, always wondered about how the rest of their lives would go. Then I found out about Closing Time. Both wonderful novels.    We may go to the same Uni, I saw him read at my Uni last year too. Though I imagine he does many readings.   I love this poem, it's one of only a few poems I know by heart.didn't mean to memorise it but it's always stayed with me.  	5

 My job is great, but we are a 24/7 center so Sunday mornings get pretty slow.      I think I can, I think I can....   Not many times where I wish I could whistle...right now is one of those times.   While I was a bartender/server, I had to work the day after my birthday. Now I had never gone out for my birthday, even at 21. I would always party at my parents house. So I underestimated the phrase- "Hey it's my birthday!" Needless to say, I got hammered. Woke up on a friends couch who proceeded to wake me up just to wake and bake and start drinking again, completely forgetting I had work in a few hours. About an hour and a half before my shift, I remembered. Oh no, this was not good. Got a ride home, showered...that's about all I could do. I got into work and immediately my co-workers were calling me out. They were all pretty cool so management was unaware. We ended up getting really busy in the afternoon, and I was holding the fort down great, I thought. Right before I leave, my General manager pulls me and and lays it out. "I don't know how you did it, but you did a great job today, and not one customer complained that you were fucked up while working." She proceeded to let me know to never do it again (obviously) and I went home with one of my best Sunday afternoons (Tip-wise) that I had ever had, oh, and a horrible hangover.  TL;DR: Bartended and Served drunk and high after my birthday, customers didn't know, manager did, made lots of money and no trouble.   Great answer.   Imagine if you were driving an older car that didn't tell you exactly how long you had left....THAT is nail-biting.   Pepper spray. Yes, I hate that person.   Ah yes, good ol' edit 634053...those were the days.   Really though? Take essentially an entire frontpage post and change Reddit to Buzzfeed? C'mon, try a little bit hard.   Oh no, he got some from Jenny and Carly, they were switching, remember? It was in edit 645234.   Cris Carter, Tim Brown, and Jerry Rice.   Ryan Leaf could QB for that team.   Yes, you are.   Well that's a given. I do that everywhere that is 5+ minutes from my current house.   I have even more cautious optimism about this upcoming season!   Ah I've seen both sides, both have pros and cons.   That will definitely NOT annoy me. I am one of the few around this area that doesn't seem to be in a crazy rush to get to EVERYWHERE. That gets me kind of excited.       We are both Network engineers and make decent money. We are prepared for the typical move stuff, but don't know how to handle moving out of state.      The duck face.  I hate it so very, very much.   I hope at least .500. I think the off-season is extremely crucial this year more so than previous years.   This...I shouldn't have read this at work. Such a strong lady. I will be hugging my mom extra tight tonight.   A lady in front of me at the grocery store couldn't find her credit card in her wallet and started frantically calling her husband and panicking, so I picked up her grocery tab without second thought. She started crying and hugging me. She asked for my info to pay me back and I just told her to help another fellow stranger one day.   Any update on the CL guy??    This happened to me...twice. Not cool ladies. Stop that shit.   While I was sitting at work at my desk alone   Not one person in the office, nor the building   Silence surrounds me, broken only by keyboard taps   Occasionally the printer spools, or phone rings   This is a normal Tuesday night   Unfortunately, the normalcy ceases here   I hear ghastly noises   They slowly escalate   Paralyzing screams   Silence.   Heroin is legal in Portugal, and I heard that stuff is pretty addictive.   I would LOVE a custom intake manifold from you. That would look gorgeous. You do damn fine work my friend.   Dexter Morgan.  Even though it's his show, and you are supposed to love him, he technically is a villain because he's a serial killer...of historic proportions. I still love his character though.   Faggot.         Now introducing, an organized place for anything about Jenny....   /r/jennyisawhore   So this is my second year of doing Extra Life, because last year was so awesome I am even more excited this year. So I live around Reading, PA and I am good friends with someone who is allowing me to use the back room of his bar, for most of the marathon, so if anybody in the area of Reading, Pennsylvania, swing by Klinger's on Carsonia and come to the back room and hang out and play games for the cause!    45 minutes since last update...RIP OP :(   My dads brand new truck is totaled. Multiple friends have totaled vehicles, I'm also berks county with confirmation. Craziest thing I've ever seen. Glad I had a carport to cover under.   This is beautiful.   I think the important thing to look at here is that a lot of servers are struggling college students and although a lot of people would brush off 200 dollars, it would be a huge help to almost every server I know.    When my friend calls his significant other "woman," or some other disrespectful term. It's really not cool and you sound like an asshole doing it. They're engaged now...   Django Unchained   Yep, I had seen them in Philly earlier this week, it was an excellent show.   And the bear jumped in the ocean and yelled "That's racist!"  	43
 What girls? As friends? He's like definitely gay. As in homo-sexual.    omg i must have this   gorgeous   OMG I NEED THESE. CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE OOK ME UP WITH A TORRENT OR SOMETHING. THIS IS THE BEST THING EVER AND 100% BETTER THAN THE NETFLIX VERSION. TAKE NOTE NETFLIX RE-EDIT IT.    WHAT THE FUCK   His eyes are so dead. I'm sad for him. He knows he officially sold his soul with this one.    I used to watch Nickelodeon everyday from maybe 4 - 12 (maybe 11)... WTF happened.    WHERE DO I BUY THIS?!?!?!!   freaky ass shit.    This should be illegal.    Is there a TShurt?   College.    Why?   SUCH PRETTY COLORS   his sex tape was released himself HELLO   I don't care for P-Hound.    I loved the living shit out of this movie when I was 8. Haven't seen it in forever, wonder if I'll still like it.    So far, INCREDIBLE. Like... I really don't know what it is but I've laughed more in this first episode than I laughed the entire 15 episodes I watched on Netflix. A few of the edits are a little jarring in a way, but not so much so. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT. Wish this could be the way they delivered it. Thank you so much!!!!!!   SOOOOOO CUTE!!!!!!!!!   I hope she's on All Stars 2... :D    Oh the shade of it all!   In other news, who agrees with Ru? Did always really need to be in all capitals? Is it ALWAYS, Ru? Always? I can't really tell. Wanna know what y'all think.    What'd Amanda say?   Edged n came... Kinda fell off the bandwagon then back on and off... On a good streak right now... Really not planning on relapsing this time. Feels just like when I went on my first thirty day streak. Hopefully I can make it to 50 days this time.   At first I thought it was QWOP holding a hammer.    Love.   I hope someday a studio like them or they themselves will make amazing games like they did.    ugh.... i love these movies.... really want more even if they blow.    Holy shit bro. I'm inspired.    They could do it Kill Bill style and Johnny wakes up from a coma. Lisa, guilt ridden decides to go back to Johnny who is happy because Lisa is the love of his life. She then gets sick of him again and starts more crazy bullshit leading to... Another tragedy...   Or Greg n Lisa have to raise Denny to honor the memory of Johnny. Tommy could play a different character with some prosthetics and not be Johnny. We need more Tommy nudity though.    Sad but true. I think focusing on only a few characters at a time killed it.    Am I the only one who might give this a shot? Some of the shots were beautiful. All the nudity is a bit jarring and the director seems to be a provocateur but it definitely looked like it had some potential.    I was dissapointed :( I wanted to see a faces of meth person doing duckface. :(:(:(:(   what game is this?   I think we need to call Maury in for this one.    Funniest boobs ever.   ..but... they have to be trolling right? i mean... they were paying homage to Friday right??? RIGHT????   Wow. Worst analogy EVER. I'd consider sex with someone you love as a good restaurant and fast food as hooker sex. But still I'm not making the example. I find sex with prostitutes is always unfulfilling, whereas sex with a consensual partner is the best thing ever.    You sir are an inspiration. What has been the biggest change you've notice about yourself? What do you think is the best thing NoFap has brought you? What advice to you have to those who have time struggling with their addiction and wonder why should I keep going? How do / did you make it through those particularly difficult days... Have you almost ever lost out edging?    Have you remained a virgin by choice or what do you think it is? Confidence, looks, no time, religion...? 600 days on hard mode. Wow. I salute you, good sir.    Edging becomes addictive and its what lead me to relapse today after 35 days. Its good you didnt orgasm but don't edge either.   After 35 days... Kinda pissed... But at the same time... Astonished.   Pros:   -Proud I made it this far.   -Biggest cum shot and amount of cum I've ever had and I was in astonishment that I could actually cum that much and was soo happy, it was almost worth the relapse for me.   -I jacked it one more time about 30 minutes later just to see if the cum shot would be as impressive and it was exactly like the first. I used to shoot blanks all day everyday.. Now I had like 5 table spoons worth. I had to change my clothes and shower. Kind of amazing.   Cons:  -Kinda sad and lethargic... Wish I could have kept it going.   -Gotta reset my badge and instead of being 55 days away from 90 I'm now 90 days away from 90...   I'm starting up again because I can already feel the energy depletion from those two jerkin seshes but whatever. I made it super far once already, it was fun and a BIG learning experience. Definitely don't want to be a PMO'er, but 35 days is a freakin long time and a great start. I've lost 25 pounds since I started NoFap, and I'm starting up again right now because when I'm not masterbating I'm doing more productive things so I just wanted to put this all on here to keep myself honest and accountable. Wish you all the best of luck!   Truer words have never been typed.   Thanks :)   On shrooms I saw the devil's face over my face and it freaked me the fuck out.    FUCK YA   Napoleon Hill's been dead forever.... Love TNGR n have tried to master my sexual beast ever since reading it. NoFap has helped so much.   If she'll be here in lets say 30 days (or hopefully more)... Why not wait out till then...    What's the difference between hard mode and easy mode?    Awww... This made me a little sad but the thing is, a lot of guys are in different boats. Some guys have girlfriends already, some guys are really good looking, some guys are not, some guys want to stop fapping for more confidence, some guys want to stop fapping for religious reasons, some guys want to stop fapping just because it's a waste of time, some guys want to stop fapping because they think it will help them get with girls. I'm not going to say which boat I'm in because I don't want anybody to think that this is another self ego stroking post as some of the posts in this subreddit are, but I will say I have seen good things happen in my life in the past 27 days of nofap and I consider nofap a major reason for so.    Holy shit....      Yeah... I just fooled around for three hours n have several dates lined up this week... Kinda crazy how this first date ended with kissing which led to groping which led to dry humping, mutual head giving n constant kissing. I've never had an experience like this before. I had to share with you guys how natural and easy everything felt... And because we didnt have pentrative sex i said I'd rather have more dates n get to know eachother better so we dont ruin our relationship early by just hooking up. We got clothed n I didn't cum. I feel great n know I can do even better... Yayyyyy for NoFap.  Edit: sorry the title is stupid... If a mod could change it to 'not even thirty days in...'... Thanks :)   I survived.... Feeling less horny n actually have two dates next week.....   This is the horniest slash desperate I've ever been. I need some support guys... I'm on the edge.    SWEET BROWN ISN'T A 2012 THING. SWEET BROWN IS A FOREVER THING.    No, you lost to yourself.      Proud of you bro.   Now kiss!   10/10 would cringe again   *Jealous*  Thanks for more inspiration!   WILLAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   So true.   Things that give me hope: straight guys who love RuPaul's Drag Race.   Bad tattoo but I still love it omg   This is a good little slave....   Also imagine what princess Mandy actually makes him do. She probably beats the shit out of him and makes him roll around in his own feces. This is a slave fetish.   Fake, look at the poster names.   Yeah, SA is pretty disgusting. And they make fun of you when you say you we're addicted to master bating. They don't think there's anything wrong with that, or at least at the meetings I've gone to.    Drink Zenify. Best drink ever.   Are you Napoleon Dynamite?   There should be a 12 step FA (fappers anonymous) or MA (masterbators anonymous) or PA (porn anonymous) program. For real. I would go.   True dat.   It's interesting how coherent and concise this post was... Just saying.. Gonna keep going. I already know NoFap isn't a placebo.    I don't know if there is a NoFap forum but if there is could somebody link me? If not I think we should start one. Reddits great but lacks the personalness a forum can have. Thanks, Fapstronauts!   Sounds fun.   Genius.    That would work. This meme doesn't get the meme imho.    I feel like this would be better if it was like "one does not simply feel crappy after relapse." Implying you feel horrible.    Hope it's Jinkx's crown. She's the SUPAH STAH.    Yeah.... but... she's really not that spectacular to me. She's funny but not nearly as funny as Jinkx. I really don't think Alaska has something more than Jinkx. She really doesn't. If anybody has the X/WOW/It Factor... It's Jinkx for me. But to each his own. I love Alaska... I'm just goo goo for Jinkxy.    Awwwwww mang. Wish I still lived in NYC.    Where did u buy tickets?   Loved it.   "So, Alaska, why do you deserve to win...? " - "Uh... Star quality... The X Factor."  I cringed. Go Jinkx.    Yeah, I want to go. All my dreams will come true.    Why are you comparing these 2? Yeah... and freakin Adele rapes both their asses. Big whoop.    Fuck Hitler.    anybody else find this little bit about jinkx just a little hokey? she always brings it so i feel like she shouldn't be so nervous. i wish she wouldn't be so... afraid i guess. besides that she's still my favorite queen this season.    You probably wouldn't have gotten on a date if it wasn't for NoFap... Also, this story was painfully awkward.    Same...   So I have a house keeper who comes to the house 4 days a week and has known me for a really long time.. Today I came downstairs around noon and I started to talk to her and she said, "What are you doing? You look so good." I laughed and pretended like I didn't know what she was talking about but in the back of my mind I was like NoFap... It made me happy and I was surprised she could see what seemed like a significant change in just one week. I've had boatloads of more energy, it's kind of crazy and I've almost beaten my previous no fap record which was 8 days. I've been a chronic masterbator since I was 12, 23 now. Typical day consisted of 5-10 PMO sessions. The best compliment she gave me was that I look younger. Only day 7! Can't wait to see what life has in store for me, I'm done with PMO for good!    Who the fuck names their turtle Adolf??   All things /r/Athiesm   Can I be a part even though I already started several days ago? By the way, the urge has been there but I've said no because I can come here and read the success stories so many other people on this subreddit have had. It's kept me going strong and even though it's not the longest I've gone without orgasming (8 days), it's the longest I've gone without edging. I haven't edged once since I started and I've already gotten so much stuff I've been putting off literally forever done and I feel amazing... And I think I'm only on day 5!   I kind of love this tattoo. I had a Sidekick 2 which is what this is...    A lot of the comments and this entire posting were pretty science heavy which was a bit confusing to me but I see a lot of people agreeing with the PhD (PhD is doctor of Philosophy, not Medical... so he's not a Medical doctor FYI...)... There are many doctors, especially PhDs, who think they're experts in something but they're incorrect about many things.. (I don't want to have that discussion so if you expect a response from me talking about it, I'm really not going to go there, I've dealt with a lot of PhD's in my time.) Anyway... What I wanted to say was to the people who agree with the science this PhD has supposedly presented in that NoFap has nothing to do with our chemical make up being negatively affected by masterbating and all to do with just having the novel need to end the habit I have to throw in my 2 cents... Yes, I want to stop masterbating but it is because I don't like the way I feel after my body goes through the physical chemical change of orgasming alone. I get groggy, hungry, unmotivated and as a result guilty and begin self loathing... To me this is 100% chemical. I'm sure if you did case studies you would find that orgasming decreases energy and concentration... As a result if you are addicted you aren't ever going to get anything done with your life. That's the truth to me, it's not just about some habit I want to get rid of. It's chemical. I don't know if it's dopamine or something else but I know my body goes through a dramatic chemical change during sex (whether with just me or another) and significantly afterwards.    You're retarded.   I agree.... I thought she was pretty good. I couldn't do that.   I would believe this.   I've tried for years to edge and not finish but it was literally impossible for me... Everytime I would ejaculate and feel retarded and depressed after. This time I'm completely giving up edging.    So not cringe it's a joke... When I was 8 I would have watched THE SHIT out of this.    I just want to start punching him and say NO. THIS IS NOT OKAY.    Link... please... I'd be so much less disturbed if I saw him getting pounded by a big black cock....    No, go to the sidebar and message the bot, it will ask you to input a date and then about 2 or 3 hours later you'll have a badge next to your name.    I upvoted this for I liked the content of its message. That is all.    She has to be trolling. Please be trolling. Please for the sake of my childhood and all that is holy be trolling.    How has your life changed in these 64 days???? I want all the T! (Btw the thing says I have 111 days but I really have 5... I fell off the wagon after going on 7 days and having my first date which got a little sexual conversation wise and when I got home I masterbated... I fucked it up in our texts the next day and didn't even realize until a few days ago... I still really like him but when it comes to love/sex/relationships I'm always in a post cumming haze.... I hope I can get him to go on another date with me cause he has responded to some of my texts.... Ugh... When I get hard the urge to just touch n massage gets so strong then it feels so good it hurts to stop... Any advice would be great...)   This was more MorbidReality for me.    I'm scared.   Come on, you have to relate to this.   I was gonna upvote but you're at 42 so it felt wrong.    Omg cringe.    I found that kid awesome.    Oh, hi Mark, AMA, ha?   I think Garner thinking snuck isn't a word is more cringe.    Casem or Kassem or however the fuck you spell this twat's name always makes me cringe. Almost as much as that Philip DeFranco however you spell his name cunt.       I don't know why... But we were watching it and  right off the bat she was like... "Oh I love San Francisco... I can't wait to go back..." And then later when we were all laughing she was silent and after maybe the third sex scene I said "Do you like it?" cause I was afraid she thought it was just bad and I forced her to watch a movie as bad as The Room but she said "No... I love it..." Even though we loved it for other reasons... I also saw a video once of people leaving a screening at an NYC theatre who actually liked the movie legitimately... Not ironically either... I think they were watching it as part of a film festival in early 04 or 03... Oh, also, the woman's favorite movie is A Clockwork Orange... but come on... O HAI DOGGIE   looks sooo gooood   It's too Batman Begins for me... I just want Schumacher.    I heard it was so they didn't have to rack focus for lighting...    Here's a torrent link... http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/3317759/threads_%28nuclearwarmovie_conflict_discharge_crass%29_avi   You've only seen it FOUR TIMES!!!!??????? WTF!!!! I'VE SEEN IT LIKE 40...!   I WANNA BE HYPNOTIZED LIKE THIS!!!!   Almost sure he's Persian... Might be Armenian.    Awww.... Well if it's any consolation to him... My mom has a friend who is a very educated woman from Paris who watched The Room and didn't think it was funny and legitimately liked it... She didn't really care about the technical errors... She said she loved the drama.    What about Foreclosure? What do you know about it?    Yes... and I think I'm going to cry if you actually think I'll never see it... I want to learn about The Neighbors and the Princess and all the characters... Especially Tommy's.... WHY HASNT ANYBODY GREENLIT THIS????? ughhhhhhhh  	127

    Did you have enough money to get groceries?!    That reminds me of the movie Insidious.    Please update with the new info.    The Tyrant episode of House explains this. Very interesting how the brain works.   	5
 Surprised to see that my hometown TV station made it on r/science. The last time they made worldwide news was for their drunk anchor. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2071669/Annie-Stensrud-Was-bumbling-news-anchor-drunk-air-Female-presenter-slurs-words-bizarre-broadcast.html      What's he doing at a World Wrestling Entertainment event?   One has to wonder about the multitude of ways that sports subtly affect our psyches and actions. The article mentioned that sports defeats also boost chances of traffic fatalities and domestic violence... eeek!       100% positive feedback: sounds like a responsible mother.      So rigid, methodical, and uninspired... but enough about the current state of scientific publishing.            So many people carry around hatred and contempt after being wronged. The accompanying worry and anxiety must feel like a 20lb weight on each shoulder. You don't have to forget -- justice should be done in those circumstances. But forgiveness is the true liberation.      Technically correct. Though with male animals, vets almost always remove the testicles: simple, cheap, effective.  The downside is that your male cat won't be cooling its balls on the base of toilets.      If fusion reactions don't become self-sustaining, how do you explain stars?   NIF began focused on achieving fusion ignition and it still is. But they've missed so many deadlines over there that it seems they're starting to "diversify their research portfolio," so to speak -- taking on all sorts of projects.  I mean, that HUGE laser has to be used for something!   NIF's biggest problem is being able to sustain and control the fusion reaction. Judging by the article it doesn't seem that fusion ignition occurred, where the reaction actually becomes self-sustaining. In other words, I'm guessing that they didn't reach the break even point, if they did, that would be the headline.     We like to have fun in Madison.  http://www.southparkstudios.com/clips/402323/we-like-to-have-fun-here         This study was released almost two months ago and already appeared on /r/science. I love how Scientific American simply slapped on a misleading headline and republished it.      Looks like they compared the subjects' final fitness scores/metrics to baseline metrics taken at the beginning of the program. Not sure if sedentary controls are really needed for a study of this design.            STUNNER!         Here's a link to the research that I think the author is referencing: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23759244  Psychobiotics: A Novel Class of Psychotropic.  Abstract: Here, we define a psychobiotic as a live organism that, when ingested in adequate amounts, produces a health benefit in patients suffering from psychiatric illness. As a class of probiotic, these bacteria are capable of producing and delivering neuroactive substances such as gamma-aminobutyric acid and serotonin, which act on the brain-gut axis. Preclinical evaluation in rodents suggests that certain psychobiotics possess antidepressant or anxiolytic activity...         One time I ripped my boxers deadlifting and mistook it for an anal blowout. For the thirty minutes before I noticed that they were ripped, I was scared shitless that my colon would start leaking out of my arsehole.      Whoops, damn my brain. A billion billion is still less than 10^32, though! ;)   Only a billion years? Pffft. The proton can live for up to 10^32 years!      This study is interesting in that people commonly perceive cities as more dangerous due to higher crime and homicide rates -- we fear what we can't control. But in reality, the risk of injury death is higher outside of cities.      One findings that was surprising about this study was that people were least likely to intervene when the conflict was between a man and a woman. Those fights are often of a different nature, I suppose.   Yes, here are a couple.

 She hits a lot of asian stereotypes, but she sounds pretty narcissistic.  Keep in mind there are many different kinds of narcissism, for example my mother is a shy narcissist... Which is an oxymoron, but I cant describe it any other way.  The worst thing about narcissistic parents is that you need to get away from narcissists but youre supposed to stay close to your parents :/  I wish you luck.   Tried to pretend I was straight and cis. Lel.   Clownfish. Changing gender to a different one than you were assigned at birth sucks.   Lets make a list of evil...

 Rumor has it - When bomb explodes on Inferno fish in pond will float dead  (I don't know if it happened previously?)   Darude - Sandstorm   Where should i find a server like this?!   You can't DDoS LAN tourneys, it was probably technical problems...   GTFO  Theres a subreddit for that.   Darude - Sandstorm   They didn't make it for a reason, most of these are either too big or too small, too cramped or too open. In short, they don't fit to Competitive 5v5 standards. I'm not talking about ALL of them, there are some really good maps, so don't get me wrong. Hopefully those who have some free time in their hands can sit down and rewrite the layout of some classics.   Interesting stuff - De_Chateau is being remade by me and my friend, so you can consider that to be worked on! :P    I thought it was the opposite o.o Just look at the Skybox on Cache...     I hope you don't wan't me to explain why i said so?  How is this even close to COD? This is probably one of the cleanest looking maps besides Agency at the moment... Also, CS:GO is a competitive game, the amount of clutter is not even near to COD. What gave you a thought that this is like any COD map? Can you give me an example of a COD map like this?   Yeah! Let's go back playing DE_DUST! This is too much over-cluttered, amirite?    You got to be the most weird person in the universe. Not gonna go further in-depth to explain what you just said.    You prefer the bland usual "factory" style which most mappers easily adopt to, amirite? :)  Go and play the original Season, it will always be available even after this release...   All these people moaning "Please don't over-do visuals" probably have to check their eyes, the map is so simple clean and nice, the textures are smooth... Good job as always FMPONE! :)   Cause you keep matchmaking with pre-made team that has Silvers in it . Go solo queue to play with your rank players.    I wasn't replying to you, i guess the comment stacking got messed up. I was addressing to Bravehood.   Lag switching is illegal, lagging isn't.    It's not SiC's fault, it's Auzii's fault, he started the chain by using a copyrighted image on Howl.   I didn't start off with Source version and recompiled it, i remade it. It does look very similar, but it's just the Bombsite B, the other part of the map doesn't exist cause it isn't made/remade. (But yes, i used Source version as a bare-bones for scaling and geometry, but it's not recompiled for CS:GO) I could put up comparison screenshots, but i don't work on this anymore so there's no point basically. I do have subscribed some ports from Source to CS:GO on workshop just for a look, but i don't really know how to find map source to decompile so it's just impossible for me to work with workshop content. I did play the original Russka in 1.6 though. But you got a good point there, and i agree with a lot of what you said.  I wish i could give you the credit in the first place, but there's no way to add description at Reddit link posts, that would explain a lot of stuff.  Anyways, i understand how you feel about this, but i haven't done a lot of stuff to continue with the map, so if you wan't me to take down this post contact me on PM. I would not hesitate to do so, just because you gave an constructive and valuable statement.      It's the balance really. Engaging early doesn't let players set up smokes/flashes and positions, i think that would be a con to pros.  I might try a mixture of both, hopefully.   Shouldn't it be the opposite?   Good luck, i encourage you to do that and i would love to play on it. I have moved on with this project. You got some nice fanbase here, as you can see people would really love you to make this map. Btw, welcome to the Reddit!   Thank you! :D I really wish i could remove them, but i still feel like it plays a big part in next-gen spawn camping....   Please read my reply below, thanks.   Did i said i stole anything? More over, did i post the map anywhere? The screenshot doesn't tell anything about the layout. It might be completely different with a different name, it's just the map style, which you can't really blame me for. :P  Go ahead and tell that to people who actually ripped Source version and put it up on the workshop. Don't scream at people who admire your work and wan't to achieve something similar to learn.   If you wan't to sort this out, i would suggest using PM. And yes, i do make other maps as my hobby. P.S - This is also one of my hobby projects, nothing too special. I might use it to play it on LAN with my teammates.  P.S.S - I'm mapping since 1.5, Brute pls. Peace.     Fill DCMA notice, hopefully the item gets removed from Steam Market and prices go up.  Friggin' art stealers.   De_cbble was supposed to be a successor to de_dust, the creator wanted to name de_dust2 to de_dust3 in the first place.  I remember reading his article about making de_dust2...   Originally the map had mid to B rotates, but i blocked off the entrance as the time it takes for CT's to go from A to B is very close to the amount it takes on Nuke (Literally, instantly.) While having it blocked, Ct's have to go around all the way. That way it makes it more balanced and give CT's time to rethink they're strategies before going either bombsite.  The door is not supposed to be widened. The reason why is because there is long A to the left which gives more space if you need it. The door has a window above it, so additional support Terrorist could go up to doors and smoke mid without being exposed, or throw flashbangs.  At most part i could agree, but it's all about timing and smokes, which professional players really nit-pick about.   That's an good idea, it would encourage team-work!   You'll be able to test it once it goes on the workshop! :D   Sure thing! PM me I'll help you out ;)   If they wanna do their things they go to the inside part of the cafeteria where is the WC.    Oh my god, the second layout. Love it.   http://i.imgur.com/hI88gqz.png Layout V3 (Based on @justdefaultaccount feedback!)   You're right. The above post was a joke. :)   I encourage that.   http://i.imgur.com/L0AYF2j.jpg Better?   It's the same vending machines they're using since 2004 :P Except it has a different name. I might change the texture when i find an texture artist to work with.   I wish.   Thank you for your opinion, i will be putting it up on workshop soon. :)   Didn't even notice that similarity! :D Who knows, it might prove to be very fun!   Thank you, it means a lot to me! :)   Like i said, high risk high trade-off bombsite. It's really easy though, terrorists could just throw a smoke down the hallway and push into the bombsite. I wanted to keep the entrances to be close in the viewpoint, If there were more you would get into situation where you look at doors and get shot from the back.  I would also love to possibly add vents as an optional entrance from Alt A.   I would be glad to add any additions you would suggest, how do you think i could improve bombsite B?   This is supposed to be outside cafeteria. It also has a nice view of hills and river.  When it's that hot outside, I'm sure you would prefer sitting outside too! :P   http://i.imgur.com/p65cISZ.png  LAYOUT UPDATE!   I wanted to keep alternative B as an entrance through doors, kinda like Cache. (You can throw flashbangs through windows for retake)  Let's say there was one CT standing behind door, and one standing at mid, the CT in alt B pop flashes the bombsite for CTs to push in through the other side.  Now that you mention it, i might as well as remove it and give an alternative path for T's to go B. Most of the play opposite to De_Dust2 revolves around CT's utilizing mid, it's not quite the same mid as in every map, it's basically mid for CT's to rotate through. If CT's loose mid control it's harder to get it back.  It's really hard to judge the layout without playing it, as i found most of play testing very 50/50 for both sides, as there are some height and perspective changes.   Although, it's still WIP and every layout feedback is very valuable, as i wan't to keep it as simple as possible.      It's about the same, i did some testing and CT's get at least 2 seconds before T's rush. Auto-sniper might be useful in that scenario. You can also rush ALT-B through mid for a surprise. I might move T spawn a bit further back to give more time for CT's to ready up.  B is kind of a high-risk high-reward choke point, just because it's easy to defend before and after plant for both teams.   That's why it says WIP. (The screenshot is view from CT spawn)  I will post more screenshots as soon as i touch up the important parts of the map! :)   Try to be the top entry fragger, i try to be sneaky at the first rounds, and when i get AK or some better weapon i mostly try to outmatch my opponents by playing aggressively. Second thing is do pauses between matches. I usually go relax myself for a while and go back to playing. It's very important. I also take some water with myself, it helps me feel better during the match.  Also, when you feel like you're being out of luck (If your opponents are destroying you), there must be one mistake that you are doing. Try improving reaction times and pre-aim common spots.   If none of those help you, find some teammates who played really well and add them on Steam. Together it might be easier to play.  P.S - Never depend on your team! Try to carry yourself out! Team work becomes real needed at later ranks, at Silver it's mostly basic mechanics and gamesense.       The screenshake. It gives me headache.   The screen-shake effect is an over-kill.   There are either two ways - When you are about to rank up (when your skill increases) you get matched with higher ranked enemies, the second way is that you live in a region closest to a server that doesn't have as much players.   We all started as noobs. Maybe the guy is still learning.   I think the guy needs specifically a theme, not layout ideas? I'm not sure, but that's what i lack the most. When i try to whip up a new design for a map i either come up with Nuke/Cache styled map or Inferno.    I'm still waiting for that ultimate one shot ace since 1.5.    He didn't even announce working on his own version... Speaking of that, it would take him 2 years to make one. Empty promises.  I will be renaming the map and changing the layout for more fluid gameplay.    Like wise man once said, if everyone you meet are assholes that means you are an asshole.  gg wp OP.   Texture choice i assume! :P   Better change that map-name quick...       I practice Bhopping in CS:GO, but trust me, the way you make these big strafes just after landing and gain the speed looks way too impossible.   Valve should hire you.   The feels are strong with this one.   126 http://steamcommunity.com/id/theguma/  GL HF   You can't sell a knife to a friend, you can only trade. Once you post a knife for this cheap it will get bought by bot almost instantly.  Even then, trades can be checked.    The gif is so smooth i feel like I'm watching a video.   It may not be very good for competitive scene, but as far as casual goes there is already an remake on Workshop.   Depends on your performance during the match.    It happens when i launch CSGO from shortcut. Try launching from library on Steam (Client.) If THAT doesn't work, go to game properties, launch options and remove -insecure.  Hope it helps.    It's a bot. Thanks for your info. When you saw the message you should have instantly changed password. Or was it too late when you saw the message?  	70
 A recent study showed that it is natural for nostrils to have differing air intake volumes under normal conditions. The findings suggest this aids in identification of scents, as the reactions occur differently at a higher volume and an lower volume.  Edit: [Nature.com Article](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v402/n6757/full/402035a0.html)  "The flow of air is greater into one nostril than into the other because there is a slight turbinate swelling in one. The nostril that takes in more air switches from the left to the right one and back again every few hours, but the effect of this switching on the sense of smell has been unclear. Here we show that this difference in airflow between the nostrils causes each nostril to be optimally sensitized to different odorants, so that each nostril conveys a slightly different olfactory image to the brain."

I was amazed that this was his first novel.

It comes from a spelling alteration of the abbreviation "docs" (for "documents") and refers to "compiling and releasing a dossier of personal information on someone". Essentially, doxing is revealing and releasing records of an individual, which were previously private, to the public.

Sherrod argued that Madison County deputies in the summer of 2012 conspired to stalk, beat and falsely arrest Bryant. Bryant sued Sheriff Dorning and eight deputies, including Countess, in federal court last year.  The county settled with Bryant for $625,000 last year and the FBI then announced it was investigating the deputies.  This lawsuit invokes the Bryant case and related newspaper articles to argue that Dorning and the Madison County Sheriff's Department have a record of ignoring or even covering up police misconduct.  "Deputies under [Sheriff] Dorning's command have learned that their justifications for using force and other unlawful actions will never be questioned," reads the Kenebrew suit, "and that they can act with impunity."

She falls down, apparently dead, but her father cannot face the idea of losing her, so he lays her body on a bed in one of his estates. Later, a king out hunting in the woods finds her, and since he cant wake her up, rapes her while shes unconscious, then heads home to his own country. Some time after that, still unconscious, she gives birth to two children, and one of them accidentally sucks the splinter out of her finger, so she wakes up. The king who raped her is already married, but he burns his wife alive so he and Talia can be together.

The whole measles thing by itself is a joke and not a real threat to America.  [From January 1 to January 30, 2015, 102 people from 14 states were reported to have measles](http://www.cdc.gov/measles/cases-outbreaks.html) "The United States experienced a record number of measles cases **during 2014, with 644 cases from 27 states reported to CDC**'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). This is the greatest number of cases since measles elimination was documented in the U.S. in 2000."  * The majority of the people who got measles were unvaccinated. * Measles is still common in many parts of the world including countries in Europe, Asia, the Pacific, and Africa. * Travelers with measles continue to bring the disease into the U.S. * Measles can spread when it reaches a community in the U.S. where groups of people are unvaccinated.

It's not about skin color - it's about geography.    No - the contagion vectors come from outside the Americas.  The spread is due to pools of non-immunized children that are exposed and quickly transmit it to others.  If the children were immunized, the virus brought in from Europe or Africa would not spread.    Here's some of the misinformation being spread:   **Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.)** said individuals who come to the U.S. illegally may be responsible for the recent measles outbreak, contending they dont undergo the stringent health screening others do when they enter the country. I dont think there is any health care professional who has examined the facts who could honestly say that Americans have not died because the disease is brought into America by illegal aliens who are not properly health care screened as lawful immigrants are.  **Rush Limbaugh** - The children coming across the southern U.S. border "were never examined after they got here and quarantined if they had a disease. They were just sent out across the country. Many of them had measles ... We now have an outbreak of it all because of our immigration policy."

 Hey guys,  My room mate is about to try a Soylent diet to lose some weight. He's not a goose, he knows about caloric requirements and nutritional requirements, that's not a problem.  I was wondering if any of you have tried it before?   Haha, you're right, I don't do it in that order, it just rolls off the tongue better saying it that way.   There has been instances where Buzzfeed has stolen content from reddit. The joke is more specifically targeted at threads in AskReddit where the answers could be made into one of Buzzfeeds stupid articles. So a thread like "What cute thing does your SO do?" could be stolen to make a "25 things that your SO could do to be cute" clickbait monstrosity.   I'm still weird like that though. I still love the smell of second hand smoke, but I hate the smell of smokers. There are two completely different aromas there. That being said, I won't let anyone smoke in my car, so there are some hard limits.   As an ex smoker, I feel the exact same way. Knowing how repulsive being a smoker is definitely helps me from relapsing. It's totally the same with over eating. If being fat were considered sexy, it would be so much more difficult to lose weight.   Not just the habits that are instilled, but also the information provided in general. Do you know anyone who refuses to try to lose weight because 'exercise is hard', they don't even know how that is a non sequitur. I was in that camp too not that long ago, I'd always just assumed that weight loss cant be achieved without exercise..   I personally don't mind them, I think stigmatising overeating worked for me. But I can totally see why others wouldn't want those places to exist.  That being said, here is a thought exercise. Let's say there was a subreddit created called /r/smokerhate. All they did there was shame smokers and post stupid smoker logic. Would you have the same opinion of it as you do about /r/fatpeoplehate?   Same goes to you, I liked it the way it was. I remember back in high school psychology reading about a bodily function clock, which dictates when your body has the highest/lowest blood pressure, etc. That body clock also regulates when your body ceases bowel movements.

Alarm goes off at 6:15 am then I'm off to do the 3 S's (Shower, Shit and Shave **not in that order _**). Every Monday morning I would weigh myself right after the second S, so I can get the most accurate reading. About a month or so into my new diet I noticed that I couldn't do the morning movement right after I woke up, now it occurs 2 hours later, like clock work.  Has this happened to anyone else? I'm obviously not ready to call a doctor or anything, but it's frustrating because now my weigh in readings are not going to be as accurate as I'd like. I'm wondering if it has anything to do with the fact that I'm getting better sleep now than I was before. Same number of hours, but definitely more uninterrupted sleep (weightloss = better sleep, yay)  Edit: Clarification on the SSS rule   Dinner which wasn't prepared by myself or a chef.   I honestly don't know, I feel like I need to buy new clothes but the way I'm losing weight, I'll need to do it again in a few months. Luckily being a guy means I can get away with more baggy clothes. That being said, it's still a bad look lol   This reminds me of my first week. I did some snap calculations as to how little i'll need to eat for me to lose weight. So I did some guess-timation on my lunch and dinners for the week. 5 days in I was *convinced* that I was eating too much. So I subscribed to Lite N Easy (weight watchers), which was due to arrive in the next week. I was certain that I couldn't set a 2000 calorie limit correctly.  I guess I was wrong, because on the 7th day I recorded a 3.3 lbs loss! I was never more happy to cancel that Lite N Easy order :D    It was the same when you gained the weight in the first place - it crept up on you.   Oh god, this is so true. I wish it wasn't though .  It has reminded me that I'll probably never stop doing weekly weigh ins.    sandwich.    "women only want to date rich men" and "women don't want to **hate** men who are broke or balls deep in **depth**"  I know these are obviously typos, but I still had a giggle.  I totally agree with you, the distinction is important. I certainly don't want to date someone who isn't responsible with their finances or job situation. If you're studying, thats different but if you are just lazy, then no fucking thank you.     Yeah the majority of my mates are men, I had a really close female friend but we had a falling out over something really stupid and she hasn't talked to me since. I made fun of her favourite football team not making it into the finals. Not even kidding, 10 years of friendship down the toilet over that.   I started taking the train to work.   Not even joking, going from a 35-70 minute drive to and from work in heavy traffic to a 45 minute train ride to and from work has done **wonders** to my anger.  Fuck traffic, other than that I don't really have anger issues.   I make enough money that I could buy everything every time, but I wont. I think you're better off working off a 'shouting' system. Meet up for coffee? Ill get this one, you can get the next :)  Alternatively, at dinner just pay your own way. Fuck these gender roles, you're an adult right? Buy your own damn stuff. It's fine to spend money on your SO every now and again, but I don't understand the guy paying for everything, thats just silly.   I appreciate a movie more if it makes sense scientifically.

You sound worse  That's not very nice /u/citizensssnips.     Why?   Question in the title.  I saw some brief rumors about him potentially playing the heir apparent to Tony Stark as Iron Man. The kid is currently 13 years old, so if he were to take over from RDJ after Avengers pt 4, he would be 18~ years old.  What do you think he could play in future movies?   I saw the movie, loved it. I then read the comics, loved it. I then rewatched the movie and loved it even more.  Those criticisms are not fair, the reception of an adaptation shouldn't be measured on its accuracy to the source material, it should be on it's own unbiased merit. I really liked the changed ending in the movie, it felt natural and it made sense.  Stellar movie, 10/10 would watch again. Especially the extended addition. It is easily Snyders best film, sorry 300 :   Yes! The dude who does the voice over does an amazing job   Thanks for linking this sub. I've been following the Martian progress (loved the books) for ages. I'm glad we're finally getting snippets of information! SO EXCITED!   That's the catch 22 of this subreddit. It's an amazing support network with shit loads of awesome information... But daily usage can make your progress seem slower since you're constantly thinking about your loss.     I still **love** it, over the past 11 weeks I've only had drinks twice. Once for a bucks and once for a 30th birthday party. Otherwise I've been sober. I miss having a beer with dinner, but the way I rationalise it is "I've drank enough beer in my life, I need a hiatus".  I won't be a teetotaler for the rest of my life, just until I get my weight back in check.   It does make sense, I thought it was weird that the camera stayed so long on this unknown extra. That's the exact thing D D would do for a cameo.   Nice one man! I **guarantee** that in a few weeks time, you'll think "Damn, why didn't I start this earlier". The old proverb holds true.  **"The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago, the second best time is right now."**   It's only slow because you're focusing on it too much, let your changes become part of a daily routine and time will go super fast.   Yep, I'm going to be visiting another friend interstate at the end of June who I've not seen in months too. By then I should be down to 40 lbs :D   I take pictures at every month interval. The 2 month photos show some change, but not much. Not enough (in my mind) to warrant asking "did you lose weight". Obviously I'm wrong, my friend had no idea that I'd been losing weight :)   Thanks! It's been surprisingly easy. Turns out that eating like this is how normal people eat and they do it every day without thinking.   What I eat for lunch pretty much hasn't changed, my biggest problem was dinner and how much beer I drank.  Looking back on it now, it was an insane amount. So much so that I would bet the large part of my weight loss is from cutting out beer and drinking water/coffee.   Hey guys,  I'm currently in my 11th week of my weight loss journey and my change of diet no longer feels foreign, it's now *just how I eat*.  I'm 31 lbs down from my starting weight of 285. I've struggled to notice the difference in the mirror, despite my belt going down some notches and my shirts feeling looser than normal.  Tonight was a good night, I bumped into a friend that I've not seen in months. "Holy shit train_subject5967, have you lost weight?", "Yeah, I've lost a few Kilos ;)", "I almost didn't recognise you!".  A simple exchange like that, I'm still buzzing. That was an objective and unsolicited view of my progress, really made my night.  Do not fret my friends, if you're just starting out and are frustrated at the speed of your progress. Trust me when I say this - it goes **insanely** quickly. These 11 weeks have been a blur. Just keep at it and everything gets easier with every passing second :D     Any secret to it? Or did it just kinda happen the way it happened?  You carry it really well!   See the problem is that for the past 10 years I've been playing competitive 8 ball, I'm quite good.  I don't bring my A game with anyone I play unless they also play competitively. It's not a 'letting them win' thing, its a 'I love playing pool, so I want my friends to want to play with me' thing.  So I'm not letting people win, but I'm turning down my game to like a 5/10   My friends? No, as long as they're happy I couldn't care less how they go about their week days. I have friends who are in retail and some who are doctors and lawyers. I never feel better than anyone.    I'm 27 years old and the last time I cried was almost 10 years ago. I had a physical altercation with my father and broke down at a mates house. I felt so embarrassed since he had mates around. But he was a really good friend, who sat me down away from them and supported me.   Once I calmed down, i went back and joined his mates and had a laugh. No one mentioned it again. It was good because he saw me at my worst and so did his mates and no one judged me.    It depends on the relationship and who breaks up with who. When I was younger, i dated this amazing girl who after almost 2 years, broke it off with me. I was inconsolable. It has been around 8 years since then and I still think about her. Hurt like hell.  Other times, I've not felt as much. The most recent was a 10 month relationship with a nice enough girl, who had a whole host of anxiety problems. I enjoyed her company, she got along with my friends and was a very bright individual. But those anxiety problems were just too much to deal with in the end and I came to realise that I couldn't keep dating her (there is a lot more to the break up, I can elaborate if you want). So I ended it. Instead of feeling upset about it, I felt relieved. It was strange actually.   It was a sad day where my stuffed jaguar named Jag was put into storage.   Why the hell not? It's lovely and warm and there's plenty of room :)   Glad I could help. If you can't tell, my favourite character is Carl Drogo.   Kissing. I mean seriously. You don't just passionately press your faces together. There is more to it.   I'm so sick of this shit, I hate it when people call her 'Dany'. Do they not realised that Dany is a title given to Khaleesi by the Dothraki? It means princess.  Some people are so fucking ignorant.   And last but not least, Jons "death" could be used as a plot device which relieves him of his Nightwatch duties and frees him up for other storylines without making him a deserter.  This is one of the biggest pieces of evidence for his resurrection. I remember when Mel had that show only conversation with Thoros about how he ressed Beric, I was thinking "Oh, I see. Now that Mel knows about resurrection, it wont be a shock when she does it to Jon", clever.   It wasn't just that, there was all of this circle jerk by the writers and director about how the episode was "The best they've ever done" and it ended up being rather subpar in the context of the show.  Happy cake day btw :P   Nice job man, hows the loose skin situation?   Same with quitting drinking. I was buying 1-2 slabs of beer per week (not including drinks when I went out on the weekends) which could be upwards of $150 per week on booze. That's insane.    Its been almost 3 months for me and I couldn't agree more! I've cooked every since dinner since that 3 month start and I can't even stand the sight of fast food. Give me a fresh and juice steak over mcdonalds any day of the week.  I work in the city and there are so many places to get a awesome lunch. The cafe in my work lobby makes a awesome minestrone soup in house..... Fuck it, I'm getting that today for lunch :D   I'm kicking myself that I didn't start sooner. I really am. It's really not that hard to start, I'm a stubborn mother fucker so I just focus my stubbornness into my change of life style.   I don't weigh daily but I do experience what you're showing here. For example, I record my weigh ins every Monday morning right before I get ready for work. Yesterday (Sunday) I weighed myself and saw I had lose 1.2kgs from the previous monday (yay). Knowing that, I did my official weigh in the following morning and I had apparently gained 2 kilograms from the previous week. WTF body, your mass retention is just plain silly.  I obviously didn't gain 2kgs of fat overnight, so fuck you body, I'm recording yesterdays loss.   I love making my friends and family laugh. So in that regard, I care about social media.  If I tell a joke which gives someone a laugh and brightens their morning, then I consider the effort worth while.   Excellent action movie, really surprised me since it had been in development hell for so many years. 10/10, best movie of 2015.  That aside, I don't get all of the feminism/anti-feminism shit which has sprouted up from the ethos. Why can't people just enjoy something for what it is instead of finding meaning which serves their personal agenda?    I feel like I'm on the wrong website to ask such a question lol   I have a 5 inch wide burn scar on my left calf muscle which was caused by a hysterical woman and a motorcycle. Interested?  I grew up on a fairly large property and had been motorbike riding since I was a youngster. One day when I was 17, I had a few mates around and they begged me to give them a dink (aussie slang for riding a bike tandem). I said yes and explained to them a simple rule for riding tandem. **Lean the way I lean**. Balance is everything when riding a motorbike.  So anyway for the next 45 minutes or so I was giving my mates the time of their lives, everyone was really excited. There was one girl left who hadn't had a ride and was rather shy about it. She eventually got the courage to get on the back and go for a ride. I'm not a dick, I went extra slow for her, I know she was nervous. As we go along she starts to get more confident asking me to go faster. So I oblige her.   This is where everything goes pear shaped. We get to the final bend of my circuit which is a fairly tight turn on wet grass. I take the corner at a liberal speed and lean into the turn, she *forgets* the golden rule about leaning and leans the opposite direction which causes massive under steer and we end up crashing into the ground. It was a relatively slow impact so no broken bones.   Let me explain what's wrong about this picture. There I am, 17 years old with a girl latched onto my back with a 120kg motorbike pinning me down, which has its *red hot* exhaust pipe pinned against my left calf muscle. I'm screaming bloody murder for this girl to let go of me so I can get out from under the bike and her screaming even louder, seemingly unable to let go of me out of sheer terror.  It took her around 30 agonising seconds to finally let go of me so I could get out from underneath the bike. I have had a few bits of pain in my day but that one was the worst of them. Not only that, but the pain of recovery over the next few months was horrible too. I don't really dink my mates around anymore, that was a shit time. Not as much a *stupid* story, I'm told it was hilarious though.   It is, it doesn't look like much when written down. But when it's pronounced, the letters all flow well.  It's like *sequestered*, Q is a really awesome letter.   I love that word, I think the noun sounds better than the verb though. **Defenestration**, I recall learning that word while wikipedia hopping. How the fuck is there a word for such a specific act? lol   This one comes up often and unexpectedly.   Good one, I use this one often for work. Feels classy as fuck.   Dude, that word is a god damn nightmare. It's like *comparable*, there are so many moving parts that trying to spell or pronounce it can make you look stupid.   *shudder*   Mine is **frivolity**.   It rolls off the tongue so well, using it in a sentence instantly classes the place up. Of course I see the irony of being the OP in a seemingly frivolous askreddit thread.   If you're weird like me, you'll hear/see a word and suddenly think "that is such a cool word". That word then becomes your favourite word for the day. This word could be considered 'cool' because of its meaning, the way its pronounced or even because of the definition.   That being said, what is your favourite word for the day?  **Edit: Let's get meta, does anyone know if there's a word for 'finding words pleasing'? I'm sure it's some sort of sexual kink.**   I'm putting my money on the fact that this comment is complete and utter hyperbole.  I hate to play the pessimist, but experience tells me that every time you hear a comment from an actor for an upcoming episode, it has been crafted in such a way as to build hype, rather than prepare the audience for an event.  Remember the hype around last seasons final episode? It was being built up as a ground breaking piece of television. Remember how anticlimactic it was for us?  Scary^Spooky^Skeletons   As long as you factor it into your budget, then it's perfectly fine.   (Posted on 5-20-15, weight: 230.6) (shamelessly using this post as a "before" shot)  That's not shameless at all, that's actually quite clever. I text my weigh in results to myself every week so I have them stored and readily accessible.  GJ on the self control   In my head a;ldkfjaf! I have fought for every single pound I have lost, thank you very much. You dont know me, or my body. My PCOS has made it damn-near impossible to lose weight; but Ive powered through. Ive given up all of those cookies and donuts I see you grab in the breakroom. This 23 lbs was NOT EASY!!!  Does this person know all this background information? I mean, I know he/she has made a snap judgement about how difficult your weight loss was, but what does your success look like to them? They probably see a happy person who is proud of their weight loss and assume that you're able to lose the weight easily.  I'm not saying that they're assumption was correct, but I wouldn't get too frustrated with someone for not knowing the whole story about you. Some people have an easy time losing weight.  Congratulations on 23lbs lost though :)   Pure curiosity here. Does anyone like the sand snakes and the Dorne plot as a whole? I can see reddit has made up its hive mind in some threads but are there any positives anyone has taken away from these new characters?  Edit: Do not down vote someone just because you disagree, that's not how reddit works.   Hey guys,  I know this might sound like a silly question, but is an elevated heart rate from non physical exercise still burning calories like exercising would do?  I ask because I play competition 8 ball and at times, it can get the heart rate up. I put myself in late so I end up playing the clutch games for the night. A combination of nerves and excitement can actually lead to a sustained heart rate of 168~. My question is, does that elevated heart rate equate to calories burned in the same way exercise would even though what I'm doing isn't physically exhausting?  Edit for clarification: I'm quite sure that the two are not comparable, I'm just after the specifics if any      Hey guys,  I've since changed my exercise regime. I was previously trying to walk every day but I was finding this wholly unsustainable. I've since decided to do 45-60 minutes of fast walking (with jogging intervals of 5 minutes) every Saturday and Sunday. Already I can see how this is far better in the long run, I feel much better. It was at the stage where some week days I'd get home from work, I would have to get changed, do my workout, cook dinner, eat it and then I only had like 5 minutes before I had to be somewhere. It was getting a bit hectic.   **How often do you exercise every week? What exercise do you do? How do you rationlise what you do and how often you do it?**   I was wondering why the hoodie I wear every day in the colder months feels weird. I kept trying to roll the sleeves up and they just wouldn't stay up. The sleeves are also longer for some reason. Also, the bottom of the zipper seems further away than normal.  Some seriously strange witchcraft is going on here guys. I think I'll need to buy a new hoodie, this one is suddenly defective.   This may help others get jump started and may re-spark your own efforts!  **What event(s), feeling, realisation, etc started your efforts?**  I've been procrastinating losing this weight for years. My maternal grandfather died of a heart attack at 38 and his son (my maternal uncle) survived a heart attack at 38. Turns out I have some form of congenital heart condition on my mothers side.  That itself didn't stop me from digging this hole I'm in, but the cognitive dissonance is strong with me. "I'll lose my weight soon.", "I won't have to get healthy for another 10+ years".  As you can see that is a horrible loop to be stuck in. Something else happened. A few months ago I was reading a 50 year study done on the mortality rate of smoking cessation. I had myself quit smoking back in mid 2013 and was curious as to my chances of dodging a proverbial bullet.  Statistically speak, it turns out I had.  The study showed that the subjects who were heavy smokers in their teens and 20s (I'm 27 and I've been mostly smoking since 16), who quit by 30 lived (on average)  as long as those who never smoked.  What a relief to hear, I kinda knew instinctively that was the case but it was a good little pick me up. But then the realisation came crashing down.  "Awesome! I'm likely to reach 80 due to quitting. **Wait, no I'm fucking not. I'm not going to reach 50 the way I'm living**"  I put the booze down, cut down what I ate, became more active and I've been losing weight ever since. Fuck you complacency, I'm in charge now. I'm using my ingrained stubbornness against my own vices. I don't know why this time is different than every other time, but it fucking is.     Hey guys,  I know for a lot of newer people (and some veterans) getting motivated is such a hard thing to do. Most of the time the motivation comes far too late in a persons life. To those who are struggling, I would highly recommend watching [Fed Up](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fed_Up_(film)), it is a documentary which came out last year about the effects of the sugar industry in the world and the impact of obesity in any society.  It goes into great detail about daily diet and processed food, it also covers the history behind the way lots of laws are currently set up. This documentary is currently available on Netflix, I hope it gives you all a push to realise what the right thing to do is.  The truth of the matter is frightening, it's important that we all know it.    While it's obvious which will be ranked the worst (god damn it, Jai Courtney. You were so good in Spartacus -.-), I'm genuinly curious as to how others view the other movies by comparison.   I would rank them (using shorthand for the movie titles):  **1) Die Hard 1**  **2) Die Hard 3**  **3) Die Hard 4**  **4) Die Hard 2**  **5) Die Hard 5**  I honestly don't get a lot of the hate I see for Die Hard 4, it was a clear winner over the second one and in my opinion it's close behind Die Hard 3. I liked the fish out of water situation of McLane being thrown into a plot concerning cyber terrorism and I think Justin Long was a good foil for Willis.   What is your order? Please, **PLEASE** don't just downvote people you disagree with, it runs rampant in this subreddit. Downvoting should **only** be done when someone adds nothing to the discussion.   Hey guys,   I had the chance to rewatch Mel Gibson's film Apocalypto recently and it reminded me of how good of a film maker Gibson can be. What a movie. The characters, the setting, the intrigue and the action were all amazing. I was then shocked to see how it was critically received, 65% on RT is a great injustice to the quality of the film. It's a curious reaction from critics since 2006 was the year of the majority of the controversy which Mel Gibson was involved with.  To add to this, the movie garnered big support from the film industry.    [Actor Robert Duvall called it "maybe the best movie I've seen in 25 years". Director Quentin Tarantino said, "I think it's a masterpiece. It was perhaps the best film of that year. I think it was the best artistic film of that year." Actor Edward James Olmos said, "I was totally caught off guard. It's arguably the best movie I've seen in years. I was blown away." In 2013, director Spike Lee put the film on his list of all-time essential films.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apocalypto#Critical_response)  So what did you think of the movie? Did you feel it was overrated or underrated? Were Mel Gibson's personal troubles part of the reason for such a luke warm reception?   Hey guys,  So last month I had a bucks and I'd been off booze and had been eating healthy for the past 6 weeks. But, come on, its my best mates bucks party. I'm going to celebrate the shit outta that and I most certainly did.  I had some guilt the following day until I actually read the report of my daily activity from my fitbit. [Holy shit did it tell a story](http://i.imgur.com/0JPbTxT.png). I had not realised how active we were. The fact that we were up at 9am till 3am with all sorts of activities during the day countered quite a bit of the unhealthy consumption that accompanied it.   Either way, have a cheat once and a while people! It helps maintain your sanity!    I've read a few studies about the effects of sleep on weight loss and a common finding was that those who had solid sleep were capable of losing more than those who didn't sleep well.  How much sleep do you guys get and how do you think it's affected your weight loss?  Edit: I currently get between 6-7 hours sleep per night, but I'm starting to think that isn't enough lol. I'm not overly tired and I know that the 6-7 hours I get are solid      Story time!  I've been struggling with my weight most of my adult life, it became worst during my early 20s. I loved beer, loved food, loved smoking and hated exercise. A recipe for disaster indeed. 2 months ago I had enough. It wasn't a depression thing, I had become *comfortable* with my weight and I had been overall happy irrespective of it. That comfort with being a fat person lead me to just not care anymore about my weight.   This led to a sort of apathy towards my romantic life and my weight. I didn't care how much I drank or how much I ate. That all changed 2 months ago. Several small events lead me to start. I stopped drinking, cut my portions dramatically and started exercising. I did plenty of research. /r/loseit, /r/progresspics and /r/fitness really helped. **Shoutout to you sexy mother fuckers**. I'm on an 1800-2000 cal budget and I walk 3-4 times a week 30-45 mins. I'm really looking forward to losing more weight, I can't wait to start jogging.  So here we are. 2 months in and 24 pounds down. This isn't a diet. This is a permanent fix to my broken world. I would like to thank everyone for posting as you have been, it really helps.  It may not show, but there is some serious progress in these pictures. I'll post again in a little bit. Enjoy  [**27m 5"10 SW: 285, CW: 261 GW: 220, 24lbs lost**](http://i.imgur.com/SsNNEjr.jpg)         Hey guys,  I'm at week 7 (yay!) since I started my journey and it seems that my weekly weigh ins vary all over the place. I weigh myself every Monday morning at 6:15am naked, after I go to the bathroom. SW: 284.9 5"10 27 y/o male. I'm on a 1800-2000 diet, for the first 5 weeks I was walking 30-40 mins each day (less now because autumn is cold as shit). My diet has not changed.  Here are the results:  - Week 0: 284.9 lbs (first weigh in)  - Week 1: 281.6 lbs **3.3 lbs loss**  - Week 2: 277.2 lbs **4.4 lbs loss**  - Week 3: 274.1 lbs **3.1 lbs loss**  - Week 4: 267.7 lbs **6.4 lbs loss**  - Week 5: 267.7 lbs **0 lbs loss**  - Week 6: 265.3 lbs **2.4 lbs loss**  - Week 7: 264.4 lbs **0.9 lbs loss**  So as you can see there is quite a variation between each week. Obviously, early on I was shedding lots of water weight. Has anyone else experienced losses like this?  I'm going to start going walking again tonight, hopefully it isn't as cold as it has been .             Hey guys,  I know that its not possible to burn fat from specific areas, but is it known the order of which the body burns from?   Hey guys,  There were many reasons for my decision to get my arse into gear and lose this weight. One of the more tangible ones occurred a week or so before I started. I went to kmart to get some miscellaneous items and thought to myself "Oh, I need a new belt too, my old one broke.". So being in a hurry, I quickly grabbed the largest sized belt I could and bought everything.  When I got home I tried to wear it, but I was shocked to see that I couldn't even get the ends of the belt to reach around me. What a fucking downer, especially since in my haste I didn't keep the receipt. Its been almost 6 weeks since that day and I've been working my arse off to undo all of the years since.  Today I found that belt (which I thought I threw out) and decided to try to put it on.  I'm on the **Second. Fucking. Notch.** Fuck yeah, what an excellent piece of validation. It's go time bitches.   Also, as of this morning I hit my 20 lbs mark. Flair-eon I choose you.   Hey guys,  Last week I bought a Fitbit Charger HR, I've been happy with the helpful statistics and the rather robust app. It even has a good calorie counting portion of the app :)  For example, yesterday (a normal 'sedentary' work day) with a 30 minute walk stacked up 7800~ steps and I burned 3762 total calories. So with my standard 1800 calorie died, thats one mother fucker of a deficit. And that wasn't even a standard work out. I burned 2 times as many calroies during Sundays workout (which was more typical), which would've pushed me well over 4000 calories burned for the day.  Has anyone else had some interested results from their Fitbit?      Hey guys,  This morning was the week 5 weigh in and I was surprised to see that today my weight had not changed. Literally zero gain or loss. Since I'm a heavy lurker around here, I'm very much aware of how plateaus can occur and not to freak out and revert to my old habits. All I can do is keep to my new habits by eating correct and exercising and wait for the plateau to break.  How quickly did you hit a stall in your loss? How did you overcome it? How long did it take?  **Edit: Ok, so maybe its too soon for me to call my week without gain a 'plateau'. Lets discuss my questions then :)**     Hey guys,  For years I've been doing this, I'll have a big dinner(5-6pm) then not eat again till lunch the next day with nearly zero snacking, this being the 18-20 hour fasting strategy. This was for no reason other than laziness and not normally feeling hungry in the mornings. Then after some googling, I discovered that this 'intermittent fasting' is a legitimate technique for weight loss and appetite management.  Since I've started my weight loss journey I've been following this self taught system and it seems to be working wonders. I do get hungry at around 10-11pm but I'm a stubborn bastard and I won't let it get the better of me.   What are you experiences/opinions of intermittent fasting?      What a last week it has been! I started with my first weigh in on Monday 9th March at **284.9**. I cut out beer, halved my portions and started walking everyday. In the first week I was not sure if my diet was working at all. I (stupidly) was weighing myself every day and with no change at the 5th day I was convinced that I'd not calculated my caloric deficit correctly, then...  **WHOOSH**  - *Monday 16th March* came, the weigh in, **281.6**. I lost a little bit under 3 pounds in the first week. Which gave me more motivation than anything. What a damn feeling. I kept going on with this diet and exercise plan, everyday feeling better than the last. Here are the weigh ins.  - *Monday 23rd March*, **277.2**. I lost even more this week (4.4 pounds), mostly water weight I'm sure.  - *Monday 30th March*, **274.1**. Lost 3.1 pounds, slowing down a little bit. I thought *ok, water weight gone. It's been 3 weeks, time to slow down surely.*  **FUCKING WHOOSH**  - *Monday 6th April*, **267.7**.  Lost **6.4** pounds, thats 17.2 pounds in a month! I had to weigh myself 5-6 times I couldn't believe it. I'll be putting up progress pics in a month or so once it starts to show better :)  Thank you all at /r/loseit and /r/progresspics, helped me get motivated so well. You guys rock.      Post away guys, I want to hear all of your favourite NSVs, I know everyone has several that shocked them.  I know I'm only just starting my journey, but I've noticed several things. I'm not sweating as bad during the day during normal activities, I have energy I've not had in years and I've not slept this fully in the longest of times (may have had sleep apnea)   As of this morning I weighed in at 274.3, thats 10 pounds in 3 weeks. Almost 5kgs, after never having really tried to lose weight in the past I had no idea how quickly it could be done.  I walk everyday but I know confidently that the main source of this has been my control of my portions and cutting beer out of the equation. Thanks to this subreddit as well as /r/fitness and /r/progresspics. Motivation was very easy to gain from these subreddits.  Don't think I wont keep you guys updated. As an additional NSV, I'm now able to pinch the top layer of skin off my gut, I can actually feel my body breaking down the fat and my skin loosening. Good times ensue.            I don't actually have a team I want to win! I know that sounds weird but since both will be awesome competition in the finals, I have no horse in this race.  This means that I can just sit back and enjoy the game! What a corker its going to be :)   ...Makes me nauseous. I know I've only just started my journey but with the boys bringing lots of fast food over to my place on the weekend, the smell and look of it made me feel sick. Its a good thing, I have zero cravings for it. A nice juicy steak with fresh salad and some mustard... Oh sweet jesus, now thats a fucking meal.   Its so hard to imagine that I could burn away something as tangible as a whole brick worth of weight in 2 weeks.  Yikes this is going to be a fun bunch of months.  Edit: For the sake of context. SW:285 GW: 220, 27 y/o 5"11 male  There is no secret to my regime. I quit drinking (I used to drink **a lot** of beer), halved my portions, drink only water (save for a coffee here and there), stopped eating take out and aside from a cheat day my diet has not really changed (meaning same similar foods, just less). I also walk 4kms per day. I use RuntasticPro to keep track of my exercise. [Here are the basic stats from the last 15 days](http://i.imgur.com/CeRa1FR.png)      Australia vs Pakistan at Adelaide oval! What a quarterfinal this will be!  Are we going to see some Starc magic? A massive Warner/Finch opening? Perhaps a historic batting appearance for Smith (praise be to him)?  Whose going to be man of the match? Bat or field first?  TAKING A HALF DAY OFF WORK TO WATCH THE GAME AT HOME WITH THE BOYS, WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!         Hey so ive just started my weight loss effort, im a 27 yo male, sw 285 gw 220, 5"11. Weeks ago I initially started by cutting back on beer, then cut my portions down. Then i started walking 4kms a day, stopped drinking beer, started drinking lots of water and added more fruits and vegis. Its been a week since my first weigh in and.. ive lost 3.3 pounds. Way more than i expected since my diet has been kind off the cuff guessing as far as calories goes. im certainly not under eating, though i do get some hunger, nothing which isnt manageable.  I was just wondering if this ammount of loss is typical for someone my size whose just started? Should i tweek my diet to have more calories? My intention was to avoid the loose skin problem by loosing weigh in a more paitent manner.  That being said, i feel great!   Hey guys,  Its a concern for all of us who are hoping to lose that weight, I've read up and down about how you pretty much can't do anything about the majority of the loose skin. You can stay well hydrated and exfoliate. But aside from age, gender or genetic factors, you're going to experience loose skin.  I've just started my journey and I was after some clarification as to what is a good rate of loss to best counter loose skin.  I'm a 27 y/o male, 5"11 285lbs. Target weight of 210 lbs.  Bonus points if anyone similar size to me has an experience to share on the subject :)  Edit: I should add that this issue isn't going to stop me from losing my weight, no way.            Hello friends,  I've been doing some research into my own diet and exercise regime. One of things I've calculated is my BMR (base metabolic rate), its around 2300 kcal. Further investigation showed that since thats the BASE rate, I needed to factor in activity levels. So with the daily exercise I've been doing (45 minutes of 6 kmph walking), that metabolic rate jumps up to around 3900 kcal. Does that mean that on a 2500 kcal diet I'd be burning around 1400 kcal per day just from my diet plus what ever I burn from the actual exercise?  This is all very new to me, be gentle.  Edit: Those numbers were estimates off memory. But for contexts sake ill give you some info (im a metric system person so these should be right :P). I'm 27, male, 5"11, 285lb and I'm not sure on body fat %, havn't measured it.   Question in the title, what show baffles you as to why its so popular.     What a game. Seriously what a fucking game. I knew going into Sunday that Sri Lanka would put up a fight, but this was an amazing one.  After a very strong batting performance by us, I was convinced it would be a strong win. 376 is a safe score? Right?  Almost wrong, you guys really showed heart out there. I have to agree with Pup there, I wasn't convinced in our win until the last wicket went down. The highs and lows of that game was doing some serious work on my blood pressure, at least until Englands game yesterday #lolengland  This is truly an amazing time for cricket and I look forward to our probable face off again in the qualifiers :D  	120
    Oh, you   One of my favorite tony twist moments, I dont remember the year but Its opening game of the season. The Blues win 1 zip over the Sabers on the strength of goal that goes in off of Tony Twists skate.  Post game interview Tony gets asked, how does it feel to be the top scorer on the team? Youre on a pace to score 82 goals!     Keenan. Not a player i know but... Fuck Keenan.    http://i.imgur.com/Rc2uK.gif   they're delicious.      I don't know if i would say it's better in terms of pure production but it's up there and it's certainly a more complete overall record.   Dunno if you've checked out the new Killer Mike record but in my mind it's probably the best work that El-P has ever done.   Factory 81   I wouldn't hold my breath for later this year but Del and Dan the Automator do release updates from time to time. They are working on it.

I see it as a cultural construct; a place to put the others who dont belong.  Hell was invented by people who were very sure they were not going there.  Unless you're willing to accept double predestination I don't think you can reconcile the christian concept of grace with the existence of hell. The Biblical support for the idea of hell is dicey at best.   City Museum. http://citymuseum.org  	31
 NPR interviewed Jules Feiffer yesterday and he said the following:   "Well, I've had endless acts because I ran out of steam on one thing, because life happened on another thing, and I developed a resourcefulness ... where I would just look around for some other way to do what I wanted to do. If it happens too fast, you don't build these, what I used to call these "rejection deltoids," where you are so used to being hit in the face that you just get up again automatically. The kids who were successful in high school from the beginning didn't know how to do that. So they would take a couple of slaps and they'd go into their father's business."  We all need to learn to cope when life slaps us around.   I'm annoyed by trigger warnings, spoiler alerts, helicopter parenting, etc. but I take issue with blaming all of this on the left. I think this has more to do with changes in parenting technique than politics.   Same here.   That is some seriously ugly camo.   Actually, to get plates and registration he has to go to the county tax office. Bigger counties do have some satellite offices so don't have to go downtown, but the ones here in Harris County still are slow and crowded.   I believe gangrene and frostbite go together.   Very different from the other episodes - all things said I enjoyed it.   I was afraid there would be no Simcoe in this episode, glad I was wrong.   Did not expect self amputation.   I'm so used to him the wig on Turn, looks so different.   He played Karl Tanner from Gin Alley.   It's a bit weird to watch.   Jailhouse snitch, an old tradition.   I remember hearing or reading that AMC limited how often "shit" could be used in its shows.   That was an odd open.   Just the yelling names aspect, combined with the Middle East conversation above it just triggered my memory of that tweet.   You reminded me of this old tweet https://mobile.twitter.com/lsal92/status/247763296541896705   It actually made me think of Ren   Stimpy.   I remember the old days of sitting outside the Continental lounge using its WiFi, thankfully those days are over.   I have neighbors with a little dog that likes to yap a lot, thankfully my bedroom is on the opposite side of the house so it hasn't disturbed my sleep - good luck with your neighbor.   A little after I posted that question I saw this over in /r/protectandserve http://m.imgur.com/gallery/8NtwT5t   Have you looked into assistance from the state's Veterans Land Board, not sure if they do urban or suburban stuff, might be worth checking out.    Corporate took the franchise away today.    That a Game Warden truck?   Up in Ontario back in 2006, members of the Bandidos killed a bunch of their own members, the Shedden Massacre.   I think in Wisconsin only the county coroner, elected position there, can arrest a Sheriff.   This guy had three warrants out for him.   I'd love to see him in a deposition.   I can't remember where I heard or read it, but Judge and the writers love killing the dreams of the Pied Piper team.   It's interesting how quiet Apple managed to keep it about the horrible batteries in the initial iPhone 5 models that were sold.   That area of Louisiana that Season 1 was set in is seriously spooky.   Can we bring back Northern Exposure?   Shocked to see Pete in this episode, oh Sally - heart just broke   Glad you are okay   Win the NBA championship    Will premier on January 24th!   Way after my time there, feeling old now.   Rockets winning in playoffs, Astros above 500, X Files reboot, feels like the 1990s again.   Damn you MW for making me hate Pete Campbell and then making him one of my favorite characters, damn you MW.   Sons of Anarchy: Waco   The women getting all excited by Don fixing the sink, one of my favorite scenes.   All the national press set up shop at Sonny's, the all nude BYOB strip club during the siege. I did see FBI Crown Vics driving up to Waco a lot when I made trips home to Houston.   I attended Baylor during the siege, such a weird time. Glad you are safe.   I tip my hat to you sir or madam as the case might be.   Have to admit, rather shocked how sad I am that this show ends tonight.   Was on Saturday morning, have to admit that Signal 30 is one of my favorite Mad Men episodes. So much packed into that episode. Also, for some reason, I really like TV episodes directed by actors. Slattery kept that episode tight. As an aside recommend the "Walter Taffet" episode of The Americans, superbly directed by Noah Emmerich.   SE Texas here.   sorry   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LCRZZC-DH7M   Might be covered by other articles, but other articles suck compared to the New York Times.   Army  Marines, but I know you disagree   So policing a jurisdiction where everyone is a government trained killer is no big deal?   Is it?   The above is totally wrong, this a documentary about a group of people who live in northern India.   I switch to soccer shorts   a tank top when I get home.   That was a sweet ending.   Well, he didn't get appointed to the position, so it'll be a little bit harder for him to get elected.   Not surprising that it's FBI related, though when I heard the name I was actually hoping it might center around [Army CID.](http://www.cid.army.mil/701st.html)   That seems a bit extreme for a show that doesn't get better ratings than AMC's The Walking Dead or Breaking Bad.   For the sake of the residents, I hope Kim Jong Un never visits a nursing home.   The League of Women Voters will have a good voter's guide, closer to election time - http://lwvhouston.org   Institutional and historical segregation - segregation along socio-economic lines and racial lines.   Rocky Horror Picture Show   Nope.   I enjoy driving, I like getting behind the wheel   hitting the road.   To me, turning Houston into Austin sounds like a big step backward (I've lived in both cities, I prefer Houston).   I would never consider a self-driving car.   I'm gonna go old school here - Roots.   That was a good mini-series, really enjoyed it.   And he's an Astros fan, nice.   It's not making me hate George Washington, so much as reminding me that he was only human, he was imperfect, despite what our history books might of said back in elementary school.   I'm enjoying the presence of NYCFC in MLS, it's fun watching RedBull and Revolution fans acting like MLS pissed in their collective Cheerios.    For two unmarried persons to kiss like that in public, not socially acceptable back in the 1700s.   I thought this was the first boat she received.    Andre and Shippen are kind of making me feel sorry for Benedict Arnold, didn't think that was possible.   I suspect it'll be a bit like this place: http://creationmuseum.org   I think so too, next week we'll get Peggy's last scene, makes sense that they save her for the finale.

I think a lot of people in Texas already pick football over church.   Texas Bucket List is from McAuliffe Productions in College Station, while Texas Country Reporter appears to be produced directly by Bob Phillips.   I remember [The Eyes of Texas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKmtby53fT4) from when I was a kid.   I used to love browsing in that Bookstop, and of course visiting Whole Earth and Cactus while I was over there. Used to be one of the great little classic shopping strips in Houston.   Looks like it's 15 minutes longer.   Don does not have a great history with motels.   That drummer is so bored.   Then he's going to pawn it in Vegas.   Looks like Don was watching Redd Foxx making an appearance on The Flip Wilson Show http://youtu.be/lm6fLKz5ByU   Not the kind of pool I expected.   MW hates us.   I'm very disappointed    I'm very disappointed.   It did. It was kind of one of the first CDs to get away from the plastic H form.   I actually love Barry's Pizza. My family has been going there since it was Eddie's Pizza located on Richmond   Sage where the Chipotle is now.   I heard this song at a recital when I was at Baylor back in the early 1990s, it immediately made me a fan of Hovhaness.   There are at least 5 in that picture. Not 100% sure what happened, but I got the impression it was an assault on an officer incident.   Dude . . .    Totally understandable - I kept the cats when I got divorced, was helpful that she defaulted and never filed an answer to my petition for divorce - so I pretty much got anything I wanted.   Ouch   Whenever I have had a family member do that, they usually have a babysitter available at or near the wedding location. Not an issue for me, but is helpful for lots of the other cousins who do have kids.   That's an acceptable question in Mississippi.   Just wanted to say I really enjoy the show. As someone who has always had an interest in the history of Colonial America and the Revolution it's been frustrating how little play the Revolution has had in popular culture. I know at one point, there were more movies about the French and Indian War than about the Revolution - I guess the turn (no pun intended) came with Mel Gibson's Patriot. Now, in the Fall I have Sleepy Hollow and it's fun with the Revolution and then in the Spring I get the more serious, but still entertaining, Turn.   I hate Simcoe, but I love his scenes in the show.   Contact your local legal aid office, there is a slight possibility that what your parents did might technically be an illegal eviction. Even if that is not the case, legally you should be able to retrieve your property (not allowing you to do so might constitute illegal conversion of your property).   I took the Wisconsin bar exam and practiced law there for 4 years before moving back to Texas and taking the bar here. Biggest takeaway is how useless the bar exam is and how it's made more difficult just cause of a pissing war with BarBri.   Sure you do Daesh, sure you do.   Just another Spring day up in Montgomery County.   Hopefully the Sheriff's Department can track down the driver of the other vehicle, that way, even if you have to go through your insurance company to get your vehicle fixed, your insurance company will go after her insurance and will refund your deductible.   Orthopedic surgeons = doctors with Craftsman tools.   And that will probably increase the more we get to know McCann people.   That only works for politicians in South Dakota.   Worth listening to also, if just to hear Willie talk.   I remember all the Lite commercials featuring retired athletes from when I was a kid. And this storyline is another reason for Miller to keep using the throwback cans and labels for Lite.   Good point.   That scene was great, so trippy.   I'm having trouble believing that Daesh had any knowledge of this incident till they heard/read about it in the news.   I'm going to venture a guess that Daesh is taking advantage of the incident after the fact, I doubt it had any prior knowledge.   A couple Tuesdays back I didn't have any project to work on at the office and the weather was great, so, after hitting a bit of the MFAH, I figured I'd go to the Zoo. The parking lot was a cluster and it wasn't even 11:00 am yet.   Lebanon, on the whole, has always been a bit different from the rest of the Middle East.   Condolences.   You mean "escort" activity, nudge nudge, wink wink.   The fact that Howard wants, needs a limo just highlights the depth of his insecurities. Most people in NYC in Howard's tax bracket do not use limos, instead they get driven around in high end sedans and SUVs. But does Howard want a really nice Mercedes? No, he needs to have a limo.   Thanks, I'll check it out.   Sigh   More like: Crazy people meet crazy people.   The other week I was down by the police parking lots off of Washington and noticed a couple black ghost vehicles.   Not sure why this is posted here, but it is a good song.   This is more the Dallas suburbs leading the way than it is Texas leading the way.   http://youtu.be/Lsuosv_Bq5A   Don has no fucks left to give.   Roger on organ, Peggy on roller skates - is this Mad Men or Twin Peaks?   "The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife (the 'octopus pleasuring a woman' woodcut) is from Japanese 19th-cent erotica by Hokusai."   Kick some McCann ass Joan!   Don's visit to Racine reminds me of a book title: Wisconsin Death Trip.   Classic corporate America.   Worst impression ever.   Everybody's gotta die inside sometime.   So Cooper was into anime before it was cool.   In fairness, Betty thinks all other women (and most other people) are morons.   Don knows what he likes and won't change just to be with the "times," e.g. his hair, his clothes, his car...   Glenn aspires to be Travis Bickle.   Yep http://youtu.be/D00Hi8DoO5c   I will say this about Pete, when it comes to work, he's extremely loyal to Don, Peggy, and Joan.   McCann just oozes sleaze.   And amused.   Don is realizing he's no longer the only pretty girl at the dance.   I miss Julio.   Dragons = Secretaries?   Yeah, Grown Ups 2 is still in its premium cable cycle.   Peggy is a McCloud fan http://youtu.be/D00Hi8DoO5c   The birth of Miller Lite http://youtu.be/DPh4iF76LbU   Meredith is being the mom Don always wished he had.   http://houston.culturemap.com/news/city-life/08-02-12-10-17-high-speed-smart-car-chase-ends-in-houston-mans-driveway/   I read that there is going to be a new printing of his cookbook.   Every year summer when I was in Scouts it seemed I'd find a new magazine in the woods at El Rancho Cima up in the Hill Country.   Or dance, or eat stinky food, or sing along (badly) to the song on their earbuds, or a multitude of other things   SMH   Plan B - Houston is worth visiting.   I tend to find "On Being" rather hit or miss, but this weekend's episode was really interesting. Since it tends to air early on most stations, I figured I'd post a link here.   Based on the picture, that does appear to be a valid European Union license plate issued in Germany (The D stands for Deutschland). Odd are, the owner is in the military and was stationed in Germany, bought it there, and had it shipped back to the US when transferred.   So for all those people who want to totally delete their Facebook accounts but are having trouble doing so . . . . /s   I think my mom still has these glasses stored away somewhere in her house.   It's a Texas thing. If I had to explain, you wouldn't understand.   At least with this group, when the munchies hit Droubi Brothers might benefit.   Probably easier to get a permit for downtown on weekends. Where was the parade yesterday?

So glad that they are rebooting X-Files, came out when I was in college, so good memories.   I was thinking of this http://bizbeatblog.dallasnews.com/2015/04/health-inspectors-found-crickets-mildew-at-blue-bell-plant-report.html/   Damn, that brings back memories, was in high school at the time and this incident was highlighted as a warning story at spring break time for several subsequent years.   I'm glad they aren't laying anyone off, but maybe they should considering whatever managers failed to maintain proper sanitary conditions in the plants.   Agree, when it returns to the shelves it will sell like hotcakes.   Well, it is a documentary produced by and for Netflix, which, in this era, is television.   Is crack really still a common thing? Has the term "crackhead" become a catchall phrase to describe someone who is freaking out on drugs (or freaking out because they are crazy and aren't on their meds)?   Obviously, games that take place during the work week (before school is out) will have smaller attendance giving you more chance to upgrade.   [Was this your problem last night?](http://www.click2houston.com/news/wreck-involving-18wheeler-closes-eastbound-lanes-of-290-at-eldridge-parkway/32742200)  Sounds like 290 at Eldridge will be a construction cluster all weekend too.   Parking scams during events seem to be a thing lately. I've heard several parking scams stories related on sports radio from people who were going to Rockets/Astros games.   Poor little thing, glad he's getting help.   So Louie is the only guy who still uses a Blackberry.   1 unit = 1 drilling rig   Honestly, my recommendation is, if at all possible, cookout at home, pull the grill out and throw some meat on it. The three worst days of the year to eat out are NYE, Valentine's Day, and Mother's Day.   Just seeing the picture of those people on those manuals brings back so many memories.   Have you contacted any museums or historical societies in the area? Or possibly contact the [New Jersey Historical Society] (http://www.jerseyhistory.org/), they might be willing to take it, and handling the transport etc.   Too often when I hear gunshoots in my area of Alief, I have no idea where they are coming from. Sunday morning I heard what sounded like gunshots while walking on my own street. All I could tell was they came from the north of my location. As to what street, block, etc. . . no idea.   da fuh?

I feel like I've actually seen it aired in recent years, but can't be certain of that.   But he only has to pay them in the Philippine peso.   I love Stand By Me, but I really love Spanish Harlem - I can close my eyes while listening to that song and be transported to 1960s New York City.   Sigh   One Christmas, my Uncle and his family came to visit and he brought his new Intellivision with them. My parents had already purchased the Atari to be a family Christmas gift, but once they saw the graphics of the Intellivision, they returned the Atari and bout the Sears branded Intellivision. Great decision, loved playing that thing as a kid.   While doing research for his novel Lush Life, Richard Price did a ride along in one of these NYPD taxis in the LES and talked about it for The Moth: http://youtu.be/S6LCSGv1gA4   The only vehicles that NYC resident pedestrians ever seem to yield to are fire trucks and ambulances.   It's a penthouse in Gramercy Park, that's the basis for the bulk of that price. And the NYC real estate market is insane thanks to foreign investors.   I saw the same in Italy, and not just marked cars.  	199
    [How I imagine OP](http://imgur.com/vMIv2gj)             In a 1986 paper, Brindley injected 17 different drugs into his own penis and measured the effects.

One of the most radical and abrupt shifts in healthcare policy ever enacted.    An ISIS spokesman, Omar al-Qahtani, confirmed that Mr Fares had been injured and, thinking he had been captured by members of a Shia militia against which he was fighting, asked them to kill him in terms misunderstood by the ISIS members in fact taking him to hospital.   Am I the only one having trouble understanding what this paragraph is saying? The guy thought he had been captured by enemies, and so asked them to kill him?    Fun facts: oranges (the fruits) are called literally "Apples from China" in Eastern European languages and "Portugals" in Greek and Middle Eastern languages ([source](http://mapsontheweb.zoom-maps.com/image/66276524834)) and I'm pretty sure that most of them call the color orange the same, and for the same reason.  edit: very surprising amount of downvotes - I'm sorry, just wanted to start a discussion on the world's different words for orange, both the fruit and the color.

A tennis court is [10.97 m wide and 2 times 11.89 m long](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_court), so has an area of 261 square meters. To get to 9261 cubic meters the tennis court would need to be filled to a depth of 9251 / 261 = 35.48 **meters**. Ahah! the old metric vs. imperial mistake strikes again.

Interestingly, these plants still possess a chloroplast genome, which has been sequenced. Since chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis, you would think that in this species, which has literally never seen the light of day, the chloroplast genome would have been lost over time. However, Rhizanthalla still retains a tiny number (37) of genes in its plastid genome, suggesting that chloroplasts have functions beyond that of photosynthesis.

Ever.   at DPR's request, redandwhite send DPR a picture of the victim after the job was done, with random numbers written on a piece of paper next to the victim that DPR had supplied. On April 5, 2013, DPR wrote redandwhite "I've received the picture and deleted it. Thank you again for your swift action."   It's in the [criminal complaint](http://www.scribd.com/doc/172768269/Ulbricht-Criminal-Complaint). WTF indeed.   So is the website for the [National Science Foundation](http://www.nsf.gov/). The [NCBI](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), whose website is used daily by life scientists around the world, has a red banner up saying that information on it may not be up to date.         Out of interest, here is Willem de Kooning's ["A tree in Naples"](http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=80116) which is mentioned in the article. I wish there was a picture of the 4 year old's painting!      Also good is their "Is this written in Oracle bone script?". Have to start using that one at work.   Now this is a TIL! Thankyou OP. If only they had these "docking structures" more useful   The paper they are referring to was published in 2010 and has been cited [only one time](http://scholar.google.ca/scholar?cites=3836192125356317566 as_sdt=2005 sciodt=0,5 hl=en). Not saying it isn't interesting, but this hasn't looked to have gained much traction since then.

Worst case linked list search is O(n) time, but uses no resources, and fixing pointers is O(1) time with what, 2 writes?   Meanwhile, copying and writing to a new array is what, 2n - 1 read/write operations? This is way more expensive in terms of resources.   So, I'm not sure what is going on here but consider this.      output_greaterequal-first-next = pointer;     temp =output_greaterequal-first-next;     temp-next=NULL;  So imagine this is not the first element being put in your list. It is over the threshold, and there is already something in the list. You set the next element of the list to be the pointer so you could have had this to begin with:  First-A-B-C-NULL   or something like that. This means first-next is A. But now, you set first-next to pointer (P). So, now your list looks like this.  First-P  and then temp is also set to P, and then it looks like this.  Temp = P-NULL  and now the value is NULL so we break out but your list was messed up in the process it seems?    I'm not totally sure what you are trying to do but if you are trying to compare digits of numbers you can use % to get specific digits right, since modular arithmetic would get rid of the rest of the number?   ex. 13 % 10 = 3  To get the 10's digit would be a bit different,  134 for example would be (134 % 100) / 10 134 % 100 is 34, and 34 / 10 is 3.   	4
 I would like some opionions on this new series...I`m conflicted about watching it...Any comments?      1) The Sopranos (it`a an absolute must) 2) Game of Thrones 3) The Big Bang Theory 4) Two and a Half Men (no Ashton seasons, only the Charlie Sheen ones) 5) How I met Your Mother (`though the last season is kinda dissapointing)   Ok, if you haven`t noticed, I`m a few days old on reddit so...I haven`t had the time to read all the things that have been written on this matter....    Money beats being selective any day...I know, they don`t need it..but still, the rich will always want to be richer...   Finally! Someone who had the guts to say it! I applaude your courage! I`m with you on this matter....I like Sandy but this movie kinda ruined her as an actress for me...over hyped!      I actually start to care about Christie and Alaks story this season. Last season they were more part of their parents story but they really are coming into their on in this season.   Thanks a lot!   I hope there is...I am kinda sick of all this drama with them two...let it be over with and let the show `come back to normal` like in the first 2 seasons!!!   Seriously? that`s too much though!!   ooo...ok, i`m so sorry, i did not know about that! i`ll never do it again!!! sorry!!   Yep...apparently...      :))  	15
 planning on doing beef and cheddar next, cheers man, thanks!   this was a natural hog casing, I bought a small tub if it from a local butcher, comes packed in salt, all I had to do was soak it for about 15 minutes and then run water through it, it's very resilient!   very nice actually, big difference was texture and how much better it was to store bought sausage  	3

Sure, he's popped back from time to time, every now and then, but as we all know, playing the tourist and actually living in Hawaii are two different things.  Life being what it is, my *friend* will be moving back to Oahu (not 100% official, but he's 80% of the way there, he's paddling his ass off and can see the Islands on the horizon!) and he'd like to know:  "If you left Hawaii in say, 2005, and came back today, what do you thing has changed the most about life in Hawaii?"                                                  	115
 I think I was originally thinking more along the lines of naturally occurring portals, I guess almost like rifts? I don't know why I didn't just think of movement as being a factor.      I wasn't really thinking telepathy. To me, telepathy is like mind-reading or speaking mind to mind. I was thinking of a certain percentage of people being able to see higher level vibrations, which is where the other dimension would be located. Right on top of our own dimension, but vibrating at a higher frequency than our own. So these people that have this ability would be able to pass between the dimensions, and certain points, or portals, would be easier to pass through. The more people in an area that have this ability could change the properties of the portal points to where they begin transporting living or moving things between worlds. I was also thinking that people without the ability to see these higher frequencies wouldn't have been able to see the dragon, for example, only the fire that it created perhaps.      I wanted the other dimension to be different. How we rely on technology for things like communication or weapons for example, would be different on their side. They would be able to interact differently with elements in their world. So their rods could be of a special metal that allowed them to bend natural magnetic fields (or something along those lines) to form a sort of shield, or even containment field. They wouldn't be able to do this without those rods. The way they lived would seem almost simple to someone from our world because they wouldn't need the same technology that we do to accomplish things. That sounds vague, I know, I just haven't thought it all the way through yet.    I agree that I need to do better with the showing more than telling. Work has decided that its going to deny that link so I'll check it out when I get home. It definitely isn't my goal to make humans seem barbaric in the least, just that the visitors treat them that way.      I don't want the Centauri people to be more defined until later in the story, I was thinking of purposefully only showing one kind of people from their world so the humans view of them would be sort of warped until a later time. So what they would be seeing was a militant group of individual and wrongly assume that the entire population of the dimension was aggressive, abrasive or snobbish.      I'm not sure I want them to be biologically human but I'll have to read more about where a good point would be to dissect their evolutionary paths. I do want them to come from the same basic ancestor I believe, but have grown in different ways and abilities.      I have a lot to think about. I wanted these ideas before I continued writing on this piece, figured it would be less rewriting in the end, which I am not a fan of. This is really good.   Thank you.      I actually was thinking of having the dragon wander in from an opening without consciously trying but I don't know if I want inanimate things coming through too, like crashing together. It was my original thought to put more explanation into it that the "will" was simply wanting to be a different place than it already was. Not specifically another dimension. Ill have to rewrite that bit.      I had to google psionics, I wasn't already familiar with the term but it sounds like maybe thats a bit of personal taste. I personally love the idea of what the brain could be capable of with evolutional or manipulation, etc. I do intend to include more tech, but most of the thigs I like to read are more based around what you probably think of as psionics. I will have to branch out and read some more variety to understand how I can best fit technology in with my idea. But I do agree that it would make the story more interesting.      I also want to explore what makes the cultures each feel that they are more superior to one another, what skills make them different, but perhaps that bit just needs to be rewritten as well. I don't feel that either of these cultures are better than the other, but they will be very different, and I personally like exploring cultural conflict. In the end, I want an event that makes them band together in order to save both their people but I don't want them seeing eye to eye at the start and that usually seems to come from people believing they are better than someone else. Exploring where their pathes diverged though would be interesting, being overlapping dimensions I did want a few similarities. Ill have to think more on it.      I definitely appreciate your feedback.   [Google Doc Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GfqKV1fstXCSTVlk5GwbNC4g5Zw6L64Kl2TenSWd_yY/edit?usp=sharing)  Looking for feedback on whether to continue. Does it sound like an interesting read? Is there a specific direction you think would be really interesting for this tidbit to go in? How is my writing?  I've just decided I should let others read some of my writing to get some idea of where I want to go with it. And I didn't know the best place to start getting feedback so this is my first attempt.  I choose a writing prompt to work with daily and I kind of liked where this one was going.    Any helpful comments are welcome! Please also comment here if you comment on the actual document so I know to go look. If there are specific websites you use to get good feedback on your writing, I would appreciate it if you dropped me a comment on that as well. Thank you      **Edit**: I rewrote portions, so the word count is now 564.   The men that held back the crowd were a mixture of army reserve from this world and officers from Centauris dimensional patrol. They were all clearly uncomfortable standing between a mob and a giant lizard, but the men from Centauri looked like they felt far more prepared to handle the situation. These officers held simple metal-like rods that seemed almost nonthreatening next to the armys security shields and guns. I knew they still had every reason to feel complete confidence amongst this worlds inhabitants. They were endowed with mental abilities that most of us could only dream of.    The beast gave a throaty challenge that was more of a deep rumbling moan than a roar as it continued waddling towards the Yellowstone caldera. It had the coloring of light gray ash one would see with the remains of a dead camp fire. Many people from our world called these creatures dragons. I doubted that the people of Centauri identified them with that term but they had never corrected us. To their more refined culture, we were bumbling invaders who were slightly barbaric in nature. With that said, they were not forth-coming about life on the other side of the dimensional veil.      Centauri was not even the true name of their home world, that too was denied to us. Most of Earths leading government officials involved with our new visitors had agreed upon Centauri, being the name of our dimensions closest cluster of stars to the sun, and their dimension being the closest one to ours that we knew of. It almost overlapped our own, and it seemed that anything living on the Centaurian side (with the will to do so) could now pass through the veil. The dragon clearly had had the will to push itself through and now was in a state of confusion.      The men did not allow the crowd to move forward as the dragon relocated away from the commotion we were creating. It lumbered towards an active geyser and stuck its head inside the spray. After adding more deep grumbling noises, it moved its whole body across the opening of the geyser and settled itself down, head resting on massive claws. It belched flame tendrils which caught on a close clump of grass but made no move to evacuate as more of the plant-covered area caught fire. The volume of conversation rose among the crowd as we watched. The patch was too secluded from others to cause much worry, but anxious questions flowed from the watchers. *What else could it do? And where was it going?*   Thank you. I wish I could stick with one idea longer lol   Leaving one world for the next is a thing partly of the mind and a little of placing. A door, as it might be thought of, could be located anywhere. The final part of our ascension comes when we both locate a door and push ourselves through. A door could sit on a beach, in a cave or even in mid-air. A being can access these doors once specific credentials have been met. The credentials can be anything from having specific strands of DNA to surpassing a specific level of spiritual growth. Once the credentials have been met, the correct frame of mind is needed to utilize the door. This state cannot be described, it can only be known and felt by those individuals who possess the traits needed to pass through to a place on the other side.

 Lionheads have a very specific type of personality. They tend to be opinionated and vocal (yes they make funny sounds). They can also be a little nippy. They require more grooming.  Rexes can get sore hocks quite easily if their flooring is not soft enough.   My personal opinion is that source and connection matters more than breed. Rescue rabbits and shelter bunnies need homes - don't buy from a breeder and encourage more rabbit breeding. There are already plenty of buns looking for someone to love. Meet the rabbits and see which one you feel more comfortable with, which one you like and seems interested in you. Don't just buy based on looks.  :)   And remember, the red eyed whites that you always see are the black cats of rabbits. They aren't worse rabbits, quite the opposite. They are typically calm, intelligent, and friendly. They just have less people interested into them because of their "boring" coat color and "creepy" eyes.    Sadly we have multiple litters of rabbits being fostered in our rescue right now. It may be a while before they are all placed :-/   We have a piece of cardboard under the bird cage that catches any poops from when she is hanging on the outside of her cage. When they harden the rabbits like to chew them off the cardboard - pretty sure they aren't actually eating it though.   http://www.amazon.com/Midwest-Black-E-Coat-Exercise-Pen/dp/B000H8YTJI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1375400007 sr=8-1 keywords=xpen     Thanks! I had never had a conure before. I wasn't even looking to get a bird. We volunteer with rabbits at a shelter that doesn't "do" birds and she was in the back. I had never seen a prettier bird! She seemed friendly and curious and I couldn't get her out of my head. I went back a few days later to bring her home :)    Green cheeked. The pretty colors are the yellow-sided mutation. We don't know her sex. We call her a her because we chose Leela as a name.   Most of the time they seem to get along fine. I have seen her peck at him once or twice - we don't leave her out when we aren't in the room with them. Better safe than sorry.    Twelve born. Eleven made it.               For some reason they always behaved best huddled together in the litterbox         Haha, yes!   Awesome. Yeah, we had to bathe our bunnies once because my bf went a little overboard with a "bonding exercise". Someone had suggested rubbing a tiny bit of banana behind the ears to get them to groom each other. The tiny bit must have escaped him because they were sticky and stiff even in to the next day so we decided to clean them up. I wish I had known about these wipes then! We actually just learned about them Tuesday night in our shelter volunteer meeting!   We knew it was bad to bathe the bunnies and I have a pretty funny pic of him blowdrying them. It is true, you post anything saying you bathed your bunny and you are going to get a lot of people telling you not to bathe your bunny! Sometimes it has to happen, but the less we can do it the better.   It is a shame because they look so funny and cute when they come out of the bath - but people really are just looking out for the little guys. Lola is adorable :)   beautiful!   What a great low cost solution      This looks great! Love the bar and red walls too!   WAY TOO CUTE   What a handsome bunny! He is lucky to have a foster home 3   May I recommend: http://www.amazon.com/Earthbath-Natural-Hypo-Allergenic-Fragrance-Free-Grooming/dp/B000WFIVSQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1375305335 sr=8-1 keywords=grooming+wipes  Less stress for the bunny.  Also, rabbits can get hypothermia even if it is not that cold out. They don't dry easily and it is very stressful for them to be wet and to be blowdried.    I am willing to bet you can't ;) Nanas please!   She. Her baby name at the rescue was Pandora 3   Pretty sure. I have done some reading on it and she seems to really enjoy being held like this. I understand that they will also zonk out in this position, but when she struggles a little I don't put her in it. I only do it if she seems to want to be held that way. She purrs while she is like this, too - so that indicates to me that she is enjoying herself and is present.   Her name is Guinevere. We call her Gwen Danzig sometimes :-p   It was all I could do not to adopt this little gal on the spot!   Sounds like I have a new comic to check out!         	32
 PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN!!! (It is beautifully musky, damp, swampy and just altogether Disney!   I have a kiddo that sounds just like this kid ,Cameron. I agree with what everyone has said about positive reinforcement, but all of that can take time.  I would suggest a simple change. Do not ask, tell.  For example, rather than saying " I'd like you to stop talking", say "Cameron, stop talking" or you could put a more positive spin on it and say "Cameron, this is important. You'll want to hear this."  Also, try to have as many of these conversations in private, unless he is shouting out during your instruction.   I drink a good deal of wine the first week as well ;)  	3
 Seth Killian's commentary can be very condescending and smug sometimes. Also dickrides Daigo too much when he's playing (see Evo 2013 Top 8). However, his style is very interesting to hear compared to other commentators since rather than focusing by what's happening in the match, he focuses on the mindset and mentality of players as a whole and on the fly. You can thank his doctorate in philosophy for all of these insights.   Zhi is an enigma. When he's under restraint in a professional environment, he is actually the best commentator when it comes to play-by-play. But 90% of the time, he's on the extreme spectrum of "colour" commentary. He's like a hit-and-miss vesion of Aris when it comes to the anime references/memes/jokes. He's halfway between good and high tier a.k.a his own tier. This is because he has the advantage of knowing the Asia FGC scene better than the US commentators as well as capable of speaking it.  Mike Ross is terrible end of story. But I guess that's his style in terms of being a "hype" man in a WWE way. Both Ultra David and James Chen admit that when they are paired up with him, they sometimes accidentally say stupid shit. That says it all.   Combofiend isn't much better but since he works for Capcom, his play-by-play is slightly better and seems articulate on the mic.  The most frustrating thing about James Chen is that he's the perfect template of what a commentator should do, but I feel like his work on it has barely improved throughout all these years of experience. He should already realise by now on the faults he has when commentating such as getting stuff wrong within the match, being mis-informed on other stuff relating to players and such. Otherwise, when he's paired with Ultra David, most of the time he is very good.   Warner's 'stache is an assault to the senses   Rule 5: Criticising Shane Watson is a customary (or obligatory) tradition here.   Bonchan is really clutch too. Tokido sometimes gets flustered by irrational play by his opponent.    So will the commentating line-up be James Chen, Ultra David, Seth Killian, Spooky, Skisonic and Mike Ross for both streams?   Training Stage = EVO Street Fighter National Anthem. [] (/Kappa)   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2reKhU28GWA  Skisonic's finest commentary [](/Kappa)   Is F-W0rd coming to Evo for commenntary? It will be a shame if he didn't. He was the best commentator for Street Fighter only when he was paired with Logan Sama.   Will it be a surprise for people if Daigo didn't makes Top 8 this EVO?   The competition is so stacked + pool madness these days that making Top 32 is still respectable for him I think imo  	9

 Everyone here complains about being lonely, but they resent seeing people happy and in a relationship anyways!   what's that?    actually safest with him :)         I have this one outfit with a hood and an awesome bra that makes me look like a monster haha! But it's winter in Canada and it's cold now so i can't wear tutu's and stuff, I actually need shorts.   These are awesome!! haha :) I love seeing themes! I honestly never get pictures when i'm at raves, I do nothing but dance and glove, so this time I got a picture before i went! i'm jealous you have such an awesome pic durring the event!   thanks for defending me! You understood exactly. I didn't claim it was original and I know others dress similarly because it's a pretty typical attire at raves now, but I still think it can be made into a lot of fun and creativity. You can't see it in the picture but i'm also wearing a homemade mask and light up bow. So it's crafting too!    I invite anyone to post their costumes below!!! I love seeing new ideas!

 Compare it with the number of deaths of other nationalities and it should be clear whether the numbers are BS or not. You haven't necessarily disproved The Guardian.      You know how you can go today and qualify for the NWC next month? I was at the Torrance one and I saw Arin, Dan and Ross there.  We were a ton of people standing in line to try our luck and qualify. I had waited for like an hour and there was maybe only 6 people in front of me. Suddenly Arin, Dan and Ross come walking past us all. It was some kid who was playing, maybe around 13 years old. Arin just walks up to him and pushes him to the side. We're all yelling wtf at him and one guy quickly comes up to him and tells him to back off. But Arin just faces him and says:  "Don't you fucking know who I am? I am fucking egoraptor. Internet celebrity extraordinaire. You do not fucking talk to me like that."  The guy was just looking at Arin completely puzzled. I wanted to say something since I was obviously the only one who actually knew who Arin was but I decided not to.  Then Arin was like "What the fuck is this garbage anyway?"  And he like looked at the 3DS and then yelled "Yo Ross check out this kid's shitty score."  Ross looked and then started laughing and said "Do you HONESTLY think you can qualify with that score? Are you fucking serious?" while looking at the poor kid.  At that point more people came to get them out of there and one of the men tried to grab Dan's arm and Dan pushed him away. He had this really mean look on his face and he was wearing sunglasses. He then took off his sunglasses and looked at the guy that had approached him and he said:  "Uhm... You may not recognize me as I was wearing glasses. I wrote an Internet song about dinosaurs and lazers in 2010. I'll escort myself out."  Then him and Arin and Ross walked together with Ross still laughing at the poor kid. I then saw them walking up to a car that was parked in a handicap spot and then they drove off.  Man, what the fuck is wrong with them?   See, that's what I noticed too among my Iranian friends. I always wondered why they'd mix more with Danish people (not that that's a bad thing at all!) compared to Arabs and Chinese who tend to stick to their own kind. I've asked some and they explained vaguely that they don't like other Iranians which I thought was strange.  Why do you think Iranians don't like to stick together?   I see. but is it then really true that all of the Iranian girls are bitchy/entitled? From my experience that doesn't seem to be the case.   Yeah I'd definitely hook up with an exotic chick too if I met one, nothing wrong with that. It just rubbed me the wrong way when the two girls that I've met said they'd exclusively date Danish guys. I mean, as much as I like exotic girls, I wouldn't reject a Danish girl simply because she was Danish. I don't know if those two girls are just a rare example or if this is something cultural that many Iranians feel.   I've never seen an Iranian woman date an Iranian man in Denmark though. I notice that Arab women always date Arab men but I never see that being the case with Iranian women. Is it something cultural?   That's very cool. Yes, Iranians seem much more integrated. Why is it that some of them date white men exclusively though? I've met two Iranian girls who said they only date Danish men. Is it because Iranian men don't treat them as good?   Kilde til den verste paragraf? Statistik over successrate?   So in that episode, they talked about how funny it would be if the announcer was sarcastic in his comments.  In Wave Race Blue Storm you can unlock a mode with a sarcastic commentator: http://youtu.be/G-QfJ1jsmag   Er der nogen kilder som du kan henvise til som viser at det har en positiv indflydelse? Statistik?   Og hvordan skal man s hjlpe ham?   Is it true that the majority of Iranian women prefer Western men? All of the Iranian girls in Denmark seem to only go for Danish men.   Shabadibadab babadibadibub shabadiba 2 players dabadabadab JonTron dabadabadabadib daba Grumpcade    There are adults out there exploiting these stupid kids  What do you mean? Are you implying that ISIS fighters are going door to door in the UK and recruiting the kids?  Don't be naive. The only way these kids could get in contact with the ISIS fighters and be recruited is if the kids themselves actively seeked them out on Twitter and other places. These kids already knew about the rape and murders and they still got in contact with ISIS fighters to help them get there. They were already motivated to join the ISIS before they even got in contact. There's nothing innocent about them.   How does supporting genocides and the brutal rape, torture and murders of innocent people, including kids, compare to spending a few weeks in school detention?  If yoy were to do those things on school property, you'd be serving life in prison.   What's a good pick-up line?   Why are people so obsessed with changing the genders in video games?   I love how in the /r/arabs subreddit, they're all whining that reddit is being racist for pointing these things out.   "The West" consists of the people living there.    I also love that the pressure is not on Qatar to actually reform it's laws  Uh, yes? That's because last time the West tried to interfere in the Middle East, Arabs got angry and told the West to mind their own business.  Now the West is starting to mind their own business by not putting pressure on Qatar and interfering with another Middle Eastern country, but instead putting pressure on an organisation based in the West (FIFA) and now you're complaining that the West is not interfering in Middle Eastern politics?  Basically, the West is damned if they do, and damned if they don't. Now isn't THAT just fucking convenient?   Does that mean me and my ex might still be together in reality? That she never cheated on me? Damn, now I'm starting to get really excited if this is just a dream.  	22

 I was being sarcastic.   Well, he just got my vote. /s   The VA estimates that an average of 18 veterans per day commit suicide, or 1 out of 5 suicides in the U.S.   A one-day attack on US soil eleven years ago unleashed a never-ending campaign of violence around the world from the target and its allies. Is it really a challenge to understand that continuous bombings and civilian-killing assaults over many years, in many Muslim countries, will generate the same desire for aggression and vengeance against the US?  Why can't *YOU* understand this?   If Obama is really the peace president  When was Obama ever a "peace president?"   Here's the headline and story.  You be the judge: [Romney Says Remarks on Voters Help Clarify Position - Mr. Romney said he stands by comments that he said demonstrates his belief in the power of free enterprise rather than a growing reliance on largess from the federal treasury.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/19/us/politics/in-leaked-video-romney-says-middle-east-peace-process-likely-to-remain-unsolved-problem.html?_r=0)   I posted a story at r/politics yesterday from the New York Times w/ a headline written by the NYT and they pulled it b/c they said it was "editorialized."   Because otherwise some people in the military-industrial complex will [lose their jobs](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/defense-industry-is-reshaping-itself-in-a-multitude-of-ways/2012/09/19/736c31ac-fdc0-11e1-b153-218509a954e1_story.html?hpid=z3).   We wanted to attack Camp Phoenix to kill the Americans but were stopped by the Afghan police, and we had to attack the police, said protester Ajmal Hotak, a 26-year-old shopkeeper.   accepting "full responsibility for this tragedy."  Then I'm assuming that someone will be punished, right?   McDonald was sentenced in January to five years of probation and sex offender treatment after pleading guilty to two misdemeanor sex offenses. The charges stemmed from a relationship he had with a 15-year-old girl when he was 19.   If you're not aware, Gov. Hickenlooper made his fortune as a beer brewer and alcohol dealer.   Actually, I think the message is that adults s/b allowed to treat their bodies as they see fit w/out interference from the State.   [From the AP](http://www.stripes.com/news/africa/us-officials-attack-on-consulate-in-libya-may-have-been-planned-1.189017):  US officials say attack on consulate in Libya may have been planned   Huh?  I said the attacks were planned and used the movie to rile up the mob.  That's exactly what happened.   The whole article is worth a read to give you some insight into the mind of a neocon.  It's clear, he really believes his own rhetoric.   [From USA Today](http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012/09/12/obama-tightens-security-after-diplomats-killed-in-libya/57752828/1): Days of planning and online promotion by hard-line Islamist leaders helped whip up the mobs that stormed the U.S. Embassy in Egypt and launched a deadly attack on the U.S. Embassy in Libya that killed an ambassador and three others.   Do you remember that we recently bombed Libya for months?  Do you think this may have had something to do w/ stirring up some angst against the U.S.?  Do you remember when Hillary Clinton said, "We came, we saw, he died" after CIA-backed rebels beat and sodomized Ghadaffi to death?  Also, did you happen to notice that the attacks fell on 09/11?  These were coordinated attacks against the American Empire that simply used this Muslim movie nonsense to rile up the mob.   I just noticed that this article was written by Ron Paul hater James Kirchick.  'Nuff said.   **The GOP bent over backwards to accommodate [Ron Paul] at its convention**, airing a 3-minute video tribute in honor of his career (something it did for no other primary contender), included a platform plank calling for an audit of the Federal Reserve (a Paul hobbyhorse), and offered him a speaking slot provided that he endorse Romney - hardly an unreasonable request considering that the event is, after all, a nominating convention.  WTF?   You are just dumb.   In the hierarchy of evil, consigning someone who has been convicted of nothing to a cage year after year after year, until they die, is high up on the list. And in that regard, this latest episode demonstrates not only the ongoing travesty of the US's war on terror policies, but also the dishonesty of the attempt to exonerate Obama for those policies.   ReneFonck is a well-known troll.  Don't feed him.   The United States is not at war with Afghanistan for humanitarian reasons.  It is there because Afghanistan borders Iran to the West and China to the East: two countries in the Pentagons sights. And it is there because Afghanistan is a transport route for oil from the stans of the former Soviet Union down to the Arabian Sea.   What's the difference?   Nice catch.  I didn't notice that.   Dempsey also met with Lt. Gen. Robert Caslen, head of the Office of Security Cooperation in Iraq, according to Dempsey's spokesman, Col. David Lapan. **That office is an arm of the U.S. Embassy and is responsible for facilitating Iraqi arms purchases and training the Iraqis how to use and maintain the weapons.**   1. Mitt Romney is much less qualified to be president than Ron Paul, who understands the Constitution and Bill of Rights.   The reason for the silence about such matters, and the reason commentary of this sort sparks such anger and hostility, is two-fold: first, the US likes to think of terror as something only "others" engage in, not itself, and more so; second, supporters of Barack Obama, the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, simply do not want to think about him as someone who orders attacks on those rescuing his victims or funeral attendees gathered to mourn them.  That, however, is precisely what he is, as this mountain of evidence conclusively establishes.    I'm assuming "other items" is just a euphemism for hookers.   Faced with our undeniable momentum and his own failure, the enemy is increasingly forced to resort to spectacular attacks. I am confident that these recent attacks were carefully crafted to drive a wedge between us and our Afghan partners. This is a common theme in the latter stages of a counterinsurgency operation. We saw the same thing in Iraq after the balance had tipped in our favor."   If they had been successful, then yes, he would have claimed to have passed them all by himself.   I don't remember Sarah Palin weeping at her first campaign event.   In a June 2011 foreign policy speech, Ryan heralded so-called American Exceptionalism and criticized isolationism, argued that America is the greatest force for human freedom the world has ever seen, leaving out the fact that the US props up dictatorships all around the world and engages in near constant aggression and violence.   "[Herbert Hoover] made some big mistakes AFTER the Great Depression..."  "This bill offends my principles, but I'm going to vote for this bill in order to preserve my principles..."   "I want to get on my airplane..."   "Herbert Hoover made some big mistakes AFTER the Great Depression..."  What a f*cking idiot.    Here's some more info on the CSM: http://news.yahoo.com/senior-u-soldier-killed-suicide-bomber-afghanistan-121800898--abc-news-topstories.html   Do you really think it is consistent to say that an industry is privatized when it is "controlled by the federal government?"   Your entire comment is nonsensical and uninformed.   The trend of privatizing every aspect of American life  This is complete fantasy.  The trend is exactly the opposite (see healthcare, auto industry, mortgage industry, etc.).   What are you talking about?  We were about to go to war with the USSR in August of 1945?   If nuclear holocaust inflicted upon innocent civilians for the purpose of securing a diplomatic result is not terrorism, then there is no such thing.   because I think **we can all agree** that entering WWII and attempting to finish WWII (at whatever cost) was just.  Sorry, there was nothing "just" about WWII (or any other war for that matter).     Whatever else is true, its impossible to evade the fact that Endless War will inevitably degrade the citizenry of the country that engages in it. A country which venerates its military above all other institutions, which demands that its soldiers be spoken of only with religious-like worship, and which continuously indoctrinates its population to believe that endless violence against numerous countries is necessary and just  all by instilling intense fear of the minorities who are the target of that endless violence  will be a country filled with citizens convinced of the virtues and nobility of aggression.   resulting in MILLIONS of deaths.  This statistic is a tall tale made up after the war to justify the use of the atomic bomb.  Do me a favor, and read [*The Decision To Use The Atomic Bomb*](http://www.amazon.com/The-Decision-Use-Atomic-Bomb/dp/067976285X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1344430481 sr=8-1 keywords=the+decision+to+use+the+atomic+bomb) by historian Gal Alperovitz.  After doing so, you won't believe all of the lies you were taught in junior high.   Yes, of course.  And so should you.   You're justifying the mass murder of hundreds of thousands of civilians by citing Ken Burns?  I stand by my original assessment of your character.   US pullout  Huh?   Telepathy?   They're both equally lame.   And that makes it morally acceptable to incinerate 300,000 civilians. Wow, what a twisted moral code you must have.   If Hiroshima was such an important military target, why hadn't it already been leveled by conventional bombing?   Here are some releveant quotes from an [article](http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/phil-strongman-hiroshima-is-a-war-crime-that-haunts-my-family-67-years-on-8008821.html) you should read:  General Eisenhower opposed it, "Japan was already defeated dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary." The Pacific Fleet commander Admiral Nimitz agreed: "The Japanese had, in fact, already sued for peace. The atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military point of view, in their defeat." Admiral Leahy, President Truman's Chief of Staff, concurred: the atomic attacks were "of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already ready to surrender"   That's ridiculous. A statement like that tells me that you've never read anything about Hiroshima and are simply regurgitating the mythology you learned in 6th grade.  Hiroshima and Nagasaki were targeted largely b/c there were significant *civilian* populations and b/c they had not been destroyed already w/ conventional bombing.  Military considerations were of little or no importance in the targeting decisions.   They were war crimes.  Both of those bombing campaigns deliberately targeted civilians for destruction rather than military forces.   Between the two bombs, Harry Truman killed upwards of 300,000 civilians when the war was already won and Japan was attempting to surrender.  If you don't believe me, then see [these quotes](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm) by U.S. military leaders.   It wasn't a war crime?  Please explain.   Mr. Romney says he wants to increase that to 15 per year, which, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates, would increase the annual budget to $33.5 billion a year, nearly doubling costs over the next 30 years to $1.005 trillion.   I wonder who in the CIA wrote this press release for the "rebels?"   Marion C. Blakey is president and CEO of the Aerospace Industries Association.   So this is supposed to make me so angry with Obama that I'll vote for Romney?   I've never claimed to be "patriotic" in the sense you mean: unquestioning support for every action our govt and military take.   Why don't you educate me rather than just throwing out a meaningless insult?   I'm a keen observer of what happens when a U.S. official, especially the former director of the CIA, issues an ultimatum of this kind.  Just ask Moammar Gadhafi.   It sounds to me like the CIA is getting ready to send in the drones.   Here's the full quote: "I would say if you want to be able to protect yourself and your family, you better get the hell out now."  So he's basically threatening to kill Assad and his family, right?   That's no my interpretion.  It's the intepretation of the [CBS News reporter](https://twitter.com/bkappCBS/status/229954334669017088/photo/1).   I wonder how many of Romney's 5 military-aged sons will volunteer to fight in his wars?   Takes one to know one...   The military has not tortured anyone legally, you are thinking about the CIA.  So, I guess you're saying the CIA is and has always been running Bagram Prison, Gitmo and Abu Ghraib where torture was routine? And, I don't think it was the CIA who tortured the Afghan taxi driver to death in the documentary *[Taxi To The Dark Side](http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/taxi-to-the-dark-side/)*.  President Roosevelt ordered the bombing of Japan  Actually, it was Truman, not the deceased Roosevelt, who ordered the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  Japan (who was far from defeated).  Then I guess you [disagree with Gen. Eisenhower](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Dwight_D._Eisenhower) who said about Truman's decision to drop the bombs:  "I was against it on two counts. **First, the Japanese were ready to surrender**, and it wasn't necessary to hit them with that awful thing. Second, I hated to see our country be the first to use such a weapon."  [Admiral Leahy](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm): "It is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. **The Japanese were already defeated** and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons."  [Gen. MacArthur](http://www.doug-long.com/quotes.htm): [MacArthur] replied that he saw **no military justification for the dropping of the bomb**. The war might have ended weeks earlier, he said, if the United States had agreed, as it later did anyway, to the retention of the institution of the emperor."  hatred of the military  I hate pointless mass killing and destruction.  Unfortunately, the U.S. military is an eager participant in both of these activities.  The U.S. military does not protect freedom, it endangers it. If I'm wrong, tell me how I am more free today than I was prior to 9/11 or the Iraq War.    Sorry, but the U.S. military does what most people would consider "abhorrent" things every day.  You routinely attack countries who do not threaten America nor ever could, you've killed literally millions of people in unnecessary foreign conflicts around the globe, you have tortured and continue to torture helpless individuals at secret prisons at the behest of the President, and, to top that off, you dropped city-destroying nuclear bombs on a nation that was already defeated in WWII.  Look at your real history, not the fanciful mythology you've been brainwashed with, and my guess is that a military acting on its own won't seem like such a far-fetched idea.    The military would not do it on their own  I guess you have more confidence in the benevolent intentions of our military than I do.  We'll just have to agree to disagree.   You do realize the military doesn't attack countries without direction from Obama, right?  You are aware that according to the U.S. Constitution only Congress can declare war, right?    Yeah, right.   "It makes no sense to spend money to destroy a facility that you have spent money to build in the first place," said Daud Kalakani, another Afghan lawmaker.   Why don't you ask Indonesia or Ethiopia how well off they would be without the US military?  Huh?  I've never heard that our military saved Ethiopia and Indonesia.  You'll have to educate me on that one.  yes we do fight..we do it well.  This just isn't borne out by the facts.  The U.S. military hasn't won a war since WW2.  It lost in Iraq and will lose in Afghanistan.  There is a difference between sowing destruction and death and victory.  criticize the way those liberties are provided  Liberties are natural rights.  Govt doesn't provide liberty.  Govt can only reduce or destroy liberty.  Better men than you or I have died to give you liberty and while criticism is the duty of all in a democracy  U.S. military personnel do not die to preserve liberty or democracy and haven't since (arguably) the American Revolution.  In fact, their actions abroad only serve to reduce liberty and democracy at home (see the TSA and our pointless elections).   They die normally to preserve the financial interests of certain elite groups such as the oil industry or the military-industrial-Congressional complex.  If you don't believe me, then just read [*War is a Racket* by Smedley Butler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_is_a_Racket).    Then again who would save the world after the next disaster or stop some other country from falling apart.   We *create* disasters (see Iraq, Pakistan, Somalia, Yemen, Afghanistan, etc.), we don't stop them.  The world w/b a much safer place were we to bring our military back to our shores and drastically reduce the size of our forces.  If we didn't have those bases half the world would've fallen apart because we couldn't get to them fast enough.  I don't know which countries you're referring to where we've prevented them from falling apart.  Iraq? Soviet Union? Yugoslavia? Sudan? Mali? Afghanistan? Pakistan?   we gave those countries back  We're still there.  They don't have their countries back.  [Ask the people of Okinawa.](http://www.stripes.com/news/protests-greet-arrival-of-controversial-ospreys-in-japan-1.183689)  if we wanted to rule and take over another country there is not 1 country out there who could stop us.   Actually, Iraq just did exactly that and Afghanistan is in the process of doing so right now.   name one country that we have annexed or taken in the last 50 year.  We tried to annex Iraq (remember the 100s of bases George W. Bush wanted?) and we're trying to continue our "enduring presence" in Afghanistan.  We still occupy Guam, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, Japan, Germany, Italy, England, Djibouti and God knows how many other countries.  I have traveled extensively in many countries and have never seen any place where the presence of the U.S. military has had a positive effect.  Of course, nearly every country has benefited from American innovcation and technology, but this would have occured independently from American occupation and bombing.  places where American influence has a been such a good thing  This argument has been used by every imperial power in the last 150 years.  Ignore the trail of destruction, look, they now have basketball courts and flush toilets! Whatever "good" America may have done, is it really worth the piles of corpses we leave behind?   Perhaps you're not familiar with the Iraq War and its predecessors.  You may want to check the period from 1990 to the present day.   Do you ever think *you* may have been "brainwashed" by either the US govt, the US military or both?  When I read your post, it's almost as if you're describing yourself:  After so much of the same propaganda it becomes reality to them.  America is not some benevolent force spreading its goodness around the world.  The America of today is a brutal, violent imperial force that has sown a field of destruction and death around the globe for decades.  This is why they hate us.   Did you ever ask **why** those Saudis attacked the US?  Do you think it may have been b/c the US military had bases in their country and was using them to incessantly bomb Iraq?  Or, did they attack America b/c we have R rated movies and listen to Brittany Spears (i.e., 'They hate us for our freedom'), as George W. Bush postulated?   He killed a million people.  Is that one of the "bad breaks" you're referring to?   Check out the comment by "Keith_Vlasak".   I guess in a world where war means peace and freedom means slavery, then yes, George W. Bush is a "moral voice" who reflected the "decency" of most Americans.   Sorry for posting, but it's instructive to know how these people think.   supporting the Libyan rebels  My guess is that the U.S. pilots who bombed Libya and killed Libyans may be eligible for the award as well.  What do you think?   but as president he has to continue the business that is part of being the president   You mean killing people who have never threatened our country nor ever could?   The Afghan Surge was ordered by Obama, not the Monster Bush.  The drone strikes in Pakistan have overwhelmingly been ordered by Obama, not the Monster Bush.  If you are unaware of this, please consult the Internet.   See, Obama says he's against massacring people, but one day after saying so, he kills more people than the Batman theater killer.  Get it?   Well, I guess this op-ed makes up for the million people he killed in Iraq.   Just wait until someone suddenly discovers that Al-Qaeda is using Namibia as a terrorist sanctuary.    At a dinner co-hosted by the governor and the congresswoman, Deputy Secretary Carter congratulated the people of Guam on the 68th anniversary of their Liberation Day.  I wonder if the people on Guam feel "liberated" w/ a giant U.S. military base dominating their island?   Didn't Rand just give up on his own father?   This is what he has to do to justify the horror he unleashed on the world.  What a pathetic, loathsome excuse for a man.   That'll definitely make me vote for Romney. /s   I thought we were fighting them over there so we didn't have to fight them here?   Paul on Tuesday agreed with that advice, saying Romneys tax returns have become too much of a distraction.  Its a shame. The important issue is [what] the two candidates seem to agree on. They dont really disagree with militarism overseas, they dont disagree with the Federal Reserve system and the bailouts, and they dont disagree on basically whether the role of federal government is wealth redistribution through welfare. So instead, theyre talking about tax returns and that to me is so disappointing, he said. Its all a charade, I think its all contrived to not have a debate.   Mitt Romneys father was placed in nomination for president in 1964 and 1968 despite having no chance to win either time. Romneys father refused to endorse the 1964 nominee before or after the convention.   Romney came to Aspen between resort fundraising stops in the Hamptons and Jackson Hole.   This isn't a base and it isn't for us.  Oh to be naive again...   They seem to be doing a pretty good job against every branch of the U.S. military.   Yes, I'm sure there will be no U.S. military personnel within the confines of the Afghan intelligence building.   Didn't we elect a new president a few years ago?  Or, is George W. Bush still president?   Read your own post.  Of us two, who exactly is the "mindless hater?"   Yes, I dislike the fact that our president kills innocent people virtually every day.  And so should you.   The ones who wanted to learn some basic economics, perhaps?   No Democratic lawmakers attended the hearing.   Jews do not get to give keynote speeches at Palestinian gatherings. White people do not get to lead NAACP dinners. White, male conservatives do not address attendees at the NOW gatherings. Big oil supporters are not welcomed with open arms at greeniac environmental conferences.   [Gen. Carter Hamm] said the U.S. is looking to provide assistance - "**certainly not a large military presence, probably no permanent military presence**" other than in the embassy mission.   I wonder how many military suicides there would be if Obama ended his wars...   Rand wants to eliminate tax "loopholes."  This is the equivalent of raising taxes and Ron Paul has said as much.  Rand wants more *govt* spending on infrastructure.  This is exactly what Obama advocated when rallying support for his $800 billion "stimulus" program.  And nowhere in the interview does Rand ever state that he wants to *decrease* govt spending of any kind.  Ron always brings up reducing spending, particularly overseas.  Rand wants to make sure the behemoth and unconstitutional govt programs Social Security and Medicare are around for another 75 years.  Whenever Ron is asked about these programs, he always states that we need to transition out of them, not keep them around for another century.  And BTW, no one likes a tattletale.     One last thing is worth mentioning from the documents published today:  Anyone with any doubt that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is dangerous to the United States is contradicting U.S. intelligence. **Violence between Israelis and the Palestinians, moreover is making Sunni extremists more willing to participate in attacks against US or Israeli interests, the CIA wrote in February 2001**. It is not the only piece of information revealed by the new documents that will be deeply uncomfortable for the Bush administration and hawks across the country.   "These deaths are grim reminders that our Military...is still in active combat **in defense of our country**. We are privileged to have such heroes in our midst," [said Maj. Gen. Robert E. Livingston, Jr., the states Adjutant General.](http://springvalley.patch.com/articles/identity-of-second-columbia-guardsman-killed-in-afghanistan-released)   From the comments: "I think that being friendly toward Rand Paul and (to some degree) inviting him 'inside the tent' is absolutely the smartest thing Romney's advisers have done since Romney has become the presumptive nominee. **Kudos to** them for this, and to **Rand Paul for being a team player."**   But, The Surge worked?  Right?   From the story pic, looks like RP's going full-on tribal for the Tampa fest.   Great comment.  Thanks.   "There's every reason to believe that Assad will continue to escalate the violence, more massacres, more use of helicopters, and perhaps worse weapons after that," he said.   "You can find condoms in Haiti," Moscou said, "but many people can't afford them, and supplies run out. People now understand that you need to use them."   I agree.  It sounds like the Jack Hunter argument.   Whatever else is true, having the military held in such higher esteem than all other American institutions is an obviously dangerous state of affairs for a democracy.    So Ron Paul supporters are not "principled?"  This coming from a self-described "team player?"   Rands endorsement of GOP nominee Mitt Romney clearly shows that in spite of those who try to marginalize him, he has keen set of political instincts and is very much aware that a successful national run will require more than just his fathers loyal following, said one Republican strategist close to Paul-world.  Wanna bet this quote is from Jesse Benton?   Rand Paul in a single stroke has made credible all the things that his father's supporters suspected of him: He's a conservative politician first, someone who has gone into politics to serve his own interests.   "I think it would be devastating to the military-industrial complex," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said. "You'd lose thousands of high-skilled jobs and undermine our national security."   "I think it would be devastating to the military-industrial complex," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said. "You'd lose thousands of high-skilled jobs and undermine our national security."   "I think it would be devastating to the military-industrial complex," Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said. "You'd lose thousands of high-skilled jobs and undermine our national security."   Why don't I let you handle those posts.   military assertiveness of China.  Where is this happening?  What countries has China invaded?   Watch the whole report for a good dose of imperial propaganda.   Somebody please explain this column to me.   Yep, the fix is in.   It's not.   How has spending billions on our military "prevented" or "won" wars?  We've been at war constantly since WWII and haven't won a single war since then either.   Yes, the deaths millions of people around the globe were definitely worth getting American women in the workplace.  Sorry, I forgot about that one.   You mean the war where Harry Truman dropped nuclear bombs to intentionally destroy entire cities and their civilian populations?  Yeah, Americans should be real proud of that atrocity.  I'm assuming you're joking about Kosovo so I won't address that one.   But people do take you seriously, right?   Name a good one.   This all has to do with a policy led by a president who does not believe in American exceptionalism, McCain said.   Any NATO airstrike that leads to civilian deaths erodes the Afghan people's trust in foreign forces.  Huh, really?   Here's the story of the [U.S. massacre](http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/27/11902353-afghan-family-including-six-children-killed-in-nato-air-strike?lite).   That is the imperial mind at work. Its premises are often embraced implicitly rather than knowingly: American lives are inherently more valuable; foreign lives are expendable in pursuit of American interests; the U.S. has the inalienable right to take action in other countries that nobody is allowed to take in the U.S.    It won't work.   2nd Lt. Travis A. Morgado, 25, of San Jose, Calif., died May 23 in Zharay, Afghanistan, of injuries sustained when insurgents attacked his patrol with an **[improvised explosive device.](http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=15308)**    I'm glad you agree.   "Credit" for what?  Killing people?   The Museum of Modern Art in New York arranged for a public premiere in June 1946, but minutes before the show, two military policemen confiscated the print.   The Afghan army has been given billions of dollars worth of American training and weaponry over the past decade; yet we're told that only 1 percent of these forces are now capable of undertaking operations on their own. But the opponents of the occupation -- without these billions, without a bristling international military alliance behind them -- have somehow managed to wield a military force that grows more effective with each passing year.   Unsurprisingly, then, when I asked Paul supporters whether they would be voting for Romney this year, every single one of them said definitely not, and they insisted other Paul supporters they know wouldnt either.   7 "suspects", 8 civilians.   I wonder if any Afghans will be included in these negotiations.   Want another reason to vote against Mitt Romney?  Listen to the god-awful devil's music in the background.   I couldn't agree more.   "Our campaign is presently working to get several items up for consideration, including **monetary policy reform, prohibitions on indefinite detention, and Internet freedom**, Mr. Benton said.  How about ending the fucking wars, Jesse?   Why wasn't Jesse Benton fired months ago?   Another brilliant move by Jesse Benton.  Why didn't RP fire him months ago?  What a fucking amateur.   Best analysis so far from the Christian Science Monitor: **[Why Ron Paul's 2012 effort may not really be over](http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/DC-Decoder/Decoder-Wire/2012/0514/Why-Ron-Paul-s-2012-effort-may-not-really-be-over)** - The Ron Paul campaign won't run ads in upcoming primaries, but Paul is still out to make his mark at the GOP's August convention. That means getting supporters elected as delegates and even picking up some 'stealth' delegates.   Fair enough.   This story has other "useful information [and] anaylsis."  It should not be consolidated under the official campaign announcement.   I like how the writer had to add this hearsay to the story:   Some attendees said they heard Paul supporters chanting outside that Mitt Romney is "the white Obama."   If opposition to gay marriage is the only thing that can unite the GOP base, then they are doomed.   Sciple's attorney, John Fitzgibbons, said Sciple volunteered for the Marine Corps after 9/11 and "came back a changed man because of his war injuries."   We have now come to understand that there is no such thing as moderate Islam, Dooley noted in a July 2011 presentation (.pdf), which concluded with a suggested manifesto to Americas enemies. It is therefore time for the United States to make our true intentions clear. **This barbaric ideology will no longer be tolerated. Islam must change or we will facilitate its self-destruction.**   A distinction without a difference.   Meanwhile, tribal leaders in parts of Yemen where drone attacks aimed at AQAP have killed civilians say the strikes are turning more and more people against the government and the United States.   Leila Buffett, Warren Buffett's mother, recounted that her husband said he considered only one issue when deciding whether to vote for a bill: "Will this add to, or subtract from, human liberty?"    Speaking at a campaign stop last week in Portsmouth, Va., Mr. Romney said he will add new ships to the U.S. Navy, add new aircraft to the Air Force and add 100,000 active duty personnel.   We feel that establishment Republicans have done enough damage to this country and that by nominating a clone of John McCain, the party is forfeiting the presidency, Davidson said.   The GOP can no longer ignore its libertarian "fringe." On the contrary, it will have to reach out to a new generation of activists who don't regard religious piety or continual warfare as sacred tenets of conservatism.   Listen to his answer.  What a weasel.  The reason I posted these videos was b/c now [Romney is speaking out for the Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng](http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/romney-chinese-dissident-chen-departure-american-embassy-dark-184056059.html).   I had never seen this video.  What a dick.  Watch how Romney forcefully pulls his hand out of the handshake w/ the questioner.   In contrast, here is Romney's response when being questioned about Bradley Manning:  Clip 1:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1tWstYVV7I  Clip 2:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EtmGted3D0   What's next?  The USS Rosa Parks?   Morally they're no different.  In reality, Obama is responsible for vastly more carnage and death than Osama ever was or ever could have been, unless you don't consider Afghans, Somalis, Iraqis, Yemenis and Pakistanis as being part of the human race.   Who determines that?  You?   Obama has ["actively sought to kill Americans"](http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/awlaki-family-protests-us-killing-anwar-awlakis-teen/story?id=14765076) as well.  Is he a "piece of shit" also?   Why?   **Sometimes you have to take life to save lives**, and thats what weve been able to do to prevent these individual terrorists from carrying out their murderous attacks.   Then who did?   He will favor more intimate settings, like the Ohio classroom, and a schedule that calls for fewer public appearances as the campaign hopes to show a softer side of the former Massachusetts governor who struggles at times to connect with average Americans.   I have no idea what you're talking about and I've been posting these obits for at least 4 years.   Limbaugh?  I think he probably supports murdering unarmed elderly men.   I don't send out messages to my "Ron Paul spammers." If you think I do, narc on me to one of the moderators.   If that's true, then the GOP is doomed.   The absurdity of the theory that literally every security problem in the world is a direct threat to the United States is but one example of Rubios navet. In his vision, America never makes mistakes and everyone loves it.   Panetta also announced during his visit to the base that the U.S. would facilitate the sale of 10 helicopters to Bogota - five Army Black Hawks and five commercial aircraft - to help Colombian forces in their fight against the FARC.   Newt Gingrich, meanwhile, revealed recently that his campaign is saddled with $4.5 million in debt.   The photographs reveal not only the nature of the war, but more essentially, that of the society that produced it.    But he still can't admit that the war was wrong:  The generous investment of our capital, the valorous example of our men and women in uniform, and the unselfish support of the American people have given the Afghan people the opportunity to now determine their own future.   And of course the usual disclaimer:  "Such conduct is wholly inconsistent with the core values of the department of Navy," Mabus wrote to Marine Commandant Gen. James Amos in ordering separation proceedings against the two.   All true.  Thanks Gary.   I have done just that for at least the past 4 years.   Update: [36 killed](http://news.yahoo.com/series-blasts-hit-iraqs-capital-police-sources-053952495.html)   You have to be an "expert" to figure that out?   Capt. John Kirby, a Pentagon spokesman, said the conduct depicted "most certainly does not represent the character and the professionalism of the great majority of our troops in Afghanistan..."   "I'm going to probably eliminate for high-income people the second-home mortgage deduction," Romney said, adding that he would also likely eliminate deductions for state income and property taxes as well.  So his first act as President will be a massive tax increase on the rich?  What a disaster...   Team Player: "The last week after Wisconsin, we basically raised almost no money. We had solicitations going out and people emailing back and saying, '**The race is over, you've got to join the crew**,'" Mr. Santorum said  	199

 What would happen if you spoke about something on the list of things you can't mention?   Neat idea, but will you make it opensource afterwards?   A closer reading reveals that she also has had multiple partners in that time frame as evidenced by "I pretend to be an underaged boy and pickup male clientS" Her husband is very likely only one of them.  Still, what he is doing is way more fucked up, indeed.      Thanks for your reply.  I don't think you're an asshole, just coming from a different perspective.  Ok cool, but that's still 100% anecdotal and completely unscientific. It means absolutely nothing to anyone other than you or your friend.  I understand you are coming at this completely from a scientific POV here, but I really don't think science is the only way to ascertain truth.  There is such a thing as intuition, and just plain observation and reasoning (which science does apply, but most of the time we do this without doing complete scientific studies).  I don't know if there are any studies comparing the prevalence of bad trips on shrooms vs. lsd, but I'd be very curious to see the results.  I do take issue with discounting personal experience completely.  I trust my own experience much more than anecdotes OR studies (which are sometimes falsified or inherently flawed).  Sometimes personal conclusions are wrong too, but at least I know I can trust myself.  This is a huge philosophical topic right here, which I'm sure we can could back and forth on all day, but honestly, do you not believe anything you learned through experience unless there are numerous, repeated, well-constructed studies about it?  but your wording implies that Psilocybin is somehow a more "true" psychedelic than others, and that the differences between psilocybin and chemicals with a similar structure or effect are inherent shortcomings in relation to psilocybin  I do think there is something to be said about the fact that mushrooms have been around on Earth for as long as we have.  [Terrance McKenna had some interesting thoughts on the subject](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KsZbxRzWYLc)  This is only very loosely even close to the truth. First of all, there's not just one "lock" and there's no "distorted" way for the "key" to fit.  I was speaking metaphorically.  I have a general understanding of neurotransmitters and how psychoactive drugs work.   it just strikes me as somewhat intellectually dishonest to make a post implying that shrooms are somehow better or healthier than LSD, or that there's any relative reason to avoid LSD in the first place.  I don't have an agenda and I'm not trying to mislead people.  I encourage everyone to do their own research and trust their own experiences!  I also don't think there is anything wrong with sharing one's own experience and the thoughts that have come out of those experiences.    [Shrooms can also help cure depression](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/07/magic-mushrooms-treat-depression) It worked for me. Just remember: mindset and setting!  And take it real easy on the dose the first time.   See my answer to the same question above.   I have a lot of experience with both, personally and anecdotally.  My experience with shrooms has been mostly positive.  I come away from the experience with a renewed sense of wonder and a deeper understanding of my place in the Universe.  I really believe that they help reveal as close to anything that can be called "truth" as possible.  LSD, on the other hand can also be a tremendously powerful experience, and many times the experience is positive, but many times it is not.  It also often leads to great feelings of "revelation".  However, it seems to me that the revelations are much more likely to be false with LSD.  A friend of mine came away feeling like there was no love in the world.  I think it often talks about the same subject as shrooms, but distorts the message.  It makes  sense physiologically for LSD to lead to false epiphanies when you consider that is has a very similar molecular structure to psilocybin.  It's as if it is another key that turns the same lock, but always in some sort of distorted way.  And since this is r/conspiracy, I'll just remind people that [the CIA experimented with LSD in the 1960's as a method of mind-control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_MKUltra).         Sometimes I feel like reddit is really advancing human ethics.  It's like we are all collectively working out proper behavior.  Sure, there are kinks, but they were a great band.   Horoscopes are just a small part of astrology. I assume you mean astrology in general though?   I know I'm gonna get downvoted for this but...   I humbly urge people to veer towards the shrooms and away from the lsd.   Mine: making sweeping generalizations and judgments about people based on their dietary choices.   It took me a while too. Basically you have to listen to every sentence you are about to say in your head and then remove all the "like"s beforehand.   Good for her!   That is not correct. ac - bc = (a-b)c.

USE FOLDERS!   it was funnier when IWillBeInTheCorner said it.   It could very well be that the dumb boys keep their mouths shut more than the girls.   When society and media constantly tell you something about yourself, you start to believe it.  When I was about 6 my sister and I got into an argument and she called me a "girl" as an insult.  To get even, I called her a "boy" and she shrugged and said she didn't mind being called a boy.  Made me realize some things about society and status right then.   Hahaha! She really didn't know that Africa has a Prime Minister?   Rejoice!  I did my part.   I imagine for you it is probably novelty seeking.  For me I actually find the opposite effect.  A song or album gets better after I've listened to it 2 or 3 times.  Like I start to understand it and appreciate it better.   Same thing happened to me!         That's your judgement.  He was a sensitive guy who like poetry and classical music.  Does that make one a "pussy"?  Matter of opinion.   You're right. I don't even know you. Sorry if I offended you.   You mean the joke we've all heard 100 times on this page alone?   Gale in Breaking Bad was vegan.  Nothing bad was said about it.   found the conformist with no original thought.   Guess what. B12 doesn't come from meat either. It comes from bacteria.   No... I subtracted x.  I defined x to equal .9 which is perfectly legal to do.  So you agree up to 10x = 9.9, right?  So 10x - x = 9x and 9.9 - x = 9.  Make sense?   I posted another proof above.  It's not a mathematical fallacy.  Here is my proof:  let x = .9_(repeating), multiply both sides by 10: 10x = 9.9_, subtract x from both sides: 9x = 9, and divide by 9 giving: x = 1, therefore: 1 = .9_  Oh and here is the wikipedia article explaining more: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.999...   Here is another proof. let x = .99999(repeating), multiply both sides by 10: 10x = 9.99999(repeating), subtract x from both sides: 9x = 9, and divide by 9 giving: x = 1, therefore: 1 = .999999(repeating)   You are missing my point entirely.  I'm not saying that we one needs to be physically capable of killing an animal to eat it.  What I am saying is that one should be emotionally responsible for their own actions.  When people buy meat in a store that comes from a factory farm they are completely removed from the process that produced the meat and have no idea what sort of suffering was endured.  At least when someone raises and slaughters an animal on their own, they are well aware of what they are doing.  Tribal societies honored the life the animals they killed and treated them with respect.  Animals "raised" for food today are  treated with no respect and in fact are treated legally as property rather than living, sentient beings.  That is fucked.   You hit the nail on the head.  The intense anger reaction is because they are NOT comfortable with their own actions.  And you are calling attention to it.   Everybody is is saying "oh, it's not so bad! could be worse!" But why are we assuming that it is our right or necessity to eat chicken in the first place?  This is just a small sampling of the torture animals have to endure under factory farming.  I think if you want to eat animals you should be comfortable with killing the animal yourself.  Don't leave it to a big industrialized process that has no regard for humane practices and also leaves you completely removed from the process that delivers the meat to your plate.  I'm not saying no one should ever eat meat, but the way it is done in modern society is completely out of control.  It's literally destroying the planet, destroying people's health, and leaving a trail of misery and suffering along the way.   How about, if you want to eat chicken, you kill it yourself.   Here is proof that Earth is intact and not polluted or radioactive. http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/3158/why-did-the-people-on-the-jetsons-live-in-the-sky Scroll down to the second answer.

Old sailor's saying: Any port in a storm.   http://www.salon.com/2011/08/28/bisexuality_2/   A new world is literally a new world and an opportunity to do things completely differently.  Since we are approaching it from somewhere else we can do things after careful though and examination.  No need to rush in to things and much it up.  The very first things we should do is take inventory of the entire planet.   Where are the resources concentrated?  What areas are most suitable of habitation?  The entire thing should be in a database in a computer system so we can use algorithms to help make informed decisions.  We also have an opportunity to switch to renewable energy.  If we concentrate our efforts we can produce a network of a 100% renewable sources such as solar, wind, geothermal, tidal, etc.  Our goal should be to live an existence that both allows us to thrive and doesn't disrupt the lives of the billions of other species of life on the planet.  Sustainability is key.  We should absolutely leverage the power of machines to do all sorts of repetitive tasks.  I imagine that each city could have an automated garden which would automatically grow and harvest the sustenance we need.  These are just some quick brainstormed ideas, but the point is this would be the perfect opportunity to do things right.  All it would take is the will to work together.

Are you missing a "don't" from your statement?  Otherwise it sounds like you are saying that people mistakenly do drugs in order to lower their senses and that the way to remain with lowered senses is to not do drugs. Some might agree with this.   ADD is defined by the DSM5 as a psychiatric disorder: http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/ADHD%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf In order to "have" ADD one must meet 6 criteria from a small list of behaviors.  Can your behaviors change? Yes. So can you just "get" ADD? According to its definition and that logic, yes.  If you were objecting to my usage of my term at all because you don't feel it is useful or helpful to refer to the meeting of these criterion as a disorder, then we agree!  I simply used it for fun in more of a tongue-in-cheek manner like gay people affectionately call each other "fairies".  Also, there is a lot of ongoing research investigating the neurological effects that the internet may have on our brains: http://www.today.ucla.edu/portal/ut/PRN-081015_gary-small-ibrain.aspx As all repetitive experience does, it has measurable effects on the brain, and very likely changes our behavior, even if in minute subtle ways.  I think this is actually fascinating and I think about the prospects of societies neurological structure changing on a mass scale.  Perhaps something like a new phase of humanity?!  As for marijuana, I know at least some research has indicated a higher prevalence of pot smoking among those with ADD.  Of course, CORRELATION DOES NOT IMPLY CAUSATION.  It could well be that people who have those symptoms just also happen to like smoking pot =) (Or any other number of explanations.)  But it does seem like some of the things on the ADD list are quite similar to some of the things on the "marijuana intoxication" list.  I think similarly of the internet usage, these changes are not "good" or "bad" or "orderly" or "disorderly" (unless your talking about relative to the status quo, but that's a whole 'nother discussion.)  These characteristics just are, but they can makes a really big difference in the way we live our lives!  Now I'll speak of my personal experience.  I am diagnosed with ADD and I always felt like many of my behaviors weren't detrimental at all, but simply annoying to teachers, like standing in class, and asking tangential questions.  Other behaviors I did want to change, like failing to finish things I was excited to start, and have been pretty successful at doing so.  I smoke pot and I have fun and I get things done.  TL;DR Think about it.   Yes, I am missing your point. Please elaborate.   Why would anyone want that?      Letters From a Nut was hilarious!  When did you publicly reveal the true author?

How about the Wiccan Rede: *Do what you will, so long as it harms none*   Once in a dream I had a someone show up in my bedroom and asks me to follow him.  He flew out the window and I followed him.  He took me to the backroom of some building where there was a meeting going on.  It was a secret lucid dreamers alliance meeting!  In another dream, I tried to go back there by flying to the building.  I went in through the front which was filled with offices and cubicles.  I tried to make my way to the back where the meeting was and a woman in a suit came out and told me I couldn't go back there.  I told her I had to find out if it were real.  At this point she produced a pistol and pointed it at me! She said forcefully "IT WASN'T REAL"!  It seems to me like there are some dream figure who want the truth to be known (the liberators) and others who want to suppress the truth about the dream state.   He went out with a bang.   Except for the people for don't and actually do the things they say they will do.  We exist.      This is absolute nonsense.  Anyone who has experienced a lucid dream knows this cannot be true because they have been conscious WITHIN the dream and can recall the narrative.  Lucid dreaming has been scientifically verified by researcher Steven LeBerge who was able to signal from within a dream using a series of eye movements.      How is Piper a "sociopath"?  And Nancy?  Nancy was self-centered and narcissistic maybe, but not a sociopath.  Piper isn't even selfish.  She's just a young woman who made a stupid mistake trying to work her way through it.   Surprised noone's said "taxes".   What evidence? My personal experience tells me otherwise.   How do you "know" it is bs?   Like the buying age has anything to do with what age people start smoking.

Here's part two of the interview: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08zNQ_wO0D8   REM sleep gets longer as the night goes on, and it can range from 5 minutes to over 90 at the end of the night.  This is why you have your best chance to have a lucid dream at the end of your sleep cycle, and also the longest (lucid) dreams.  Personally, I've had lucid dreams so long I could barely remember how they started and were way too long and detailed to write down completely.  One technique I've learned for extending a dream I feel slipping away is the SPIN technique.  Try spinning in circles.  Often times when you stop you will wake up in a completely different setting. In fact, you can use this technique to teleport by focusing on where you want to be while you are spinning!   "You're only a breath away.  It may looks closed off but you're already connected.

Just read about Tchaikovsky's relationship with his servant.    I would like to add that on reddit, in the comments, I observe so  much disrespect and violent thoughts directed at women that it is repulsive.   Not to mention appalling grammar and diction.

 Are you making the case that CA is not full of entitled asshats? Because I would make the case that the entitled asshats here are just so used to us that they ignore us mostly.    Nope, not rich neighborhoods. You and I, we're almost neighbors actually, I'm in Novato at the Delong exit.   9er's games? Who want's to pay those prices.

I was living at 135th and Metcalf when I was there, so I was already used to high rents for small apartments. The truth is that after the dust settled our monthly budget only moved up by about $150, and the additional money at my job more than made up for that.   I moved from KC to SF three years ago.

But I love him, despite my genetics telling me that I shouldn't. It's a real battle. A year ago my wife an I had a daughter and I was surprised at how different it feels with her.

Just sayin'   If you decide to go with LabPython, best just to get it from VIPM so you get the latest version.    I was falling out of gaming as a social enjoyment just before Halo 2 came out. I was poor and couldn't afford XBoxes or games, and my friends were the same. So I never got the chance to play much of the Halo series after CE. Occasionally here or there at my brothers or a couple of friends who had intelligently not moved out of their parents' houses. By then my skills were rusty and Halo had turned into a 'thing'. Pwning had been invented, and typically I was on the shit end of the pwning stick. But CE... oh man, my CE days were so great.   I got a new roommate when CE had been out for a few months. He moved in and brought his big screen TV with him. He was so excited to play a little split screen on the big rear projection (One of those early Mitsubishi jobs that only looked good from dead-on). We played a ton. Most weekends, all through the day. My girlfriend (eventually became my wife) sat there with us, not playing, just enjoying the show. He never won a single match. Ever. He would practice day and night, trying to get better, and when I sat down I would still own him. It got so bad that he made a new standing house rule, I was relegated to pistols only. And still, he never won a single match. The conventional pistol paired with a fairly good aim was insane. That crazy three shot combo to lower the shields and a head shot to finish it, it was near unstoppable. I don't know how I was so good at it, probably the years of Goldeneye and Perfect Dark, but I had to have a near 100% accuracy for pistol finishing headshots in that game.   He didn't handle his losses well. He ended up throwing a controller through the screen of his big screen one day. It wasn't long after 'the incident' that he decided to move out.   I'm looking forward to the MCC. Being able to play through the stories I never got a chance to will be fun. I'm sure when it comes to multi-player I'll be lumped into the sub-par group with a K/D ratio well below 1. I'm old and slow, my reflexes dulled through the years. It's likely that you young bucks out there will have plenty to say about my Mom, god rest her soul. I'm okay with that. I'm okay with that because deep down I'm holding on to the hope that, somewhere, out there in the big wide world of XBone's, my old roommate is sitting there, controller clutched in his hands, one pistol headshot away from throwing it through his TV.   If only the left turner at around 1:05 could've turned a half a second earlier. The world might have become a better place for everyone.   Sorry, I've got nothing to add as far as helping diagnose the BSOD issue you're having. But I will say that is the most convoluted code I've seen in a while.

Good times, hope you had fun. I came to the realization on the Bandit, that while it has plenty of steam left at 155, I'm definitely running out of balls around there.   This whole story is tragic and sad. And yet, I can't get the image of you, finishing a can of soda while a fire rages in the forest around you so you can have a target to drop the tree on.   Looks like you had fun. Thank you for driving in the right lane while going slow to take your videos. Those of us who are crossing the Golden Gate to get home appreciate it.    I assumed, by the username. Nice, btw.   CLD, with the thinking of moving to a CLA function. Capable of working on object-oriented modules utilizing an actor framework-ish framework. 99% of the framework is there and complete, so it's a lot of building modules that interface with the physical world. Most everything is RT-based using 9068's on a path towards migrating to the SOM. . Some fairly cutting edge software as it pertains to LabVIEW software engineering. It's been an awesome learning experience for me, and there's still a ton of work to do.   I'm all for dropping sequence structures once they put an error terminal on the Wait function. Ha.  Actually, they have a lot of value when used correctly, especially in RT and FPGA applications for optimizing memory and slice usage. But using them to enforce dataflow is wrong, and bad, and the people that still do it should be publicly made fun of. :)   If I'm reading this correctly, the external application (in C#, Python, MATLAB, Cobol, ArnoldC) communicates with an existing LabVIEW program that pushes data onto a FlexRIO card at a rate of 100mB/s. Your goal is to extend the LabVIEW program and expose an API that the external application can interface with in order to push data onto the FlexRIO card.   If that's correct, there's a number of good ways to do it. TCP/IP is good and straightforward, but you'll need a parser on your LabVIEW-side to receive, handle, and respond to API calls. That portion of your code would be the bottleneck and need to be optimized to fit your specific need, i.e. can the data be buffered, what's the expected outcome from the perspective of the external application, does it expect it's commands to be answered immediately within the realm of network latency, does it need a response, does it's data need to get to the card ASAP, lossless, without exception, what happens if two separate instances of the external app (maybe a python and C++ instance) call the API at the same time, priorities, etc...? Lot's of questions there to consider, likely not in your immediate scope, just throwing them out there.   So, to answer your original question, TCP/IP is a good solution and probably a good first route if the API you have for your LabVIEW program works and is robust enough to extend.    Not to mention, the most un-LabVIEW-like answer. I'm sorry, maybe I'm over-thinking this, but I really hope that OP's class isn't teaching dataflow concepts and order of operations by enforcing sequence structures. This would be like learning Python by enforcing C style pointers.   Perhaps a more LabVIEW oriented solution would be to create a for loop that executes 'n' number of times containing the three LEDs and use a shift register to set the state each time. This uses a basic for loop, some front panel indicators and an expanded shift register. The most advanced concept here is the shift register, but one that I know for sure is on a CLAD test.

I tried Javascript in San Francisco and it returned nothing. Same for San Francisco, CA? For C++ in San Francisco it returned a guy named Francisco somewhere else. I think maybe it doesn't like a space in the name of the city. I tried Oakland and it returned a bunch.   I lost it at that line. Just imagining him trying to kick a door in with those carbon fiber things.    Difference of opinion. I don't think you fully understand the situation, nor can you, since you have absolutely no idea what it's like to have a one year old in the house, every day, with your fragile IG. I love my IG as much as I love my child, I'm making this decision because of that love, not in spite of it. Apparently that's the point you refuse to accept. Do you think if you just keep repeating the same point over and over again that eventually I'll say, "Oh, I never considered that." Is this how you convert your used-to-be-friends to child-haters? Have fun with your life jourtney. From the 20 minutes worth of interaction I've had with it, I'm glad I'm no part of it.  And, for the record, my off the cuff comment (similar to yours) about you not respecting human babies came from a half-assed insight into your post history, which, unfortunately, shows a fairly large disdain for human children, especially when they're involved in dinner. God forbid those kids should be allowed to eat with the adults. Funny how wrong someone can be when making inferences about someone else's life after only about five minutes of reading a few statements they've chosen to make public.    I'm glad you have an opinion. It's nice that your allowed to share it. Keep in mind that it's just yours, and made up of only your experience, which includes thinking human babies are lower on the respect scale than other animals and than treating your animals like human babies. Funny, my opinion is that it's a little strange for a person to make such a big deal about how their family dotes on the children and grandchildren in the family and than turns around and dotes on their pets as if they were children. But, that's just my opinion.    No, I'm not kidding you. Thanks for not considering procreation, we all feel like the world is better place without it.   No, you had no idea, but you still spoke. That's my point. Also, cross-posting to /r/childfree is pretty childish.  And yes, again, speaking without thinking, my dog not only gets daily walks, she gets daily runs. I run 2 miles with her every day. She also get's weekly trips to the dog park to socialize and once or twice a month goes to doggy day care. Her attitude isn't the issue. In fact, there's nothing wrong with her at all, which makes this suck even more.   Look at it this way, if I had a child that was in danger when at my home unattended (think, mentally disabled and needs constant monitoring) I would do whatever necessary to ensure the safety of that child, even if that meant relocating that child to a permanent care facility. Keeping them around just to make myself feel better at risk of their health is just selfish.    I've had her for 5 years, not 8, but yes, I still see your point. The bonding thing worries us, but again, not more than the worry of something serious happening here. It sucks, but I really feel like it's going to suck a lot more if my daughter breaks one of her legs and I have to have her put to sleep because I can't afford the time or money required to get her back to full health.   And yes, the rescue I'm working with goes above and beyond to find the right homes for the animals they adopt out. If they can't adopt them out, they stay at a foster home with other IGs and lots of open land to run it out.    I was waiting for this response and no I don't feel horrible reading this. And to think that we hadn't considered that and we were taking this step as a snap decision is pretty rude. We have tried to teach gentleness, however, with a one-year old, that's near impossible. I'm not going to make assumptions about you and whether or not you have children, but our one-year old is very active. Our apartment is not set up to allow for baby gates to make much of a difference, so apart from locking either my daughter or my pet in the bathroom (not really nice for either of them), there's no physical way to keep them apart, and I think it's way more cruel to crate my dog 90% of the time just because my wife and I's work schedules mean that only one of us are usually home at with them during the week. My daughter has just figured out how to get on the couch, which was Ella's only refuge, and unfortunately this was the last step that led us to this decision.  So, have a little bit of empathy and try to consider the following. I can continue to risk injury to my dog because I can't physically separate them while I attempt to teach an active and rambunctious one year old 'gentle', or I can re-home my dog to a loving and safe home where she can enjoy herself (likely with other dogs) and the owners can enjoy her.   Oh, and by the way, I know your comment was relatively off the cuff, but the 'other' dog in the photos passed away over a year ago, just before my daughter was born, actually. So there is no practicing with my other dog, but, thanks for reminding me that if only my other dog hadn't died, this would all be so easy.   Perhaps you should consider that four photo's and a paragraphs worth of information don't give you near enough insight into anyone's life so that you can pass judgement on them.    We love ours too, and when our daughter is older, I'm sure we'll get another. It's been great having her around our daughter for this last year, she absolutely loves all dogs now, but it's just gotten to the point where we're afraid for her.    We contacted Norcal IG Rescue, http://www.norcaligrescue.com/ and they're helping us locate a foster family, so soon she'll be available for adoption from there.    I totally would but we've found a wonderful organization here that's helping us find a great home.    Thanks for the link, we actually contacted Barbara (we're further north) from there and she's helping us find a great home for her.    We have an 8 year-old IG (Ella) who is great. We've had her for a little over 5 years, but unfortunately, with our one year old daughter becoming more and more precocious by the day, we are in a situation where we need to re-home her. There's already been two incidents that could've resulted in an injury her had we not been there to immediately intervene, and I would hate to have Ella suffer a serious injury because we're not quick enough to get there next time.   Does anyone know any people or agencies in northern California (Bay Area) that are able to take dogs and offer them a safe place to live? Health-wise she needs a daily phenobarb (which I think is pretty common) and her teeth weren't the greatest when we got her, so she lost some at her first few dental appointments, but they're much better now. She's definitely on the small side of the breed, only 6.5 lbs, but it doesn't seem to stop her from running and jumping like a mad woman when we go out. She's perfect with other dogs, or cats, and most humans once she warms up to them. She's skittish at first with strangers, but she's never had an issue with people for more than a half an hour.  I definitely want her to end up somewhere safe and loving, unfortunately, we're unable to make it safe for her here. Any help from you guys would be great. Here's a gallery with some pictures in it; [Imgur Album](http://imgur.com/a/vFKPp)    Agree totally. However, I was immediately angered at hearing that the Crew was pay-to-win, I guess, because they came right out and said it. I never even knew VIP existed in FH2.   PLOT TWIST TWIST: OP was at party, took original picture. Started gender riots on Reddit. Produced second picture of toilet after he broke it to prove that gender riot was stupid. OP = Genius Troll.   Yep, I skipped to the end. Only saw a happy dog.    I commute from Marin to Hayward for work. The up-tick of that is that almost every day I get to watch these awesome sunsets. I love this place.   [What she looks like now.](http://i.imgur.com/g9SfoG3)      But is okay to ride inside inside of a corner like that?   Wish I could upvote this more. I love riding in the rain because it gives me the chance to really focus on controlling the bike. I still ride at 5 or 6 tenths, but really narrowed in on smooth inputs.   That poor fish. He looks like he knows.   This is amazing. Realism conveyed to a more comic-y look with absolutely no loss of the emotion of the photograph. Instead you've created something that screams out what the photograph only hinted at. This version, out of those submitted, is my favorite.   Dead Island had the second greatest pre-launch trailer ever. The greatest being the Goat Simulator spoof on Dead Island.   Cheater.  Naw, just kidding. I miss my 636.      Ah ha, yep. I know the C, I rode one once. A buddy of mine bought one and I had to give it a try. It looks so cool, I just can't get into cruisers I guess. The closest I had was a XR1200R.    I was gonna say GS, but the fork holes in the triple trees look too small. What is it?   California, Mendocino County.   Yeah, using the controller to fast forward also sucks now, no fast forward controller, just analog stick right over and over again until it's at the scene you're looking for.   The voice commands are there, just not green on the screen, nor do they make any sense at all. No Go Back command, can't play from 90% of the app,  Yeah, overall, not happy with it.   Samesies. Also, calling in sick on Wednesday.   When you say the floors must be removed, you mean, the paint on the floor in the container needs to be removed, or the whole floor? I hoping you mean paint.   Have to be careful with MIG though. Probably want to do stick (GMAW) so you can use a proper filler rod to work with the weathering steel material and keep it's corrosion resistance. I've heard 2.5% nickel steel is the rod to use.   Although, again, a weekend welding class at the vo-tec school should offer something like this.    The wife and I have purchased land and are in the planning stages. I'm a software developer currently, but have a background in a lot of different stuff that includes welding, electrical, and general construction. I'm planning on taking it all on except for the foundation work.   That being said, I'll let you know how it goes. :)   As I came home across 580 and noticed the road was soaked I wondered if it had rained here today. Looks like all the way up here in Novato we didn't get any, but still, I'll take nice and cool any day.   I think his point is that the servers there are empty.   That's pretty awesome considering the toolbox.    His other attempts at the note. OP is a lying Red Pill posting faggot.    A photo of a fake message posted by the worst kind of liar. The Red Pill kind.    She is, classy enough to get away from OP's red pilling ass. He was the abuser and is now obviously an attention whoring liar.    It didn't, OP is a manipulative liar and a red piller.    He's doing the fishing. He's a red piller, he was the abusive one. Check the post history for his entertaining story on how he was brainwashing her into sex every day. OP is liar.   As a kid...? What the shit, that movie's only ten years old, who was a kid only ten years ago?   If you jumped into the pool from up there, you'd be okay, right?   Don't be stressed. I was worried about the falling forward aspect of it all, but it seems like mine is way more likely to fall on her butt than anything else.    I go to put my motorcycle boots on in the morning and have learned to just go ahead and shake out the toys first.   Yep, mine just went from that to walking, to pulling the sliding screen door off it's tracks in the last two weeks. Today she figured out how the door handle on the front door of the apartment worked and opened it up. Guess I need to lock that door all the time now. Climbing? Forget about it... no couch, chair, slide, step, or big pink sheep chair is safe from her. The dog's only safe spot is on the bed which is still too high for her to climb on. Other than that, yeah, it's pretty much a non-stop adventure of making sure she doesn't kill herself. So yeah, good luck with that. :)   I like the torque order numbering on the bolts. Glad to see I'm not the only one that can't do that shit without marking it.   I don't know, cous cous or Skittles or something...   Forget FPS views. I just want a top-down view, a' la Grand Theft Auto. Is that too much to ask for?   Am I the only one that likes putting kale in my smoothies? Frozen pineapple, mangoes, half a banana, some kale, top it off with vanilla almond milk, yeah, that's the stuff.   Why would they use a signed integer to represent RAM, a little weird, isn't it?   PTFO   Can't tell if you're just addressing OP or making a joke. Still laughed out loud.   The Panda? The Hachiroku? Is it true.    You mean, unsnapped right? Because you can snap music and use the volume mixer to adjust volume between snapped and main window.   I commute from Novato to Hayward. Traffic sucks. I happily risk my life for 45 minutes each way on a motorcycle because sitting in that mess for two hours each way in a car would have me eating a bullet.    I have those boots. I'm proud to say mine are much more worn. Same with my knee pucks. Same with my leathers.... hmmm... maybe I should stop falling down.   Anyone else notice the new menu you get when Double X-buttoning for snapping stuff. Way nicer than trying to figure out what's where and which screen is active and yelling at my kinect to play the freaking song.   I was waiting on Dunk's review before I bought. Glad I did.   Thanks for the advice guys, I actually took the test this morning. It was my second attempt. The first time I only got about half of the requirements tags on the diagrams and about half of those were just thrown someplace. So, yeah, that was a fail, but still a 63. This morning felt a lot better. I spent the last few days just practicing getting the basic framework and the three usual modules (Error Handler/Database Handler/Abort Handler) written as quick as possible. Went in this morning and before I even opened the packet I got to work on that stuff. In the first hour I had the framework done and before hour two was up I had all my modules built and the Main vi had all the appropriate cases in it. I used a queued state machine architecture, like in my sample test, but with half an hour left I had every requirements tag on a diagram with either accompanying code or a comment on how to implement, I had a #TODO tag at every not implemented or broken piece of code, and even a couple of fully functional modules. I took the last half hour to comment every control and VI about how they're supposed to work.  The first time I took the test, when I handed it in I felt pretty 'whatever' about the whole thing. I'm feeling pretty good about today's test, especially considering your guys' comments. I just did what I did before, but got more done.   I thought you guys call those things lorries?   Why is the pillion on backwards?   Sucks, but I'm glad to see the buses don't move for you guys down south either. I felt like I had to pass twenty stupid Google buses this morning.   Anyone want to take a look at the prep test I just did for the CLA and make comments or offer suggestions?   The repo is located [here.](https://github.com/iyeager2004/Elevator_CLA_Prep)   A few notes;  * I stuck to the four hours, even though a few loud people in the library caused me to have to get up and move a couple times, so I lost a few minutes for that. Not that I'm complaining.  * I took away a few things from today's practice that will probably speed up my next attempt (doing the controller states first will let me define APIs up front and than make all of my API vi's at once, etc...) I'm also going to practice a few of these regular handler VIs (error/database/abort) and try to get them done in under half an hour.  * I didn't look at the solution until after I was done. I had some similar ideas, but some varied drastically (I created APIs to queue states in my modules, their's has the controller pass states back and forth in the queues, etc...) I know that a portion of the test is graded using VI analyzer, but how much and how much comes down to some guys personal opinion?     Are people still considering purchasing Hardline? Just wondering.   Awesome trip. Next time set your sights on Mono Lake Hot Springs. Great roads up through Yosemite and the hot springs pools are the perfect relaxation after a couple days of riding.   I don't know about you, but I always test-fire all my rounds before going into battle.  	106
 he was in another show called the mimic playing the polar opposite of his character in utopia. very funny to see the contrast. funnier than the show actually.    mr robot  mr rabbit   math puns are too formulaic.    she left the abbey because she did have fucks to give.  	4
 The same goes with video games? Do you play them in chronological order or when they were made? Example:Kingdom Hearts or Metroid?    For example Star Wars. Do you watch New hope, Empire, Return and then the prequels? Or prequels first?    One of my favorites is "graffiti is for fags"    Graffiti found in the bathroom stalls or on the walls.    Reminds me of the Facebook girl meme.   	5
       i had also noticed that point.   schipje,yes i am agree with you which are you trying to say!  	4
 Supernatural. I can remember when that show was good. Now I'm stuck because of some weird misguided loyalty I inexplicably fell, but I wish they'd let the show die with whatever dignity it has left.   I know this is super, super late, and please forgive me for my lack of articles and details, I was a small child when this happened, and It's not something my family talks about, also my searches on the topic haven't turned up anything (feel free to dig yourselves if you feel inclined.)  My Grandpa disappeared mysteriously. I don't know the exact year, and I'll try to give as many details as I can.   My grandpa was career Navy. He married my nanny in the early 60's they moved around a bit, spent some time in Illinois, and a few other Midwestern places (my grandpa has family out there) and had my Mom and Uncle. Somewhere along the way they divorced, my grandpa moved to South Carolina, and Nanny went back to Virginia with Mom and Uncle. Grandpa continued to get the kids during the summer, routine divorce stuff. Grandpa remarried, all of my family (and his) don't seem too fond of his new wife, and think she's either (odd- the polite term i've heard or NUTS. The less polite term.) Years pass, Grandpa sends a few letters to Nanny, saying he misses her, he's sorry for the things he did, she's always been his true love, he hopes she can forgive him, and perhaps they can be a family again.  Not long after this my grandpa supposedly leaves in the middle of the night /wee hours of the morning to go 'fishing' on his boat. His boat is found crashed into some rocks, although his fishing equipment was left untouched at his house. They drug the lake where this happened and found nothing. It's probably worth mentioning that his new wife had friends on the local and state police force. The investigation seemed shoddy, I remember Nanny trying to submit the letters and such to no avail. A while later the NIS got involved (as I said Gpa was career Navy, retired with a high rank) and called the situation "suspicious" but nothing came of it. Grandpa was declared legally dead a few years later, I think.  Also, final weird tidbit, Grandpa's new wife started going out to her garden everyday and talking to it, and calling it "Bill's Garden." (my grandpa's name.) I think the general consensus in my family is that she or accomplices offed grandpa and buried him in that garden, and then her cop friends did a bare-bones investigation. I don't know, I believe I was 6 or so at the time maybe a bit older. If you want names and stuff I can give that, I left them out in case Reddit got angry for some rule violation.   I'm willing to eat food off the floor, but not lick a butthole. The world is funny, right?   I feel awful, but when I got to the line -   "The worst image was a man covered in blood holding a huge grey goose bottle over his head like a gladiator as he beat one of the grooms with it. "  I laughed so hard I snorted because what I pictured wasn't a gladiator at all it was more like- https://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2wkp897rY1rprxkro1_500.gif     A casual 'fuck you' from the state of Virginia.  Take that, Chicago!   *disclaimer this account does not endorse poop bombs  	5
 This was a buffet at a rather small hotel so there was one meat, one poultry and one fish option, two or three carbs, same for warm veggies and then a separate salad bar... Plus the death stares you got for - the horror, the horror- 'cutting in line' to get your meat first made everyone just tag along   Lovely imagery!  The woman in question was also morbidly obese and morbidly sunburnt. Oh, Mallorca!   Someone held up the whole buffet line at our hotel because she wouldn't let go of the spoon for the fries until someone had refilled the bowl. May i remind you, this was an all-you-can-eat situation. You can go back to the buffet a million times if you please. Yet she loaded 2 plates so full she spilled things all over the floor. The she also started a fight over a slice of lemon with a family member. (All on the same night)   Belgium has the option of euthanasia but my grandma still decided to go in a similar manner, just so it wouldn't be a big fuss. Found one vanilla pudding and seven bottles of champagne in her fridge, one for each of her kids.   If it makes you feel any better, I kinda felt for him... He's had about 20 flings and has gone bald since   My guineapig runs free in the living room. One morning we couldn't find her. Turns out she crawled into a narrow pretzel bag, ate some, fell over and got stuck.   My best guy friend told me he didn't love his girlfriend of four years (my best friend) but me. We both dumped him   My uncle's bus went down a hill/ravine in Venezuela. It was all a bit chaotic over there so he just boarded the first plane home and went to the ER. Had some broken ribs and cuts and bruises. We never actually found out anything more, apparently bus accidents in that region were common.   ... It's not like she's going to impose her own eating habits on the population. Pretty sure most of what she'll deal with is regarding money.   I once had swimming at school and forgot to bring a tampon so i asked one at the secretary (no nurses over here) and the guy gave me like seven tampons. Don't think he really understood how they work...   My dad always says that everything written on the internet is wrong. Apart from what he reads on the internet. That information is all factual.   I'm from Antwerp, Belgium and people from surrounding cities always say we're arrogant. There's this saying that 'Antwerp is the city and everything else is parking space', but i've actually never met anyone from Antwerp saying it.   Lovely to look at, but it gets pretty boring after like an hour or so    My grandpa was the youngest of 18 kids which resulted in his and his descendants' last name lacking a capital letter... Because his name didn't fit on the page so they had to write real small   (there's a nest of pigeons outside my bathroom window)   Soooo happy about that   i live in the low countries and stuff like that makes us shiver... In our clogs   studying... If you actually start on time it can be really soothing   that's not cheese   When I was 9 years old we had mardi gras (?) at school and me and my best friends dressed up as witches. Our teacher(who i LOVED) was going to take a picture of us together, but before doing so she pushed me out of the group and literally said 'not you'. Apparently she didn't recognize my disguise as a witch...  	20
                                           1. How is training for a fight with Manny Pacquiao shown to be different then your other fights?  2.  Do you *honestly* plan on retiring at 49-0? Any chance for 50-0?  3.  Who was your toughest opponent to date?   4. Was there ever a time where you were actually afraid that your opponent may be to much to handle?   5.

They fought together in the World Wars.  Why did our relationships go sour?       This actually happened last year and I can't forget it. I was driving my car to get some food when I hit a stop sign right by the place I wanted to eat. Crossing the street was a man in his mid 20s. He was moving rather slow but he was already to far in front of my car for me to beat him. As he got in front of my car,  he stopped and started looking around slightly but has his head down like he was looking for something. I was patient for about a minute when I came to the conclusion that he must be messing with me. Wrong conclusion.  I decided to honk my horn which startled the man terribly.  The look on his face is burned into my memory.  It was at this moment I realized that this man was mentally handicapped. He was absolutely terrified and ran away!  I felt horrible. I feel horrible.  To this day I remember this story anytime I get frustrated on the road.    Be patient on the road. It's not worth hurting yourself or others.    I purchased Battleship.  You need two people...  Story of my life.     Edit: lol the PM are ridiculous.  You guys are a friendly community!  I kinda meant that no friends available to play...  Hahaha it just hit me that many of you thought I meant absolutely no friends!!  Hah but you guys are super awesome!     It made sense.  Now I'm a ichthyophile.             What are the texts I should be studying and knowing that will increase my knowledge and help on my path.       Alot of players fall in the draft and still end up being great players others may have gotten.  He is a tall shooter with Dirk potential. His defense isn't horrendous and may spread the floor for Cousins. Being 6'11 and a PF can't hurt.                So I was with this girl for about 2 1/2 years.  Hot girl and really good natured.  VERY TRUSTWORTHY.  I was the flirt.  I was this I was that.  She was just a church girl.  University comes along and girl starts acting different.  I notice she was socializing with some of her coworkers. Told her I wasn't comfortable with it and she said I was over-reacting. I decided 30 different girls is better than 1 girl who is going to play you.  I broke it off, played around and landed a smoking hot girl.   As for her?  She has been seeing the guy she was "talking"  to for a little while now. Make the right choice.  Not the beta choice.  No pussy is worth losing your cool over...  Ever.    So my Gf and I decided to take a spring break trip to go hiking in California about 2 hrs from where I live. We carefully plan the trip as we will leave at 10ish and be there about 12.    So we are driving up to the forest when she tells she wants to check out this small town she used to go to. (check out trinkets and such I guess idk...) I agree and I Google map it.  About 40 min away..  But then I see a couple small roads that look like they cut angles and time off.  And obviously Google maps has no idea WTF it's talking about Ima do *my* shortcut.  Well...  It took us 20 min in and was a dead end... Drive back and go original way.  Gf rolls her eyes pretty hard.   We leave her trinket town and leave to the forest.  Once again we map it and I see another "brilliant" short cut. She does her half assed attempt to convince me other wise but I was sure it was better. We ended up lost for and hour and a half to only end up 25 min from where we took my shortcut. We proceed with the original plan..   The last one was while in the forest. We were a good hour into the trail when we deviated off the trail to see some site seeing. Well to get back we decided to go a different way then our original...  It is a loop.  Wrong...  We ended up wasting and hour and a ton of energy/sunlight. We went the original way and just arrived home.  She is pretty pissed off and asked if she can keep her jewelry where I am supposed to keep my brain...   TL;DR Went on hike.  Got lost driving.  Got lost again.  Got lost during hike.  Gf thinks I'm an idiot.  I think I'm an idiot.   On mobile. Sorry.    I have seen a lot of references to these names and would like some accurate info to the relevance of them in Buddhism.                         How is the overall department?  Professors?  Are there preferable professors or avoidable prof?    Are there philosophy meet ups?                2327 ad,  male insemination became possible and 2329 ad,  rebirth in of self became possible...  We didn't think of the ramifications!!!!             It seems pretty steep. About 1400 is alot more a month then I pay now for rent,  car and insurance...  Alot more.  Is it better if I rent a room off campus?                  Well this is unfortunate to say the least.. It all happened when my mom asked me if I could take her necklace to the jewelers to have it cleaned. First of all,  I didn't know you could clean gold so I laughed.  She explained that they do and how important her necklace is. I guess my father bought it for her years ago before he passed away.  It was a gold necklace with a beautiful gem in the front.   She wore it a lot and explained it needed some TLC. Fast forward to the drive to the jewelry shop. I decided to stop for some food.  Got my McDonald's and threw the trash in the bag and threw the bag away.  I arrive at the store and that's when I realize I can't find the necklace.  I search everywhere in the car but I can't find it. It occurs to me that it may have fallen into the McDonald's bag when I threw it away.  I drive back to the McDonald's to find the bag right next to the trash bin. Empty.  I lost my mom's necklace that she loved dearly...  I can't see her heart break again or it will destroy me.. So I have decided to make her a new necklace just like the last one.  I have the mold for the necklace and even the gem...  NOW ALL I NEEDS IS SOME GOLD!?!?!       If so what is its significance and why does Buddha have it?             Why isn't malaria a huge issue in America like it is in other continents?                   Based on ability,  style,  cultural impact/influence, sales,  hits,  longevity etc.    Who is the greatest of great?            8, 24 or perhaps both...                                              He explained "There are two things in the world that you need to know to be successful.  The first is never tell anyone everything you know"          I am a guitarist looking to get better at my vocals.  I'm improving but still far away from where I should be.  Is there any site or tube channel worth watching?   What are good tips to drastically improve my voice?  I greatly appreciate your tips!          Daughter 1: Dad,  why did you name me Rose?   Dad: Because sweetie,  a Rose petal fell on your head when you were born.   Daughter 2: Dad,  why did you name me Lily?   Dad: Because sweetie,  a Lily petal fell on your head when you were born.   Daughter 3: hghghdnbgh!!? dnbgh!??!  nfhriirb!!? Jfjebdjhcb!!??!   Dad: SHUT THE FUCK UP CINDERBLOCK!       Does anyone know why we didn't give him a chance but we gave so many other a chance...  It's hard for me to accept he is worse than Nik.                I am a Kings fan and we are in talks of possibly acquiring Goran.. This upsets me especially with how he is handling your team.  He is upset his brother isn't getting minutes? Upset they signed Thomas? Wants a max deal?  All of this is absurd for a good (not great) player...     They only got Thomas as insurance and 6th man potential but sounds like he took that personally.  Now your team is going to piss off Thomas by trying to shovel him off in delusional hopes of keeping Dragic... I say trade him and focus on the future.  Good luck.       http://youtu.be/A1a5QQoHh60                           [Look at this dipshit](/u/train_subject6818)          [This is Cousins I bought last year](http://m.imgur.com/IQfAmih)   [This is my new one...

 Oh my gawd yes. "Hey, are you even listening to me?" **Sheeeing!!!**   Quentin Tarantino- A film without references.   This is the end.   Repo men   American Psycho....maybe ;)   I still listen/ watch double toasted and rageselect. We need to stick together. I miss spill.   The original star wars, it helps that it follows the hero's journey format.  Also, skyfall. When it came out I saw a post highlighting that the cinematography is mirrored within the movie.   John Carter    The Lone Ranger      Green lantern         I can't call it for you, it wouldn't be fair.   I like it, it's not bad.   Texas chainsaw massacre created the slasher film as we now know it.   Yes, I think so. A performance is what ends up on screen, regardless of how it is reached.   It was in the original script. I think diamonds or jewelery. Tarantino decided not to use it since reservoir dogs already had a suitcase full of jewelery.   Law abiding citizen.   It is important as an actor to convey a real performance.   In this case the director took it upon himself to force a genuine performance out of his performers. A bad director would do this right off the bat without allowing the actors a few takes first but this is a proactive method in my opinion. It shouldn't go too far to the point of abuse, such as Hitchcock on the birds or Kubrick on the shining.   Yeah, I'm going to bring you something, alright. I decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't going have to come looking for me at all.    You must've seen the American version.   Where's the last man?   Up in the air? The terminal? Dog day afternoon?   Would you hold still, please sir?   I am serious, and don't call me Shirley.   You don't know what you're talking about.   BING-O!   Le professional.   Me too, please add a tardis.   Recognize the actress or any other details?   Best:Raging bull      Worst: Hide and seek   1) the bag wasn't a threat to her, the mercenaries were. A bag is just a bag.   2) that rooftop was teeming with hostiles, she was probably finishing them off.   3)true lies, when (this woman) drops the Uzi and it kills all the terrorists. It's funny and I get the point but it still doesn't make sense.   Edit: Jamie lee curtis   Basically, any movie with a bad guy, namely the Joker.   Talia al guhl.   Dark City.   Schindlers list   Shawshank redemption   Saving Private Ryan     Pulp fiction     Citizen Kane      Rebecca      Alien      Skyfall       Goodfellas       Memento      City of God       Cloverfield     The Wizard of Oz       The Lord of the rings trilogy      The sting      A streetcar named desire       The man who shot liberty Vance      The Godfather 1   2      No country for old men   In the U.S. Edge of tomorrow hasn't come out and won't until June 6th. If you have a good sense of humor in line with family guy you might enjoy AMWTDITW if not then go with edge of tomorrow. (Beware, tom cruise runs a lot)   Will Ferrell- Everything must go.   Equilibrium    James Cameron's Avatar....it's pretty and that's it.   Bill.   Maybe you guys can't hear anymore.   Mark Wahlberg.   upvoted CP.   Breach?   Most movies I never revisit. I might re watch a movie either because it's good (District 9) or to give it another shot at the behest of others (Napoleon Dynamite) or just old favorites (Jurassic Park). If I watch a film at the movies it's usually just the 1 time.   I would love this cast...if it were another film. Why have I never heard of this movie?!   Maybe I'm in the minority but subtle product placement is good IMO, it can help immerse the audience. I'm taken out of movies when two characters are talking and one stops to drink "soda pop". Just drink coke or Pepsi like a real person please.   Lol.   How does he look like W.W.?   Wow. I'm lost.    It could be that they had the boy, it could be fixed with a line of dialogue. That is, if they want to bring him back.   Azazel?   Jack as Joker. He brought the comical psychopath to life.   I would like a superhero movie about a new, original superhero. Or maybe just a sequel to chronicle.   Ha ha ha   Oldboy.   It's nearly a shot for shot remake. Personally, I prefer REC because since the lead is not recognizable it is much easier to be immersed. Also I'd highly recommend REC 2 for being a creative follow up film. Have not seen Quarantine 2.   Yup, When he came on screen I almost yelled out "Godzilla isn't a threat, I AM THE DANGER!"   Tom Cruise is a movie star. Other than in movies where his characters name is the title (Jerry McGuire, Jack Reacher) it can be very hard to name his roles.    An actor is an artist who would prefer you know them by their roles. Kevin Spacey is one such artist. He IS Frank Underwood. Kevin Spacey has made it a habit to stay out of the spotlight in order to better blend into his characters from the audiences' perspective.   Well you're concerned with the "branding" of the channel to make it more popular. I'm asking why no new videos? There are 3 up at the moment and I'm curious as to why?   I think a "Jury of your peers" is an obsolete practice and there are so many ways to manipulate these individuals.       I'm subscribed to it and since I frequently use YouTube I see it in my subscriptions lists.    I believe we were promised 2 videos a week. What's the issue? Are folks not sending in their rescues? Is there no time to edit and reformat the videos? What's up guys?   Dunno about Casey but definitely Jessica.   The following (season) takes place between 1:00 PM and 1:01 PM.   Events occur in frozen time.   Like that futurama episode.   ...and there's the mental image.   The Butterfly Effect. Let's have our main character abort himself.   In Kill Bill Vol. 1, Beatrix is in the kitchen talking to Vivica fox's character about when she could call it square between them. Una Thurman actually makes a square shape in the air when she says this, my guess is its a call back to her pulp fiction Mia Wallace character.   It's an awkward season, especially knowing what was happening behind the scenes. It's difficult to find laughs in that season. Also season 5 was funny with Harmon back but was tough to watch at points with the departure of two cast members.   Nolan.   Ah, yes. You're right, I go back and forth so much it just sort of melds together. I'll be more wary next time.   The first Harry Potter or Lord of the rings(fellowship).   No there wasn't but the writers thought it would be a good idea to imply that Debra was in love with Dexter. Gross.   Dexter: incest. ;(   Not a difficult movie to follow.   Also the game won't be out for a while, a lot can change and be rendered and tweaked between now and release.   Long live the king in the north!    This sounds like information overload, so much to catch up on can be overwhelming and terrifying.   I would prefer a man-woman pairing with the man being jaded and cynical and the woman young and idealistic. An added bonus would be if he's a sexist but really good at his job, kinda like Dr. House. I am personally a bit tired of the rural setting so either a big city or a snowy locale. Both of these places can foster feelings of isolation. I think the villain should be an active serial killer who makes it a point to contact the police. Also, a twist would be nice but not that one of the detectives is the killer (lazy writing).  Edit: also we need more tracking shots.   Moon   [Fight Club](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaYzAkS_gRc t=4m27s)   I'm sensing you're a bit of a bitch.   :)   I'll [drop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_HuFuKiq8U) it here then.   District 9. It's important to find films that unite the two genres, romance and Sci-Fi.    The fountain is very good as well.   Danny and Sandy (Grease)   Joel and Clementine (ESotSM)    Also any teen movie, romance just isn't like that anymore.   On the plus side there's always the ones that probably do stay together.   David and Elise (The Adjustment Bureau)    Ron and Hermoine (Harry potter series)       I won't go that far but for me about halfway through i found myself talking to the screen.    "Um, Superman, you're killing an awful lot of folks. er, ok. Wait, what? why are you upset that you [Spoilers-](#s "killed General Zod, you killed like at least 2,000 people")."   but you can replicate parts again and again to make a new ship or fix the part that broke.   well if it can replicate objects from the past, i could definitely see them fixing the ship...you know if they stop being girls about it.   But if the key is outside, it shouldn't be recreated.   Can't get much more elaborate than primer.   Was he peeing on the sandwich? or does he...pee sandwiches?   The ending was "underwhelmingly optimistic." That's how I'd describe it.   yeah, i did that intentionally, i feel silly for some reason.   Dude. spoilers.   Money talks?    From the wiki page: " In the meantime, Russell manages to escape from Villard's men, after placing several un-pinned grenades beneath his helicopter, ready to detonate if he tries to take off."   Yeah that movie is just a character study of a mentally ill individual.    Gravity   Also the how to train your dragon tattoo trilogy.

I know you said no love movies but I could not stop crying in Time travelers wife.    If you're a fan of the first two, the 5th is a step in the right direction.   Final Destination 5. Only at the end though.   This one made me laugh.   It's darker when you know what the German soldier says: "Give up, you don't stand a chance! Let's end this here! It will be easier for you, much easier. You'll see it will be over quickly."  	109
 That's not a problem with the disorderly conduct law; that is a problem with the police illegally applying the law. They had no cause to arrest these people nor many others that they do the same thing to. Unfortunately, the NYPD will rarely ever punish them but any citizen that does suffer this unconstitutional treatment can sue the NYPD and the city. There is also the Civilian Complaint Review Board and the Internal Affairs Bureau (both of which are usually useless). I recommend suing as your best bet.  I'd like to say that I don't see abuses of power often but that would be a lie. Almost every day I am court I see some level of abuse of power. It can range from outright lying on the stand to searching someone without cause. And for the record there is no law against dancing per se.   Okay this is a little tough to explain. Everyone in the justice system knows that disorderly conduct is a completely bullshit law. These people's charges were dismissed and based on the info provided in the article probably by the prosecutor before they even saw the judge. Most of the time in NYC if you are charged with only disorderly conduct the charges will be dismissed or you can receive an ACD (adjournment in contemplation of dismissal). An ACD means that if you do not get in trouble again for 6 months the charges are dismissed and sealed.   Disorderly conduct has been challenged multiple times as unconstitutional but the courts have consistently upheld its validity. It is written in such a way that it does not violate the first amendment, according to the courts.   As a defense attorney I am not so sure I want this statute to disappear. The reason for that is because it is only considered a violation which is not a crime under NY law. Often times when prosecutors can't or won't dismiss a bad case they will offer the disorderly conduct plea even when disorderly conduct has nothing to do with the original charges. Or sometimes they offer it even in a good case if there is a reason they feel the defendant does not deserve the punishment he or she is possibly facing. This plea allows your client to avoid a criminal record and avoid risking losing at trial. Some defense attorney are a little too willing to have their clients take these pleas but I can definitely say that there are times it is overwhelmingly beneficial for my client to take it.   Here is some other information about it: http://newyorkcitydefense.com/disorderly-conduct-new-york.html and http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/opinion/sunday/inside-the-warped-world-of-summons-court.html?smid=pl-share  I'd be happy to answer any questions I can about it.    It seems they were arrested for disorderly conduct, [New York Penal Law 240.20(5)](http://law.onecle.com/new-york/penal/PEN0240.20_240.20.html) . The NYPD does this all the time.

Thanks to his time travel, Earth rotated 42 milliseconds faster on it's axis while he was here, thus preventing the tip of the solar emission from hitting Earth. According to calculations, had 20141220 not traveled back in time, Earth would not have rotated faster, and at the time of the solar storm, the tip would have hit Earth, taking all the lights out. Therefore, this was not all a lie. The truth is.... we have been saved.                           I'll be honest.... I kind of believed there was a possibility for the lights to go out, though I doubted it would be as severe as described. And yes, part of me wanted this big change.

I actually have never taken any CSS class before and only get my styles by editting others' stylesheets, so I am inexperienced. My subreddit is named /r/CrazyCows . Thanks in advance for the help.             The Praxis of My Method, underscored by all necessary humilities and good graces. Let's jump right into it and grab as many electron rings as we slide down the pipeline of letters, doers, willers, thinkers, feelers, wishers, commanders and demanders... The state of mastership is to be at all times consciously and positively in receptive and gracious attitude. Open to all good and positive powers to flow through you is a paramount condition, and to direct them in the proper channles of good thoughts, words and deeds the further fruitage of the tree of eternity (the fully restored cosmic ego). All around us, at all times, are the titanic forces of the entire universe, unique in our present positions, which seek forever to enter into and transmute you and themselves according to laws which can be discovered and harnessed for the good purposes of uplifting the estate of life and sustaining the vitality of being. These transmissions from the infinity expanse of complex diverse forms and minds encounter no resistance when in proper channels from the Master/Mistress of their own Destiny. To find the hidden music of the moment is to establish the master rhythm with the body and from the body back to the world. It relinquishes the dependency on the fetal impressions of the mother and the world at time of conception, pregnancy and delivery (the first causes of all subsequent causal reactions and responses) as well as memory dependence on negative and adverse surroundings, coincidences and influences. This establishment of the master rhythm was accomplished in a variety of elementary procedures in the ancient schools, be they Hebrew baptism, the Babylonian-Dravidian heat tests, the Egyptian endurance tests, or even the somewhat less known tradition of live burial for purposes of feeling the earth itself in full exposure to the earth itself, vaguely popular amongst certain lesser known mystery cults. Only those who can read this and already understand the value of it without having to do it will be sufficiently advanced to proceed with deeper lessons. Atavistic remonstrance is worth it's weight in immediate experience. Don't re-invent the wheel itself. In the Great Work of Mastery, the main and the only object is to attain communion with the harmonious creative power of the world and consciously joining the forces for solving the destinies of the Evolution towards Immortal Oneness. The first steps along this infinite journey involve a mastery of thoughts and through the thoughts a mastering of the body; the dynamic so established releases hidden potentials through the energetic activation of previously energy-starved processes. Many definitions of mastery exist: to overpower, to subdue, to rule, to possess dominion, superiority and victory of beings conscious of it. Consider further that man is generally in a state of slavery of one sort or another. Everywhere you look you see people in one state of involuntary bondage after another, and all of them creating more chains to bind those who are not bound like themselves. This slavery is produced by ignorance on any of the planes of manifestation (the short list being physical, emotional, intellectual and psychic) and any combination there of. Ignorance is imbalance at best, and many other horrible things at worst. Competition amongst the slaves of the world for the supposed benefits of further bondage has resulted in an almost penal atmosphere, wherein every breath brings anxiety and fear, and thus agitates and depletes the reserves of energy for the body and the mind to function as a healthy union of the forces. This condition, of pandemic psychosocial slavery is one that must be overpowered, must be subdued, has to have a ruling decision made over it, and be possessed by the dominion of a new system, superior and victorious for Man and the Forces alike, to bring about the revitalizing and vast expansion of expressions of each, to sustain the world and even turn deserts into paradise. And towards a paradise on Earth one has lent the ears that heard that the words mystic, occult and magick get thrown around pretty commonly today, and so I wanted to recapitulate how I am wont to believe them to mean. Mysticism is born from careful observation of impressions through supersensitive channels, both biological, psychological and technological. It can be a state of mind alone, but it is also the observation of that state of mind in the midst of being it. Occultism thus becomes the correct interpretation of that which can't be seen at the same time what is seen is also interpreted as the effects, causes, or side-effects of the invisible properties and objects of the world. It is engaged through a soulful conscious discrimination between assembling data. Magick must follow suite and make manifest the practical application of mysticism and occultism; the powers of creation, destruction and transmutation in action at the behest of a will possessed of self-solidarity and worldliness to make things happen or not happen according the truth the magician holds at heart. Yes, so in measure the mother of invention herself embraces those moments when her offspring manifest the 3 overmentalities. In a word or thrice spoken lesser worlds, finding no other solution to the problem of YOU, decided to feed yourself back to yourself and make you even more YOU, which solved two problems with one philosophy's stone. You couldn't escape yourself, and the world learned all about you while containing you completely in a binding of self-other-self-grammar. The attempts of the limp world to contain you only fail because it is now seen as a foreign taste which now has to get you to like it too, and you only will if the world becomes you itself, which it will make small concessions too, and progressively, if conditions are correct your central sphere of influence will now have a probability-spreading shell of orbiting factors that serve you because they became you, and being you can't speak to you in anything other than your own voice, so they are themselves mute, and you face the second entrapment. The breakdown of those orbiting elements in their exposure to an external world that is now less familiar with your ultimate self, is slowly becoming familiar with your extant orbiting self-satellites, and since the world still has to trap you and them it binds them in the same procedure it used to bind you in the beginning. Take heart, the world CANNOT learn, it can only grow and repeat. Thus you reach the third extension, and the snapping of the leash, that of the world's reflexes becoming your own, and now you can interact with the world through decaying aspects of your own history and new aspects of your present and future, safely for the first time, because now the world can only see itself in you. Fortunately you think now of an "orange" and the taste of it, and the funny architecture of it, and remember all the arrangements of situations that presented the orange to you, and foresee all the memories of the orange as it is. New tones enter your life and your satellites learn new forms of communication and the amount of acquired information about your universe expands exponentially, taking you to a new level, wherein you become self sustaining in a way that the world no longer can effect. Thus you have attained a harmonized consciousness. Eternal satisfactions are not yet too far ahead.   Is this subreddit dead and abandoned?

I got rejected from most colleges, despite my 4.0 GPA(weighted)/3.8(unweighted).... just because of that stupid SAT score. My classmates made fun of me too. The day of the test, I was very sick and it resulted in a very low score despite having taken(and **wasted over $1000** on SAT prep) 2 SAT prep courses, wasted 2 summers studying hard, and sacrificing regular school studying.

 What is the french police force trained exclusively on call of duty? "we should equip our sharpshooters with submachine guns" makes sense...   Check your local walmart.

Don't help the gougers out anymore.   because I myself am not in my mid 70's...   just the mun, gotta figure out how to get ol' johnsby home now...      check out that ASStronaut   Sorry for the disregard, everyone, stopped at the local hardware store and picked up 3 different o-ring sizes (don't ask me which, i just eyeballed them off the wall basically). Slipped the largest one i got on there nice and tight and, what do you know, slop gone. Thanks for saving me the $35 folks.  	7
 well, if you're not hurting anyone, including yourself, I believe there is nothing wrong.     The problem is that sometimes laziness gets in the way of you pursuing other things that makes you happy.   	2

 With gay issues largely eliminated by the recent Supreme Court decision, the 2 parties that rule the US have to preserve *some* [wedge issues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wedge_issue), right?  If not, people might notice that *both* of our ruling parties are war-loving, civil liberties-stomping, pro-corporate, right-of-center capitalist political parties who don't give a rat's ass about average or poor Americans.   Is this surprising? This is the "[Starve the Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starve_the_beast)" strategy. It's been advocated and used by the far right to privatize/corporatize government for decades. They're now doing the same thing to public education.  From the point of view of capitalists, public ownership of anything is an error; why have publicly-owned services/institutions when you can have privately-owned for-profit corporations?   "Theres class warfare, all right, but its my class, the rich class, thats making war, and were winning." -- Warren Buffett, the 2nd richest man in the world.    So what about Sanders?   I hope he does well. He's clearly superior to any of the other Republicans or Democrats running.  But with that said, there's not a snowball's chance in hell that Sanders will win the Democratic nomination. Once upon a time, Sanders was a sort of socialist. Today he's nothing more than an old-school 60s-style liberal.  The rich people who fund the Democratic Party will simply not allow such a candidate to be nominated. The Democrats tolerate Sanders now because they'll use him to rope in gullible progressives and young people into supporting the Democrats. Then 1/3 or 1/2 way through the primaries, the big corporate money will roll in and they'll choose Hillary or some other Democrat that will push their wars and pro-corporate, neo-liberal agenda.  By the time the actual Democratic nominee runs against the Republican nominee, Sanders' rhetoric and whatever influence he had on the Democratic nominee during the primaries will be forgotten. Those gullible young people and progressives will then be expected to hold their nose and to vote for the pro-corporate Democratic "lesser evil" and try to forget that they're still voting for evil.  That's the way our 2-party dictatorship works.   Well, if that winds up to be true, it's time to dump Iceweasel too.   To answer your question, I don't know. But I do know there were protests by some Texans to the crimes committed by Bush.  Increasingly, on issues of militarism, the surveillance state and foreign policy in general, more and more Americans are seeing that there's not a dime's worth of difference between Republicans and Democrats. They're both war-loving parties aggressively advocating further expansion of the American empire, no matter how much it impoverishes the American people.   An incoherent cartoon.  The first 5 panels should be huge anvils, larger anvils than in the 6th panel.  The cartoon is propaganda because at no time did the EU/Troika intend on rescuing Greece. The 6th panel is accurate because Tsipras sold out and went against the will of the Greek people and finally accepted the EU/Troika's austerity (albeit in a slightly smaller form).     It should not be surprising that Russia is responding to the US' aggression and low-level warfare.  The Nat'l Endowment for Democracy[sic] is nothing more than a US government front corporation used to fund dissidents in targeted countries and to destabilize them. Every country on the planet should kick the NED out if they actually want to claim to be and remain sovereign.  The question I have for the other corporations that Russia intends on kicking out is if they receive $0.01 of money from the US government. If so, then it's a no-brainer that they should be kicked out too. So-called NGOs that receive government money are simply not *N*GOs.   Ahh, the old conspiracy smear.  Do you deny that the US government lies like I said above? Do you deny that they have committed unapologetic torture as a national policy and now refuse to enforce the laws and int'l treaty and to prosecute the criminals?  It's absolutely stupid to take the government's word about military and geo-political matters -- stupid!  Again, Texans' objections could be easily rendered moot simply by embedding reporters in the military units -- so why is the government not doing that?    Theyre not inviting any media to embed with the units, said Johnston, and its important for Americans to step up and look around and say, OK, what are you doing? Well, its secret. Not if its in public  its no longer secret.  Our evil government *routinely* lies to the American people and the world. We've seen they will lie to start wars, they will lie about spying/surveillance on Americans, and we've seen that our government will unapologetically commit the most heinous war crimes. Thus, it's only logical for people to be suspicious of these military exercises.   In this hysterical climate  and given a lack of detail from the army  outlandish claims have proliferated.  That's not surprising, is it?  The government could easily blow away these outlandish claims by embedding journalists with the military units doing the training. The fact that the government is not doing this *should* raise suspicions.   Iceweasel. The current "stable" version of Debian's Iceweasel does not have pocket in it, and I would be shocked if it is in any released version.  Debian's militant free-software attitude can on occasion be a PITA -- but far, far more often it's a blessing!   Yet another reason to dump Firefox.  Firefox was great in its time, but that time has passed and Firefox has now fallen into the category of non-free software chasing money as its top priority.   Parliament still has to vote on this, right?  It's time for the Greek people to rise in protest against this neo-liberal sellout and to put pressure on their parliamentary "representatives" to kill the deal no matter what Tsipras agreed to.   Syrizas betrayal has not only landed Greece in an even more nightmarish economic position, it has generated enormous confusion in the working classa dangerous situation that will only strengthen the fascist Golden Dawn party and facilitate preparations by the military for a possible coup.  *This* is the real risk... :(   Fences/walls seem like a logical solution, and sometimes they have some short-term success, but their primary function is their strong emotional appeal for the wall-builders.  History screams that humans are very good at breaching walls and the wall will fail in the long term.  Just ask the Chinese how successful their wall was at keeping the Mongols out, or how successful the US' southern wall is at keeping Mexicans out. And yet this story is about a 490' test wall? Good luck with that Hungary...   Fast fact: More people died in the *first* *year* along the US-built wall on the Mexican border than were killed in the *entire* *history* of the Berlin Wall.   Here's another "when" question...  We've seen Reddit's corporate response about censorship (even though the corporation has changed figureheads).  With the rampant, routine censorship that happens on Reddit -- *especially* on the very popular sub-reddits (news, politics, worldnews, etc.) -- censorship that has a clear pro-US/pro-western slant, how long before we can admit that this is far more than just a problem of a few rogue "moderators"?  One would think that the entire upvote/downvote system would be the "censorship", with moderators doing little more than killing overt spam.  But that is not the case -- instead the moderators are actively twisting rules to outright censor articles based on political views, all while Reddit claims ignorance and blames things on the "liberty" of the moderators and uses a "freedom excuse" of "just go start your own sub-reddit".   How long before we can openly admit that, just like the fact that we have used Muslim fundamentalists as US proxy soldiers for decades, the US is behind ISIS and is merely using ISIS for short-term geo-political purposes?  Can we admit the obvious now? Or do we have to wait a few years until Time or the NYT "breaks the story" long after it no longer is important?       While the U.S. waged a war in Vietnam 50 years ago with 2.7 million men conscripted from every segment of society, less than one-half of 1% of the U.S. population is in the armed services today  the lowest rate since World War II.  We should be clear about why this happened.  We no longer have a military made up of a rough cross-cut of citizens of the country. Today we have a form of Praetorian Guard -- an elite, privileged military force with little relationship to the country the military claims to serve.  The US government ran into *heavy* opposition to its immoral war on Vietnam. We all know about the anti-war protests here in the US, but in the actual military itself anti-war resistance was *huge*. This included not only the killing of gung-ho officers by US soldiers ("[fragging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragging)"), but all sorts of other resistance. The situation became so bad that in 1971 the Pentagon counted 503,926 "incidents of desertion" since 1966 and reckoned that more than half of US ground forces in Vietnam openly opposed the war.  Think about that -- *half* of the (mostly conscripted) US soldiers in a war zone *openly* opposed the war. That's an astonishing fact and clearly hints at a possible mass rebellion. (The documentary "[Sir! No Sir!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469589/)" on this topic is *definitely* worth watching.)  So what was the solution?  The Pentagon chose to adopt the exact same strategy/tactic used by the British Empire -- the "professional" army. This was openly and candidly discussed in military journals of the immediate post-Vietnam era.  So the US abandoned the draft of its citizens, increased military pay a bit, started massive advertising campaigns, and created a volunteer military.  The volunteer military is more expensive, but it yields two distinct advantages to our war-loving politicians:  * The first is that the soldiers volunteer for their duty. This means the military can easily squelch most dissent in the military simply by reminding soldiers that they volunteered.  * It means that fighting unpopular wars does not generate anywhere near as much public opposition as is generated by fighting wars with an army of conscripts. (And today we have the unending wars and experience to prove this!)  These are huge advantages. And they avoid some of the "problems" of an army of conscripted citizens.  For example, when the Egyptian people revolted against their US-backed dictator, we saw the disadvantage (or *advantage*?) of an army of conscripts -- the soldiers refused to fire on the peaceful protesters and the dictator fell from power. Later, when the US-backed/armed/funded Egyptian military overthrew their new elected government, the military had to use special elite units who would follow orders to slaughter the civilian supporters of the elected government to enact a reign of terror on the civilian population.  One problem of the imperial "professional" army is lightly touched on by this article: the military is far more distant from the people/country it claims to be "serving".  We see this happening today in the US. People give faux polite deference to the military and its soldiers, but we really don't care what those soldiers are going through. This is only common sense, since deep down many Americans know that the sacrifices of US soldiers have nothing to do with serving our country, but the military instead functions in reality to seize markets, complete corporate conquests and to wage imperial struggles decided by our out-of-touch political class.  The sad thing is that we know where this all leads. Anyone familiar with the history of the Roman Empire should know about the deteriorating republic, the economic decline, and the rise of rampant militarism followed by the seizing of power by tyrants.  But of course, we're a "exceptional" country. We're immune to history and human nature -- right? Right?   "I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class thug for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism." -- USMC Maj. Gen. Smedley Butler, winner of 2 Congressional Medals of Honor.   Are you aware that this story is about Yemen, which is quite a distance from Palestine?   One has to laugh at the embedded propaganda in this article.  For example, if Thailand was doing something the US approved of, there is no way the author/editors would have called the Thai government a "military junta".   Greece is officially not a sovereign country, and the Greek people know that it is certainly no "democracy" where the will of the people count.  Instead, Greece is ruled by unelected capitalists.  Tsipras should resign in disgrace, and if not, the Greek people should riot until he flees office.   Doesn't selling tainted heroin directly and negatively impact other people? Thus, your analogy is highly flawed.  Greedy capitalists have imported foreign labor for well over a century to make themselves richer. Today greedy employers eagerly seek out and employ undocumented workers to maximize their profits, and they are literally breaking the law when they do that.  But yet rather than prosecute the rich heads of these criminal enterprises, our corrupt government instead go after the "little people" who are just seeking to work, take care of their families, and to improve their lives.  We see this over and over again with our corporate-controlled government -- the rich are blessed and are essentially untouchable, and the poor are persecuted and oppressed.  Another example of this is the recent financial/housing implosion and crimes. Banksters committed massive frauds, almost destroyed the entire country's financial system, crimes that resulted in sinking our economy into a deep recession and causing *millions* of Americans to lose their homes.  But yet what do we see? We see simple class warfare at work.  We see our corrupt attorney general cutting backroom deals with criminal banks. No banksters go to prison for their massive frauds and the anti-trust laws are ignored and not enforced. And recently, the corrupt attorney general gets his payoff -- by taking a high-paying position with a law firm representing the criminal banks that he worked to protect. Again, just another example of our corrupt government refusing to enforce the laws against the rich and instead allowing poor people to be screwed.  You can call it "justice" to persecute some immigrant seeking to work to take care of his family, while ignoring the big-time criminals who are exploiting that immigrant. But do not expect others to swallow this warped view of how our country works.   "Theres class warfare, all right, but its my class, the rich class, thats making war, and were winning." -- Warren Buffett, the 2nd richest man in the world.   We're a capitalist society and worship greed and our economy.  The NGOs aren't really cashing in, it's more like they're making their jobs permanent and ensuring continuing funding for their corporations.   "Bureaucracy defends the status quo long past the time when the quo has lost its status." -- Laurence J. Peter.   It doesn't matter what the law says the penalty is about hiring undocumented immigrants -- like our anti-trust laws, our corporate-controlled government simply refuses to enforce the law. Hell, in some cases the US government actually warns the corporation/employer in advance (so they can clean up their act and get their books in order) and then sweeps in to arrest the undocumented workers who are just trying to work and take care of their families.  That's what we're supposed to call "justice" here in the "land of the free".   "All the props of a democracy remain intact - elections, legislatures, media - but they predominantly function at the service of the oligarchy."  Richard Wolff   But why bother to clone the dinos -- haven't you seen Jurassic Park and learned they're fraught with problems?  [There's an easier solution...](http://imgur.com/gallery/x85F3gU)   NPR: National Propaganda Radio.   Or perhaps the lesson should be that the apartheid regime should stop its ethnic cleansing/land thefts and follow international law and withdraw from the territories it seized in a war of aggression in 1967 and illegally occupies to this very day?   Two reasons immediately come to mind:  * Nationalistic indoctrination. We're indoctrinated to be skeptical about "conspiracy theories" and anything that is highly critical of the US government. This nationalistic indoctrination starts when we're young and comes at us in a gazillion ways, some overt and many subtle.  * The fact that the rich people that own the US corporate mass media^1 who are under-reporting this story are the same people who control *both* of the political parties that rule the US, and the same people who profit from US wars and control our economy.  Footnote: 1 -- Note that this article is from a British newspaper, not an American one. While I have no doubt the NYT probably reported this story, the NYT will both bury the story on its inside pages, spin the story and put the essential/damning facts at the *end* of the article where few will read them. Those are typical ways the US corporate mass media under-reports or "buries" a story.    There are good journalists and journalism you know.  Sure, there are good journalists. But every single human on the planet has varying levels of bias -- it's inherent to us and the way our brains work. Just something as simple as our core values introduce bias. And these biases result in varying amounts of spin in the writing of journalists.  I see The Economist as a magazine that typically puts a pro-capitalist and pro-western subtle spin on its articles. You might see it differently.  Either way, facts don't lie. We need to take the time to think, be skeptical, and to separate spin, nationalism and bias from the facts, and to then analyze only the facts reflected against our own core values.    If it was as simple as making it free, there wouldn't have been so few people attending college during the 60s and 70s.  Remember the times. Then the gap between the rich and poor was much, *much* less than it is now -- thus, a college education was less important. Also, good-paying, lifetime manufacturing and blue-collar jobs were in abundance -- again, a college education was less important.  Also, colleges and universities then had semi-hard requirements for entrance; a stark contrast to today where colleges basically will enroll anyone with a pulse and a HS diploma.   Costs didn't start to explode until universities became heavily subsidized and more people could afford to go.   It's more than that. Colleges have *always* been heavily subsidized.  The student loan/debt peonage system completely divorced tuition costs from economic reality, thus allowing colleges to go hog wild with new buildings and frills that are barely related to education.  The debt peonage system is banksterism gone wild.  For example, when I was a tenure track college professor I was shocked at what happened to the grading system. The "D" grade was essentially eliminated, and I had to have a very, very, very good reason for flunking a student. The reason? Because financial aid and student loans required a "C" average. The college (and I saw this at multiple schools) was simply shifting the academic standards to match where the money was coming from -- non-profit does *not* mean "immune to financial incentives/realities".  Watching clueless young college students get cash "kickbacks" from the student loans they were taking out was simply disgusting to me. They had no clue as to what they were getting themselves into. Dirt poor -- but rich in student loans -- working-class students paying outrageous costs for off-campus apartments, going on Caribbean vacations, and other similar luxuries simply made no economic sense in any sane world.  But that is the reality of the debt peonage system that our corrupt government created. And instead of changing or "reforming" the immoral system, instead the government expanded student loans to include *for-profit* colleges! Corruption and private profit: it's capitalism's way!   "Students who acquire large debts putting themselves through school are unlikely to think about changing society. When you trap people in a system of debt they can't afford the time to think. Tuition fee increases are a disciplinary technique, and by the time students graduate, they are not only laded with debt, but have also internalized the disciplinarian culture. This makes them efficient components of the consumer economy." -- Noam Chomsky.   The Germans *have* *to* humiliate and punish Greece. They have to set an example for countries like Italy and Spain, which also chafe and gripe at the austerity inflicted on them by their German banker overlords.  The entire Euro system is an abomination. It gives capitalists and banksters massive power and authority, but the common people are not represented in any real way. For those reasons, the Euro is undemocratic and we should be hoping the entire system collapses.   Good! Putin's position is right. It is absurd to the point of insanity that if India wants to trade with Brazil that the trade has to be done in US dollars.  That's not independence; that's not sovereignty. That is the US having a de facto financial empire.   It's amazing that our mass media describes Tsipras as a "leftist."  Just nationalize the banks -- problem solved.   "I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies...The issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the Government, to whom it properly belongs." -- Thomas Jefferson.    Why did Obama honor that when the generals on the ground told him it's not safe?  Because to violate that *agreement* would have clearly shown that the US is a pariah, outlaw state that treacherously breaks international agreements. We are that, of course, but for Obama to break that agreement would have *screamed* that fact aloud, screamed it so loudly and so plainly that no moral/honest person could argue otherwise.  Obama wisely decided to cut his losses and to abandon our immoral war of aggression. No big deal, it just meant losing another war; we've had quite a few such losses.   Yeah, he should've ignored that contract, that's what a good leader would do  Do you not have a shred of honor, truthfulness, morality or justice?  The only "good leader" that did such things was named "Hitler" and he is considered to be the literal epitome of evil.   "If certain acts of violation of treaties are crimes, they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them, and we are not prepared to lay down a rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to have invoked against us." -- Justice Robert Jackson, Chief of Counsel for the United States at the post-WWII Nuremberg War Crimes Trials, and later US Supreme Court justice.   I asked a simple question that could be answered with either "yes" or "no".  Instead of answering the question, you ignored it and went on to claim people opposed to the war are an "extreme minority".  That is lying propaganda. Even CNN had to admit 2 years ago that the "[Afghanistan war arguably most unpopular in U.S. history](http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/30/cnn-poll-afghanistan-war-most-unpopular-in-u-s-history/)."  The rich people who fund and control both of our ruling political parties have not learned a damned thing from losing the wars in Vietnam or Iraq. Rather than cutting our losses, declaring "victory" and leaving the disasters we deliberately created, our government is continuing to run up debt (largely to China and Japan), to saddle our children and grandchildren with more taxes and debt, and to impoverish the country.  Extreme minority my ass. We just don't see the views of the American people reflected in the corporate mass media's news reporting. Considering that the rich people who control our political parties and fund our politicians are the same rich people who own the mass media, this is hardly surprising.  Have a nice day.   "Of all the enemies to public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded, because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes...known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few...No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare." -- James Madison, Political Observations, 1795.    Lol yep we should have just said oh too bad!     Well, that's your suggestion.     I would have publicly produced the evidence of Bin Laden's involvement (assuming we actually had evidence), and had Bin Laden tried in an international court for the whole world to see.     Considering the fact that Russia was critical for years in allowing NATO to supply our troops in Afghanistan (especially during the time Pakistan refused to allow US/NATO supplies across Pakistan), it is highly likely that the Russians would have supported an international force under UN auspices to go into Afghanistan to deal with our former Muslim fundamentalist allies.     But we did not do that. We decided to invade multiple countries and bankrupt ourselves.   Thank fucking God people like you weren't in power on 9/11.     Are you saying that turning the entire Middle East into a feuding hellhole, invading Afghanistan and causing allies like Italy to leave the country in disgust with the US, *wasting* thousands of American lives, *countless* Afghani and Iraqi lives, and wasting *trillions* of dollars on fruitless wars of aggression was actually a *smart* move?     Those wars you celebrate have ruined our economy, have impoverished the American people and have shat whatever moral high ground we had down the toilet. Today the people of planet earth [see the US as the #1 threat to world peace](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/02/greatest-threat-world-peace-country_n_4531824.html).     This should cause one to ask who are the *real* "patriots" and who are the *real* "anti-Americans".   "In the future, I want my children to grow up with the belief that what I did here was wrong, in a society that doesn't deem that idea unpatriotic." -- 22 year old US Marine Alex Horton.    Can anyone explain this to me?   Sure. It's the same dynamic of people citing the BBC, PBS, NPR, Voice of America, the CBC or any other state-sponsored media outlet.  *Every* media source applies spin. Some spin is overt, easy to spot and it raises our red flags (e.g. FOX News). Other spin is very subtle, seemingly objective, it bypasses our defenses and it is much harder to spot (e.g. NPR or the BBC). But the fact remains that *all* media sources apply spin.  RT is quite open about their spin -- bluntly saying they report news from the "Russian perspective". RT runs commercials using John Kerry's statement about RT being a "propaganda bullhorn" to highlight their bias.  We'd be a god-damned fool to assume that PBS or the CBC does not similarly spin news and report the news from the perspective of the governments that are funding them -- fools.  With that said, the issue becomes this: Separate the spin from the facts. Then ask yourself if the facts are true or if the media source is *lying.*    What if we started our own conference for our community on reddit or our own light political group?  A conference oriented around a for-profit corporation based on advertising.  Hmm...  Wouldn't it be better to work organizing your friends and neighbors in your real-life city, and working with other existing socialist/leftist groups? Wouldn't that have far more potential for *real-life* political impact and change?  Reddit might be fine for the moral support of a "choir", but online activism is essentially a diversion with little or no political impact.   We could have the mixed democratic grouping of left perspectives that the American left has never had.  In the hey-day of the US Socialist Party, Eugene Debs got 6% of the vote of the American people in one election. Then came WWI and following the war the "Red Scare" and suppression of the Socialist Party, including everything from imprisoning socialists to American Legion goons burning down party headquarters in some cities.  Perhaps your first task is to get familiar with actual US history...   American history to be proud of: On Christmas of 1971, Vietnam Veterans Against the War seized the Statue of Liberty for 48 hours and draped it with a banner demanding "Bring our Brothers Home."  	37
 ET. I was terrified. Then later that year my family and I went to universal studios and wanted to ride to ET themed ride. That entire 3 minutes was my small version of hell. Snot everywhere from crying. :(   those are great speakers, actually.      Hey all. New to owning any vintage gear so go easy on me :D I just got this receiver and after getting to know it a bit better, I have grown to really love it. There are some kinks however: -Upon opening the box after getting it from my FedEx man and plugging it in, the left channel produced a very fuzzy, uncentered sound. After playing around, it seemed to go away. This was all in while my turntable was plugged into phono. Aux seems to work ok in that regard. Phono later seemed to work fine. Used for a few days and no issues. After work today I played a record and the left channel seemed to do the same thing but after switching to aux and back to phono, that fuzzy gross sound was gone. I feel like it needs a few to warm up. Anyone else have similar experience? -While plugged into aux and with phones plugged in, the volume in the left channel decreases suddenly w.o warning.  -Overall, the left channel is more muffled than a crystal clear right. I tested the speakers and it is not them. In the mix, it all sounds balanced and really warm. I have checked both the main and remote channels and they produce the same sound.  -In the end, I love the quality of sound this thing produces. Overall, my Technics can play many records and sound great especially if I am spinning vintage records (Rush, Steely Dan, Police, Steve Miller Etc) and even sounds great with the newer stuff (Glass Animals, Sharon Jones, Flylo etc) It seems to me that hiccups only happen within the first 10 minutes off a cold start. I am wondering if these little quirks are all part of owning awesome equipment like this and if anyone has similar problems and how they deal/dealt with them. Thanks all!   listening to my dads "Aja" right now   Just found out my dad has an Technics SA 303 from when he was in school in the 80s. Were gunna grab it out of storage this weekend. Super pumped. Still curious as to why Home Theater receivers made 20 years later just dont cut it for audio. Appreciate the info!   Hey all. Looking to upgrade receivers as I have been using an Onkyo home theater receiver for a while now. Any recommendations for casual listener like myself? Anyone familiar with Technic's receivers at all? Would really appreciate some ideas.    It was about 69 degrees. It was in the fermenter for aprx 4.5 weeks. It tasted pretty good but it did have a soy sauce aroma.    Hey all. Just bottled our dry Irish stout yesterday and I noticed that it had a soy sauce smell. Gave it a taste and for an uncarbed, room temp beer, it had the right flavor and an aftertaste reminiscent that of a guinness. I am sure its all part of the beers progression to my glass but wondering if anyone else has had a similar smell upon bottling their dry stout. Cheers!      If you're asking me about price, you're barking up the wrong tree. :D      My gallon batches go crazy by the next morning! Makes me very happy    Thanks for the info. Looks like this yeast was packaged in April -____- Thought that it would be enough. We pitched a second package of dry yeast in there. I would rather over pitch than under pitch. If I do a full boil, does that mean I would require more yeast for fermentation?   no I didnt make a starter. Kinda new at this. But I know there is no action because the airlock is dormant and my carboy is krausen free. Looks the same as it did when I put the wort in the fermenter two days ago. Maybe its slow to start? Temp in the room is about 68. Kinda wondering whats up at this point.    So I am wondering why this Dry Irish Stout is not fermenting. I usually use dry yeast but I tried out Wyeast's Irish Ale liquid variant. Every other batch I have done, extract or all-grain has started to ferment within 6 hours. Its been 2 days and literally nothing. I decided to pitch some dry ale yeast I had around. Its pretty fresh so hopefully something will happen  soon. Any ideas or thoughts from previous experience reddit??   Nice lookin mugs/brew! congrats   Just one quick Q. How much of my hops should I add to my kettle pre boil? and if it only a percentage, when should I add the rest? Thank you for the help!!   Thanks! Just to clarify are you saying that it should be at leasts 2 weeks ish in the Primary?  Also, what would you suggest the proper mash thickness should be? 1.25 qt/1lb grain?   Trying this recipe this weekend! Any tips?    Thanks for the reply. I know that the ring is normal but what about those white particles above the krausen?   I attempted an all grain brew for the first time. Didn't really smell too nice after the boil. Before it was awesome. Kinda smells odd now. Then I see these white things on the side or my fermenter after 3 days. Any ideas? Is this an infection or should I not worry? I'm tempted to dump it an try again for real in a week or so. Its only like 2 gallons.   http://imgur.com/d8Jb1jG http://imgur.com/0K0iNR5   next brew day!   Wow I really appreciate this! Thanks a lot. I will definitely try this soon and get back to you. As soon as I get this 8 Gal kettle I can definitely do a 5 gal full boil and not be as paranoid.   I do have one question. When you say add hops to the secondary, is this immediately after I transfer it from the primary after initial fermentation?   	24
 Your ways aren't evil, it sounds like what everyone goes through.  I'm not trying to make your problems sound insignificant, but if you keep calling it evil it will make you feel terrible about yourself....  And masturbation is fun and healthy.   K   I'm not getting what you're throwing I guess.  How can my assumption be that off if you affiliate with a Christian religion?   I assume that since you identify under a certain denomination,  that you have at least minimal respect for the book.   I don't claim that there are *any* books written by anything but fallible humans...   But I sure as hell wouldn't do anything as drastic as follow a religion written by them.    I mean fuck, a lot of people think the Mormons are crazy because a couple hundred years ago Joseph Smith talked to God and created a religion.  If someone does that now, we put them in the psych ward.  What the hell is the difference?  In my eyes, crazy people wrote the book you're defending.   Why would you live by a book that was written by fallible men?   You know people are born gay and don't have a choice, great.    The fact that they can't control their orientation is something that hasn't been known for a long time.  When all we had thousands of years ago were lines like this to refer to,   "If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them."-Lev.20:13   ...people were well convinced it was a choice.  But thats humankind for you, learning evolving, continuing to gain information. You are helping me make my point.    *This book has gotten things wrong.*   I know what you might say, "of course a book written so long ago wouldn't have all the answers..." "it must be interpreted correctly to understand it's significance/meaning..."  but it got equality wrong, a human right that people are still fighting for!  People shouldn't be able to  blame it on the interpretation or time it was written.  Not acceptable to me, considering how many people live their life hanging by every word of that book.     Who is telling you that the bible, or any part of the bible, is not meant to be taken literally?  The only answer that I'd accept is God, or the people that wrote it.    Since they're not here to explain themselves, it's up to the people who preach to the masses with their own ideas, interpretations and agendas.   5,700 and 10,000 years, I'm sorry.  And when I say, "that's what the bible says," I'm only speaking of a literal *interpretation.*     You are an example of what I'm talking about, no offense.  If you literally interpret it, it does say the earth is that old.  "Young Earth creationism (YEC) is the religious belief that the Universe, Earth and all life on Earth were created by direct acts of the Abrahamic God during a relatively short period, sometime between 5,700 and 10,000 years ago. Its primary adherents are those Christians and Jews who, using a literal interpretation of the Genesis creation narrative as a basis, believe that God created the Earth in six 24-hour days."  Edit:  Like you said, you can easily say that a literal interpretation of Genesis is ludicrous because the age of the earth has evidence that it is billions of years old.      But is that how everything will go in the bible once we find enough evidence against it?     No.  They might have a hard time admitting to themselves they feel that way, but never in a conversation or debate has any Christian admitted that to me.  If it was my religion, and I felt like the only connection I had to a religion was a holy book, I'd feel the same.  I feel like questioning the book, would be the start to losing faith.   I agree with you that there are different genres of the bible.  I really should have worded it better, because you are absolutely right.  Let me put it this way.  I'm not referring to the miracles, the prayers, the mythical creatures.  I'm talking about history, human morality, very black and white topics where there isn't and shouldn't be a gray area.   Well, I don't know how you'd come to that conclusion, I don't believe it to be either.  The Christians that celebrate Easter I'm sure think it actually happened.   I could figuratively be a sheep, but literally neither.   Some people?  I am talking about the people who have nothing more than common knowledge on the subject.   Every religious person that has crossed my path, had their own way of interpreting things in the bible.    The ones that think the earth is 6,000 years old, take Genesis literally.  The Christians that believe what the scientists say to be accurate, say it's up for interpreting and that science fits with the bible.  Of course there are people that say science fits with the bible, because there's an overwhelming amout of evidence to support the age of our planet and they'd be crazy not to agree.  The same with homosexuality.  It's a sin.  Gay people are a large group, that are shunned by numerous religious organizations.  But then other groups say God loves everyone and excepts everyone.    It seems to conveniently come down to whether or not an individual is personally accepting or not of the lifestyle but they just blame it on the interpretation of their bible.    I just always wonder how people decide what to take literally, or figuratively in the bible.  Whether it be how old the earth is said to be, or the view on homosexuality.  Everything..  People will say that the earth isn't *literally* 6,000 years old, and that you shouldn't interpret Genesis as literal.    Who are they to interpret it the way they feel it should be?   Not only that, but interpret the whole thing the same way or don't.  The picking and choosing is all over the place.   O yes   In the span of a few decades we went from smoking on planes to grounding them over a match.  I agree that's its dangerous, but I could see how someone from that age might disregard the danger.      I want to help you, but I've never used that brand.  Pomades aren't suppose to dry stiff, the base it's made of is usually beeswax or oil.   But this could have other properties that give it that effect.   By far the best!   How exciting!  Love it.   Can I ask the time span that this covered?  I love looking at hair transformation albums like this, thank you.   Since facial hair is more coarse and resistant than normal hair, sometimes the formula is stronger.    It's absolutely safe if it gets on your skin, but if the color is darker it could stain your skin.  That's the only thing you'd wanna worry about, is staining.  So avoid the skin as much as possible.  Just lightly paint it on with a q-tip and let it process for the time specified.    Young Adult.  I just love Charlize Theron in that movie.     How old?   Definitely Chi flat iron.  If she requests a big curling iron, I'd get her at least a 1 1/2" one.  The flat iron is important to get a good brand, the curling iron, not as important.  But Hot Tools brand is good.   But while you are letting the top grow, you could fade the sides.  It usually makes the overall shape more desirable when the sides are shorter.  Her advice is sound.    I think that's an amazing question   Very common!  They do sell facial hair dye.     Is that like a 3 on top, 2 on the sides?  It's very short, but what do you usually do, 5 and a 4?     You must be pretty young   I've noticed, the times when it foams the most, there is some sort of cleaner in the toilet, or residual cleaner left over from the previous flush.  Might not be relevant, just my observation.   I like these the best, out of all these posts.   *I think I'm doing okay for a 15 year old with a wife and a baby.*   That shit cracked me up   I thought that emphasis was necessary.  I find many people saying there is this blurred line when it comes to attraction to the same sex for females.  A lot of women do it for critical acclaim, and I think that's where it gets messy.  It creates this weird stigma for the ones with genuine attraction.  My opinion.    I am female.  I *do* find myself staring at certain females sometimes, but I never reach the point of sexual attraction, ever.  I am very straight.  I find it hilarious when I stare too long.  But it feels like human nature to appreciate immaculate appearances. ::shrugs::   That's exactly it.  On the strip and under the Fremont Street Experience,  anything can be open, it's legal!  But East Fremont,  just outside the main drag where all the hipster bars are, is where the law changes.  The rest of the city is not open-container legal, just strip and under Fremont Experience.    What if she has been pregnant multiple times but has had multiple miscarriages and can't conceive?  And everytime she sees her face on a magazine with that headline she is forced to be reminded...   I've heard that the most simplistic is the healthiest.  Everything you listed are single ingredients, therefore the healthiest.    When it comes to overprocessed, majorly artificial,  super-refined shit, our bodies don't even recognize it as food;  another reason why it's hard to feel full on junk food.   She fucking nailed that Joan Jett persona!  That was the one movie that made me appreciate Kristen Stewart's acting.   Aww, you killed it.   Thank you   I'm so sorry, what happened in FL?  Has this already been implemented?       He's got your baby.  That scene in 2 made the scene from 1 scarier to me.   I didn't get through to the end of that one.  He was too repulsive.    It has the smallest molecules, stains easy and slips out easy.   I really don't want to sound mean, but it looks like an 80's jerry curl.  Maybe you should try it shorter.    He tastes like you, but sweeter.   I completely agree.  But I get the vibe he seems like a really nice guy.   I love the short-lived yoga in the park scene.     I think it's so weird that women can be divided on this, but I hate when a guy sucks on it!  Soft, repetitious licking feels the best to me.   That warms my heart.   In Her Shoes.  Toni Collette should have won an Oscar, in my opinion.    Bottom left!   Yea, you should feel the vibe pretty easy whether they say they are or not.  Good luck.    I am a stylist who is very comfortable with fading.  You may not find that everywhere.  Read reviews and find a good barber in your area.  Just remember to take that pic with you lol.   I think you would rock that style wonderfully.  Just remember to take that photo with you, because consultations can be confusing and it's not the normal way of fading a man's cut.  But, fucking go for it dude!   I agree.  This seems like a popular look, so it'd be easy to tell you with a better view of it.     It looks nice, a lot of different colors, I can't really tell what's going on.   We would really just need to see your hair.    ...I agree with you?  I feel like you're yelling at me.   Four Rooms!  Tim Roth, Tarantino,  Madonna... very interesting.   How do I get there   If it weren't for the believers of scientology,  there would be no scientology.  They might be pawns, but they fuel the fire.   They just did this multi-million dollar renovation on Caesar's Palace Buffet, holy shit, best buffet in town now.  http://www.caesarspalace.com/restaurants/bacchanal-buffet.html#.UlpiWaO3PFo  No one can argue this!   A miscarriage feels like labor pains.  It's terrible, I don't wish it on my worst enemy.  Instead of the pain giving you a child, it just gives you more pain :(    /r/wheredidthesodago  Funny, wholesome, doesn't make me sad.   I keep forgetting this specific movie scene.  Broke my heart.   They would post fundamentalist pictures, I'd share my opposing opinion.  They unfriended me, but last I saw on Twitter,  they now share my beliefs... I feel I contributed somewhat to their switch, but it wasn't my intention.    Soooo accurate.    Four Rooms!  Tim Roth, Tarantino,  Madonna... very interesting.   I respect your judgement on scientology,  but there is more bullshit in this world than you think.  My christian ex sister-in-law was forced to go to this place in TX as a teen.   http://www.recoveringalumni.com/?m=0#   Yes   http://m.reviewjournal.com/news/fine-day-hike-leads-blm-fines-red-rock Not in my town, they are assholes.   They don't put the employees to work to keep the parks up and running, but they make sure there are people working that can give citations. http://m.reviewjournal.com/news/fine-day-hike-leads-blm-fines-red-rock   You're not wrong, but he isn't either.  His comment is referencing The Fremont Street Experience, and your article's gray matter is just outside the Fremont Experience,  Fremont east.  As long as you're in the main drag,  drink up!   That's the magic I was hoping for.  It was this joint concert back in December,  he was playing with The Reverend Horton Heat in Vegas.  He was suppose to be out first.  Nothing was said, no one apologized, just a complete no-show.  The fucker.   I was really teetering, but I agree we shouldn't have responded at all.  There is absolutely nothing we could say, and after reading the response billboards again, I definitely agree they are probably the most juvenile way to get the message out.  This is a crucial time for atheism, we can't look lower than they are.  Those response billboards should've been so much more thought out anyway, It shouldn't be that hard to make Ken Ham look like an ass.   Is your job physically exhausting?  That would be a big factor for me.  But anyway, take off when you can, everyone is right when they say life is meant to be lived.   Yes.  Double negatives are fucking terrible.   This article says the opposite.  http://dictionary.reference.com/help/faq/language/g09.html  I'm not trying to argue but, this makes more sense.   Jello Biafra of the Dead Kennedy's... the asshole didn't show up.  I still think highly of him.   Before my grandpa died, he was sitting next to me when that music video came on.  He said, "He wrote that song because of his troubled life, and he knew it would be his last."  I thought it was sweet that he felt the song's emotions, I couldn't bring myself to tell him it wasn't written by Johnny.  No music has ever effected my grandpa enough to talk about it.  This definitely is a good one.   I enjoy my life in Las Vegas.  When you get away from the strip, we have some beautiful desert landscaping, beautiful master-planned communities, wide open streets and friendly people.  If you *choose* to be on the strip, we have world-class restaurants and hotels;  and don't forget, debauchery of your choosing.  I don't understand all the hate, if I go to North Town off of Fremont, I could find drug addicts.  They are there, they are in lots of cities.  But it's your opinion to hate our region.  For every bad area of the city, there are good.   Their ad is much more distasteful.   It is so insane that my situation is identical!  Ultrasound Tuesday. Was planning scheduling d c Wednesday.  All day Wednesday (yesterday) was unbearable pain and between huge clots was oceans of blood.    I opted for the d c to avoid that whole situation :(  but I had the brunt of it naturally.  They did my d c today, no more blood coming out, still have moderate cramps.    Hugs xoxo, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.    I'd like to help you out, but it's really hard to give advice when I can't see what you're working with.  If you can't post a picture, maybe explain your hair's natural texture and desired length.  It sounds like you want some asymmetrical style, and that's cool, just very vague.   I agree, you don't see that too often!   Expensive window cleaner.   Crybaby was always a cult classic to me,  then I watched it recently and I realized how cheesy it is.  I still love it, but I can see where people get the hate from.  I honestly haven't talked to a lot of people that have even seen it.   You can't really tell what's going on with the hair color in these pics.  Post pictures that better shows your hair color and we might be able to help more.  Edit:  If it's something you really desire, you should go for it.  There are some cons.  Short haircuts are a lot more maintenance and upkeep and the picture you chose is an intermediate style to achieve on your own.  It might look easy, but it is a little harder than it looks.  It's not impossible though, you should just be prepared.   Cherry Poppin' Daddies.  Everyone thinks it's shitty swing revival band, but they span across many genres.  Plus their energy and stage presence are unparalleled.    Sometimes toning it when it has a lot of damage makes it mucky looking.  I would let the hair cuticle calm down and do some conditioning treatments before toning.     There are so many medium blondes that would be gorgeous against your skin tone.  Brass doesn't suit many people.  Dont give up hope!   Stop googling!  Lol.  You have a reason to be positive, the heartbeat!  Stay strong mama.   Well, what he's saying is she doesn't have to pay til she reaches her destination... where the babysitter could pay for her.  Get it?   I'm 11w 6d.  We were so excited today my nurse was giving us a sneak peek, just for fun because my insurance only covers one US per pregnancy.  She looked for 2 seconds and said "it doesn't look 11 weeks, come back tomorrow for a size and dating ultrasound."  :(    I had one at 8w5d just for fun and it measured fine with a good heartbeat.  But now I'm feeling very sad.  It did look very small, but she didn't try to move around or find a heartbeat.  I'm trying to be realistic and not overly optimistic,  but we will see.   Edit:  Nightmare confirmed, will be scheduling a D C tomorrow, hope to see all you guys in the future sometime.  :(   Something pointless happened every two seconds... jesus, it was over the top with the cheap scares.   I'm curious of your critique.   Vagina bacon knows.   Well that's a good point.   It's funny because it's fake.  But for the first 10 seconds, my brain thought it was real and I was very sad I just watched someone die.  	103
 My are the mods of FPH dense, as dense as their subject matter =D  Keep patting yourselves on the back.  No one else believes you did a good job steering that ship.  Keep riding the ez-karma wave that is hating on fatties.  Congratulations for "staying under the radar" for two years, this qualifies as executive level management.  In what way did the mods of FPH maintain direction of that ship, it looked a lot like hoping for the best or whatever the fuck.   So we didn't need comeback mechanics, go figure.    WE were the gods that ran the show.  Anddddddd that is what we were all waiting for.  Point stands....the mods of FPH were arrogant, narcissistic, ignorant and for the most part clowns incapable of managing the beast that was FPH.  What makes you think that mod-group had what it took to run something that big?  In what way did the moderators of FPH display a fine-course in management worthy of academic case study?  Please I'd love to hear, because FPH had no clear direction, although it's content was clearly going downhill.   You seem to think your opinion matters at all. Not to mention WE were the ones that made it big.  And no they did't make it big, we just like to hate on fatties. FPH-mods invented this past-time.  The egos are real.   WE were the ones who made it the best it can be.  Do you see where this is going?  These ass-hats were just patting themselves on the back for some illusory achievements.  Sense of reality and foresight were not skills that the mods possessed, therefore FPH died.  Keep pattin themselves, let's see where that gets em.   I cant believe no one is mentioning the game that was popular before DotA...Rival Nations!   Oh Reddit, shit posting on sundays at maximum!   Once you go black, you never go back.   Why is this so?   Use your head, that for which you think FPH was for was not always what they claimed; 2nd the point still stands the mods could not control what they were tasked to control.  Therefore, they lost that privilege.  They just weren't a capable bunch, they did their best but was mostly patting each other on the back.  FPH was for hate, but the mods just didn't know how to control it, they keep saying that it's not up to them to police outside, but they couldn't even control what was happening "within their borders."  So it matters not what you think fatlogic or FPH was for.  FPH was a safe haven until the mods failed to keep up with its evolution.  If the mods quit their ignorance/arrogance, they'd have prepared for this battle with the admins ahead of time, not kick scream like little dimwits after shit hits the fan.  "FPH FPH FPH, we're not about we're not about hate"; but when someone calls them out for toxic behavior, they claimed it was just to shame fat acceptance; however when retorted with "it's not really a place that shames fat acceptance," they claim "it was never about such"...yea pretty elementary style of retort...nuh uh that's not what we are!!   Yea, that bunch of mods was gonna win with that tactic....FPH was doomed with the circle of clowns running that ship.  We needed mods that knew what the fuck they were getting themselves into; I saw a lemonade stand running in more capable hands today in the neighborhood.  Those days huffing and puffing on r/all were cute though, gj mods gave everyone a good laugh for a few days, next time they shouldn't manage like a group of downies and keep their house in order.  	8
 I would totally buy you gifts dude all the time.  You make each gift sound fantastic.      That and the typewriter sound board was a bit much.   ohhh u so foamy      I get Keanu Reeves a lot.

I want you to give me drink ideas!  Something that you like or I should try.   I will order and try each one and report back with brief opinion on each drink.

I live in MN and every car you purchase comes with this sticker.   Gizmo!   Come on now... Nobody accepts American Express.   Sometimes I will buy a pack of smokes for the weekend if I know Im going to be drinking.   I don't smoke otherwise.   Anyway last Saturday night my friends and I were outside a bar having a cig and a homeless guy walked up to us and asked for a cig.  My friends kinda ignored him and I just flat out offered him my pack with the lighter.   He started tearing up and he thanked me as if I saved him from his poverty life.  It gave me such a weird feeling overall.  I mean those won't help him in life, but even hurt him more.   It just confused me.  :( I hope he's ok.          It reminds me of my ex.   It is a parody everyone.  Nevermind, faith restored in Jack Black!      you r fukd   I bet that was so gratifying when you pulled the ends and you got that slight suction feeling.     My roommate has a pet ferret.  We would do "ferret bombs" where you would run up to someone lying on the couch with the ferret and stick it under their shirt or up their pant leg.  Next you would grab a squeeek toy and squeeze the shit out of it making that god awful noise.   This would drive the ferret crazy which would lead to biting and burrowing.

 Was it heaven? Are you a Zombie?   Here in St. Louis a good majority of our bars that serve food close the kitchen at 10 and last call for alcohol is about 1:25 because bar closes at 1:30.   Damn how many hands do you have?   Damn phone. That should be Feast.   It sounds like the ship is sinking and you're still on board. IMO it's best to jump overboard now before it's too late.   No music but we'd belt out whatever song was in our head and 9/10 others would join in.   I've made many many menus using Word and the clipart in it. Of course those were for rehearsal dinners and other catering events.   The app for people who forgot the number to 911.   The wild cat sanctuary is great and if you got the money you can even stay there. Mostly it's shopping, plays/musicals, and eating. My uncle used to own a cafe in the downtown district called The Eureka Springs Food Court. Best vacation ever was singing karaoke there and helping him out in the cafe.     Eureka Springs, AR to visit family even though I haven't been in 11 years OR down the river road to Pier Marquette State Park.      Nah that's definitely the bunny from Monty Python and The Holy Grail.   Feat and Sauce are your best options.   Any maker marks stamped into the metal?   Been there before with Amazon.

Very photo worthy places.   The story I heard on the scanner was they jumped through the sunroof and weren't moving. Then all of a sudden they say he's conscious and alert. Even called the newsroom at 2 to tell them this but they kept saying that he died. Did tried to change the title here and take out fatality but haha turns out you can't edit titles.   1.) Matheny doesn't know what he's doing bullpen wise. When a pitcher is doing great he takes them out and put someone like Rosenthal in which leads to #2...  2.) Rosenthal is by far our worst closer IMO. He's like Issy from a few years back where when he's put in you know there's a high probability we're losing.  2.) Our outfielders when playing in SF. They did say it was a hard outfield to play but still there was no coverage. Especially when they had to run to hell's half acres to catch the ball.   Burnie Gus looks like Jarrod the Subway guy.   That I do. More than one "thing" at that.     Exactly I'm not going to be intimidated and run. With that said I will add that if they come out this way I will defend not only myself but also my house and family no questions asked.   God God they still make those books? I remember those books when I was in elementary school and that was many moons ago.   Oh been there many times. Hell still did it in Culinary School.      Have to give a big old amen to that last part. Right now that's what keeps me from drinking excessively.   In this case it'll be Brute and Old Spice for me.   Was listening over the scanner and the cop who found the car involved said it was full of beer cans and other shit(exact quote).   That's what I've said for years. With it being the main highway from the airport to downtown you'd think they would fix up the areas around the highway.   Guy jumped through the sunroof of a moving vehicle and now WB side of the highway is closed.   1.) Start it off by watching RAW and Smackdown together. Not full on event.  2.) Case in point he fucked Steph and is now head of NXT.   Straight OP's fault here for two reasons:  1.) You took a non-wrestling fan to a wrestling event aka taking her to something that probably bored her out of her mind. If I was you I would have just taken the nephew for a mini guys night.  2.) You dated your boss' daughter. What were you expecting to stay with her and get one of those "I fucked the boss' daughter promotions?" You never date the daughter of your superior because when that goes south so does the job.   There was an AP article that came out a week ago titled "MO Flea Market Plagued With Crime To Close," and it was all about the Pagedale flea market.   Name?   Girl my ribeyes are on your hot behind.   Was gonna ask if I missed a memo or something. WE CAN DO IT! WE CAN DO IT ALL NIGHT LONG!!!   I tried this one time before but the girl just screamed and asked how I got into her house. Oh Well!   Don't have much to add other than welcome to the club.   That's what I started out on. My Mom worked in a hospital and used to bring those home to me. The shave was shitty but they did the job.   Surely you can't be serious?   Remind anybody else of the no more spaces scene from Police Academy 1?   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZRGxNozcp4   Because it's Grand.   Not bad but if we really want to impress Guinness we have to hit that rare Fiver and with it getting colder it gets rarer.   Ooh damn. Are we going for the word record or some shit cause I'm pretty sure Chicago takes that honor.   Was before or after the whole quitting the business thing?   I agree the evidence needs to be known but would people believe it or continue to believe what they want to believe. In this situation that being he was a good boy with only a sandwich.   I took what you said as the sooner people back these protesters the safer it'll be and that'll never happen. Not everybody is going to support their cause. I mean I'm not, my family isn't going to, and I know 95% of my friend aren't going to either. We all think it's idiotic to protest this but not protest the black on black crimes that are statistically hurting the city more. Just today we had the 106th confirmed homicide in the city which is a 30% increase from this time last year.   Yeeeeeah I don't see that happening anytime soon.      LMAO @ St. Quiznos Thought he might be considered The Earl of Sandwiches #2.   Valuable and Upstanding citizen with a rap sheet 3 miles long. Ooook yeeeeeah somebody explain that one to me.

Haha   Saw the original origin of this meme but what is it called?   As a Chef I like the Farm to Table concept but I have a feeling this guy has no restaurant experience or farming experience for that matter. I can see $30,000-$35,000 easily for this and that's for a pop-up restaurant but not 5mil.   For just $5,000 you get that final 1%.   Precisely    Sorry man but that's not what she was laughing at.   Is that a sledge hammer in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?   Nice to see the "Little Man" succeed. Keep up the good work and congrats on the stellar year.   Damn it! Now I gave to return the van and all this candy.   Looooved that show and had a lil crush on the robot chick.

Met my ex in college so I was walking her to class, noticed the teacher wasn't in there yet, so we just set up against the wall, and opened up to each other. She told me about her dreams and fairs which I can remember the dream but not the fear, and I opened up to her about mine. It was the first time we got emotional in front of each other but not the last.   OMG How dare you say something so morbid. BTW you gave me the wrong change.

 Do you ever have tea in a Chinese restaurant?  If you like that, it is typically an oolong.  If you like coffee, I'd recommend an Assam or even a breakfast tea.  If a friend wanted to get into teas, I'd start with oolongs and jasmine greens as they are the most taste friendly for starting.   There are lots of decent black teas out there. Harny and Sons has some decent ones, Twinings is a UK standard and is pretty good too. I love their Prince of Wales tea. It is strong but still has nice subtle notes. And their Irish and English breakfast teas are very nice. Strong, but tasty. And try a decent darjeeling if you get a chance too. They are very unusual teas with a lot of subtle flavors.   To me it looks metallic. I think either you are not using filtered water and you are seeing the sediment like you do in an iron, or there is metal in the clay and it is showing up now.    I don't understand the foofy strainers. Strainers have one function, to give you a nice cupa. A product that forgets that main goal and worries more about style is not for me.  It looks nice though.   On the other hand, the Great Lake Alliance may be the strongest alliance. We'd even let Lake Champlain call themselves a great lake then.   He has the firecrackers to get through the blow stuff up phase, moving to the sending stuff up to blow up, and soon graduating to combining firecrackers and bottle rockets to blow stuff up in the air, just because.   There are so many things wrong with this picture.   I recently bought 3 teas from Dragon Tea House.  I ended up giving the other 2 Yunnan's away and I've had mixed feelings about their Wild leaf tea.  It is incredibly mild, almost to the point of no taste. I filled my strainer about 1/3 of the way with tea, and put it in freshly boiled water. Has anyone had better luck with their company?   TWG has some of the nicest high end teas I have ever seen.  But you can spend over 700US for 50g of some of their tea.  I also use Yunnan Sourcing and have found their teas to be way above average. I am waiting on a delivery of their spring teas.   Most Chinese restaurants I go to server Oolong.  You could even ask at the restaurants if they sell their tea.  Most places I go to will sell boxes to customers.  The great thing is, most restaurants do not use high quality tea so you should have a lot of growth potential in your tea tastes.  Every brew method will give you a different taste.   When I get to work I make a travel mug (16oz) of black tea. Typically a Dian Hong, although I bring my Taiwanese black teas in to mix things up sometimes.  If I make a 2nd cup, I typically use the leaves over and just pour the hot water over the leaves instead of filling the cup and putting the strainer in after.    T2Tea's Grand Yunnan. I bought 50g in their shop when I was working in Melbourne. Before I left I bought 100g more because it was the most amazing tea I had ever tried.   After that, my wife or kids would order some for a Christmas present. I think my last order was a crop from a new year and the taste was significantly more mild. I ran out of the last bag of that about 1 month ago.   TWG's best Dian Hong is very close if not better than T2Tea's Grand Yunnan, but I just happened upon it going through Singapore airport and I only got 50g   Sorry, I should have been more specific too. Any Black/Red Yunnan teas.They have some teas that look very interesting but I am worried they will be like Origins Tea and be fairly mediocre. Any input would be appreciated.   I guess I should mention, I am not, nor ever have been, involved in unions in any way. I am a systems analyst for industrial software applications. I have also never taken any money from the gov in unemployment or disability, nor has my wife, nor have my kids. I work with both management and union workers in my job. I have spent the last 5 years launching new software around the world. My job does not leave me much time to do touristy things, but I do get to meet the people and have lots of time to talk to them about their country. It is something I am very interested in when I travel. For the most part I am very non political when I am out of the country and I avoid arguments regardless of how strong I feel about a topic.   I am there professionally to teach them new software, but I am there personally to learn about them and their country.   I see your agreements, but you seem to disregard how those policies manifest themselves. It manifests itself quite clearly in those countries.   Linking to possibly the closest we have in the US to the National Enquirer, Murdoch's Daily Mail and next to The Economist as the most corporate/free market magazine; Forbes, tells me where you validate your opinions and why your opinions are what they are.   Have you actually been to any of the BRIC countries? Everyone I worked with wanted out. The most common question I get is; how do I get a job with corporate in the US? There is no safety. Your life and your families lives are at constant risk.   Through the 70's, S and C America, Africa and the islands of the Caribbean and far east were pretty much places the powerful countries put their people in power and sucked the nations dry. Corporations with their nations blessing and often assistance or Russian autocratic communists, would put a leader in power and get long term sweet heart deals on their resources. Effectively preventing that country from ever using their resources for the benefit of their people beyond the pay they got for removing them or harvesting the products. Examine Chiquita's or United Fruit's history in South and Central America to see what I am talking about. Read up on Baby Doc Duvalier's history in Haiti to see the kind of people we put in power. Take any critical resource we get from 3rd world countries and read the history. The western nations and the USSR had no regard for the people in the countries with the resources they wanted.   Are the neo liberal policies better than dictatorships? Sure. I agree. Is that the best option? Not by any means.        I'd recommend reading Howard Zinn's: A People's History of the United States.  That is what is playing out in the BRIC countries right now. I'd also recommend looking at how Norway has handled their natural resources and used those resources to benefit everyone in their country.  Income disparity in Norway is no where near where it is in other countries because of who owns their natural resources and the benefits the people of the nation get from those resources. The pay difference between top management and the workers is far less than it is in other countries as well. We are one of the top oil producing nations and we only got 2.5 billion in royalties in 2012 from all oil and gas royalties. We give them more subsidies than they gave in royalties. If we treated our resources like Norway does, we would be far better off as a nation.    The pay gap between the top and bottom in US corporations has gone up by over 300% in the last 30 years. That is the framework that is getting pushed by the IMF and the World Bank. More for the top and far less for the bottom. And it's why graduates can't find jobs in the US. It's all going ot the top.   As you may have noticed from all the downvotes I am getting for my views, most people agree with your viewpoint. So it appears there is little to worry about as my views are seen as fringe anyway. I've had too many classes in analytic reasoning, logic, and the media to be swayed by all the emotion based distortions we see in the mainstream, corporate owned media and even in media with opinions I support. Everyone distorts and everyone is really presenting opinions. It's just a matter of knowing how your media distorts information and what opinions they are interested in expressing.   And last, capitalism is a wide net and includes the European socialist systems.  I doubt if many people feel that capitalism is bad. I just feel that it needs to keep it's eye on the health of the community and less on industries leaders and their backers getting extreme profits. I also see countries like Norway who follow that path have less social problems and more social equality. Unbalanced social systems become more autocratic and then fall.   In our area, they're in expensive malls which forces them to overprice their tea.  Their selection's also mediocre, other than flavored teas. They may make amazing flavored teas, but that is not my cup of tea.   I'm not sure   He said it would powder the entire kitchen and the cost and time to clean up would be substantial.   world news. :-)   Wow, I had no idea you could upload without a UID.

I was then told I would be fired if I ever pulled the lever.   Finding new teas is one of the joys of being a tea nut. I'm glad you found oolongs.  You'll be amazed by the diversity there is in oolongs too.   Did the kool aid taste good at least?   If you are just calling to threat, it's like they can sense it. You have to be willing to follow through. Most of the time it was the actual person cancelling my service who lowered our rate to keep us on. Because you know, the person you get when you make the selection to cancel the service, can't actually cancel it. They want to send you through the team to see if they can change your mind, why you're doing it, etc.   Thanks. The Brits called it black tea because of the color of the dried leaf. Chinese call it red tea because that is the color of the brew.  The Chinese I work with kept calling my tea red tea and even pointed to writing on the label of my tea that said Red Tea in Chinese but black tea in English.   I used to call about once a year to cancel because a competitor's rates matched the rate comcast gives new customers. They folded for years (or I guess in their eyes, kept me as a customer)before they actually refused and let me cancel   As someone with a background in economics you also know there are a lot of theories. Libertarians think they have all the answers. There are many economists who disagree with them and state the facts far better than I can.   Free trade agreements have cost us jobs. There are things more important than profit. What I have found in my travels is democratic countries with the strongest social protections have the largest middle class.   Russia? Really?   Brazil? They have police with machine guns at the cash machine in the manufacturing plant of a huge company because gangs break in and rip out the machines on pay day. I'm a 5 minute ride into the site to get to the building I was working in. The smoking area was near the cash machines and it was very discerning. Kidnappings are common, and the streets are not really safe to walk on.   India has a nice growing middle class, but the poverty is something you never forget.   But, yes, anyone can go to a store and buy an iPhone or the latest Samsung tv. You can also starve on the side of the street.  I actually love both Brazil and India. They certainly are not the US, but the people are pretty nice and the food is great in both places.   I'm not sure what this is, but it sure looks like an amazing Yunnan. http://bienvenuemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/maison-des-3-thes.jpg   The owner of a tea shop in Taiwan roasted a nice oolong and had me taste the roasted rolled leaf. It was amazing. I would munch on those all day. Talk about an expensive munchie though.   We weren't belligerent about it. Our kids were close friends and they pretty much gave everyone a bunch of BS about it and would never give straight answers.   It's not about smarts, it's about being informed, and most of the information out there is meant to distort and distract.    An example in my own community; our neighborhood elementary school was always top 5% in the state. We also had 99% PTA membership in the school.  The city wanted to switch the school to a Jr. High but they knew the community would not agree. So working among themselves and the planning commission, they had a millage to do needed repairs to the school and bring it up to date with computers and the associated wiring. We had always supported school millage's so they were confident it would pass and it did.   Then they told us after more analysis they were making the school a Jr. High instead and most of the money would be used to update all the bathrooms for older students. We did not pass the next 3 millages in our community. We knew the people on the planning committee and they all swore secrecy about the plan. They knew if it got out, they would all be thrown out of office. This gave them all another term. We are no longer friends with the 2 we knew.   I actually did not read the article. Hillary's views on trade deals have been pretty consistent. I also know the bias from the Hill site. I just know Hillary is no populist. She did not get where she is by supporting the little guys. When big biz gives her money, they get a worthwhile return on their investment. Like they do with most of them.    I understand. As much as I love my tea from T2Tea in Australia, that shipping stops me from ordering from them 90+% of the time.   Most people get their news from major corporations who do not have a populist view. Their view is that any leader who doesn't allow for a global free market in their country is bad, and they present that view to their readers over and over. It's hard to fault people for being ignorant when that is what their leaders want.   Yeah, at least in our country if a community is active in their political system, the system works pretty well.   The problem is getting people off the TV and things like StumbleUpon, Imgur and reddit. ;-p   When I have been in S. America people talk about their corrupt gov. When I tell them it is pretty much the same in the US they are surprised.   I get tea from both China and Australia. It's almost 20US to ship from Australia but only 7 or 8 from China. I guess the queen has to get her cut. ;-p    But, are you hoping to provide free shipping, or just worried the cost of shipping from Canada may be cost prohibitive to some?   You can get boxes for as little as 28 cents each here, so boxes really shouldn't be that much of a deal breaker, price wise.   http://www.uline.com/BL_440/Lightweight-32-ECT-Boxes   I don't worry about tracking. I just make a small order the first time to see how the company handles things.   OK, police actions with our military, to satisfy your semantics. Boots on the ground are boots on the ground. Ask some people who were in Cambodia to see if actually being at war with the country in the official sense matters.   Same with bringing back a US backed stooge to run your country.  However, the people who now have clean water and access to healthcare sure do seem to think their lives are better off.  I compare it to Cuba. Before Fidel, the rich controlled 90% of the wealth in the country. The poor had little access to education or healthcare. The rich are pissed because the control and wealth they used to have, they don't have anymore. The fact that 90% have more is irrelevant to them.  The 1% wants it all.   She looked like the photo on the left in BJ's Diary.   So I see. I am an old fart who watches more B W movies than anything released in the last 20 years. My wife and daughter were watching BJ's Diary and I found it a fun light movie. That was my exposure to her.   Alpha males are pigs. Unfortunately most women look for alpha males.   http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/renee-zellwegers-changing-face-actress-4474527    So do I compared to my pictures from 15 years ago. People that are heavy and change weight change even more. I'm pretty much my same weight from college but my friends who have gained or lost weight look so different.  I don't think she has had surgery, but I do not follow that crap too closely.   She's not a youngster anymore. She reminds me of Jennifer Lawrence because she seems like she is pretty without all the Hollywood dressings and comes across as less movie starish.   I never have enough of a layover in Dubai to get into the city. In Singapore's airport, they have a TWG shop. I had never heard of them before but the gold Yunnan I like so much looked incredible so I bought 50 grams. I think I paid 38 US for 50g.  It's the most expensive tea I have bought and it was good enough I would buy it again. For special occasions. :-)   Thanks. I will be in Taoyuan City and will visit the 2 tea shops I found near the hotel I was staying in. Hopefully I will be able to find a couple oolongs and nice black teas like I did in October of last year.   I think WMF's tea strainer is perfect. One of the problems I have with putting my tea directly in my cup is the fact that it continues to steep and often gets bitter. As a new loose leaf drinker, I would recommend trying several different oolongs from Taiwan and China. I have found a relatively inexpensive oolong that I like as much as much higher priced ones. It's just a nice midgrade Tie Guan Yin. For a special treat, try Oriental Beauty from Taiwan.   I'm surprised no one has mentioned filtered water. I think the difference between regular tap water and filtered water is night and day.   I try to switch up each week or every other week so the flavor of Yunnan teas do not get washed away. I find if I exclusively drink them, I do not get the same flavor after a while.  Typically I bounce between black tea from Taiwan or black teas from Yunnan.   My routine is; as soon as I get into work I heat water in my teapot, add a bit of honey to the cup, pour the hot water into the travel mug I use and decide which of the 3 or 4 teas I keep at work to drink. I place the tea in my strainer and steep anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes depending on what I am wrapped up in. That will usually get me through the work day. When I get home I typically make an oolong or a mild Yunnan and follow the same steps. I use a gaiwan if friends are over and want to share some tea.   I just ordered 7 new spring teas from Yunnan Sourcing so there will be a tea tasting going on in about 2 weeks that I am looking forward to.   That is a bummer. I am heading there in about 3 weeks and was looking forward to getting some more nice oolongs and their incredible old tree black teas. I actually chose to be routed through Taiwan for that reason. Arghh   TWG out of Singapore and T2Tea in Australia both have incredible teas. They are expensive though and shipping is not cheap either.   Yunnan Sourcing offers the best Chinese tea I have found online, for a reasonable price. Yunnan teas have been my favorite for a while and I just found Yunnan Sourcing about a year ago. I've tried about 20 of their teas and haven't found anything I did not like and some I loved. I've also tried about 5 other Chinese tea sites and have given each of those teas away to less particular friends.   The owner of the tea store in Taiwan told me the same thing when I bought my gaiwan.     What compensation was given to the people who lived on that land? Taking more land and the water is not compensation.   I think the delicacy of a nice golden Yunnan is hard to beat. I use Yunnan Sourcing for my tea. I get most of it from their Chinese site. TWG's Golden Needle Yunnan is incredible.  	57

 She may be out of touch but she is right about one thing, her parents should have taught her more.  I would never trust a young person to efficiently use 90000 over three years responsibly.     	2
 There is this girl and every time I see her it feels like my heart is about to fly out of my chest. Is this love or just infatuation?    You tried so hard to be right. You're wrong though, dead wrong.   Good luck man, sounds like fun.   I'll definitely look into that. Thanks for the advice   Thanks. What did you major in if you don't mind me asking?   	5
 How much would it cost to get her to make me one   Damn off brands   Any movie where the dog dies   I know a girl who put a rolled up waffle in her vagina.      Yes, cuz my parents would have wooped me if I didn't take that kind of money    Should of have read terms and conditions before agreeing to unconditional love. Now I don't love you   During home coming week me and my friend was talking in the hall. This girl I liked came up behind me and my friend very loudly stated" the girl you like so much is behind you, now's your chance to ask her to the dance". I turn around, blushing like hell, and I see that her face is redder than mine. She said before I opened my mouth" only if we go as friends."  	7

 thats lame as fuck. find a new doctor.  total bullshit man.  sorry to hear that shit.     I've had shitty and good ER experiences. Mainly shitty but i'd say its pretty hit or miss and just depends on who is working that shift in the ER.   i like peppermint schnapps with just regular coke.   lol can't agree with you more yet i am kinda empathetic to the OP.   yeah im pretty much in the same boat as you. its hard for me to just have like 3 beers cause i don't like them much so I drink harder stuff and it usually makes me too drunk haha.   "I don't know much about beer and dislike the taste of most I've tried. Any recommendations?"  Yeah I have a recommendation- if you don't like it, don't drink it!!  I am not trying to sound/be a dick but if you honestly don't like it just stick to what you like!!  Everyone around where I live loves Sierra Nevada beer.  I have tried it several times but I just don't like it much. Its too heavy of a beer and I agree with you about light beer as I am not a huge beer guy myself and find that stuff easier to drink. I guess a lot of drinks are an acquired taste so I dunno I'm just saying if you have tried to drink beer quite a bit and still don't like it just skip it!!  haha I mean this in the best and nicest way lol.   Good luck in finding the right beer if you choose to keep trying!!   I don't go around telling everyone but I don't keep it a secret as well.  I mean it comes up sometimes when I am talking to someone about drugs.  For instance my parents know.  Btw I am on a legal prescription for norcos and I don't use any other drugs not even pot.  I just find that being honest is the best way to go.   I think it does.  When I drink wine I get a different feeling than when I drink other liquors. Hard to explain but I do notice a difference.     murder city devils   just a normal doctor at kaiser who i've been with for about 8 years.  i'm not looking to get into any real heavy stuff but want a modest increase in the medicine i am receiving right now and just a bit worried about bringing it up with her as it might make things worse.  what experiences with pain mgmt have you had? I've never been....   thanks man you too!! it just sucks being young and actually having legitimate pain but getting profiled because you are young!  That's kinda why i was looking for advice/ other peoples stories with this situation because up until here I have only been kinda judged by every doctor i've seen.   yeah i know i can do that and i'm pretty good at telling stories if I need to haha. but the messed up thing is that I am not trying to scam my doctor cause I want to be high all day, I feel that I need a small up on my dosage for legit reasons.  I am just worried that this proposition to her might backfire you know?     hah i wasn't trying to sound like a dick. i just read what i wrote and it came off that way.  but yeah tolerance sucks!   exactly what i'm afraid of.   are they steroid shots? i've been wanting to get steroid shots but been pretty much talked out of them by all the doctors i've seen saying it won't help much.   wow that was fast!  ive been on opiates for about 10 years.   ok we sound in about the same place :)  I have had this doc for about 7 years now and we have a great relationship which I don't want to mess up but I feel like I do have a legitimate reason to get a bit more meds.  I've never done the doctor shopping thing and the pain managment clinics are very pricy since I am going thru Kaiser Permanente and its really cheap but which from what i have heard is the Wal Mart of hospitals but it is all I have I known.  Thanks for the response!!   not sourcing whatsoever.....  i get 60 10/325s prescribed to me 1 month for legitimate pain from my doctor after being on 5/500s for about 5 years, yeah i know gross. i do have real pain and have the xrays/mris/etc to prove it.  I have been limiting myself to about 2 of the 10mgs a day just to get mobile.  I just feel like a junkie trying to get more opiates but at the same time i need them for the pain.  Problem is I am young (30) and I just don't want my trusting doctor to cut me off.....  Any suggestions?     nick cave or golden brown!?! dude both of them are my jams haha   damn. how long did it take you to build up that tolerance??   Ahhh i know!! My tolerance is still relatively low (20-30mg gets me good), but I remember when 7.5 mg got me feeling good.  I shit you not!!   hah! love it but i would never wear it!     lookin good bro!   haha i dunno what i was doing. haha thanks!!   thanks man. i'm a total internet noob. i tried imgur but they were down.   fuck yeah love that song!!! took me years to figure it out though haha. heard it first on a video that my friend made of some bay area skateboarding:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C0HfQMKsiYg   i like opium tea by nick cave......          what did you post like saying that you couldn't find any liberal doctors or what? i've seen people on CL straight up asking for norcos and stuff which to me seems a bit sketchy.   yeah ive seen ads like that saying its leftover surgery stuff. and yeah when i've ever bought/sold shit off CL no matter what it was always met in a neutral location and try to bring a friend.   sounds like what i am dealing with. i do have legit pain and have a small monthly script for norcos and just don't want to blow it by asking my doctor to up my script so i was seeing if i could kinda play a bit of catch up on CL you know?  I don't smoke weed for various reasons so I just have the norcos to rely on for the pain. only stuff that makes me actually mobile.   sf bay area. just typed in meds or pain meds under for sale. found a lot of interesting stuff.    yeah i was searching in sf bay area and found everything from 5mg vic's to methadone and everything in between!   exactly how i'm feeling about it haha. but i guess if you read stampbag's reply, you can't even register for the SR right now......   I have heard of this and similar stories on the news as well and you have a good point too.   Alright thanks everyone for the input!! I am glad this thread seems to have been a success (haha at least for me)  Also interesting to hear from you guys and your CL stories.  I only mess with pills- no H ever so its not like I could do the open air market deal is why I was mainly contemplating CL.  Sucks that it seems wayyyy easier to get heroin than some wimpy norcos haha!! I am not that hard up for pills so I doubt i'll actually ever get the balls up to do it. Still wish I knew how the SR worked 100% so I could confidently pull it off.  Anyways thanks everyone once again!!   lol totally agreed   I agree with you about the risk/sketchiness. I have known of silk road for a while now but I am still not 100% sure how it works haha. and i don't want to use it until i am full able to understand the process of it.   anyone ever try buying opiates off craigslist? i've been contemplating doing this for some time now but haven't quite figured out if its worth the risk.  just wanting to get a feel for any good or bad stories from anyone here that has gone that route.   i don't really think so cause i was getting 100 5/500's a month. now getting 60 10/325s a month.  i just told her i am concerned about my liver and she changed it up for me.  I have a ton of different pain issues on various parts of my body lol so thats what they are for.  I am only taking no more than 3 a day so I would like to think that isn't too much?     oh and i'm not sure if you mean by your question will it kill someone due to an acute liver failure or just by prolonged use or both?     norcos being 10/325 i would think that one would have to take a lot of them over a long period of time to die from fucking their liver up but everyone is different.  I'm just glad my doctor switched me from 5/500's to norcos for the sake of my liver.   Man you are lucky to live there. I am on the other side of the country in california and the doctors here are pretty stingy.  my friend was trying to get me to take a roadtrip to FL and I told him after that movie it was virtually dead but I guess its not!!  Still, i'm not going to take a cross country journey for something that still is not a 100% sure thing haha.  even though it sounds like it is pretty close to that.   ok i just wasn't sure is all and honestly didn't read the whole wiki link you sent me about eds and ibs.  sorry for any mix up!   ok so why'd you mention ibs haha seems a bit personal to mention if it didn't relate to receiving pain meds for it!   Troll 2  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyophYBP_w4   you get them for IBS?? Just wondering, not judging.  I haven't experienced IBS so I can't talk but I didn't know it could be so painful.  Either way you are lucky to find 1 of the last few liberal doctors around haha   Damn so its still got it going on down there?!? I heard that FL dried up after all the pain clinic stuff being exposed and The Oxycontin Express movie.  I've never been so I can't say either way.  You live in Florida I take it?   never smoked either regularly. actually tried to start smoking cigs recently (yeah dumb i know) because i was subjected to so much second hand smoke it made me crave it but i couldn't even make it thru the pack.  For me nicotine is something I never had an issue with.  Alcohol and opiates, haha............   fuck man, me too!! too bad mine is only 60 norcos a month!! may i ask how you legally get these?  i need to step my game up......   i agree with your statement but 22 ounces of wine is quite a bit considering wine usually starts at about 8-9% alcohol content.   never done cocaine but considering that is a stimulant it would produce a different high completely.  but i totally understand what you are talking about considering i asked a similar question not too long ago:  http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/zsyaa/cleaning_your_house/   awesome. i'm feeling this pic!   whats worse is the fact that it is tramadol.   i'm done talking to you kook   Let me rephrase that.  I came to this place to ask questions and offer my advice when needed.  In this instance I was asking a question and the thread was going fine until you showed up.   i came here to be positive and help people out. not to be a kook like you.   ironically i just found this in my bathroom  http://imgur.com/tqY9g   haha yeah i can totally understand on a drug like speed although ive never used it.  i sometimes lose my appetite though on opiates.   yeah for me it usually just ends up in cleaning my house but i guess its good cause it probably wouldn't get cleaned otherwise  haha   ah ok thanks!   ahh gnarly haha.  id be worried it would get dropped on the carpet and stain it up really bad.   like to disinfect stuff?  god i hate the smell of that stuff haha   BA= body absorption?  haha i'm a noob.  just guessing that is what it means.    ah ok good story!! i've never used anything more than pills orally and i would think it'd be kinda hard to clean after shooting up so i'm not surprised haha   Did a search and found something posted about 6 months ago and couldn't comment so decided to start a new thread.  Sorry i'm high!!  anyways I always have an urge sometimes after I take a couple norcos, about 20-30mg to just start cleaning and its great the feeling I get from it.  Kinda funny cause it seems like something a meth head would do.  either way my place is taken care of at least once a week without hiring a maid haha. Just wondering if others get these urges and would like to hear some stories from you all.   yes    oh ok yeah it is.  i was just scared my doc might just cut me off if i asked for stronger stuff quickly.   oh and i do get blood tests every month from my doctor. one thing that is checked is my liver and it is fine.   i know it doesn't but somehow its worked for me for the last 10 odd years.   325x2=650mg of tylenol a day for me......   oh and thanks!! good luck with your opiate adventures!    i hope so.......... i am trying my hardest as much as i love those opiates haha. like i said before i am trying to sound like a jerk or snob, i just hate withdrawls and really don't need a hell of a lot to get a nice buzz so I have always been very moderate with my opiate usage.   agreed.  its a hard juggling act for a lot but moderation is key.  I know moderation and opiates probably don't go hand in hand but its essential.   lol i forgot about that one. it does mess up your number 2's!!    only made mine better. cured my actual physical pain and also emotional.  i have a super cheap co pay and have rarely had to cop pills from the street(never touched anything stronger)  my tolerance has gone up a bit but I have been on the same program for about 10 years now and i'm only 30 so I feel that I have really good willpower. I understand how strong drugs are, especially opiates and I respect them never going on binges.....  I know i'll catch shit for what I wrote already saying i'm naive and cocky or whatever but I am this is how I humbly put it.  Losing both of my parents at a very young age from drugs has helped me pace myself with my addictions to put a long story short........   when i was taking the 5/500s I took about 3-4 a day max.  i consider that not much right!?!?  I am not sure, everyone is different but I am/was taking them for pain but I do like how opiates make me feel I won't lie haha.   was on just 5/500s for like 3 years. told my doc i wanted 10/325s so my liver could be healthy and she switched me up no questions asked.  i am light user though......... i think haha    yeah its fucked!!  I am just looking for pills. its funny that i can get heroin here easier than just like norcos.   never used meth but this whole area has a really bad  meth problem so i hear......   you would think a college town like chico california would be too easy but I guess they have been cracking down or something cause I can't find anything.   haha very well said!! you got my upvote.   i agree with you.  i'm not taking the naive/ignorant route on this one.     Its all good. what you said was just kinda open ended sounding is all haha   is this a response to me? i cannot tell.  	85
 Hi Reddit,  My boyfriend has been taking Citalopram (celexa) for his depression for a month now but he has admitted that he has no desire to have sex. I asked if I could make him want to and he said 'please don't do that', I asked if he thought we would any time soon and he said he didn't know.  I was wondering if anyone with experience of this could give me some advice on what to do?  We have been together three years so it's not the end of the relationship if we don't have sex for a while, but I already really miss feeling intimate with him like that, and it's upsetting me thinking we might not get that back any time in the foreseeable future. Especially as we're so young.  Every time anyone mentions sex I get sad and my heart drops and I worry about our future.  He won't want to change his medication as it seems to be working for him so far, and at the moment I don't think sex is very important to him at the moment. I would really like some help with how to handle this, what I can do, and how over people have handled a relationship without sex?  	1
    Your username is awesome, I feel like we're late to this game, but we were pretty pumped about it      This one was the only one we had a hard time with because he had such a good personality and we got attached but the others haven't been bad. We've fostered probably 10 now.      Normally just microwave them       It's going over the bridge on Atlantic    http://www.fatgirltrappedinaskinnybody.com/2011/04/bacon-egg-cups/         Thanks!   Never been to Wisconsin though I have spent some time across the lake from it in Michigan  	13
 Excellent response time and you delivered exactly what I needed. Thanks so much!!   This is awesome! Thanks so much!  	2
 How do they do it? About 90% of adults I know obviously have no idea what they're doing and the other 10% either have it somewhat figured out or are really good at pretending.    Huh.. I'm going to try that   I'm nearly 26, still not sure what I'm doing.    Bored   Power of having everyone like me and give me excellent job opportunities.    All of the above, gods full of rage and hates many things.    That anyone is actually good at being an adult.   Edit: gold? What? Thank you   10th. I've heard stories of how he's said similar things to other students, and people have complained but he's still teaching.   Edit to add story: one girl, about 15 years old, asked him what subjects she needed to do do become a nurse, he told her to just do easy subjects because "let's face it, you're not bright enough to be a nurse"   She's currently in uni studying to be a nurse      I hate being to hot to sleep, or even think.    Yep, just need time and patience.    I don't have one  Except, boyfriend   Summer time. Please, take it away.    As a student with adhd and depression things were generally a struggle.   I was falling behind in one subject, but one weekend I was determined not to fail and spent all my energy working on and finishing two assignments. It was hard, but I did it and I was really proud of myself. I handed the assignments up on the Monday.    After a week or so, I hadn't got any response from the teacher so I asked him if he'd marked them yet. He said:  "I haven't looked, I'm not wasting my time because I don't know if it's worth it"   Crushing. It's been 10 years since he said that and it still brings me to tears.    Same here, I'm nearly 26 but not ready yet.    I dream of running away, building a cabin and setting up a vegetable patch. But that's an unrealistic, useless dream.  So I just keep trying, failing, trying, failing etc   I'm so sorry, it's a constant fear of mine that by boyfriend will do the same to me.   Depression sucks, and is so misunderstood, or not understood at all and people without it can be incredibly insensitive.   I hope you will get over her soon and find someone much much better in the future.     I currently feel exactly the same, it's awful. And my boyfriend says stupid unhelpful things like "you just need to do it, it's not that hard" "you're better than this, just get started" "it's really very simple"   I get more depressed thinking that I will constantly fail, and that I'm just not meant for this world, or this world isn't mean for me...   If you discover a miraculous cure, please share!     Freezing their tits off?   The dogs photo! It looked so innocent.     If they used that power to do bad, then it would be rational, and yes, some do intentionally do very bad things, but the majority are good, and use their power to help people, they shouldn't be feared because of a few bad people.   And not all medical professionals have powers to make life or death decisions, and the ones that do have strict laws controlling them. They are highly educated people who's priority is to maintain life in a way that is best for the patient.    I'm sorry you're going through this, and I can't help.   Maybe try a different doctor, some are insensitive, some are really good, I learned this though experience, it took me about 5 doctors until I found one that actually cared about me. You might be able to ask others from your area (online?) if they can recommend someone really good for you to see.   Medical professionals aren't anything to be scared of, they really can help. please try everything, don't give up.      I'm not an expert, and I obviously don't know your story, but are those fears irrational or valid? have you spoken to a medical professional about it? or sought any other form of outside help? Suicide is not your only option.  Please seek professional help, you shouldn't have to live in fear and you shouldn't have to think that killing yourself is the only way to fix it.   I hope you will be ok.    I will remember reading it.     a grand total of four, and I hope to keep it that way.  I am not unhappy with my number, but not happy either. I love my boyfriend and wish I had 'saved myself' for him because the three guys before him were not really great people. But eh... mistakes happen.    And we're always here if you have questions. mostly...I guess. ..yeah   In South Australia hand raised kangaroos can not be released into the wild and males must be desexed. I dont know the laws in the other states.  They are loving animals, and make great companions but not great pets, they have poor immune systems and can die suddenly without presenting any signs of illness, so it can be difficult to treat them for illnesses, they cause a lot of heartbreak, my friends who care for kangaroos probably lose two to everyone one that lives, it doesnt get easier, it's awful every time. They also bite (HARD) a lot, and kick and can't be toilet trained or anything, and need a lot of space.    I would say, read through this subreddit, read the comments, check the most popular posts etc.   You can probably learn a lot that way.   Maybe also check out some Australian tv shows, movies or books. I cant think of anything right now because I'm tired, but I'm sure google can help.    is there a website for it? It looks amazing.    cotton eye joe now stuck in my head. thanks a lot!    can you link it to Australia too? cheers   I learned way more gory/depressing/horrible facts I  from watching/ reading Horrible Histories as an adult (It's may favourite show) than I did from history lessons at school.  As an Australian, I never learned much about the way aborigines were treated after European settlement until I started university. At school it was all "they do dot paintings and use boomerangs". In uni I learned about the massacres, raping, stolen generations, them being classed as fauna, so many horrors.      I need one of those little wrinkles. or big ones. I dont mind, so cute!   She shouldn't have to act on them if he really cared about her and their relationship. But either he isn't taking her seriously or just doesn't care enough to listen to and follow the terms of the ultimatums, which I don't think can make for a healthy relationship.   OP, don't feel guilty for putting yourself first.    I get vouchers regularly for grocery shops! Excellent   The one where Bruce Willis (?) Plays a taxi driver and there are aliens and he saves the world in some stupid way. Stupid movie.    Today I have been thinking a lot about how my life sucks...  But something like this puts it into perspective. To live in fear of and be murdered by your own family... I can't imagine the horror.    if you've already given him a couple of ultimatums and he still hasn't realised your serious, then he probably wont ever.   You need to do what is best for you.    Snow White and the Seven dwarves came through my bedroom window and used magic to freeze me and take away my voice.   I had that dream when I was about 5, so 20 years ago.  Still remember it super clearly and maybe a part of me is convinced it was actually aliens,  it seemed so real.     Not too extreme. Homes have been lost,  and countless innocent animals,  it's lucky we have excellent warning systems and hopefully all people stay safe and alive.    Starting a fire during this weather means a person is either an unbelievable idiot or evil (or both). The world can do without those people.     Its horrible,  they get one fire out only to have a bunch more start up. Can't imagine the stress for those directly affected.    Hoping no lives are lost in this fire.    Its gone for a swim   It is a good plan,  maybe it needs more time to prove effective.     Thanks, I'm following that now.     I'm in hope valley, so not in immediate danger from what I can tell. Not stopping me from freaking out though.    Edit: the cfs say they expect a wind change,  do you (or anyone) know what that means,  will it push the fire towards the suburbs or back onto itself or something?     You too.    I'm not in the grey area.  :/    Can definitely smell the smoke now.  Be safe everyone.     Me either,  keep refreshing the cfs website and Facebook for updates. I know a few people who have received cfs alert messages telling them to take shelter. It's so scary and real.     I don't smell smoke or see any thing... its about 10-15 km away from the Anstey hill area I think but I don't know what that means a far as a fire is concerned.   37 is the cool change after a heat wave.     Does any one know the chance of it getting near Anstey Hill?  It's not too windy,  but still hot out and I'm scared.  Firefighters though. .. Brilliant People.  1:30 am and they're out there saving lives and land.    Also, the middle picture is beautiful,  in a terrifying way.     I hate that summer makes me hate jackets, jumpers, blankets and other cosy things.  Because I want to love those things.     Hope you find him,  maybe post on the fauna rescue of south Australia Facebook group, they might be called if someone finds him      Works well, but then you realise that the sharp stinging pain in your nostrils is being caused by the swelling of the tampon as it absorbs more and more blood, threatening to spilt open your nostril.   But then at least your have a tampon to soak up that blood...    Do you have a favourite?    Its illegal to feed meat to pigs in Australia   thanks!  that's a lot of info, I don't understand much of it, but I will do some research based on what you've told me. and I'm currently downloading Stellarium, which looks pretty neat and might keep me up all night.   I've edited my original post to include some photos.   As I'm new to telescope use, honestly, just looking at the moon is exciting, but knowing there is so much more to see... I want to be able to see it.   I'd happily save up to buy a new telescope, but because this one was my papas, I want to be able to use it but make it better.    My grandfather was a keen amateur astronomer, and owned a few telescopes, he passed a few years ago but only recently has one of his telescopes been found (no idea where the others are/ if they still work)  I know absolutely nothing about telescopes, but am interested in astronomy.  the label on the telescope reads:   Denkar Astronomical Reflection Telescope  D- 3" F=600mm   coated optics  and the bit you look through says "H 20mm"  what does this all mean? I set it up last night and got a good look at the moon, but viewing stars/ planets etc is no better than with a naked eye.   Are they any ways to increase its power? additional thingys or whatsits?   Or would it be cheaper to just go out and buy a whole new telescope to get better viewing?   thank you    Edit: http://imgur.com/EHVlanD  http://imgur.com/DC9ltaW  http://imgur.com/NB6vPMy Sorry for the not so great quality.   yep, same kangaroo, that guy is pretty tall too, apparently, but I have no idea of their heights.     They kick hard, your intenstines would fall out your back.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHOncpF5dQI here he is trying.   I don't get why this view is so controversial, when it's obviously true.   The females are. They're smaller, gentler, have the pouches full of adorable babies. ..   The males are mostly docile unless threatened. I bet Roger up there would rather nap than punch someone in the teeth.     Not geniuses but not stupid either.       Bring frightened and confused by vehicles doesn't equal stupid, they are quite intelligent.     tbh, I'd skip Adelaide, maybe head down to Kangaroo Island instead, it's a beautiful spot.   You definitely require a permit in all states, as you do for all native animals that you wish to kill or take from the wild.   Edit to add: Indigenous people can hunt without a license though.    They are not a pest at all.   Edit: "More recently, consecutive reviews of the state of knowledge on the management of kangaroos have failed to correlate kangaroo control to meaningful damage mitigation to pastoral properties or the landscape in general (Olsen and Low; Olsen and Braysher; Herbert and Elzer)."  and  "[t]he main reason an industry is approved is almost certainly because of the extent to which kangaroos are regarded as a pest (Pople and Grigg). It is this construction of the kangaroo as a pest that has facilitated the growth of the kangaroo industry, yet the view is based on ignorance, mistaken assumptions, and the influence of vested interests in current practices."   3 million are killed annually and 1 million joeys are killed also as a by-product.   Viterra employees can no longer ride bikes on sites.  I broke my arm falling off one while riding over slippery rocks really fast trying to be cool.    Don't be an asshole, not literally though, we all need a literal asshole.   seconded, only extending it to most of the UK and Ireland.    "you look pretty when you're wet"   Wet of the 'in a swimming pool covered in water' kind.     opinions.   like "gay is bad", "global warming is a myth" "ALP is a good political party"   Selfies...  Well I hate a lot of more important things, but selfies are really infuriating me lately.  A close friend keeps putting them on fb with stupid faces and I have been liking her less and less each time.    Mine is a pretty boring story, but still confuses me about 3 years later.  I was driving with my mum from one sisters house to the other sisters house, about a 40 minute drive.  When we got to our destination, I went to the toilet, saw I'd pooped my pants a little...  No idea how it happened, didn't feel it happening, didn't feel the need to poop. Hasn't happened since, luckily.     I also pick, mostly when I am stressed/upset/angry etc. I used to have to put bandages around my finger tips because I would pick at the skin around them until it became too painful to use my fingers.   Also, my cousin who also has ADHD used to pull out hairs one at a time, mostly her leg hair and eyelashes. she also picked at pimples a lot when she was a teen.   I still do pick at my fingers from time to time, but I used to do it without even realising, I somehow became more conscious of it, and would be able to stop myself before I caused myself pain, just by focusing on what I was doing and asking myself what it was achieving, why was I doing it, should I keep doing it or should I stop. It doesnt sound like much but its helped.   I have also read that having something to fidget with helps, although I haven't tried.    oooh yes, these people suck.  oh, looks like my friends baby is seriously ill, better go on and on and on about how my child is seriously ill with the common cold and take them to emergency.   Now I have an amazing ER story to share with my friends!   - Discuss your disgusting sex life with people who really don't want to hear it  - Chew with your mouth open  - Have loud arguments in public places and make everyone else awkward  - Drive like you're the only car on the road  - Give yourself a nickname  - same pose in your million selfies  - take up a whole couch when other people need somewhere to sit  - make fun of things other people care about in conversation with those people  - scream abuse at strangers for either no reason, or if it's you who's in the wrong but you wont admit it.     I don't understand. Surely North Korea knows its mostly hated or at least disliked by the rest of the world, having one movie banned isn't going to change that.    I know a few people like this. mostly good people, but have a terrible habit of thinking they know a lot more than they really do.  I don't know much about colour blindness, but I assume it affects your life, career options, appreciation of flowers (?) and it isnt fair to have it dismissed like it's nothing important.    a very mild spicy smell, mixed with dirt.    Not really obscure, but not common I guess... I have worked at grain silos, it was really very satisfying work, hard and tiring but fun also.   My favourite thing was when the silos were being emptied and I got to climb inside and sweep out the remainder... even though it was like 40 degrees celsius and difficult to breath with all the dust. satisfying.   Also involved a lot of draining of sludge after rain, picking dead animals out of the grain, sweeping, admiring views, imagining how if during a zombie apocalypse, the silos would be a great place to hide out..etc.   yes, seriously, I don't get why everyone keeps saying that kangaroos can't move backwards, because I have seen them do it SO many times.    My parents pets. Although, the bird just refuses to leave and the cat moved in after its previous owners abused it to near death.

Hopefully what she said was just out of grief and shock and not a serious threat of suicide.

Sorry you've had to go through a tough break-up, I hope you can both move on as easily as possible.    You constantly forget you've made yourself a hot drink, then remember once it's gone cold.

I feel exactly the same a lot of the time, I do have depression also, and if I forget my medication for that these feelings intensify. As someone has suggested, maybe get checked out for depression.  Although, I do feel like these thoughts, as depressing as they can be, are not necessarily the result of depression.  I try to not have these thoughts as a negative thing, but rather as a positive. Use them to inspire me to work through the dullness of general life while planning on doing more exciting things later. Eg. having a boring job now will give me the money I need to travel later.   I would love to move to the country (overseas maybe) and set up a self sustaining property to live on one day.   How about we put together all our money and resources and buy a tropical island! who's with me?!  	103
 Just "finished" with HTO.. Heading in on Sat, Jan 31 to take my Tech, and Gen. tests.   Very confident I'll be able to pass both with flying colors.      Very happy with the service they offer, and have a *ton* of links bookmarked for future reference that I got during my study there.   Another very satisfied customer..      When I start my study for Extra, I'll be back at HTO. Very good stuff there.   Wow, that looks like its seen some service, LOL..  According to the specs, it looks perfectly usable for a HT. And its right in the butter zone for 2M use.   (downvote obliterating upvote from me :)  )     or is it just me?   ..Because she's dead.   Wouldn't 3/14/15 9:26:53 be more appropriate?   I've spent time in both Dubai, and Trondheim, and I'll second that Trondheim is a very expensive city. A pint of Dahls Lager (you can see the brewery up on the hill from downtown Trondheim) runs $11-$14USD at the cheapest bars. The Taxi ride from the Airport to anywhere in the city was $135USD (~25KM travel, IIRC)  If you ever get out that way, check out La Familien.. Its a club downtown.. Got a great DJ :)   I've been shooting, and reloading for many years now. Unfortunately, my parents are not gun people.. In fact, for quite a while, they were anti-gunners.  For whatever reason, I really hooked into shooting. I have hunted, but my primary pursuit is the elusive tight group on a paper target. Its like golf, or trap shooting to me.. No matter how good you get, you can always do better. My "break in" info comes from the 80 year old goofball that took me under his belt, and walked me through reloading, shooting, and my appreciation of hoarding brass. Yes, I can clean a gun, with emphasis on long guns.. This 80YO goofball is my mentor, and he firmly believes that breaking in a barrel is important. This is what I had to go off of. I now understand that its not important. This .17 shot badass groups at 100 yds out of the box (I did clean it before shooting it, just to get the packing grease out of the barrel)   .   I'm a noob.. even tho I've been doing this for 20+ years. I'm only as good as the info I can get, hence; asking /r/guns if I'm talking out my ass when I ask if barrel break-in is something I should do.   thank you all for your input..    And, FWIW, My .223 shoots less than .7" at 100 Yds everyday. (40Gr Horn. V-max, with 23gr reloader 15)... :-)    Base model Savage 93R17.. Waiting on a Boyds custom stock (Varmint Thumbhole "Pepper" color) Tossed a cheapo BSA Sweet .17 scope on it.. Actually it dialed right in.  ~1.5" 5 shot groups at 100 yds. Not bad for a sub $300 rifle.   Cool.   Thanks all for the info... I'm off to go sight this puppy in!   So, am I worried about doing the whole fire one, then clean, repeat 10X, then fire 3 then clean, etc.. - With such a small caliber, is there any benefit to doing this? With my .223, I even loaded up special "lapping bullets" with a light charge of reloader 15. (they were impregnated with varying coarseness of grit) Alas, this isnt an option for the .17   Any input would be greatly appreciated. :-)   Leaded glass, and leaded stained glass refers to the lead H channel between the glass pieces that were lead soldered together to hold the work together. Lead boils off way before the melting point of glass, so the glass part of leaded glass does not, in fact, contain lead.   Just a FYI :-)   	11

METEOR OUTBURST: Radars in Canada are reporting a major outburst of Draconid meteors commencing at 16 UT on Oct. 8th. "Radar rates are at 1000 meteors per hour," says Bill Cooke of NASA' Meteoroid Environment Office. "This is greater than last year's outburst, and 5x the 2005 level."   Cooke encourages northern sky watchers, especially in Europe where night is falling, to be alert for Draconid activity.  Because radars are sensitive to very small meteoroids, there is no guarantee that this radar outburst will translate into meteors visible to the human eye.  On the other hand, a brilliant display could be in progress.  The only way to know is to go outside and look.  Check http://spaceweather.com for more information and updates.

Four years ago I came down with a case of shingles on my face.  This is one of more unpleasant diseases. Shingles is what us cantankerous old farts get when we get overstressed.  The  other prerequisite is that you must have had chicken pox as a kid.  Who hasn't?  It started out as a vague toothache so I  went to a dentist first and he missed it. Prescribed me painkillers and antibiotic. Next came jaw ache, ear ache, head ache, you name them. Then sores started to break out on my face and tongue. Went to a walk in clinic next day and the totally disinterested doctor on duty missed to.  More pain killers and cream.  Went to the emergency the next day and the admitting nurse took one look at me and told me what I got.  Got a prescription for antiviral med and appointment with ophthalmologist.  Next day I developed double vision. Back to emergency.  Seven hours later after a blood test and a cat scan it was confirmed that both neurons are functioning.  Another visit to ophthalmologist confirmed that one of the eye steering muscles / nerves is affected.  This will settle down eventually.  If the stupid dentist diagnosed me properly I would be ok by now.  Instead I have to put up with this for weeks, maybe months. Guys,  if you ever had chicken pox get familiar with symptoms of shingles (herpes zoster).  If caught early the treatment is more effective. My double vision persisted for six months.

 Force Unleashed included dismemberment by lightsaber.    I dunno. I think the tech looks really cool. It certainly doesn't look easier to pull off than modeling a cartoon band. The idea that the video seamlessly reacts to your performance is awesome.   Sunset OD is fun, but you're not missing a whole lot. What you really want in your life is Ori   the Blind Forest.   Also, I imagine most pre-ordering of videogames is being done at the retail level--e.g., putting down $5 at Gamestop or Best Buy. That money doesn't go to the game developer or publisher... it's just an interest-free loan for the retailer.   Hard to argue with the evergreen. Those are great suggestions, though I think only Carcassonne will support up to 8 players. If you need something for the higher player counts, consider The Resistance, Formula D and Dixit Odyssey.   I'm guessing it's called something along the lines of "Royalty-free Dubstep Sample #6"   I wish I'd read the physical book rather than audio. Wheaton seems like a nice guy, but he's an awful reader. So bad that it actively hinders the book.   Right. I recognize that the sponsors may actually be paying for a 2-3 minute spot. I have no idea what the economics of podcast advertising look like. I really only offered the criticism on the off chance that Jeff and Christian make them long simply to personalize them, because they think this makes them more effective. I'm not convinced that it does, but mine is just one uninformed opinion.   As for making the show look bad to its sponsors, that is definitely not my intent. I think their advertising dollars are well-spent--I've checked out both Harry's and the FiveFour Club based on the podcast ads. And if I ever have to design a website, I'm sure I'll be hitting up SquareSpace. And if I ever need whatever the heck it is Lynda does... well, I guess I'll go there, too.    Take heart, Jeff. Many people probably just complain because they value your opinion and insight, and they'd like more opportunities to hear you discuss other games. Don't let it get you down.    The commercial segments on DLC are just way too damn long. Am I the only person who starts hitting the FF button every time we reach a "word from our sponsor"?  I recognize that the show needs to be supported, and commercial spots are a great way of doing that, but it seems like they would be much more effective if they were short, 30-second spots. Or even a minute. As it is, they just go on and on. And on.   This is not unique to DLC, either. At some point during Weekend Confirmed's run, that's when I started noticing it. What was once a short shout-out to the sponsor ballooned into 2-3 minute segments. And now it's reached the point that I reflexively mash on the FF button 8-12 times until it's over.   Because I'm hopelessly egocentric, I'm assuming everyone else does the same thing. ;-) So, in the interest of helping the show, and the sponsors, I submit that the commercials need to be scaled back to a manageable size. Let's say hard cap at a 60 seconds. That's reasonable, right?   As a big fan of Risk Legacy, I'm pretty certain this is going to be the best board game released this year, for our group. It's just so exciting to take a game you're already familiar with and introduce new unknowns and consequences.  I'm not the world's biggest Pandemic fan, but I like it. And that's a lot more than can be said for vanilla Risk.   I don't understand the anti-F2P movement. Sure, the F2P model can be exploitative and frustrating, but who cares? Just don't play the games that offend you. There are F2P games that do it right, and it seems safe to assume that most Nintendo mobile games will, too.   Good clickbait headlines for a site like Kotaku, though, i guess.   I'm happy for the segment to be there if Jeff wants to discuss it. As others have pointed out, it's nice to hear passionate people talk about things that excite them. The segment has definitely convinced me to avoid HotS, but I don't mind hearing about it.   Thanks for sharing the link. Guess I should have done that!  Yeah, Pandante is a blast. I backed the original project last year and we've had a great time with it since then. Perfect alternative to Poker when you want a similar card game but don't want to bet money--or just want a lighter time with kids, family, etc. I'm really hoping this expansion does well, because it looks like it makes the game even better. :)  	14

             This never made sense to me. The following are considered histories:      King John      Edward III       Richard II      Henry IV, Part 1      Henry IV, Part 2      Henry V      Henry VI, Part 1      Henry VI, Part 2      Henry VI, Part 3      Richard III      Henry VIII  While the following are considered tragedies:      Coriolanus      Julius Caesar      Antony and Cleopatra      King Lear      Macbeth   Furthermore, how was it ever seen as a good idea to just take someone country, divide it, displace its people, and give it away to someone else? If the UN just suddenly decided that it was going to create a (insert ethnic or religious people) state by dividing the US into West and East halves and give the Western United States away, wouldn't it pretty well expected that Americans, especially the displaced ones from the West, would get pissed? I can't wrap my head around how this ever seemed like a good idea to anyone ever.   It seems to me his rabble rousing "Long Telegram" instigated the whole thing.

Current roster:  Batman  Catwoman  Cyborg  Deathstroke  The Flash  Green Arrow  Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)  Harley Quinn  The Joker  Nightwing  Solomon Grundy  Superman  Wonder Woman      The violence of this play is actually so over-the-top, all I could think of is old "B" horror movies.  We have war, ritual butchery and sacrifice, crime of passion, premeditated murder, rape (gang rape at that), mutilation, execution, self-mutilation, cold-blooded senseless murder, torture, the threat of infanticide, cannibalism, honor-killing, child murder, consensual homicide, and if you believe Titus knew he wasnt going to live through it himself, you can call it suicide in there as well.  And layers upon layers of revenge.         First off, let's get the disclaimer out of the way: I am **NOT** a racist. At all. I recently moved to San Antonio from New Hampshire to be closer to my family, which, by the way, includes quite a few Mexican-Americans.   I have a 3-year-old daughter who is white with gray eyes and blond hair. Recently, my wife told me coworkers of hers, including Mexican-American women, warned her after meeting our daughter that blond-haired/blue-eyed white girls get picked on by the girls of Mexican descent.   Is this true? If so, why is it true? My wife didn't want to push the issue with her coworkers at the risk of offending them, but I'm worried for my daughter, who will be entering into pre-K next year. I doubt it's a problem with 4-year-olds, but I don't want her to grow up being bullied, either.  I have no problem with Mexican-Americans or Mexicans in general. In fact, one of the things I love about San Antonio is the Mexican culture, art, and food.   Another thing that I've noticed is my daughter, being very outgoing and friendly, tends to walk onto playgrounds waving, smiling, and shouting things like, "Hi, friends! My name is _______! Want to play?" and the looks she gets from some of the kids are like... I don't know... mean. Like, "Who is the kid? Why is she saying hi to me? Why is she calling me a friend?" This got her instant playmates in NH. Here, it gets her dirty looks. Cultural thing? Again, this is the Latino/Latina children. The white, black, and Asian kids have been pretty warm to her.  Sorry if this is a TL;DR, but I don't know how to shorten it and I'm very curious.  **EDIT**: I'd be especially interested in hearing from Mexicans, especially those who grew up in San Antonio.  For those downvoting, I don't get you. This is an honest question out of concern for my daughter. It's not an attack on anybody.         A Monologue is a speech that is spoken to someone else, or at least another character on the stage hears it.  A Soliloquy, is a speech spoken to nobody, and only the audience hears it, not any other character in the play.   So which is this?   When Shakespeare writes dialog, they say what they mean. If hes talking about Love, hes in love. If hes talking about killing someone, hes angry and really wants to kill them. It is, for the most part, difficult to lie in Shakespearean speech, without a stage direction saying, He or She is lying. There are exceptions, but they just have to be supported by the text. The things other people say, or what that character says before or after the incident in question. In other words, they do say what they mean, unless there is evidence to support otherwise.  What is it even saying anyway?  To be, or not to be...   Be as in existing. To exist or not to exist, to live or not to live. Okay, hes openly questioning if he should live or die. So, this speech is about whether or not Hamlet should kill himself, which isnt totally out of the blue; at the beginning of the play, the first time Hamlet is onstage alone, he contemplates it there as well.  Whether tis nobler in the mind to suffer  The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,  Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,  And, by opposing, end them.  Which is better? Just take my wealth and position, keeping my mouth shut, but be racked with guilt over it, or to actually stand up for what I believe in, even though it would destroy and kill me and my family?  To die, to sleep-  No more, and by a sleep to say we end  The heartache and the thousand natural shocks  That flesh is heir to  tis a consummation  Devoutly to be wished.  But if Im dead, no more pain, no more suffering, no more guilt, and all the problems I have now just go away. Hey, that sounds pretty good...  To die, to sleep.  To sleep, perchance to dream. Ay, theres the rub,  For in that sleep of death what dreams may come  When we have shuffled off this mortal coil  Must give us pause. Theres the respect  That makes calamnity of so long life...  And if its all just a long sleep, whats on that other side? Its supposed to be so wonderful; thats why we endure all the crap in this world.  It goes on, but we can see its basically a suicide note of sorts, or at least a contemplation on the part of Hamlet.  Just before Hamlet comes on stage to give this speech, Claudius and Polonius, the murderous King and his Crony are talking with Ophelia, Polonius daughter, and Queen Gertrude. The Queen leaves... okay, now 3 on the stage. Polonius then says:  Ophelia, walk you here.  Gracious, so please you,  We will bestow ourselves.  Hes telling Ophelia, Hamlets Girlfriend, to hang out here. But we will bestow ourselves.?   The archaic meaning of bestow is to stow, deposit, store. So... lets store ourselves? Lets stow ourselves? Yes! Theyre saying, Lets go hide, which they then do. They exit, and Hamlet enters, talking all morbid.  But Ophelia is still on-stage. There is no Ophelia exits, nor is there Ophelia re-enters, so shes there the whole time while Hamlet talks about killing himself.  So, is the speech an aside that no one else hears? No, because at least one other person hears it, if not three. Hamlet finishes, then sees Ophelia, they have a big argument, and he gets crazy with the nunnery bit.  Exit Hamlet; enter back in Claudius and Polonius, talking about how mad Hamlet seemed because they absolutely heard him and Hamlet knew this. Then Polonius says:  How now, Ophelia?  You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;  We heard it all.  So, they did hear it!   In most all the previous scenes, and the ones after, Hamlet is very active; hes planning, plotting, getting things ready; hes already made some written contributions for the Theatre troupe thats preparing to perform for the Royal Court. Hes been pushing his plans forward to trap the King and give the final proof he needs to show that the King did in fact kill his father. Since seeing the ghost of his dead dad, hes been consumed by this desire for justice and revenge. Suddenly, for this 1 scene, he does a complete 180 degrees and finds it a good idea to kill himself? Yes, he contemplated it in the beginning, but keep in mind, that was BEFORE he found out his father was murdered. He didn't have any motivations as he does now. At that time, it was thought to be natural causes and the will of God, and hence, theres no one to get mad at, because no one did anything wrong. When the issue of murder comes up, that changes everything and revenge becomes his motive.  Suicide is a non-solution. Its a passive thing to do compared to the rest of the events going on. Its the easy way out, and Hamlet has been setting up these plots and plays with Machiavellian precision, which is definitely not the easy way to do anything. One could claim this speech shows another side to the character of Hamlet, but would that do anything to move the story forward? On its own, it doesnt. The full text of this play can run upwards of 4 hours long. How many people will sit for a 4 hour movie when it has parts that go nowhere? Is this speech Shakespeares way of saying, Heres a bathroom break?  NO! It is NOT a soliloquy! Ophelia was on-stage. Claudius and Polonius are hiding, and listening in, and Hamlet knows it! That means his whole suicide speech is by design. Hes already spent a few scenes convincing people that hes gone mad, and there IS method in it. The King and crony are trying to figure out if its true. Now, hes actively deceiving them, so that would make this speech something that moves the plot forward. Its just another part of Hamlets master plan, and so far, theyre falling right into it.  More evidence: The last time we saw Hamlet on stage, he meets The Players, and asks the head player to give a short, impromptu performance, who readily obliges him. Then, everyone else ends up leaving the stage, leaving Hamlet, alone, for real this time. Here he has a real soliloquy (he even mentions hes all alone) whereupon he marvels at the performance that head player just gave. In fact, he realizes, and is very much ashamed at the fact, that the actor has just shown more intensity and commitment in his task of that brief performance than Hamlet has in HIS task of avenging his fathers murder. Hamlet has just mentally smacked himself, reminding him to start raising the stakes, or hes going to fail at his task, and also realized the importance of acting as a role in his deceptions.  So I'm supposed to believe that suddenly, the very next words he speaks on stage are implying the direct opposite? That he wants to kill himself? A soliloquy of his innermost thoughts that says he needs to step it up followed by another saying the complete opposite?   Even MORE evidence: Shakespeares original source for Hamlet. This is NOT an original play by Shakespeare. It had been done previously by other playwrights and writers. The original source is called Historia Danica by Saxo Grammaticus. It chronicles the story of Prince Amlothi, also referred to as Amlethus. Pull off the u-s at the end, move the "H" to the front, and you have "Hamlet." The plot matches the play exactly. The father of Amlethus is murdered by his brother who then marries Amlethus mother, the Prince seeks revenge. A large part of his plan has to do with feigning madness. Two attempts are made to prove hes actually sane, one of which is to tempt him into lechery, the thinking being that any man who lusts for women cannot truly be insane. His uncle arranges for a woman to casually run into Amlethus in the forest to seduce him while they watch, which is the prototype scene for this Hamlet/Ophelia scene. But Amlethus is warned of the trap ahead of time, so he makes his own arrangements to whisk her off to a hidden place away from the eyes of the Kings agents, who gets her to tell him everything. He also has sex with her, because why wouldn't he? But in the view of the Kings agents, he continues his act of being batshit insane.  "To Be or Not To Be" is not a soliloquy; it is a monologue!

Every history teacher I've ever had always explained the importance of history as a means to learn from our past. Do we, though? Seems like we always have the same problems in government, wars, laws, civil rights, etc. For example, miscegenation used to be argued against the same way same-sex marriage is now. We said there'd never be another Vietnam, going into a foreign country, fighting non-soldiers without uniforms without an exit strategy, but we did. Do we really learn from our past?            I just did a clean install of Maya (Mint 13 w/Cinnamon).

I pretty much agree with this which is why it saddens me when eveyday, (Non military/law enforcement),people proudly show off their new "Slash master tactical death spike 9000" EDC.

Some day I will learn how to turn off that annoying feature.   When I was a kid in the early 70's we thought we were all cool with our CAT knives...they were junk. Turned me off to Mercator for a long Time. Looking back, they were probably  Japan imports which back then were junk. Today,Japan is the same Great Quality as the Made in the USA of yesteryear if not better.Try here http://www.worldknives.com/ I have had good luck with Linder, Nieto, and the French, Swiss and Russian companies. Anything from Seiki Japan is nice. Hope this helps.   Great knife for the money,very well made.Carbon steel blade takes a fine edge and is easy to sharpen,has a second detent so the blade will stop at half way closed instead of just snapping shut.

So awesome!   Kabar ships these with an extra set of black scales,(the fixed blades anyway),if you don't like the zombie look change the scales.I personaly love that logo.

 We're already 20 episodes in and we have yet to see Sei, Reiji, Aila, or Fellini. What do you guys think? Will we see our favorite characters before the season ends? Thanks! :)  	1
 Thanks!   You know, as the story progressed I really started to enjoy Harper and Julia. I really liked the arc of those two characters, and how their own relationship with each other started to change. I started to look forward to writing their sections the most.   Wowie, there are some badass authors out there. I feel the need to give you a top ten list. But...I will force myself to answer your question: When I think of a favorite author, I actually think of Blake Crouch because I have yet to pick up a book of his and not like it. Simple as that.  	3
 What a truly fucked up scene. Now I just want to wipe the tears from my eyes, go hug my daughter, and tell her that I love her and Stannis can go get fucked. Theon style.    I look at it like the tiger could be a light, quick type attack whereas the lion, crocodile, and ape are the power house type of attacks.   	2
 Hi,  I used to have an iPhone 4s and all push notifications (Facebook, Twitter, Skype etc..) were delivered instantly to my phone. Same thing goes for my mails. I recently bought an iPhone 5 and made it a copy of my 4s but push notifcations come in with a great delay or not at all, untill I open the app. I also noticed I'm being logged out of apps more often. Does anyone have an idea how to fix this? Make the notifications/messages/mails instant again? Because this is rather annoying. Thanks alot!!         Yes, this is the right size, thank you! Too bad the resolution isn't better but this is almost perfect, thanks alot!   This is in the perfect direction! Would love the resolution a bit bigger tough, using this as a Timeline Cover would look blurry. But thanks a ton already!   So, as mentioned, I would love to use this picture http://www.ilikewallpaper.net/iphone-5-wallpaper/Longboard-Girl/5972, as my FB Timeline Cover but it was an iPhone wallpaper so is way too high. I would love to see it/her shopped into a fitting enviroment or something, with the dimensions being good for FB.   Thanks to everyone helping me! Willing to offer a small reward if I really like it!   As a Belgian, I surrender. (Not as fast as France tough!)   Me in bronze: 'So you mean, if I rush these DT's and they don't have detection, I win? Awesome!!'  Yeah, I was that guy..      OMG are you like sergeant Batista's son? When you talked with that accent, wow..   if you tried this over here you'd get lynched by an angry mob who's iPhones got destroyed, just saying..   Olaf: Just ban me, honestly   I raise your repost with a repost   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0g9jrZJmF8 feature=youtu.be   Btw, anyone knows when brackets are up? Says registration is today on the site.   Thank you for responding and good luck in Season 3!   [relevant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKTpWi5itOM)    Alot of stuff on the Deep Web, in particular CP. Especially the way those people talk about kids just creeps me out, they act like it all normal..   Yes, what mdbjd said was correct, Riot has been criticised often because they tend to fall back on nerfing something they feel is too strong, rather then trying to balance it in another way, making alot of the campions feel the same and damaging the diversity.   I have got a Razor Blackwidow and I must say, I'm extremely satisfied with it. Not because of any changes in my play really (the keyboard is of course more then perfect for gaming) but just the way it feels when you type, the sound and the feel with every keystroke, nothing comes close imo. Once you go mech, you'll never go back :)   So there's just a forth of a pixel?   Yeah, not all roles are correct, just made as an example. And you wouln't be forced to put it there but you could, if you chose so..   I think this would be a gread addition because I believe lesser known streams will have a higher chance of attractiong new viewers. Say for example, I main ADC so that's what I prefer to watch. Now, none of the 'big ADC names' is streaming, what I usually do is watch someone else 'famous', wether he plays my role or not.  Now, if this were to be added, I might click a guy I never heard of before just because I'de like to learn from him, and when I like him, I'll probably come back. So, this will, in my opinion, give more exposure to the lesser known streamers. What do you guys think?      Relevant:  [http://imgur.com/a/Xvru5] **NSFW!!!!!!!**   Thanks a bunch!   Glad to hear I'm not the only one!   Hey, I mentioned, when I launch LoL server status says undefinded, however, when I check the website, it says all servers are up. Is it just me or is anyone else having this? Also, if anyone has a fix, most welcome! Thanks   IMPORTANT: Subtitle language can be changed in the bottom left!      I have a suggestion. Keep the light in order not to make things complicated but make it so then when you actually revive, it kinda looks like the Prayer-cape emote from Runescape if anyone's familiar with that. That would look so sick imo  cf: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWRRecTqGeU   This.. Actually, I don't even know if I'de want to know.  Actually, yeah I do..:p   Okay, I'll try to explain this the best way I can (note that English is not my native language). I've been thinking about how awesome/usefull it would be to see all the stats about your life, just for information/entertainment purposes or comparing to others.  This would go from basic stuff like amount of food consumed, exact time lived, hours slept etc to really specific/weird stuff like times mastrubated, reddits read, high fives given..  Would love to hear you guys' opinions about this and what would be the n1 stat you want to see for your life?   Time to start e-mailing EG sponsors?   Time to start e-mailing EG sponsers?   I worked in a pretty large fish-shop who sells to alot of restaurants. Whenever someone new guy came my boss would send them all the way to the ocean to go and get 'salt water for the lobster'. Everybody, and I mean everybody did this. Just imagine the hilarity when you see them coming back, dragging just gallons of seawater..:D   Thanks for the responses! However, I don't really follow Riot in their decision, not having a system like that just makes for the most ridiculous games form wich, imo, you don't learn a whole lot. It should be easier to, by example, tell the bots where to go from the start, so atleast you can decide for yourself in what team you want to play etc :)   Not a troll question, recently played a bot game again after a long time and I was surprised they still are retarded when it comes to lane mate. I made a team with me as Graves and then Sona, Warwick, Malazhar and Garen I believe. You would assume me both with Sona, WW jungle (but since bots don't 'jungle', him top with garen), and Malazhar mid. Now, what happens when I start the game, I see Sona run top with Warwick, Malazhar bot with Garen leaving the mid lane for me. Now my question, is it really that hard to make bots have some sense of awereness of where to go? I'm sure I'm not the only one who noticed this..  TLDR; Bot games are meant to learn noobs how to play but how can they when they don't come near real game compositions? Is it so hard to learn bots where to go?   Teemo is not OP, het gets countered just like any champ, quit the QQ'ing.   What about someone serving 2 life sentences? Would they then kill him a second time and only let him walk if he ressurects again?   I have literally spend hundreds of euro's on this stupid free online MMO called War of Legends. Yeah, big misktake. I was top of the server tough!    Scared the crap out of me the first time they used it. I like the idea of a voice saying 'GG' at the end of a match, just not that voice..   Thank you guys for all the answers, things are alot more clear now! Keep playing!:)   Allright, first of all, I haven't been playing this game for too long now (level 20-ish) and usually play AD carry (graves, ezreal, teemo etc..) Since the beginning I've been playing with first heal-ghost and later heal-flash as soon as I had it. Now, lately more and more people told me to switch heal for ignite. Granted, almost everyone runs ignite these days. But for me, it just doesn't seem right; I feel like as if heal helped me out loads more in games then ignite. And there are so many close call situations in wich I tough, if only i had me heal there instead of ignite. A feeling I hardly get the other way around..  Now, my question is, is it really that bad to run heal? Should I just keep using ignite till I get used to it? Thanks alot!   I agree, I don't want to generalise but it does seem like the majority of drama and bullshit is coming from the NA ladder and it's players. Makes me wonder..   Blizzard please buff Ezreal to fix this!!   Why does everyone seem to dislike Teemo so much?  	46
       all ten in a core set is not unheard of remember the pain lands?   in idaho where i am, they have abandoned trick or treating all together in favor of mormon kids lining up around cars at the mall and getting candy and businesses giving it out   very far shot, but the bat computer is a very powerful machine and the d.c.u. obviously uses alien tech, so i think that the bat computer and thus batman have access to Wikipedia in our world and thats how it has so much info on everything because its been written beforehand   my money is on the undertaker being he normally is around in the back, and vince would listen to him plus ive heard taker say hell in a hand basket lots of times on air   what part of idaho?         http://doaw.proboards.com/index.cgi      the best wrestling related troll ever  	12
       Of course this isn't across the board but it seems in English speaking groups and some closely related it is impossible to notice.   That was one of my worst fears before hand. I didn't have a drink the first 2 days. Since then over 2 weeks I have tied one on about 5 times. That means about 12-18 beers each night. I still haven't given in which blows my mind. I thought it was impossible. I honestly think I am just finally fucking done with these things. It feels great.  How has it been for you?        Thanks for reading. I know this isn't mind blowing or some great story but I am glad this sub exists so I am able to get it off my chest to some people who it means something to.               side note. What is myspace now? A wall of instructions?   The only side effect I have come across so far is being a bit spaced out and super super vivid dreams. No nightmares just super realistic mundane everyday shit with all of the people I know and in all the places I know them. Every night since my first day of being a non-smoker I have smoked in my dreams. Yet, in my dream I knew it was wrong and it was not good. I have woken up each morning thinking I had cheated.   So far chantix has helped me deal with what I could not. Cravings. Now it's all mental. I have an argument with myself about 20 times daily. It's usually me trying to convince myself to just have one after a trigger. Not happening. I am able to get past that withing 5 minutes. I started carrying around those [plastic floss sticks](http://img.dxcdn.com/productimages/sku_47578_2.jpg). They are a great way to get the oral fixation out of the way and keep my teeth clean.  I have smoked since I was 14. I am just about to turn 35. The past ten years I was up to a 1.5-2.5 a day depending on circumstances. I feels so strong that I am on day 4 and am actually proud of myself for once in many many years.   Thank you for reading my quick rant.      Oh, and no variations on any others.       The main thing I am anxious about is what it's like to have that last cigarette on Tuesday night.                                              Alfonso on blow is not somebody I would want to run into.             I sure hope that I can.         I even tried taking them with two different cameras. I also tried uploading separate older pics on my laptop and they work but these wont. Anyone else experience this?                     Anything goes...except child support and menthol cigarettes.  Creative is always good, but not needed. You got a phone bill or car insurance bill that is behind? Maybe you want to see a concert/show and can't swing it right now (thanks josh) let me know.   Don't be ashamed to ask for help, okay?  Edit: One electric bill shut off notice and one swedish drinker taken care of. Cheers guys. I love all of you fucking booze faces.

I ran into a guy on his bass boat and we got to talking. I was dragging a worm across the bottom by the weeds and my freaking pole went nuts.   When I finally got him about 10 feet from my kayak he took my pole about a foot into the water. The guy who is an avid bass fisherman was actually amped/ "Holy shit dude that a biggy"  This fish finally came up and jumped over the tip of my kayak. Coolest looking thing. It was such a rush.   Sadly I was not able to get a picture and as I was pulling it up next to me it got loose. :( The dude on the boat said it was probably a 6-7 pounder.  I know to most of you this is old news in a bucket but for me it was like christmas morning.   Anyway I just wanted to tell my tale of it.   It's some new show on NBC and I figured you guys would like to know. Now, drink your piss.   Anyone down for a quick trip tomorrow at around 6pm at Seldens?         I wont mention any bands myself as to not make this a circle jerk of taste in music. Have you ever dealt with this? Do you constantly deal with this?    Well, I plugged the sucker in and windows couldn't find the driver. I am using a windows 7 64 bit laptop. So, I went and found the driver(s).

Anyway I go and download audacity because I have fiddled with it over the years and know it is a really stripped down program that some buddies of mine would use when we would write songs. Now I am able to choose the audiobox from the output/speaker menu in Audacity but it is nowhere in the input/mic menu. Does this make any sense to any of you?

Hmm, this ass feels nice. Boob! Lick the nipple. Must squeeze boobs. Ok, back to grabbing booty. I wonder if I can fit my entire hand around this booty. Nope. Man, I love underboob from this angle.

In 3rd grade i heard that the class clown got sent home for writing the f word in the boys room.  I quickly went to see what it was but it was already removed. So close.   Hopefully the extinction of the human race.    Yeah, but a machine with those specs are less than half the price you paid. And with newer processors.   I guess my point is, it doesn't matter what you buy in regards to electronics.  In a couple years, it quickly losses its value (monetary).   Have you tried emailing Serato support or going on their forum?    Most technology losses half of its value in 1 year and are basically worthless in 2.

Well obviously my TV is not as big as the theater screen. I'm saying that the movie theater industry is suffering. Even with ticket prices double what they were a decade ago, movies still have a difficult time grossing record numbers.   Maybe more people are realizing that McDonald's food is garbage.    It might help if you include your location. $800 a month might get you far in Montana,  not so much in New York.    Thanks for the laugh   3d movies are a gimmick to try and give movie theaters a competitive advantage over in home theaters, but the theaters and movie studios are fighting a losing battle.   I prefer to watch movies at home and my TV is plenty big. I'm sure there are many others who share my same preference. The draw of 3d and big screen is not enough for me to pay $15 to $20 bucks for a theater ticket.    I think it's because watching movies in theaters is a dying trend. Most people will torrent the movie or just wait until it comes out in digital format.    A honey badger   Well that escalated quickly   Remember, you aren't stuck in traffic; you ARE traffic.

Here's a cool time lapse of cars in San Diego where they are all separated into color. http://vimeo.com/82038912 look at how many white/grey/black cars then count the rest of them.  There's like 2-3 seconds of blue and one pure yellow (sentra on the top) and one orange (WRX).   [not that rare](http://i.imgur.com/sAsSfgh.jpg) I love mine, get compliments all the time.  What I never see are sport coupes.  It's always an X series or a sedan S   I added a 500w amp and one 10" sub and it's fine.   They might make a case if something that is directly connected to the mod if it goes wrong. Like the maf, or the o2 sensor goes out with a intake and exhaust mod.    Maybe add a little more fluid abd check the level of your pads.   It's got a hole in the top for one but I've not seen anything that goes in it. Our unit makes smoothies like a champ.  It's the only button we use   I think it refers to when you are walking down the sidewalk and you are on the "outside" of the two of you, closer to the street.  This is more dangerous for you and safer for her.

I've not seen a unit that has a dyno of both (and only both) vs stock.  It's seems far fetched, but they have some data to back it up.   P85D, D means dual motor.  so it's AWD with launch assist so it doesn't blindly put the power where it doesn't need it.   That's why they need to get the hydrogen fuel cell's working at this level.  You can just pump more hydrogen into it to generate more electricity and have a long range, fast refill and just as powerful of a car.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG6veF_34QE really?   It seems like a lot of people already are.  Valentines is in like 2 weeks.   they usually are trying to smash it in to some other moving thing which is tough.  If all you are doing is smashing it in to a wall...that's much easier.   It could have an embargo against releasing reviews until the day it's released, like assassins creed unity    Wait 6 months after it comes out, it'll be 1/2 price   www.idonotwantkids.com   http://puu.sh/f0h0F/0e9268a204.jpg  $85/mo but I use it for some business work so I can expense it.   Back when game distribution wasn't that good, you had to pre-order games in order to ensure that when it came out, you could actually get a copy.  Now you can get virtually every new release in a digital download format, therefore there is an unlimited supply of games.  So, with that being said there is actually 0 reason to pre order a game.  Games will go on sale after they are released.  all pre orders do now is just give game companies money for stuff they haven't done yet.  They know they can just rush games out, un polished, buggy, and patch it up later if need be.  But they don't need to do that, because they'll just work on the next half baked big IP game and shovel in more money from those pre orders.   I thought we were stopping the whole pre-order thing now?   Stillen Gen 3 will get you the most HP/$ for sure.  I like the sound of the [Stillen Exhaust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw41sSRZ4mU) as well.   Both of those combined should give you a 30+hp boost for about $2k total.  If you go big, then you can go with a supercharger or Twin turbo kit, but those can be upwards of $10k and get you to 500+ hp at the crank   Which is why I don't own a XB1, and won't buy any racing games on the PS4 until GT7.   Maybe they'll have the G27 figured out by then.   I'm really disappointed in Sony that they have snubbed everyone but Thrustmaster.  That's the real issue.  I've spoken with people at Logitech directly (at E3 and PAX) and they say that it doesn't have the little chip inside it to make the unit be recognized as a legit device.  They say they are working on it, but damn, they've been out for a year and nothing.  I'm sure they've done all they can, but Sony isn't letting them have the rights to it for some reason.    Don't use so much throttle?  You are in control of how high the engine revs in a manual transmission   They just bought 10 Barrel out of Bend Oregon too.

They have your money, what incentive do they have to make it extra polished?   Yeah I remember. But up until the last few episodes, I was always pulling for Walt.   Don't you feel due to the nerves in your arm leading up your spine?  What if you weren't attached to the spine?   There is a lot of discussion around the length of time you may or may not be conscious.  But what would it FEEL like?  Would there be pain?  Sounds like a silly question, but if you have no spinal cord attached to your head, what pain could you feel?     I get why they were against him, but they didn't see all the work, planning and shit he went through to set them up and their future family for life.   I don't think I ever hated him.  I was rooting for him the entire time.  I was pissed when his family found out and just flat out turned and rejected him after all he had done for them.  So much work, so much pain, so much death...all for the family.  And they want nothing to do with him.  Fuck that family.   he bounced up and down, but when he hit it the weight transfered up, the car had very little contact with the road. When he came back down, the tires griped again and jerked in a direction he wasn't prepared for and lost control.   If you can see a bump in the road 500 feet in front of you, you have not quite 2 seconds to react at 200mph.  at 200mph, the bumps in the road they hit you probably wouldn't even notice a 55mph.  It looked like it had a couple of little hills back to back which threw the car off balance and it would take one hell of a driver to keep it under control.    Tracks are bumpy too, you just get a feel for where they are and know how to negotiate them.  The bump that was in this vid probably wasn't even noticeable at 55mph.      Yeah, the 458 I rented was just a normal seat belt.  It wasn't a racing version, just a normal 458 Italia.   Xray says nothing broken   so YOUR the reason that warning is on the box.

Saw you at deck the hall ball and when you played the Neptune here in Seattle   Pepsi points were the zenith of these.  I worked as a bottle returns person at a grocery store in 1996 when pepsi points were around.  No one really collected them with any regularity.  So when people brought their cans and bottles in to recycle, I would take them to the back, cut off all the points (they were on the outside labels plastic bottles and on the cardboard cases of cans) and keep them, then sort them where they needed to go.  I had THOUSANDS of points at the end of the summer and got SO much crap most of it was pretty decent.   I guess the article was worded weird.

I'm not at home. I'll have to post it after the duck game   Hold a 10lb barbell directly over your head. Then keep your arm locked, and slowly lower it in 15 degree increments. See how much harder it is to keep it stable the closer you get to 90 degrees.  Now your shoulder is your neck, and the barbell is your head.   Your tendons will stretch over time under the added stress and the condition will get worse and worse.  I get a general ache in my upper back from to much phone time.

The big fancy hotels will cater to the business crowd where the bill expensed to a large company or the people that can normally afford 200+ a night don't mind (too much).     There's a saying..."The more you pay, the less you get".  Take the Porsche 911 GT3 RS.  It's a stripped down light-weight, no frills version of the GT3, but it costs a lot more.      with all that, what's your definition of "good profit" for 20 hours of work a month.   what factors makes your 9 units more profitable than others?   Wife = BS in Biochem with 5 yrs exp.  Had to look for 6 months to get a job that pays ok. She works (worked) at Amgen, but through a staffing company that pays her 55k/yr when a direct amgen employee was about 80k.  Friend of wife = MS in Biochem with 8 yrs exp making 48k/yr here.  The market is flooded here and companies are taking advantage.  Go elsewhere or do something else.     That's supply and demand right there.   It's close enough to where I don't care.  It makes it a little more unique. customizing your car is fun.  lying about it being imported from Japan...that's douche canoe territory.   There is a difference between a Skyline, and a Skyline GT-R (R3x).  I don't think they make a Skyline GT-R since the new platform in 2003.  It's just Skyline 350GT (G35) or the GT-R (R35).  If the kid has GT-R badges, then that's stupid.  If he swapped Infiniti for Skyline...there's nothing wrong with that.   R35=USDM GT-R  Similar platform to the G series, but not that close.  the G35 and the Skyline 350GT are VERY close.   go on...   Fully loaded Optima with the 2.0L Turbo...That would have been my car of choice for the price.  The Tc was basically a less girly Celica.   Technically it IS a Skyline, but it's not an R35 by any means. Just because it was "imported" doesn't make it any better (even if it were true).  If I had a 280hp car in High school, i'd feel pretty damn proud of it too.   Mom's dog. http://i.imgur.com/1nrtf0l.jpg   I hope his pant leg snags and a bloodbath ensues.   Well, to be honest, it's exactly what we intend to do.  Use the capital we've saved, invest it and (hopefully) get a lot more back in the next few years.  Once we have that new return, invest that and accelerate the income generation even more.  In the next 20 years, retire on pure residual income.    If you have the know how to setup the production facility, the distribution network, the sales channels, the regulatory compliance, etc. Then go do it yourself.  Be the boss and reap all of the profits.  I feel you in your specific chemical scenario.  My wife is a biochemist.  The business of chemistry and biochemistry is way more lucrative for the business people than the chemists that create the actual content their selling.  As such, she's quitting and we're opening our own business (not chemistry related).   I did the same thing at Best Buy.  I was a hourly department manager (not a supervisor, only one in the store) and there were 4-5 Assistant store managers.    I was making $21/hr + up to 40% bonuses.  They were flat 55-60k/yr + x% bonuses.  They weren't making their numbers to get bonuses, working 50hrs a week (60 for the holidays) and I was at 40 hrs/wk hitting max bonus numbers and had OT when I needed to work more.  After I left, one of the AM's "demoted" herself to my spot.  Same money, less work load.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight-hour_day  Here's where it came from.

 Honestly this sounds like the perfect application for camera traps.   http://www.basspro.com/Hunting-Game-Trail-Cameras/_/N-1z0ux3h/No-40   yeah, I could believe that depending on the pack.  There's still the mess factor though.  honestly not sure how much a pack cover  would help with that though since they don't cover the harness. i really want to try out large  poncho's again for that reason (and others)   It seems gist of the debate is that basically they are breathable and waterproof but only at certain levels of output, so they're rarely waterproof *and* breatheable at the same time.  At low output, low external humidity your internal humidity will be high enough to get pushed through (breathe) but low enough to not overwhelm it and get you wet.  [So it's breathable.]   (http://www.thegearcaster.com/2014/02/what-exactly-is-waterproof-breathable-fabric.html)  But when it's raining out, your internal humidity will essentially never exceed the external humidity, so it won't breathe, but it will keep the external water out to.a.point.  The material can still get [fully wetted and end up yielding to the rain.] (http://sectionhiker.com/why-does-rain-gear-wet-out/)  And there's the rub.  When it's raining out, it doesn't breathe well, so you're still getting wet by sweat. As wet as in a downpour ? Depends on you. Maybe you'd be better off just wearing nothing, or better off  in a fully waterproof layer  (forgoing any claims of breathability) or maybe dumping heat mechanically (pit zips, vented side pockets etc).     It's tricky stuff, it's rather endleslly debated, and you'll see all varieties of approach to rain on the trail.      http://www.andy-kirkpatrick.com/articles/view/the_truth_about_breathable_waterproofs  http://popupbackpacker.com/the-search-for-the-holy-grail-waterproof-breathable-rain-gear/  http://treelinebackpacker.com/2014/08/09/backpacking-in-the-rain/    In one day of constant drizzle marked by downpours on the AT this week  I saw very expensive membrane parkas on slow moving new hikers, I saw very fast packers just wearing windshirts (makes sense too, get wet, but at least you're keeping the wind chill off),umbrellas, me in my full on rubber rain coat, and folks who just wore nothing. Hard to say any of them were right or wrong.    In the military I've used goretext parka's, pvc tops and bottoms, as well as simple poncho's.  They all have their place.  Goretex is comfortable and easy to deal with, it's built right into your jacket so you don't need an extra layer etc, but I absolutely remember it leaking when laying on the ground.  PVC absolutely won't leak as a material, but the design could have errors in it, and it's not as comfortable. Personally though, for just rucking, I happen to really like a large poncho.  It covers you and your ruck all at once, keeping your ruck drier than any cover could (which still doesn't cover your big ole sponges we call hip and shoulder belts), you get leg coverage, you get mobility INSIDE the poncho so you can do things like eat, smoke, grab the camera, whatever and you can choose to keep your hands out (using poles) or in.   They're also the most breathable waterproof layer *evah* and for trail hiking, I think they're the bestest.   Can't really ski, climb, scramble, run or do other stuff in them too well though.    I think there's a lot of truth in the comments as well.  If I get caught in a downpour, the contents of my pack may be fine, but I don't  like hauling a soaked pack that much; it really takes a very long time to dry out and is a mess later than evening setting camp.    Hey thanks!  I just drew them into my map and it all worked out perfectly !   Those new shelters are  really nice !  Raven Rocks is pretty much nicer than my house ....     I think I spent a solid 15 minutes deciding which block of cheese  LoL, this statement itself is very calory dense.    I'm very impressed at how you can have your right foot to the left of the print, but your left hand to the right of it, while using (presumably) your right hand to take the photo from top dead center.  Are you by any chance a Competitive Twister player ?    You're going to be really surprised how quickly that 20 pounds comes when loading it up with real gear.  But like you said, go hit the trail with it. If nothing else it will be great for winter hiking where you need more space for lots of lightweight fluffy stuff and a big ole nerf ruck is perfect.     Really ?     Cheered me up !   Planning a section hike and working off an older map... for the Northern section of Maryland, it seems like:   - Ensign Cowell Shelter is a new addition east of Hemlock Hill shelter.  Correct ? Does Hemlock Hill exist anymore ? - Raven Rocks shelter is a new addition, near the Devils Racecourse shelter, but on the opposite side of the trail.   Did I get that right ? Thanks !    Just wanted to share something that's working very well for me.  I've read a lot of arguments for compound lifts, as well as for isolation lifts.   You can achieve the best of both worlds though by combining multiple isolation exercises at once though.   For instance, you can do preacher curls while doing say cable hip abductions if you just slide the preacher bench over to the cable machine.   You can also very effectively do dumbell back flies while on a supine leg curl machine, or do dumbell military press while on a leg extension machine.  This gives you time advantage as well as gym confusion which is very important to muscle growth.    I've reduced my total work out time to about 20 minutes and although I'm not into aesthetics I have noticed alot of people stealing glances at me while I work out now.     I was fully bracing myself for the impact  of the Rick Roll, only to be blindsided by this.    Pretty sure this is like the third car shop thread in a month... should probably just make a sticky.  Here are my recommendations:   -If you own a VW,  than Anker's on 40.  When I drove a VW only on rare occasion did anyone other than Pete or myself touch my car.  Does a great job, knows VW's inside and out, reasonably priced and very honest.    - I recently needed an emergency repair and called around looking for a shop that could work on my car same day.  Dobbin Auto did the job quickly, and for half the price of my dealership.  I get very good vibes from them as well, and recommend them. I have since used them for other work as well.  - BP over in Harpers Farm is the wife's go-to place. Been using them for years, never a problem, always reasonably priced.   Bingo.  National or by it's airport code. If you're my age and call it "Reagan" I automatically know you migrated here.   I never knew that Congress actually renamed it.  Seems like a really piss poor use of legislative effort, going around arbitrarily renaming things like they own everything.     Yep, I spent a couple years commutting from Howard County to Arlington County. Experimented with Metro and Marc, ultimately it was faster, easier and cheaper to drive, including high price of gas and renting a parking spot.   That cemented Metro as a failure in my mind.      The IRS holds on to it for me.     I'm not too big to admit OP got me.      GreaterGreaterWashington  Ok, I had to see the whole context to see you were recommending a website ;)  Thanks, I'll check it out !    Excellent... I can now justify more shoes... the wife will be so pleased   quick question, if you rotate through say two pairs of shoes, will each pair last *longer* than twice as long? In other words, do you come out ahead in terms of shoe longevity ?    Back in the day wouldn't you put stuff out like this and it would just disappear overnight ... ie you were basically donating it to someone who needed it more than you did ?    If someone who tracked the issues passionately wanted to start a more insightful blog/ website I'd contribute a couple dollars a month to it.  Not much, but start multiplying that by many folks and you may have a viable resource.  Perhaps could even kick start it.      I did a lengthy commute for years, and pretty quickly worked out that it was not only cheaper but actually faster for me to just rent a parking spot at work and drive.    They built a major  subway system in a major city with no express trains.  The fact that they were more expensive too was just insult on top of injury.         I really don't  understand how public transit can cost more, while taking longer, than a privately owned vehicle.    Right now I think I'd rather have one of those guys as president than any of the choices I suspect we're going to get.     [/r/DragonsFuckingCars](http://www.reddit.com/r/dragonsfuckingcars) .  You read that right.    that does seem more effective. no convoy of dump trucks to carry away the waste soil needed, and you can probably drop that really, really deep each time.    I presume now the miniature rose plant is completely charred ?    Is it bad when that happens ?    Holy Cow, it looks like a Walmart !   Word up.  If you can't fall asleep in under a minute sleeping on a pile of rocks, than you ain't tired and probably should be carrying the gun or the radio.   oh yes, I remember that.  Some schools still do that bullshit; pushing kids into fundraising for them, knowing damn well that it's really just the families paying for whatever crap they're promoting.       Crackers on sale, buy them by the bloc.     even after I learned it was brine shrimp, I thought it was pretty amazing that there's an aquatic animal you can ship around as powder, and would have settled for that.    But that didn't even come through.  I do remember those "Olympic" ads too though, with the "Mr O".  Man, we really let people just scam the hell out of kids back then.  I'm surprised there weren't Joe Camel ads in comics.      I ordered some of these and had my first life experience in the realm of false advertising.  Funny, that's exactly what I was thinking.    I would, and then I'd out this gym and the manager for not doing anything about it.     There's a whole lot of Nope going on with that frog.   Just more of everything.   More mom and pop restaurants, more ethnic foods, more cool shops, more mom and pop shops. They have sidewalks, and you can walk anywhere.  Even in between towns.  More of everything there, except lakes.    We win on lakes, hands down.   It's pretty cool having a beautiful lake in your neighborhood, gotta give Columbia that.    And we have better highway intersection for sure, but we're still so far north that even with the highway options getting to DC takes forever.  I'm not all that interested in getting to Baltimore.   And housing here is cheap; you can still get a sfh for mid 3's here.      What does Lotte mean ?   There's a string of Asian super stores around DC called "Lotte Plaza".     Is that a Korean Costco ?    /r/TalesFromThePizzaGuy/   So ... pretty good ?    You mean but NOT a spreadsheet ?   YEP, I'll be having seconds.    So, I wonder if there's any resolution for the organization pushing 1099's on folks ?  There is a pretty clear definition of contractor, isn't there?  Isn't there some way of saying "look, these folks aren't contractors, and this tax burden is on you not these folks"   I'm not familiar with the specific HBO problem, but generally speaking here's why using IP addresses instead of names can fix things:    The Internet Protocol doesn't recognize words as computer addresses.  To send traffic to the right places, it wants IP addresses, such as 192.168.1.1, much like your postal carrier can't deliver mail addressed simply to "Reddit" but rather requires a proper street address.    These IPs are difficult for people to remember though (quick, what's the IP address for a popular search engine? a popular web based email app ? a popular internet content aggregator and voting system? ) so the Domain Name Service, or DNS provides a collection of cascading servers taht translates word based names such as Reddit.com into IP addresses such as 198.41.209.137.   Your computer has to be able to speak to your DNS server though, and that DNS server will have to speak to other servers as well to ask for say new addresses it hasn't heard of before, get changes in addresses, etc.   Sometimes these servers are slow.  Sometimes they are poorly managed and have old addresses.   Sometime they go down, or there are network issues reaching them.   In these cases, you may experience delays in "name resolution" - resolving the hostname to the actual IP address.   Depending on the situation these lags may add up and cause real problems. Sounds like in your case the servers were down completely or just had completely bad records in them or something.  By specifying IP addresses for things instead, you're removing the need to resolve hostnames, thereby removing those lags or blocks.  HTH.    I wanted to find a meme of some incredibly cute baby goat throwing you an upvote, but then figured it would never google, so I just typed this out instead.     There seems to be little evidence that his grandiose stories are anything more than just that.    To think in the 90's we were field testing prototypes all along and never knew it. Of course ours were green, as these new ones are clearly for Black Ops use only.     under-appreciated aspects of the city  Random ideas:  - the Zoo.    - tour Congress - visit the Crystal City Underground.  It's a small shopping mall, underground.  - tour the Pentagon - Check out chinatown.  It used to be a fascinating place to hangout.  Loads of Mom n Pop chinese restaurants and gift shops selling the coolest most interesting stuff.  Except nowit's a gentrified sports arena area. Genuinely not sure how much actual Chinatown stuff is there, but if other folks say there's still some original stuff there, go check it out.  Used to have an awesome ginormous dragon arch over the street too that was very much worth photographing.  - see a movie at the Uptown - go see an all-ages show somewhere.  call around. try black cat for instance.    - walk/jog the parkway on the weekend when the road is closed.    Seems rather common in gyms though actually.  I think it's for the purposes of appearing more price competitive.   Sure, I'll have to go find it then I'll PM you.  Does the cold help by keeping folks indoors, so you get less obstructed views ?    If Hanover == Fort then yeah, it's really great.  Great employees, great patrons. All in all best gym experience I've ever had.   Unfortunately, I find myself willing to drive over there less and less and looking for something closer to home.  Really wish there were a PF here.   I've been thinking about going back to CA recently just due to proximity and because if my family ever decided they wanted to venture back into a gym it's a great place for all of us.  But yeah, they do to much differentiated pricing, and I recall the free weight room always seemed dominated by hordes of kids.  As a rec center though they're great... I mean really, racquetball, pool, hottub, indoor tracking, skating rink... actually I may be selling myself on it again ;)   If  you want to lift seriously then Colosseum is probably your first and last stop.  I'm guessing there were competitive lifters in there when I took a tour.  Loads of very, very serious looking equipment including strongman stuff like tires and hammers.    [ edit: background: i was told to train pullups for an obstacle race. ]  After my main 3 lifts I do cable curls, lat pulls and seated rows. can I replace those with pullups instead?      that's really cool !    Where do you live ? I have a full time career, but for 15 bucks a pop I'll make a second job of bringing you pizza and smiling.    ok, but in fairness, if they really do get a boatload of free equipment, that's a nice help. But I've never considered it good 'publicity' given that reality shows have always played on morbid curiosity.      that is a lightning rod.   Ah, of course.  You definitely wouldn't want to risk a lightning strike up there.   publicity you get for being on the show probably help.  Yeah, I don't know.  I suppose it could turn out well for some, but my gut really tells me the publicity of featuring your shop in a soap opera is a short game.  But  who knows....    I've spent half my life in Rockville and half in Columbia. I'd say Rockville is way, way more walkable than Howard.      This is great !!     that's a really good rate for CA.   They should have gone the extra mile and just used a Mr Hankey on the sign.    "and then we'll place this nasty spiky looking thing ... let's see, where would my head go if I fell over backwards... right. There. "   Aside from classes, shows, utube etc I would suggest finding a good cookbook.  Many of them, like Joy of Cooking, aren't just recipes but will also teach technique, selection, prep and many foreign food cookbooks will also even teach the culture and history behind a dish.    I actually learned alot  from Joy of Cooking.  It's always been my  cooking bible.   really need to borrow a tripod  Are you a Columbia resident ? Which village ? I may be able to help with that.    yikes.  sounds like it was being used as transient housing.    Man. I'm seeing this way too late, and I'm not a huge board game guy myself, but I think this is pretty awesome to do, Second Chance seems like absolutely the perfect place and crowd for it, and it's definitely kicking things the old school Columbia way.  tl;dr:props.   "Pentagon City Mall".  "Pentagon City". "Pentagon".  Think about that.  Not so odd, and unfortunately there's constant issues with whackjobs.     if you really want to lift heavy and lift hard check out Coloseum.  Personally I'm a huge fan of PF though.  I belonged to the Y and CA for years and recently checked out several gyms closer to home, still can't beat PF IMO.  True not alot of heavy free weights, and no racks; I just bp, squat and DL on the smith rack and then use the cable machines for other stuff.   Also, nothing else in the area comes close to PF for cardio gear.  Not just number of pieces but variety as well.  They have like a hangar of equipment.    there are many, many different variations of saws, even just among those used for tree work... so by 'normal' I presume you mean a bow saw, pruning saw or other type of manual saw.   i need to chop up a tree, much of which is 12" or greater in diameter.  I'd rather not do that via a manual saw.  But yes, of course, I could.    Dan and Matt - from your Farcebook page I know you're watching this thread.   Please give us a way to subscribe to your paper that doesn't require facebook.    I wouldn't mind hardcopy in sleeves and board.  I'm serious.    this is pretty much how the Onion started.  Everyone started somewhere.  I remember reading Matt Groening in the back of the City Paper long before he got his big break on the Tracy Ullman show. I have a signed copy of Jeff Kinney's "Igdoof" which he was selling in the Stamp hall at Maryland in the 80's.     The section at the bottom is EXACTLY my impression of Baltimore TV news.     Of course.    Sweet !  I appreciate the advice.     Hey, I'm terrified of skateboards (rode one once. Once. Ended up in the ER,lOL) but my daughter wants to skate.  She's had a board for a year or two but never really touched it, but recently her and her friends got some mini's and they're breaking them out alot more frequently,so I want to support and encourage her skating.  Penny brand though).  She needs protective gear - do you think [these helmets]  (http://www.dickssportinggoods.com/family/index.jsp?categoryId=15682616) are decent ?  Are is Zoomiez better ? Or should I check out some Mom and Pop skate shops ?  And is there such a thing as skateboarding lessons, like weekly group lessons, that sort of thing ?   And last question - we have a coupleparks around here. Is it easier building basic skills on a half pipe versus say the street ?    thanks !    /r/justiceporn   Yep, been shopping at Andy's place for years and years.    thanks /u/chkenpooka.  i've rented stuff from them in the past too ... was really hoping just to borrow for a few minutes.  I also happily lend tools to my neighbors.  It makes no sense for them to spend money on something they'll use once when I already have it sitting around taking up space.   Thanks Paul, they would ... and now they publish their rental rates as well, which is great.  But it would still be around 50 bucks when I really just needed one for a few minutes.  AND, I'm hoping to invigorate this really novel concept of sharing.     I too an very well travelled and I can definitely think of plenty of worst places, but I'm maybe 2 years away from bailing on this town and moving back to Montgomery County or, more likely, Va.   If I'm going to have ridiculous congestion, I at least want some amenities for it.  No, getting another fake Italian chain restaurant doesn't count.  Columbia started off as one of the coolest, hippest burbs I'd been, and has rapidly turned into everything that's wrong with the suburbs IMO.     I had a small tree come down on the fence and I need to get it up out of the neighbors side.  Does anyone have a small gas powered chainsaw I could borrow ? Wouldn't need it for long at all, probably a half hour tops.   Edit: Hey everyone, I'm pretty aware of all the rental options around.  I'm really hoping to borrow, not rent.  I also readily lend tools to my neighbors.    so, the downside being a limited season ;)   step 3, learn to set your own anchors and bail on the gym fees   Mmm, I grew up in Rockville.  I'm increasingly using the word "sucks" to describe Columbia.    I have never understood why someone would put their restaurant/bar/whatever on one of these 'we fix your restaurant/bar/whatever' shows unless they had literally never seen any reality tv show, ever.   These shows' entire business  model relies on making you look like the worst humans ever.    As you said, there's plenty of choices.  I would think about what's important to you first, so you have something to prioritize.  Is it free checking ? A good money market ? Low loan rates ?  Online banking / website  ?   Then hit google maps and see which ones are convenient to you.    I would actually compare versus jumping on say the first one available at work.  I've compared rates at my CU to other local popular ones and mine have been better; all  CU's are created equal. But many agree that they're all much better than the "big boy" commercial banks.    Yeah, I wouldn't blame the kids, but I definitely would expect better of the parents.  Not so much because it's a war memorial, but rather just because it's so obviously not a play thing.   That's what the triceratops outside Natural History is for.    A child born to poverty has a good chance of reaching middle class. Their children could become millionaires.  Personally seen both of these occur.     sounds like some sort of over  the heel footear is important, even if your run time suffers.    may I ask what you were wearing for lower body during the TM ?    i made a word for that.

Sufficiently advanced incompetency is indistinguishable from malice.    Last November my first log shows 15 minutes on a treadmill set to 2.5 mph.  Last Sunday I ran over an hour, 6 miles total distance. Later  in the week I took over a minute off my short/fast pace, and was invited to join an obstacle race team.     So ... this is like 5k meets Holi so non-Hindi's can enjoy getting plastered in colors while "racing" ?   Ok, I'm intrigued.       yeah, i really, really wouldn't judge medical care by online reviews.  Buying a bicycle ? Looking for a good pizza? Sure, but medical care seems a bit ... I don't know... important(?) to judge by online reviews    Yeah, our public transport situation here pretty much sucks.  I've never bothered with the local  bus, but I've always been amazed at how Metro doesn't even pass the beltway over on this side.   You're doing the right thing.  Keep looking for a carpool.  Don't sound at all whiny or  bitchy, just logical. You're like "I'm stuck on public transport, our public transport is shit, who wants a carpooler".  Keep seeking and eventually you will  find.   Good luck.    Honestly not sure how one would bike from here to University Blvd though; not due to distance but rather access.     2nd Chance Saloon One of the few OGs left.

Here Chief  http://imgur.com/9fdDSNZ  I have about ten (running )miles in it so far and am still digging it. It's a perfect super light weight wind blocking layer for this kind of transitional weather.   Only drawbacks -   -Fabric is surprisingly water resistant.  As in form a cup with it, and fill it under the sink and the backside won't wet.  However, seams aren't taped... this is a wind shirt, not a wet weather top.  Perfect for fog, drizzle, mist though.   - Pockets don't zip.  Don't put your phone/mp3 player in them. I just wear a pocket belt thingy instead. The pouch in the back does zip though, but it's in the back.    At some point I'll have to weigh it.    In all seriousness, if someone made that version of the Echo, and made it for like 50 bucks, it would probably oversell the real Echo by 100%.     	113
 Vincent is upset somewhere.          Mayweather seems confident going into May 2nd. I doubt the losing thought has not crossed his mind though.       With the Boston Marathon coming up I wanted to see how shoes are made, this focuses on Asics but their generally made the same way.      Lol   I just bought the Nimbus 17s for 119.00 at Eastbay.   Where can I buy these shoes at a decent price? The lowest price on the 17s I have found is $127 total out the door new. Does anyone have insight on a lower price or discount?   It's almost become like a machine, follow the Zebra and hang on, granted if your not in shape you won't last. I think it's neat though, there so many different ways to win.

Interesting how it's become about the records.      I've used it but does it work for enabling/disabling mobile hotspot?

U.S. CAPITOL SHOOTING - On west front of building - Suspected shooter "neutralized" - Said to be a 'protester' - Building on lockdown   Did you find it?   Geolocation?   I feel the Yankees are going to wear on him and try to make him quit.   Tom Brady was picked up in the 6th, there has to be some gems left in the 7th.      This seems interesting, just trying to figure out the motive.      And Will can't do much of anything.    Sierra will make it to the end and be shut out, no self awareness.    Seriously, how was the ticket appropriate?    Ah typo, meant Boy Meets World, good one, chuckled.    Great show, still remember this as a kid.   Seriously will this be the theme all the way up to the fight?   http://imgur.com/a/JyhZQ   Meme?   Kid may not be old enough but deserves the money.   http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=5611   A podium finish is not out of the question but she will have to dig deep and run the race of her life.   http://www.buzzfeed.com/briangalindo/could-you-pass-the-literacy-test-given-to-black-voters-in-th#.mcGpnn2P1   http://www.buzzfeed.com/briangalindo/could-you-pass-the-literacy-test-given-to-black-voters-in-th#.mcGpnn2P1   The image was captured last week at the re-launching of the TIDAL music streaming service. While this is but a moment in time, it does provide a very useful body language teaching moment.   Madonna is standing in a modified fig-leaf position. She is of course, a very alpha personality - yet in THIS particular moment, she's definitely feeling more beta and with a lower confidence level than she's been on many an occasion.   Deadmau5 is standing with his hands in his back pockets and his thumbs-forward. This is a good alpha-beta hybrid stance and shows a high-confidence, but not one that is too high or too assertive.  Kanye West is standing with his arms crossed in front of his chest and without his hands visible. This signals he's defensive, closed-minded and - when we correlate this with his facial expression - we can say that Kanye is also feeling threatened and impatient. He wants out of this spot-light. He feels very beta and acquiescent to Jay Z's alpha, intelligence and relatively superior social skills.   Jay Z has his hands behind his back. We cannot tell how they are clasped, yet we can say this is a very confident, alpha stance. It sends signals of leadership and strength - yet as with all alpha signals, if this is over-displayed (for longer durations) - it will transmit signals of hyper-alpha mindsets, arrogance, aloofness, and condescending emotional tones. It's not surprising that he's standing this way since he's the principle business actor of the new Tidal music-streaming service, but he should not remain this way for too long.

You'd  think the NFL would test for both simultaneously.       http://www.independencedayclothing.com/#!shop/c1ylq   Thanks.   Collector's item.   The service is not worth it. A lot of bugs are yet to be worked out. Sling TV works a lot like cable, you can't replay what you want and have to watch what's playing live.   I have seen some news organizations give credit and link back to the OP at the end of their article, that's why readers keep coming back because their not trying to be shady.   Where's Shia LeBoeuf?    I don't necessarily think their shortcomings just a different way of learning/thinking, maybe in the next century docs will find a way to turn on/off the switch you mention.    Wow amazing.   Yep thanks for your advice, no one mentioned litigation. We are provided with a ABA therapist already, private insurance so we do get collaborate and have things to work on at home, just want it to carry into the classroom, except there is so much pushback. Thanks for the education, you must be well versed in special education laws...   Yes I feel that my child needs one, we hired one through our insurance provider so there is no cost to the district, we just want for the BCBA to provide services and collaborate one day a week in school. One day a week is that so difficult? This is to ensure what their teaching my son is being done right, which so far has not been the case. Just food for thought.       We spoke with the IEP team and our private ABA therapist is allowed in the classroom for observation, but I want for the therapist to collaborate with the school and provide services to my son as well. I don't know how Florida and Maryland Special Education laws could vary.   Thanks   [Here is the Senate Bill 1108] (http://i.imgur.com/qECZ9AL.jpg)   Wow had no idea, people will obviously pay what the market can draw because they want to witness history.    That's what matters right.   Wow eye opening thanks for the article.    Deeper than most?   https://youtu.be/kUxN8nvziV4   https://youtu.be/Qu2FCR0AHaU   Interesting point of view, what would the court base their decision on?   I'm sure with the notoriety a policy will be written or maybe not but agree, a sick move.   Agreed, the Principal doesn't want people who haven't earned the letter to wear one.    Their almost at break even, paying 50 dollars per Pay Per View is pricey, maybe their trying the Netflix model which has worked pretty well.   What happened to "In Bill We Trust"?   I'm interested, live in Texas.    How can I sign up for what you do? That's some good pay and your home nightly.   I'm human.    Funny movie.    Thanks haven't seen this one, it looks insightful.

 we've got Trader Joes... It could happen  (they were started by brothers)    We're the capitol of the state. A city that prides itself of arts   culture (compared to the rest of the state). It's a shame we don't have museums   a good aquarium. Even if it's a niche museum (we're getting a toy museum. maybe get a video game museum?).    I miss Moe's burritos. Wish we had couple more Jet's Pizza on North side.  Better Italian / Chinese / Soul food selection.  Public Transportation options (no toll roads   a rail system) More sports options  museums/aquarium (sad we don't. Toy museum is step in right direction)      Do you have a smartphone? if so, not really... the XBOX One Smartglass app does it for me. Mixed with the Kinect, I never grab a controller unless I'm gaming.    I miss plain ole Doritos (yellow bag)  Also, in the early 80's my family had a grocery store. I started noticing red   blue flakes on my Nacho cheese Doritos. I asked my Frito Lay rep   he didn't know. Then a couple months later, he brought in a new Dorito with the red   blue flakes (Cool Ranch Doritos)... They were putting the Cool Ranch flavor to get people used to the flavor.    Centro-Matic  Can't believe more people don't know this band. Boggles me they aren't at least 'known' by the general public. I bartend   put on their albums   everyone agrees it's good yet no one has ever heard of them.   Other band like that: Marah, Jason Molina, Blue Mountain, Grifters...   I almost never ask anyone for help unless I physically can't do it myself (just don't want to bug people) yet people who don't hesitate to ask everyone around them to do things irk's me...   That,   when someone gets into your business before they ask the favor...  Example: what are you doing tomorrow? Nothing, well then you can do ____. Just ask the favor, give me an opportunity to at least lie   get out of it...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StJS51d1Fzg  I heard some whack lady in Alaska is calling for Impeachment...   http://www.newrepublic.com/article/115283/onions-film-criticism-better-its-news-satire  the Onion's film critiques have been killing it...   I have several videos of this. I would run through the area to the truck   backtrack   it'd be chaos...   Banshees that overheat if they do too many acrobatics...   About time for a halo boat level...      Traffic is terrible. Quite possibly the worst complaint about the city. There's over a hundred people moving here a day. I'm sure there's other tax revenues that can pay for roads.  Toll roads are barely used. I won't use them, it's a luxury tax. I'm not convinced the $.25/mile (whatever the rate) they're receiving is more than the cost of people's lives being wasted in gridlock.   How much does the TxTag system cost to operate vs it's revenue? In 2012, MnPass (Minnesota's version) cost $2.4 million to operate and only earned $3 million in revenue.   If they'd just let us all use all the roads, it'll pay off in the long run.   Bring in the rail system, quit fighting public transit options,   share the roads...    I played up until Chapter 7 last night. Really good, much better than the first Portal. Great voice work, great writing.    Reminder: Map packs are half off this week too...   also: Halo 4 is $15 today   tomorrow...      GT: mobber  EDIT: I'll be on in the evenings this week  I never got around to playing Co-op... if I remember right, there's achievements for playing with different players on your friends list.     I saw a Titan jump from their bubble this weekend, like a full titans height over the bubble... my teammates thought I was crazy   I re-downloaded the map packs after having problems   it got all the achievements...   This sale starts tomorrow (7/8)   According to Mjr Nelson  - http://majornelson.com/2014/07/07/this-weeks-deals-with-gold-xbox-360-ultimate-games-sale/  Halo 4 DLC is going on sale tomorrow, right now it's $25.  Hopefully this'll spark some interest in H4 until this fall... The last DLC playlist was fun (4v4) but hopefully a BTB DLC playlist will happen (tired of playing same maps).   Also wish this price drop was permanent, seeing how H4 is 50% off.    Xbox 360's don't support .MKV  If on a PC, you can download codecs that allow Windows Media Center to play .MKV files. If you push/pull files from that PC, that is the only way that I know of to get a 360 to play them...   after Halo 2 we were at peace with the Arbiters people (Elites, Sangheili) due to their civil war...  When Halo 4 came around, the peace was over.  Who's side is the Arbiter on now?    Since the update, it seems half the matches end up uneven whereas they used to rarely do...   The only good news is that if you're up against one person, whoever kills the one pilot after the epilogue gets the achievement for killing the whole team after...   for a mom   pop ISP startup, it's a start...   now, will smith pays millions to worship aliens...   only villains put their drinks on the table...      http://mygrande.com/austin/1-gig-fiber-internet/   Mine got to where it was doing it every 2-3 days... same, had to unplug /plug to fix...  then I did a full shutdown, been a week   hasn't happened (yet)  http://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/How_to_do_a_Hard_Restart_on_Xbox_One   I remember buying the first CDs for around $8-10... then I remember buying CDs at around $18-22   thinking 'maybe I could just download them?'  the music industry was gouging their product. the business crowd was making more money than the artists. the middlemen were taking advantage of their customers. the market spoke.   Same here, the market will say 'screw EA'   they'll suffer until they die or change...   One of the main reasons the Dreamcast didn't make it: It was too easy to download   burn illegal games  Say you were EA   you got Madden coming out. You can make it for XBOX, PS2 but Dreamcast? You'll sell one copy, they'll put the Disc Image online,   suddenly the kids realize they can just quit buying XBOX/PS2 games   play for free on the Dreamcast.   They started having developers / publishers quit making cross platform games...   DISH Network users need not apply   DISH Network customers need not apply...    then make it illegal for cops to confiscate your phone or threaten to put your phone away...   I was thinking Michael Stipe with hair...   Usually play campaign... so probably there.    How is XBOX (MSFT) allowing this app?  They phased out their own Windows Media Center (WMC) app because they are trying to encourage people away from physical media (audio/video) files. There is no way to pull media files from your PC/Network from the XBOX ONE. You can only push (Play to). Not much of an entertainment center (especially when the previous 360 could).  MSFT is trying to sell MUSIC/VIDEO digital rights   has partnered with major studios to do this. Also, they are trying to appease these studios that MSFT is actively fighting piracy is these tactics...   Just don't understand why MSFT would allow this app when they have bent over backwards to make sure their own product can't pull files from their own Win 8 machines?   On XBOX 360   Win 8, they nerfed their WMC. On 360, you couldn't view WMC as recent apps. You couldn't pin it to home. The only decent way to pull files was to hit the Guide, go to video, select from PC...  Cool to hear otherwise, much more of a XBMC fan myself. Have gotten away from files as well (why, when you can stream most everything?)  EDIT: Remember that just because you are in the ID program, doesn't mean it will be accepted by MSFT to the included in the Marketplace. Their apps aren't as easy to get into play as the apps for Win 8.    SWAT teams. for drugs...overkill? the same unit you send out to bank robberies   terrorist raids is the same unit you take out a house in the middle of the night?    No, I have a good connection.   They'll twitch around on my end, but they'll be killing as usual...  EDIT: watched the clip, very similar. no loading message, I'll usually just spawn inside some pilot (not a Titan like you). It'll say 'Watching _____" on the screen. I'll never spawn. Just wait in limbo...   Happens to me all the time on XB1. I will respawn   it's like my camera is in another players head. Some kind of glitch... I can't move, just watch them play from inside them.    Projectors have slow input lag...    i wrote @XboxStore asking if they'd discount DDL yesterday but no response...   some rank it as the best job market in the nation. I think it's most jobs overall. tech   food service, it seems to be great. some healthcare   business jobs. other fields, not so much...  Austin has a good A/V niche appreciation market, but doesn't have the industry it deserves. What do you want to shoot?    Mine were messing up too, I re-downloaded all my DLC maps   they unlocked....  Now, If I could only get the "didn't see me coming" (assassin someone while scoped...)  	44
 Brilliant   Time to face the facts   Frazbear's Freight... look out for the Freddy train!   You've got me beat, dangit   School film contest   Noope   Nope   There's a link to merchandise on the right side of your page under "The Community"   It's Mr. Potato Head, Iron Man version, a.k.a Tony Starch   Play it on mobile and don't use headphones, it's less scary   That's a good point.  Do we know if anyone is possessing the suit?   Freddy Fazbear's Pizza does birthdays!  Reserve the party room!   I think "Freddy's: The Ride" would be awesome      wut   Yeah, Jaws also comes to mind as a good example.  Or some scenes in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.   I would be super tempted to eat it  And then you would have to send me another   It is about murderous animatronics but one of the reasons why it's so successful is no blood or violence is explicitly presented.     In this article he talks about trying to keep it "relatively clean with no blood or guts" http://www.geeksundergrace.com/gaming/developer-spotlight-scott-cawthon/  This reserved approach to horror is rarely seen but super effective, I mean the only comparison I could think of is Alfred Hitchcock (who was Catholic) who made thrillers like Psycho and the Birds   What happened to just calling him Golden Bonny?   School in LA   I never noticed Bonny in/on the arcade machine before      Nobody is from California?   Here's my story chart http://i.imgur.com/pOG1NNi.jpg         What if the character can't go through the vents unless you forget to keep the ventilation systems online?   Well here it is in another song 20 years older https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEibygqqLZc   Best thing I've seen all day   The chord is a sample from "I Love You More" by George Duke   I'm a big fan (no, not like the one on the desk) and I've beat night 6 in both games.  However, none of my friends want to play it; they are either too scared or don't understand the concept.  How do you share this game with people?  What are your experiences with this?   Just beat it yesterday!  You can do it, the custom nights are worth it.  Wind up the box 4 twists at a time and shine the light for Foxy, those are the tips that helped me finish it   Why not just draw one card and use the color on that one to dictate 1-10 vs 11-20?  So you'd only need 4 cards   The cameras are definitely going to be in the game.   Yeah I did but the way you said that makes me think I didn't   Yeah but I don't use it very often         Love that new pain job   I'd like to think this is what the peeps are thinking in Roller Coaster Tycoon or Sim City   Gosh darn it   Three entrances, sorry.   Just noticed that in FNAF 1, there are 2 doors in your office.  In FNAF 2, there are 3 doors.  In FNAF 3, there is only one apparent door.  Chronologically, Scott is counting down 3, 2, 1...               Made it myself, took me forever to figure out how to make a gif out of it  	48
 I did not care for Breaking Bad.    Well, listen, you can certainly take a shot but I don't know how successful you'll be.  The only thing you're at all likely to recover is the difference in costs.  You won't get your legal fees back, and you won't get any kind of public acknowledgement that you were right and they were wrong.  Also the Attorney General doesn't just give out opinions based on a citizen complaint that they were overcharged 15 bucks.  The AG is the attorney for the government.  People say this here often and it's usually a stupid idea, but IF you're correct going to local media might be a good idea.    That doesn't really help me. Sorry.  Yes, it does, since judges frequently base their decisions on a reasonableness standard.   The statute you quoted seems to indicate that this is a "base fee" meaning the fee can go no *lower* than $42.00.  In other sections of that same statute, there is no "base fee" language, meaning that this is somehow different.  I'd wager that that is the minimum, not the maximum, penalty.   Boy that ancap stuff came out of nowhere.    It seems like she's liable for damages but just flying under the radar. Is that an accurate portrayal?  Yes.    You sound really really stupid.   One of the reasons that sexual relations with minors is against the law is because they are unable to give consent.    You're still missing the point. I'm not talking about violent assault. I'm talking about someone attempting to pursue a romantic/sexual relationship. My wife is able to recognize that and shut it down. It doesn't matter if a heterosexual male cannot stop himself from pursuing a relationship with my wife because my wife can refuse his advances. A kid cannot.    You're not getting it. Not getting treated for cancer will kill you. Not getting treated for AIDS will kill you. Not getting trans treatment WILL NOT kill you. Unfortunately some individuals are in such a difficult situation that they harm themselves but this is NOT the same thing, no matter how much you want it to be.    Not getting trans treatment does not medically lead to death.    I seriously doubt a judge would find that hormone therapy is medically necessary. Strictly speaking it was not a life saving treatment. Yes I understand the tragic outcome but that does not make such a procedure a life saving treatment.    [It's always the other one!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mbxydkIMtu1qleraio3_250.gif)     Chances are, the court won't even want to hear it -- what she's doing is legal and thus irrelevant.  I assume the judge would be very interested that she isn't sober when she's watching the kids by herself, just as the judge would be interested if someone was drinking perfectly legal scotch during the day while watching the kids alone.   If it's not cool for your wife to drink when she's home alone with the kids, it isn't cool for her to smoke pot.  I'd speak to her about these issues and tell he this is unacceptable, and if there are no changes you are free to file for divorce.    No, I don't.  The same way I wouldn't ask a man to trust me with his wife.  But as we've been arguing, this is entirely different.  My wife is around men all the time.  I don't worry about this because she is able to let them know she is uninterested.      Also, at the very least they should recognize that they should work with kids.  Shouldn't?    Self control is a thing and people should both exercise it and recognize the potential for its use by others.  You admit to being a pedophile.  Do you expect parents to take your word for it that you do not intend to act on your desires?   How is an individual supposed to know that a pedophile is entirely in control of their urges?  Suppose a man knows my wife is married to me but decides to hit on her anyway, which does happen to married women.  I know that my wife has the maturity and experience to express to the man his disinterest.  I can rely on the other individual in the scenario.  Suppose a pedophile hits on my daughter.  She does NOT have the maturity and experience to express her disinterest.  The pedophile may believe she is reciprocating and thinks she is a willing participant.  If my daughter has a tutor that is a pedophile, how do I know that he controls him or herself?    Will I be penalized for fighting the ticket and being found guilty rather than going straight to the prosecutor and ask for a no point charge?  If you appear before the judge and get anything other than a dismissal to all charges, you will be assessed court costs.  Speaking to the prosecutor and asking for a different charge will still require you to appear before the judge and plea to the new charge.  Your chances of being found not guilty to all charges are essentially zero.  Additionally, the prosecutor can and likely will speak to the cop before agreeing to anything.  If the cop remembers the speeding issue you can be issued a ticket for that as well.   If I express interest in another adult, I assume she has the maturity and experience to be able to deny my advances if she is not interested.  The issue with child abuse and statutory rape is that children do not have the maturity and experience to be able to deny advances and are at risk of being taken advantage of.      You cannot force an employer to extend FMLA leave.     If the policy is owned by you, it is part of your (also taxable) estate.   Citation?  I've never seen a circumstance where a policy with a designated beneficiary was considered part of an estate allowing a creditor to go after it.   Your life insurance policy is not part of your estate so long as you designate a beneficiary.  Your creditors can sue your estate to recover funds, but since your policy is not party of the estate, they cannot go after that.   My understanding is that life insurance is not part of the estate and cannot be seized by creditors, so long as it has a designated beneficiary.   They are not her dogs and she cannot keep them.  She should call animal control.   You're not getting total ignorance. You're just not getting the answers you want. Everything you've said we know. We understand. Our answers are the same. Yes, for priviledge to apply an attorney must be involved even in a municipal government. I don't know what else to tell you.   Also disclosure laws are state AND federal. Washington has their own open public records act.    Okay, I'll try to break this down for you since you seem to have some type of disability that makes you not only stupid but also a jackass.  When an attorney represents an organization, he also has an individual attorney client relationship with the members of that organization.  The law does not look at them as though they were the Borg, assimilated into one unit.   Thus, when one individual member of an organization talks to another individual member, they are two clients, even though their members of the same organization.  You also keep missing the simple fact that for an attorney client privilege to exist, at least one of the parties involved must be an attorney!   ONLY COMMUNICATIONS BETWEEN AN ATTORNEY AND CLIENT.   If a client passes on attorney work product to another client that is NOT between an attorney and client.    Yeah Im not an idiot. I get it. Only communications between attorneys and clients are privileged. Communications between clients are not.    You can't create privilege by ccing an attorney. If there needs to be privileged communication it should be between the attorney and the client.    Nullification only refers to not convicting a guilty man.   http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jury_nullification   I don't understand how an innocent person being found guilty is nullification.    Yeah I think subsequent remedial measures are excluded under evidence rules in most places. And I think the CA rule on apologies is a good one.    Why put victims in scare quotes?     One of my favorites.   Why don't they simply accept fault, make it very obvious what they are doing to change, and create more of a personal/human connection with those harmed?  That can be taken as an admission of liability.  Has that been tried in the past, and did it not work?  Yes, of course.  Your anecdote doesn't change the fact that this was likely a poor legal strategy on the part of the farm.  They were negligent and could have been sued with good cause.  everyone was so taken aback by the open communication and obvious heartfelt apology of the dairy owners, that they felt satisfied and did not feel the need for retribution  Lawsuits are not about retribution, but about making an individual whole again.  If a company screws up and due to that screw up harms others, they should pay for it.  If someone chooses not to make them do so, that's certainly a valid choice, but it is not somehow more righteous or commendable than filing a meritorious lawsuit.   Did he explain why he is not going to do anything about it?      Post.   Adults have to do things they don't want to do all the time. Find a real estate agent to help with the process. Otherwise the taxes owed will only continue to accrue.    I'm not sure what you're asking. The prosecution is an arm of the state, just like the police.        Is a dentist a full doctor? Or a physical therapist? or how about a Doctor of Nursing Practice?  No, but all those professions are based on science.   Sure looks like it to me.       They can sue the police department and the town.    https://i.imgur.com/E0dyhY6.gif       A few hours.  Your father is going to be gone for a few hours and you're concerned about legal liability?  You're babysitting for the afternoon.  Happens millions of time all around the country.  Relax.   Tried them all, nothing beats American.    I had brought up the point that well, what if the lawyer suggests Option C as the course to take that will incur greater fees in the future than Option A  What "fees" are you talking about?   Talk to an attorney asap. There's plenty of time to file a complaint before the statute runs. You need to do this to protect your interests. What lawyer said they wouldn't touch it? All you need to do is file a complaint. Call attorneys until you get one that will work with you.       Wait what? The vast vast majority of people are not abusers.    I downvote /u/boathole whenever I get the chance.  Just for funzies.   *Mother, May I Suckle at the Teat of Danger?*   Yeah, this has Lifetime movie written all over it!   You might get better replies at /r/law or ever /r/askreddit.       The problem with treadmills is that you don't do any work. The machine does the running for you.  Huge overstatement. It's easier than road running but in no way do you not do any work. You still do a ton of work. They are an awesome way to run when you can't get outside.    File an OPRA request.  Those documents should absolutely be public records.   Why are they doing this?   Likely yes. Whoever took the pic owns the copyright.    This is incorrect. He can be cited any time up to the statute of limitations. A prior warning makes no difference.     When you discuss the case with the attorney from the insurance keep in mind that he/she IS NOT YOUR ATTORNEY.   100% incorrect and terrible advice.    Probably looking at a minimum of a 10-20k retainer   In America it is exceedingly rare to get the other side to pay for your legal costs.  Plus she may not have any assets to do so even if she did win.   we cant afford to pay for an attorney ourself  Then you likely can't get one.  The insurance company will provide an attorney for you.  Unless you have significant personal assets then it is unlikely they will settle for more than your insurance value.   If that's the case it may very well be unenforceable.  Call your local bar association and see if they can recommend an employment attorney to look it over for you before you sign it.   It seems to only protect the company that I work for and does nothing for me.  Well, yeah, that's the nature of non-competes.  You're probably looking at 1-2 hours of review by an attorney.  How much an attorney would charge per hour depends on where you are located.   "Traffic Ticket Rhino."  Strike one.   They promise that for $145 dollars I can get no points on my license at least, and there is a possibility that my traffic fee can be reduced.  Strike two.  However, after I requested a quote, they called me from an "unknown" number, they refused to give me a number which I could call after I said I needed time to think about it, and they simply just offered to call me again tomorrow.  Strike three.  Hire an attorney that is professional and does not make unethical promises.  It is possible they may be able to reduce the fine and points, which could save you money in the long term on your insurance.   If the president of the Walt Disney company gave her a copy the answer would be the same.     Say I am legally given ownership to this recording from my mother, am I still bound to the wishes of the creator from over 30 years ago?  Yes.  If your mother gives you her VHS copy of Lady and the Tramp it does not mean you can use it as you see fit.    Does US law recognize copies of a document/recording made elsewhere as being independent of each other once under the jurisdiction of US law?  No  	75
 Diesel  all.    Macha powder. Hard to get where I live,  but when I find it and smell it I'm in heaven.    The one thing this post made me realise is that AC/DC is finally on Spotify. Many songs still under 1000 plays even.    Still bigger than most student housing.    I think my first ever straight razor shave was better than that.   There is quite a few all over the internet. From New Balance sneakers, to Red Wings to mass produced dress shoes.  Sure these shoes are good quality upper middle tier shoes, and the materials used are pretty much top notch, it's not so special. It is another one of those thirteen in a dozen hipster made "artisan" videos by a 3rd year BFA student that knows a guy in a factory.   I wonder how often the app recognised a white person as something else,  possible offensive and didn't get complained about because it was shrugged off as "well, most of this stuff is pretty accurate, can't win em all".    In my teens I worked in a butchers shop. The first rule my boss taught me is that when a knife falls,  you just step back and let it drop.   Judging from her look afterwards that is not the only "knife" that will be played with that evening.    You're lucky it was a sharp knife. Sharp knife cuts heal well. Blunt knife cuts are jagged and scar like a mofo.   Pretty much like any other shoe factory.    Bring a balloon. Lather the balloon. Make him shave the balloon. If it pops,  laugh your ass off because the "barber" is not covered in lather. Then walk out.    I wouldn't have guessed he used a straight razor. More like a lawnmower. Don't go back to this guy.    Hey look everyone,  I found captain professional trigger.    Basically Stephen King  "The Long Walk"  level cardio.    I wish I could be a victim once.  But as an upper middle class suburban young white straight male professional I cannot. Woe is me.   ARE YOU FUCKING SORRY?    Probably not.    Coincidence or freak of technology.  In 2011 I was sitting in a bar in Tokyo and another western man came in. We had a chat. Never exchanged full names, professions, just the regular bar/beer/sports banter.  Two weeks later he is in my "People you may know" section on LinkedIn.  I was thoroughly freaked out. I'm guessing we both logged in on LinkedIn from roughly the same area and the systems recognised it as a non-standard location and decided we may have been at a conference or whatnot.   In the example of Google about? Not really. Like I said, if the software systematically named all blacks Gorilla's, then surely yes. In the example, one with a super unclear picture, nope, just a glitch in the system.   Racist people make non-racist problems a race issue. It's usually the ones that scream "Racism" the loudest that are the most racist.   Ah, that actually makes sense. During my brief sailing days I think we had two noteworthy storms. One of which nearly made me poo my pants. The rest of the crew wasn't bothered at all and teased me for quite a bit of time about it.  It seems that it was an indication of how experienced a sailor was. In your opinion and based on your experience. What would you put the 1 and 2 swallow tattoo threshold at with current ship?   It is, and in this case it especially it. The picture in question is super unclear and to be honest, when I take my glasses off I have a hard time recognizing it.  It's a big thing if every black person was labelled a gorilla. Not these rare cases.   It we have to consider every small thing that might possible offend people nothing would happen.  People need to start growing thicker skin and not be "triggered" by whatever small piece of bullshit they can find.   5000 seems very little for the merchant navy. That's less than an  Atlantic return trip. You sure it's not 50/100K ?  Edit: the 5 sources I checked confirm your figure. I still think it's pretty little. In my early 20s I sailed 6 months on a container vessel (long story), that would give me the  "right" to a couple of swallows even for such a short stint.     When I was 29 my income was higher than my dads when he retired.  I live in a rental and drive a small car. They have a large house paid off, savings, 3 cars and go on holiday 6 times a year.   I live paycheck to paycheck. The baby boom generation fucked us all.   If this ever happens to me I want to keep my leg. In a jar of formaldehyde. Wonder if that would be allowed?   In developed countries the vast majority of the users would be white. This is not racist. This is a fact. So it is logical, however insensitive to ensure that this demographic is catered to.   I have no idea what that means, but I guess it's a good thing. Thank you.   I doubt this is the case. I'm pretty convinced that they did do quality control with multiple races. However all the QA in the world cannot account for all options. I'm sure if you probe long enough you'll get a picture of a fair skinned person being identified as a polar bear.   I too identify as invisible kin. But on weekend I am mayonnaise-kin. I find it incredibly offensive that no camera can identify me as a proud jar of Hellman's Real Mayonnaise. Stop the oppression of us fat and egg based individuals.    I agree, and that fact just confirms that this is far from racist.  People need to grow a thicker skin and get the fuck over race. The more you talk about it, the more important it (as in race) it becomes. We're all human. Some of us are just a bit more dark to deal with warmer and sunnier climates.  On that note. I find the sun extremely racist! It burns my pale complexion much more than my black brothers and sisters. Someone make a petition on change.com to make the sun less racist.   We have the same myth here with Polish people. Hardest damn workers you'll ever see. I had my entire house done by a Polish company. Took 2 weeks at half the cost of a local company. And the quality is amazing.    Technology is not racist. People and institutions can be racist. Technology itself can not. The racist is the person that made the technology work according to certain parameters that society labels as racist. A piece of technology labeling blacks as "monkeys" is not racist by itself. If a programmer said "label blacks as monkeys" then that programmer is racist.   One of my colleagues is colour blind as well and part of MY job is identifying colour difference. If I cannot spot a difference I ask him.  Apparently colour blind people are better at identifying the difference between shades of the same colour. After asking one of the professors about this during a work related seminar he confirmed this.  Now I don't have empirical evidence, and this might be very anecdotal, it works for me.   One often ends up reading about facial recognition going wrong. Asian people on camera,  camera asks "did someone blink?". Black people on camera,  camera asks if there are any faces to recognise. Etc. It's not offensive. It's technology that is not mature enough to do what it must do.    Quart of milk. Half a cup of cocoa powder. Some Stevia. Pinch nose. CHUG.    But Django and Kill Bill are in the same universe. The bride is buried in the grave of Paula Schultz who left Dr Schultz a few years before the events of Django.    Also Pulp Fiction and Django happen in the same universe as the soldier who carried the watch up his butt (Captain Koons) is a descendant of one of the members of the Smitty BacallGang.

Check this out. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxNLTRl36HQ  I quite like the Amazon basic powerbanks.   8 years ago a crazy ex decided I was physically stalking her.   Don't mind the fact that I was 5000 km away and never contact her.   After doctoring "evidence" and presenting it to the police (it later turned out the detective was a family friend) it sort of worked and I had to present myself to the public prosecutor. I had my lawyer write a letter and the case was dropped.   Too bad that shit stays on your record for 30 (or 40, not sure) years here. And every goddamn insurance ever ask you "Have you have something on your criminal record that happened in the past 8 years". If you answer No, you're committing fraud. If you answer Yes you go in the special pile, with higher premiums.  No shit. Want to fuck someone over. Get them indicted in a case. They'll be fucked regardless of guilt.  (The Netherlands by the way).  Some justice porn by the way: She also tried to rob me blind in a civil suit. Which I won. She is still paying me damages and legal fees.

 Some feminists are sexist against males because they aren't good at empathy and fail to appreciate it from the other side. They also often spend a lot of time chatting to other feminists with similar views, which validates their own attitudes. There are blinkered people in every walk of life, unfortunately.   This. The institution of marriage is far older than christianity.   You could legitimately argue that many major magazines basically are for white people (eg womens magazines v rarely feature non-white people on the cover).  Plus, if a magazine specifically identified itself as 'for white people', would enough people actually buy it?   Can you please give some examples? I'm struggling to think of what you mean   Thanks for sharing! That sounds amazing - good luck with it all :)   That's awesome, I've always wanted an airstream. Is it as a primary home, or as a holiday home? Do you think you'll kit it out with loads of high-tech bits and pieces, or are you planning to go more off grid? (Sorry for all the questions!)   Yeah not one I normally read, but I stumbled across this and it looked interesting                      I hope at least $1000 of that is to pay for sewing lessons    But it is pretty itchy         Do you by any chance mean the [Kingdom of Lovely](http://micronations.wikia.com/wiki/Kingdom_of_Lovely)?  It was founded by UK author Danny Wallace.         No, that's so they can find out who's visiting their site - virtually all modern sites use analytics, and they aren't all selling the info to advertisers.  Plus, what exactly do you mean by "your tracking information"? You know individuals can't be identified by analytics programs, right?   Zarrow.co.uk specialises in this kind of work                                  The funniest example of this was one my boyfriend's mum did (she believes in that crap, despite my bf's repeated explanations of cold reading etc) - it was one done over Skype (who knew that was a thing!) and everything the 'psychic' woman said was way off, so she blamed it on the 'bad vibes' of the McDonalds my bf's mum was in.    Ah apologies, I missed that you weren't in the country. Good luck with it all!      I feel the same - it's insanely expensive and I'm really starting to consider moving out, but jobs in my field are thin on the ground outside of the city. I tend to escape to Bristol to see friends whenever it gets too much.   I'd love for there to be some kind of solution to this, but I'm really struggling to think of anything.      If you can transform it into a real voice for the area it could be successful - my suggestion would be to get it going with regular posts and maybe try posting flyers around Ealing promoting it? Maybe try and launch discussions about any local issues and add pictures of any new features in the area for people to discuss. I'm close but not in your borough, but I will post anything I find that's relevant.    Thanks for sharing - I had no idea this had been preserved   I think that might be a bit of a pandora's box issue - Midlanders would probably decry not being given their own specific government and the old Cornwall independence campaign would refire. The UK has a huge number of regional identities - we could easily end up with as many states as the US if we really tried.   Very true - eureka-alert is just a science press release portal, so it's only as accurate as each university's pr writers    What about the rest of England?

I just feel bad for the poor fools who get taken in and hand over their money for stuff like this                              Yes, but those poorer are largely not paying UK prices   I didn't think it happened until I started working in an office in a touristy area of London. Some people seem to think the world is there to serve them.   Mind you, it only ever happened with British tourists - everyone else has been nothing but polite and appreciative.

Would you mind telling us about it? I haven't heard that one.                                          A key part of that profit comes from not paying over and above for staff   This is a very common practice in large news organisations   Love that picture of him looking out of the window - he looks like he's surveying his kingdom!

We mainly studied the tudors and the industrial revolution. Quite honestly I suspect it is something that very few British people know much about.  That was more than a decade ago though - does anyone else have a more recent experience?    Sam Vimes likes cheap boots - they allow him to identify where he is in the city just by feeling the street through the thin soles   Got it for this reason. Can confirm it's worth it.

 The young woman's car is hit on the bridge in an accident that involves tractor trailers. Horrifying enough. But the force of the crash is enough to send her car either though or over whatever bridge railing is there to keep vehicles on the bridge. Her vehicle plunges 40 feet into the bay -- three to four stories of free fall. She experiences hitting the bay in an explosion of water. Injured and shocked, she is in a vehicle that's sinking and starting to drift. Her options for saving herself are narrowing quickly. Fighting current and probably disorientation, she escapes the vehicle and swims to a bridge pylon. Imagine. Just imagine.   This is one tough woman.      Have they said that?    Since 2008, I'm just not sure, but this story from 2005 is part of the lore: http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all address=104x4154435   This is a Cinderella privilege with an expiration date. People should be allowed to drink water on Metro 365 days a year. There's no sound reason for prohibiting people from drinking water. I can understand a ban on French Fries, but water? It's time to decriminalize water.    @beer_OMG_beer  is absolutely correct. Comparing a Walmart worker to a government worker is a major fail. Walmart workers are often restricted to part-time hours without benefits and have a work schedule that constantly changes (if they make themselves available for anytime work, their hours may improve but ability to attend college or meet family needs declines).          This subreddit is now in danger of becoming SquirrelBoy    How was this locked? Was it a U Lock? What brand? And do you know what it's rating is? If a U Lock, do you still have it and was one of the locks that came with insurance?   This list is totally bogus. It's the click-candy industry, in this case Travel   Leisure, with an assist from the Washington Post and Reddit, at its finest.    the $3000 a month for daycare is a nightmare.    "Spinosaurus" -- love it. Sounds like a name invented by a PR agency.  "Spin-o-saurus." They might has well have named it T-Bowl. "Giganotosaurus" is just lame.   You can't undo 65 million years of effective marketing on the mighty Reddit.   T-Rex rules.      The Portrait Gallery across from the Verizon Center has a spacious courtyard with lots of seating, refreshments, and has 15+MBS of free public Internet.       CVS is almost a monopoly in the District. I'm tired of them. There's nothing that CVS can do to make a CVS interesting.    There is http://loavesandfishesdc.org/  in Columbia Heights. They run a kitchen on Saturdays. I used to do volunteer work there. They often had  volunteers from groups. Really nice people.    Other than ads for t-shirts, how does duckduckgo make money?    Baby Boomers will never retire.    There's a web site, bedbugger.com that's a great resource for questions like this.     Are you renting in a condo complex or apt? Is it a separate facility or just a bike rack? Does the space used for bikes have the potential to generate revenue in other ways?  A condo association may have the option of taking empty space and renting it out as storage. Instead, they make it available to bikers. I could see the argument on the condo board: Why should people who don't bike subsidize the loss of income the empty space might generate as storage space?  But then, there has to be enough bikers interested space to cover the cost. If there weren't, you probably wouldn't have the rental space option. Consider yourself lucky. Otherwise, you're stuck like me with the bike in the apt.    I bought in DC in early 2008 when the market was softening and the worst was still to come. I did not have a big down payment and it was risky from that point of view. Not the best decision, but what was done was done. After I bought it, the price of my unit fell about 5%-10 to perhaps as much as 20% from what I paid. It has since recovered. With a new assessment, I recently re-financed and lowered my mortgage cost by nearly a third. Previous rate was 6.5%. Now at about 3.5%. Lost PMI, too.   My monthly mortgage, plus taxes, including condo fee (non-elevator building so its on the low side), is well below market rents.   Rents are ridiculous now. But the mortgage costs remain low, even at 4%.   So what should you be worried about the most? That mortgage rates will rise to 6-9% or that housing prices won't fall?   My view: If you truly planning on staying in DC for a period of years and are set on that, then I would try to buy when the interest rates are low. If prices fall now, I suspect it will due to rising interest rates. One way or another, you'll be paying more.   More directly to your question: I don't think we will see a repeat of 2008-09. That was a historic crash. I do believe the market can soften if interest rates rise, and I think with the rates now checking in at about 4% demand for housing may rise some as some people try to lock in better rates before they go much higher.    I don't blame them. This risk is readers, who may already be up to their necks in monthly subscription charges for other content, NYT, Netflix, etc.,  Hulu, Rhapsody, whatever, may resist. Subscription costs are really becoming a burden, but what choice does WaPo have?    I dumped cable long ago to save money (use DSL) and watch TV via antenna (which is actually pretty good in DC proper) and Internet content. That has helped to offset some the subscription charges.     Good suggestion - thanks    Good feedback everyone - Thanks    Don't see many people using them. But they are appealing.    I don't own a car, hence no insurance. I've wondered about the credit card provisions and whether they really do protect you.   I have a 20-year old scratched-up, tear-in-the-seat, bike that's beat-up ugly. But it rides and I keep the components in good shape. When parking on the street, I use two U-locks to lock in both tires and thread a cable cord through the seat.  Not that anyone would steal it, I imagine. I've been thinking about buying a new bike. But wonder: Even with two U-locks, what are the odds that it will get stolen or damaged in D.C.? Is it even worth owning a good bike if you lock it from time to time on the street? (I'm not talking overnight, but about running errands, stopping to eat, etc.) I'm considering something like a Tern folding bike. (Something easy to take on travel and store)   What do you do for car insurance? I can get a good car rental rate, but end up adding $$ in coverage that can easily double the rental charge. Have a personal umbrella.    I don't have a car and absolutely do not miss owning one. DC is an easy city to bike and is getting better. The bus system is good once you figure it out and in many cases faster than dealing with Metro.   But owning a bike isn't easy. Good bikes are at risk of getting stolen. For around town, and have plans to lock your bike on a street for some hours, recommend a beater, nothing too attractive, and lock both wheels.   Personally, I think folding bikes are a great option for commuting if you can stash them inside.    The lights dimmed, briefly, a couple of times last night in my adams morgan apt.    It's more than just spending money. The chips may be U.S. but the interconnects are Chinese tech. The front end system that runs this new system is using a Chinese-made chip, 16 core SPARC. China is planning to build a system with its own chips. It also has its own software   China is learning and quickly. This isn't just about buying a system, it's about learning to build a very fast system that is also energy efficient and reliable.    Facial recognition is the killer app. I could really benefit from something that could remind just who is at the meeting ...   This piece by Ross Douthat was short on history. Ten-15 years ago you could buy condos with credits cards, and houses next to Metro at affordable prices. But people began to realize, even before the big defense build-up post 9/11, that DC was way undervalued compared to NY and Boston, and an attractive place to live. Yes, there's a lot of building going on now but much of it is catch-up. DC is becoming the city it should have always been considering the quality of life.    No, do what I did and suggest it's about money and getting rid of cars. that will get you down voted to oblivion.    The only thing the park snakes sequester are rats. They are virtuous creatures compared to what goes on in the rest of DC.    This is about money and the 'war on cars,' nothing more.    I don't know how many Vietnam vets still ride in Rolling Thunder. I imagine a good number remain. I have enormous respect for them. Vietnam was a horrible mistake. More than 58,000 U.S. military personnel lost their lives in that war, and many of the survivors weren't treated well upon return. There was no "thank you for your service" stuff that you hear today for the vets. So I don't mind at all Rolling Thunder. Let them turn up their engines and roar into the city, and if that bothers you, you can shove it.    I rented a place in Foggy Bottom in 1998 and you could buy a townhouse nearby  anywhere from $160 to $250. I remember seeing one sign in a condo that was almost directly across from the Metro on 24th that said "lease to own." I was actually surprised.  I had just come form the New England, a depressed city up north, and housing there was selling for the same price without access to a Metro, world-class museums, and a great jobs market. DC was incredibly under priced.    dcblogs.com/live has a live feed   A month of free electricity.   Chinatown Express 746 6th Street NW makes homemade noodles, dumplings. The noodle soup is just incredible. I go there two to three times a month.    If they are a certain age, then getting them close to a Metro stop is best. I'd recommend a downtown hotel, such as JW Marriott, Hyatt or something like that. Sometimes you can get good rates. The Metro escalators aren't that long, the areas are safe and well patrolled, and there's plenty nearby. Anything near the Portrait Gallery is super.    Great reporting by WAMU.   I guess my broader point is this: I wish the Washington Times would actually do some reporting on this issue and discover whether standard liability policies provide some protection. That may satisfy this requirement. It would be nice if they did a little work in finding out just where this idea of $250K gun-specific liability policy comes from. Did it arrive out of thin air? If that's the case, then it seems really hard for the council to impose a requirement that can't be satisfied.    I worry for Tumblr. Making an intelligent acquisition is not the same thing as doing something intelligent with it.    I love how the Washington Times puts this as "prohibitively expensive" and then launches into a rant. It makes no effort to look into the issue. Wouldn't personal umbrella policies protect from the jerks who accidentally blow holes through their condo walls? If you have auto insurance, it's already a really good idea to spend an extra $200-$300 a year on an $1 million umbrella policy, considering the cost of medical care.     	45
 The first one with the baby was great. The Trump one made me laugh too. They were all good.   Looks like a staging area for transportation. Boat or truck.   How could the President have missed the last 500 years of history? The point is, Christians had a reformation and no longer are violent. His statement is dumbfounding.    People who wear jeans and sandals. They're trying too hard for the laid back image. Bunch'a d!ckheads if you ask me.   Isn't that the point at being a punk band? Your supposed to be angry. I say good job Governor for tweaking them back into their "sub-culture-ish" attitude of being ticked-off at the man...... about something, or whatever.   Do they own 50% of the cars. Eat 50% of the food? Utilize 50% of the medicine? Do they buy and hoard any of these? If these 80 people died tomorrow and their money erased it would have zero impact on the remaining 6 billion of us in the world. I could care less how many zeros are on there Merrill Lynch bank statements.  	6
    Hello there! http://imgur.com/2U1pbry                                                   :)         Just searched for some more corgi puppies. They are probably the most adorable and the cutest breed I have come across in my life.                                 	32
 Or try these: http://www.fundacionendesa.org/sites/default/files/imagenes/530_463.JPG http://www.arteguias.com/imagenes5/catedralflorencia.jpg   Don't know why. It's ok for me. Anyway, if you are really interested, google "catedral murcia interior". It's just a cathedral, whatever.   I like the reaction of the second guy   And you haven't even choose the most annoying Death Grips song.   Yeah, I think you are right. I still have some problems with english sometimes.   I once listened to Guillotine on my ipod while I was visiting the cathedral at my town. It's quite monumental and peaceful and has a lot of history behind it. The contrast between the violence and profanity of DG and the sanctity and peace of the church was very interesting.  The cathedral looks like this in the inside: http://harte.hol.es/wp/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/INTERIOR-DE-LA-CATEDRAL-DE-LE%C3%93N.jpg   Not always. There was a time when you could find really funny and creative sites there. Some people put great effort on their creations. People left a lot of comments and interacted. There was imagination. I could spend hours and hours there. Yesterday I went there and downvoted almost everything. It's a shame.   I wonder the same thing.   Yeah, but now is a shit hole. The sites aren't funny at all, just random stuff put together. No interesting ideas. No creativity. I suspect now is populated only by teenagers.  It's a shame. Ytmnd used to be an important part of one phase of my life.   http://ibmwmfitus.ytmnd.com/  Are you ok with Ytmnd? Or are you gonna give me the "go back to ytmnd" like in 4chan?  Also, the sound is not perfectly looped. I'm sorry.     I think the streetlight picture is something they have in their archive since a long time ago and have used it several times. They just recylced it for the Powers that B cover.   I don't like it. It's very boring compared to other DG covers, wich have a background story. And at least TMS is an illustration. There is nothing special about this one. I'd like to have something more shocking, beautiful or complex in my record collection. It's  just a photoshopped streetlight. Anyway, at this moment is quite iconic yet.   Looks good. It makes itself a good summary of their carrer.   I think Stefan just writes the lyrics in a stream of thought style, dictated by his subconscious, and sometimes surreal and funny things come to the surface.   And what is the softest Stefan has whispered?   I heard "mommy" the first time too.   Don't forget classics like:  "Teaching bitches how to swim"  "The table's flipped, now we got all the coconuts, bitch!"   I thought he meant DG making the album and then having to wait 9 months for the fans to listen to it.   I'm sure Death Grips get some inspiration in some way in Aleisteir Crowley and Magick.    I don't get it   Why we shouldn't? Isn't it his artistic nickname? Maybe I'm missing something.   I think I feel your interpretation. In this life, you have a lot of sources and people around you telling you what to do, what are the rules, how you are... So many information in contradiction that finally you only have your own conclusions. You have to make a decision, to choose a theory, a path and a plan.   Dude, my city is full of these things. Do you want pictures? I can give you hundreds of them.   I'm not partially, but totally joking. How could Steffan think he is ugly? He is obviously gorgeous. I'd fuck him if I was a girl.   You know. Being so ugly you break mirrors just reflecting your face on them.  Just think about it.   Damn. Things go fast.   Yeah. I found it. It's now in my record wishlist.  https://www.pinterest.com/oruga/records-wishlist/   Thanks   Where can i get this?   Well, I don't like to give my money to this pirates instead to the original artists but I admit this is something I'd like to have in my collection. Price? Link?   I listened and enjoyed this album just as I had planned: playing it in my iPod, walking on the streets at night.   Bootlegs? Isn't the official lp available?   It has become one of my favorites too. And in part is thanks to this sub and the interpretations of the lyrics I read here. I think couldn't have seen the references to suicide and depression in the lyrics by my self. You all made me experience this song in a special way.   I think this sub is gonna be still active. Probably DG are gonna tour and make new stuff in the future, and we will talk about it. Maybe we won't be as active as the period between Notm and Jenny Death, but it will be ok. It will be fun.   Yeah, share it with us. Sounds cool.   That describes Death Grips in general   What's the name of this noise artist again?   /I get paid by the universe  Favorite line, no doubt.   https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/8b/a2/66/8ba26655c505c73c7f6be5d5ceefa4fc.jpg   Yeah, I've seen that video. He makes some funny expressions but nothing interesting.   Books, cute girls, internet, music, practicing with my band, poetry, books, BDSM, illustration, mechas, collecting records, role playing, Counter Strike.   Do you think the magician was high while performing the tricks? I thinks DG have experimented with drugs in some of their videos, like Pillbox Hat, where I'm sure Stefan took some hallucinogen that made him experiment through various emotional states.  Maybe this is something that they found cool. "Hey, get high and try to perform your tricks. We will record you for our next video". Maybe that's the reason why some of the tricks are so poorly performed.   Great thread   Does that guy make something interesting besides reaction videos? I'm not interested in reaction videos at all.   Don't worry. I suppose they feel ok about the memes and shit. An artist must be ready for all kind of reactions between his public, and humour is not the worst of them.  If they have ever read about somebody listening to their music and feeling like destroying stuff, they should feel satisfied.   I've just masturbated and watching this now is perfect for post-orgasm. Very relaxing.   The second one look like some Adventure Time character lol   How much has magick influenced your work as a band?   OK. Sounds like a coherent answer for me, in a way.   Are you quoting some of their lyrics or giving me an answer? I'm not sure.   Sometimes I fantasize about them giving all the answers and explanations in "Death Grips: the documentary". What was their ideology. How they did things. What does their music mean. What was the concept behind their "conceptual art".   I'm not going to listen to this snippets. I'm gonna save the hype for the release. I wanna feel again like when NLDW was dropped, having a whole unknown album ahead for me to listen.   This guys love to throw themselves into things. Bushes, trash bags, washing machines...   Are you me?   I hope they sample this and get it somewhere in Jenny Death   Is the campaign "The masks of Nyarlathotep"?   I support this idea   This was my ringtone for a while too. Now that I listen to it again I feel that typical anxiety phonecalls always give me.   Perfectly looped, i must say   I got the  nasty in my bus   Yeah, i'v seen footage. Since they made that music video I can only relate it to pool parties.   I play with my friends every friday night at 18:00 GMT +2 /CET   It's like they were trying to say there were no space for love for them then, just for music and pure energy and rage.   http://www.gigposters.com/poster/123621_Black_Flag.html  Is a flyer by Raymond Pettibon, for a Black Flag show.   Youtube can do some stupid things about copyright sometimes. I know about a guy that uploaded a video singing a song of his own authorship and was censored. Twice.   There was a thread about this before.  http://www.reddit.com/r/deathgrips/comments/1wrq1y/sample_from_culture_shock/  There is a broken link to the site Lightworkers, something about Ashtar Sheran. I looked for it in YouTube and, man, it just blew my mind. There is wacko stuff there.   The Money Store. I am an illustrator and love illustrations.   Because you like dicks?   Jennys?

 It would take a very very large surface area to significantly impact the precipitation in the region, and I am unaware of any projects that have created such rainfall after filling a dry basin.  It is well understood that the benefits of pumping large volumes to extremely dry regions are immense. Wildlife returns/appears, tourism can thrive, fishing may become economical, and water becomes available for agriculture. The concern however is the rise in salinity which can 'poison' existing water tables containing freshwater.  There is a massive project underway to pump water into the diminishing Red Sea, and you may find it interesting: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea%E2%80%93Dead_Sea_Canal   If it's just used for storing media and it isn't being shared out to hundreds of simultaneous users then cheap consumer NAS drives should be sufficient. You won't get much benefit with hybrid drives, as your content is media and hybrids mostly assist with increasing speeds for files that have a typical load pattern (like those used by the OS).  Vibration and heat shouldn't be a problem, especially if you have a CoolerMaster with that many bays. They designed it for that, and your drives won't be running extremely hot anyway.   One of those gauges is in incredibly good condition for being in salt water for ~70 years. That 4 is totally readable.  Nearly a century later and the seal still hasn't broken? That's impressive!   Other humans who are trying to keep their existence a secret, who live in the "real world" and spread disinformation to make us believe we are the only ones here. We're the equivalent of the uncontacted tribes of the Amazon, and the UFOs appear when the outsiders must come into our section of the planet and change something.   That's the point. If they are more productive, then they should get rid of me. But if I am more as productive or more productive than others (as I believe I am) then I should be able to stay productive, instead of just being forced to be onsite 100% of the time because some other employees are not productive remotely.  If anything this is a great opportunity for companies to find out how to make their remote employee **more** productive.    This is so backwards. As we create better technology to close the gaps caused by telecommuting there should be an increase in remote workers rather than a push to get rid of them.  It's happening all over. I believe it was Yahoo that recently recalled all its remote workers, and I'm also seeing it in other large tech companies with net initiatives to have everyone on site.  Currently I have a job that allows me to work remotely a couple of weeks each month, and I'm much happier because of it. I would also say I tend to be more productive when i am remote. I understand some workers may not be as productive remote versus/onsite, but if that's the case these companies should just eliminate those specific workers, rather than changing overall policy and hurting those to whom it is deeply beneficial.   It's pure science. Others will leverage this information to build further scientific findings which will eventually lead to much more broad understanding and applicable developments.  We NEED this kind of information.   It seems like a primary aspect of this study/trial was eliminating stress. Stress by itself can cause significant cognitive/memory issues. Without very specific and highly significant changes in cognitive measurements, I'm inclined to believe that this probably doesn't alter the Alzheimer's pathology itself, but instead removes the additional mental hit caused by severe stress.   One thing I notice with most of these videos is at least some of the cops seem compassionate/dismayed after these incidents. It gives me hope.  Towards the end of that video you can see one of the cops give the "wtf?!?" gesture towards the officers who sprayed the protesters. They should be the ones getting the promotions, not the officers who spray people in the face when they aren't a physical threat.   The changing stances of those around him seem to indicate dismay. Even his own comrades are probably asking 'why?'.  More images like this will only result in more protesters, and more anger. Hopefully it makes its way around China some before getting completely blocked. Even if they don't support the protesters (and why would they?) at least the Chinese citizens can display their own anger at these police tactics in a modern world.   The ants are getting restless.   It doesn't directly. The isolation does, and it's necessary for prolonged isolation.   I'm not some backyard bunker fanatic, but I do believe if you have an opportunity to prepare for certain emergencies, it would be unwise to not do so. I'd rather have a holdout/isolation destination that goes unused, than be stuck without one and wishing I had one during an improbable but possible widespread emergency.   At the simplest and incremental backup system will take up the space of the base file, plus the size of each of the incremental changes, along with a small overhead for indexing/tracking the changes. Typically the incremental backup software will store previous incremental changes with compression, to further reduce space (but increase restoration time).   With files that change infrequently or only have minor changes incremental backups will be a very wise use of space. I would definitely advise against it for files that change extensively and often however, because the amount of space you require will skyrocket. Additionally incremental backups will not be very efficient storage-wise if you are using them regularly against compressed media files that change. For example, you may be better off with full backups if you are altering and re-encoding mp4s, as most of the file content will change and the added incremental backup overhead will not be worth the benefits.   Classified documents, war plans, wiretapped conversations, and...   Oh. I mean... it's mostly films in .mp4 containers, coming in at about ~2GB per film on average. The second biggest thing is full backups from previous desktops, and also some current backups for important files.   I think for most people the answer will be media, media, media.    I'm almost 29 and my optimism continues to go down with age. I have an excellent job that most people would only dream of having financially... But my Facebook feeds are full of photos of my friends' kids and their first days in grade school... Meanwhile here I am, just trying to keep from losing things like my job, my health, etc etc. Nothing is being added, only slowly taken away.  Yay! Depressing Monday!   I wonder if the train engineer slightly shit his pants seeing a man in the distance put something in the tracks before running away.   I have. With something like cotton it's easy to get a light, especially when motivated. Not dying would be very motivating.   Damn. If I were fighting back then and it was such close combat I'd equip myself with flint/tinder and some oil. When the armored foe got close enough just throw the oil on him, light the torch and roast the son of a bitch. I wouldn't want to get stabbed in the eye!   I'm afraid as long as Islam exists the world will be raging war against atrocities carried out in its name.   Good for them and good on the doctors for allowing them to keep their dignity instead of eventually wasting away in nursing homes while cruelly being kept alive only to endure suffering.     Are there fishermen dependent on these areas for their livelihoods? Are they going to get any support from the government?  Corporations can get the fuck out. But I feel for private fishermen should any lose their ability to earn a living.    Traffic data is largely generated by measurements of Android users' GPS coordinates while they are determined to be travelling on the roads. It's automatic and it's transparent.  It'd be really difficult to get roadkill data reliably and accurately, as it'd pretty much certainly be based upon user reports.     Cool, and my GPA is the same.    Fly to Africa. Get Ebola. Fly back to the US. Buy a spandex suit. Draw a snazzy design on it. Go to the White House and jump the fence while screaming you are the one and only "Ebola man!".   I see other parking spots available.    Countering an ass move with another ass move doesn't nullify the ass moves. Now you just have two ass moves.   Are you kidding me? Obvious troll. That part of the world has been on a decline since before the USA even existed.  Having fun under the bridge?   ISIS is like new viral outbreak, you can either stamp it out when it first takes hold, or you can wait until it becomes a worldwide disaster.  Ebola really isn't currently OUR (the US's) problem right now either, but would you prefer to leave that to the locals too?   Is the building leased? It's probably connected to higher voltage lines in case the company leasing the building wants to run equipment.   OS   Browser accessibility features allow for this, assuming the website has proper markup/notation describing objects. The users will be 'read' the text associated with checkboxes/text boxes/etc and can iterate through them. On a website like Reddit, and most websites, it would be a real challenge due to the quantity of content pieces... but it is doable.    Seeing that on any fridge would weird me out a bit. The outside of a single man's refrigerator door should be a barren landscape of masculinity.    I think your wife probably wonders why there is a command center in your house =P   It took me a while to establish a connection from my lunar outpost on the dark side of the moon, but thanks for sharing this terrific article!

I love it.    And his wife sounds like she's extremely aware of the extreme retirement.   All this has to do is cross over into a war zone like Syria or certain parts of Africa, and then we're all in trouble.   As stupid as it may sound... Aren't these pranksters technically terrorists? They are using terror to advance their own cause (YouTube audience).   Just curious. How do you know you have the same thing? Were you tested?   Originally I thought Snowden had the right intentions. Now I think he's just out to stay relevant and smear the US anyway he can.   The initial documents he released after fleeing the US were about programs that were targeting US citizens unfairly and unjustly. But as time has gone on the documents are getting to the point where they are only hurting US citizen interests. Even ISIS is using his documents to help evade detection, because he released documents that had information about monitoring protocols in theaters of war... He should have stopped while he was ahead a long time ago.    Some people treat Reddit like it's a nation and take everything so seriously it's facepalm worthy. **It's just a fucking website where people go to waste time!**   Your Dad is a pretty cool guy Sam. He looked so cool I decided to take my time machine back to greet him Sam.   Side note: Paint sure is sticky!   Oh you!   "Ferguson was enough for me! I'm tired of all these white people!"  White house under attack in 3... 2.... 1   European politicians need to take a stand against this otherwise it's going to continue to spiral out of control. Extremist Muslims living in Europe and Australia are already publicly calling for beheading 'infidels', yet these countries don't crack down on such Muslims... I suspect it's because the politicians are scared that they will become targets of violent Muslims. But if they don't act soon, then every non-Muslim will be a target.   Are you fucking kidding me? Your post/comment history includes much anti-Jewish content and you're calling the OP out for supposedly being anti-Muslim because he posted an article pertaining to a logical action?   You're part of the core of the Muslim problem dude.    Christian militias going around attacking Muslims in the Central African Republic isn't right, but I'm not sure that's a fair comparison. Those militias were established after many constant and brutal attacks from Muslims on Christian villages. The villagers finally had enough and realized there was no safe escape, so they began to form militias to attack the Muslim attackers. In the process those militias began driving out all Muslims to avoid future attacks. The point being they are not doing it because they believe their religion says they should... They are doing it because they are/were under attack by Muslims who were trying to violently push their religion.     The student was Barry Kidston and 18 months later he died of a cocaine overdose. He really wanted that high.   How many people are able to comfortably fit and play from the truck?   That's incredible. It's like an apocalyptic death machine coming to destroy everything.       I think it's very common knowledge that Russia invaded and attacked Poland. But I do not think it is common knowledge that when doing so they claimed to be protecting Ukrainians. That part was not taught to me in school, so it's a TIL.   I think it's very common knowledge that Russia invaded and attacked Poland.

Maybe he suspected he was dosed with something (who the hell wouldn't if they suddenly had a weird experience while working with the CIA?), and saw it as a good time to quit the business.   For example what are some common products/services that should be avoided?    Regardless of any potential psychiatric issues this guy had poor judgement... You're a young teacher, and you choose to write about a school shooting? That's going to make for some interesting parent teacher conferences at the very least!   I dig ponds, dig ditches, and clear rock manually on a farm with a shovel to get my muscle building in. Everyone thinks it's silly. But I find it much more silly that they go to a gym for several hours each week, and leave without accomplishing any tangible work.   Easily renewable at the moment. But people don't seem to realize how big of a problem logging will be for us in the relatively near term future. 'Typical' logging land not receiving new sediment from river sources has been shown to be able to last ~1000 years with heavy logging before nutrients are depleted. 1000 years is a long time, but in areas in China much land has been depleted of key minerals/nutrients and can no longer sustain logging... Eventually that'll start occurring around the world, and we'll be forced to fertilize logging zones. Something that won't be very easy.   Saudis' rule by fear. Public whippings are very common, as are other physical forms of punishment that don't result in death. If a group in Saudi Arabia declared part of the country as a democratic breakaway, I have little doubt the Saudis would be extremely ruthless in their efforts to suppress it.   I'm not a realtor, but as someone who has looked at many mid-range homes ($400-600k in my area) and put inspections/offers on a few... If they have JUST put in carpeting, ask the previous owners why they put it in. Also walk around and feel for uneven spots. I've been to two places with brand new carpeting, and with both of them it was a sneaky way of hiding uneven spots in the floor.  And it's not really a question, but more of a tip. Watch for trees that are too close to the house. For one they can damage the foundation (your inspector will let you know if any damage has already occurred) and secondly they can make it an absolute bitch to clean your roof + gutters.  Plus a no brainer: Ask how old the roof is, and how long it is rated for.   Saudi Arabia is essentially what Islamic State terrorists are creating elsewhere in the Middle-east. The main difference is that Saudi Arabia has been long established and people are already beaten into submission, while people are still fighting back against the Islamic State.   Absolutely. This should be one of the Reddit rules. Not posting pictures of people not already in the public eye for the sole purpose of ridicule.   Imagine how radically geopolitics would change if our US President proposed a unity with Iran and Syria against barbaric terrorist groups, and also acknowledged ideological differences and mistakes in the past. He'd pretty much become an infinitely better president over night.         Some were throwing bottles (including glass bottles) at police.   It seems like it's a few minutes behind. It's a broadcast TV station so I'm guessing it may be a delay to allow them to quickly stop broadcast if something needs to be censored (like extreme profanity tirades, etc).   There is another slightly delayed stream at http://new.livestream.com/ktvi/live . The police are demanding that members of the media leave the area of protest... Most reporters have been forced out, but a few remain.   But they just announced there will be a grand jury? This Viper station seems to be the only one reporting this. I'm very skeptical.      It's very different than MS in both symptoms, severity of symptoms, and progression rate as well as pathology. MS is thought to be caused by myelin sheath degradation/destruction, whereas ALS is caused by motor neuron death.   To put it into computer-like perspective based on current pathology suspects: MS is like having a network cable between two computers that is damaged/being damaged, so sometimes messages between the two behave incorrectly... If you repair the cable you can alleviate the symptoms (in MS your body will try to repair myelin as well), as the source and recipients are just fine. ALS is like the network card going bad... eventually messages will not be able to be sent or received, and the progression to failure is usually much faster.   So does this mean that those with Parkinson's Disease will always feel tired and sleep a lot more?    Being a neurosurgeon must be very stressful... Being a neurosurgeon under the public eye must make it even more stressful. What do you find yourself doing to relax and destress?   Dysautonomia is mostly just the catch-all syndrome, and I have it too =(. I'm curious if you're one of the lucky ones to know the underlying cause?     It's truly incredible how common rare diseases really are across the population. I have a neurological/autoimmune illness and while the specialists know what antibodies I have, and what the symptoms are, very little is actually understood about the illness... to the point where it doesn't even have a name.   Prior to the antibody find I was told I may have the following ALS (first), Stiff Person Syndrome (two months later), Neuromytonia (three months later), Parkinsons or Multi System Atrophy (six months later). Then when they found the antibody they told me it was none of these previous suspects. The only real treatments currently known are suppression of the immune system or plasma exchange (both treatments I have been lucky enough to avoid)... And those are basically some of the most generic treatments out there. All of this both scares me and excites me when it comes to our understanding of neurological illnesses... It scares me because often diagnoses are often just educated guesses and change frequently with the symptoms, and because the underlying pathology of many of these illnesses is unknown. But it greatly excites me also, because I can see we are in the infancy of understanding, and that means incredible advances lay before us!   Stephen Hawking's case is extremely rare, and there are theories that the underlying pathology may be quite different from most ALS cases. Unfortunately ALS typically robs the sufferers of life within a very short period of time... Rarely is survival greater than a few years. It's a very very scary disease.   Luckily there are some companies working on some promising treatments (check out Brainstorm's clinical trials). Currently there is only one treatment available, and it only extends function for weeks or a few months. Breakthroughs can't come soon enough.   They weren't burning down stores, they were burning down college campus buildings. They even attacked the firefighters responding... They weren't really that peaceful.    The violent 'protesters' have been causing trouble for over a week. They seem hellbent on getting some violent clashes to take place, probably because they foolishly find it to be adventurous and fun. If they haven't stopped yet, they probably won't stop for the National Guard. It's going to be very interesting, because in many previous historical instances where the National Guard is called in to stop riots, they end up shooting and killing multiple rioters... and that was before social media. Now with Twitter, Facebook, and all the other social media so easily accessible, I could foresee this turning into long term 'insurgency' of sorts, with race being the underlying factor in who is being attacked and who is attacking.   When the police first fired rubber bullets and tear gas at the peaceful protesters I was on the side of the protesters. Now that they've started looting, becoming violent, and not contributing to peace... I hope the National Guard crushes those that come out at night to stir trouble.   This is a stupid "solution" and just a populist idea. Weapons are not the core of the problem here, the problem is the behavior and heavy handed tactics of some police departments...  If you take away some of their military grade weapons, those individuals that see them selves as macho military types will not suddenly become respectful of citizen rights.     That's absolutely what they mean. Not all black people though, just the true gangsters and wannabe gangsters. I think a lot of people hate those types, but it's very politically incorrect to say you hate 'thugs' so they keep it inside.   Except this is divided along racial lines instead of political ones, so it's unlikely to spread too far. However if it does spread it'll probably get ugly, because a lot of people are looking forward to a race war. Several people I know have said they hope it spreads so they can begin gunning down thugs in their neighborhoods. They are mostly joking... but I think part of them truly believe that.   What a total clusterfuck. The black rioters are burning down the town, looting, and shooting at police helicopters... and the police will be hesitant with a strong response, because that's what the protests are all about.   Blankets.  Ask your friends and family to bring you extra blankets when you're in prison. It's going to be cold :)   Nothing sells newspapers like a good ol fashioned race war!    It makes it seem so "real" (not in the holocaust denial sense, but in a compassion sense). Whenever I read about World War II and the atrocities committed it seems so distant, as if I were reading about Genghis Khan.   Recently I've started to realize just how brutal and barbaric the Nazi's were... I mean I knew they were brutal, and did terrible terrible things, but again it felt so distant. But now I see videos from Iraq of civilians being tortured and killed in mass by the 'Islamic State'... The Islamic State members say they are determined to wipe out entire races/religions and are clearly moving forth in that plan. I can imagine how terrifying it must be to be one of those targeted civilians in Iraq... and then it begins to dawn on me just how terrifying it would have been in Nazi Germany, because unlike Iraq, in Germany it was an entire nation wanting to kill you.   	87

 Reid is a Mormon    He has a gay sister too! I'm with you how the fuck can he look them in the eye?    I was thinking Xerox the entire time, like come on lawyer you don't know that    The US equivlants   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zWB4dLYChM  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFQ6YoDAoeY  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3rprwtTJvw  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEWky9PEroU  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y70V5HGhpHs  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYVuUFPFOc0  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi_JwXTXLA0     You would miss Fox Sports 1   2, Pac 12 network, Big Ten network, CBS Sports Network. You would also miss any regional sports network in your area, going by your Umass flair you would miss NESN and CSN New England. Out of all of these the only networks listed here with "good" games would be FS1 and the Pac12 and B1G networks (which you already said you don't get). The RSN and CBSSN have some games but I think you can afford to not have them as it's usually lower tier games    let's be real if fox news was around at the time they would be defending the racists as trying to stop "traditional America" from being destroyed by the evil federal government and "activist judges"    the title implies that the merger got federal approval, and most people  on this site don't read the article just the title    Click bait:  this is the state of California approving the merger, not the FCC, Justice Department, or the Federal Trade Commission    this is not over by a long shot, once again Alabama will have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the modern world   this is not over by a long shot, once again Alabama will have to be dragged kicking and screaming into the modern world    emptying the dishwasher   same   We're in D3 now as part of the [Southern Athletic Association](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Athletic_Association) so we wouldn't play them, besides I don't think we have any real history with Rienhardt (funny enough my brother goes there). I think our new rival might be Oglethorpe   Well our main rival has always been Shorter University across town, but sense they moved up to D2 I don't know if that will continue    No I'm good at it. I FUCKING HATE Florida and Virginia Tech.    I could never hate you nerds    I just had the though that "hey /r/cfb has flairs for everything, why wouldn't they have one for Berry" and there is was. (I'll still root for Tech on gameday so don't worry)    you don't have to hate me anymore, I changed my flair    We have the largest campus in the world at [27,000 acres](http://berry.edu/)   But its not even a gay rights organization, it's just a name of a gay news/blog site.     how is a name of a website "extreme"    what is so "really" about it    his co-star called him a sodomite on twitter once he found out  [source] (http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/02/minnesota-native-who-stars-in-hit-russian-sitcom-comes-out-as-gay/)   his co-star called him a sodomite on twitter once he found out  [source] (http://www.lgbtqnation.com/2015/02/minnesota-native-who-stars-in-hit-russian-sitcom-comes-out-as-gay/)   they don't produce 'Foreign Policy' magazine, they produce ['Foreign Affairs'](http://www.foreignaffairs.com) magazine    his co-star called him a sodomite on twitter once he found out    I'm very uneasy about this plan. Seems like it's giving the state and the governor too much power.    As I told the other person My comment wasn't directed at funding SC State. It was aimed at the fact that /u/SCRx seemed to imply that the state of SC struggles to fund all of it's public universities because of the fact that the state doesn't bring in much money from its low taxes. So I proposed the crazy idea of raising taxes to fund education in general, not SC State.    What is this basketball you speak of?    I'm not supposed to drink coffee because I have high blood pressure but I NEED my caffeine    Apparently it was over a [fucking parking dispute](http://www.wral.com/chapel-hill-police-parking-dispute-may-have-led-to-triple-shooting/14438074/)    My comment wasn't directed at funding SC State.

So I proposed the crazy idea of raising taxes to fund education in general, not SC State.    to lose Colbert and Stewart in a year is an absolute tragedy and the end of an era.    I haven't cared about this story since day one. The man is a human being, their are many instances of a persons memories being incorrect do to the fog of the incident, or just random crap that happens as time goes by. Heck some Holocaust survivor stories have turned out not to be true. So I don't blame Brian one bit and think that he is being shat on way too much. He is the best among the evening news anchors and I will continue to watch him.    umm, hears a crazy thought why doesn't the state raise taxes in order to help pay for this massive school system?    just watch this, all will be explained about Tony Abbot https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3IaKVmkXuk   Today 5 more counties started offering gay marriage licenses after not doing so yesterday.   Also it sounds like the governor has a sound head on his shoulders (never thought I would say that of an Alabama politician).  It is important for people across the country to know that the governor of Alabama today is not the governor of Alabama 50 years ago.   **and**  I dont want Alabama to be seen as it was 50 years ago when a federal law was defied. Im not going to do that, Im trying to move this state forward.  Of note: It is the 50th anniversary of the March on Selma in about 3 weeks, I think this is fresh on his and other Alabamans minds right now.

I didn't speak to him but a saw Jerry Springer a few rows ahead of me at a Cubs game. Same with Shaq saw him on the sidelines of the chick-fil-a bowl a few years back. I did however say hello once to congressman John Lewis of Atlanta once as I passed him in the airport.    2012 Honda accord, so far so good   I assumed it was crappy apartments    interesting    Also top voted comment on the article is as follows    **Thomas:** I walked into his chambers and could feel his steely eyes staring me down. His imposing figure loomed over me as I pressed my back against the wall. Roy dropped his judicial robes to the floor to reveal his well maintained body in all of its glory. His firm member showed a passion. It betrayed by his stone faced expression. "I always wondered if you wore anything while you were on the bench..." I whispered. "Shut up" Roy said as he advanced. He grabbed my shoulders forcefully and spun me around, bending me over his large mahogany desk. He drove himself into me from behind causing me to help slightly as I gripped the papers on his desk, moving them from the orderly piles there to be clenched in a fit of pain and passion. "Oh, Roy!" I called out. "Shut up, Tommy" he insisted through gritted teeth. Such was my first time.  **Response from Gary:**  pervert  **Thomas reply:**  Just when I thought my body could take no more, as I gasped and panted on the verge of collapse, Gary came in wearing a tight, wet T-shirt with a grin on his face. "No, I can't..."I sputtered. "You can." Roy said firmly. "And you will." Gary said. I lay back, ready to take whatever fate had brought me. It was like kissing God.  **Gary again:**  I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future.  **Thomas reply:** "I take great satisfaction in knowing Hell is in your future." Gary said as he forced himself into my mouth. He arched his back as he did so before looking back down to me. "Now accept thy Lord..."    this is fucking awesome    how do I do that?    You don't have to click the link, the headline is all you really need.    yes I know it's a christian site but I wanted to share the bigotry/crazy  edit: For those that don't want to give the site clicks the headline is all you really need, also he said this on his facebook page so this is not an "official" order yet.

Edit2: apparently the article has been taken down   Best quote from the article: Asked if he believes a transgender woman is a woman, Artiles said, I am not going to get into that. I have not spent much time thinking about that.  So clearly, he is the foremost authority to author a bill specifically about that subject   I'll wear the hate with honor, I can be /u/EmperorofOrange and you can be /u/wake_is_great. I'll poke you when ever I'm bored     I live in the Atlanta area. Mom has no interest in her school's team (Clemson) and Dad is an extremely jaded UVA fan because of their struggles over the last 15 years so it was hard for me to be a fan of either of them because I was never exposed to them when I was young. So I just latched onto the two big schools here.   I know :D   I really like airports as well!! I like just exploring the place and just taking in the sheer size of the place. I also like watching planes move about and seeing the organized chaos of it all.    I hate beer and sweet tea. I can't stand coffee unless its loaded with cream, sweetener, or flavoring (or one of those pricey fancy Starbucks drinks). Also we recently got a Cookout and I don't see what all the hype is about, it tastes shitty to me (with exception to the milkshakes). And while I'm at it Chick-fil-A is just average fast food, people around here treat it like gospel  /rant       the attractiveness of WWE and NASCAR just completely escape me  those and you can add UFC to the list    Happy Cake day :)    It works very well in North Fulton, I know several people who support breaking away and reforming Milton County    since when has ESPN covered the NHL?    First I'm hearing about it, good to know. It that's the case then the $1 billion could definitely be used on public transportation (lord knows Atlanta needs it)    "I'm not worried about following the U.S. Constitution"  really telling quote there    "I'm not worried about following the U.S. Constitution"  really telling quote there    i think we've had this conversation before    Have two tests today and got only 4 hours of sleep last night, and after class I work til 5pm, so today will be a little rough    The design laid out here is definitely an improvement over what is there now. But I still can't help but wonder if this money would be better served either on public transportation or widening 400 past McFarland    I honestly think that at this point he is secretly gay, how else do you explain a man so hell bent on stopping gay marriage?     let's stop people from exercising their right to vote so that we can stay in power   Obama is a wizard, and he summoned goblins and devils to vote for him.  Republicans already believe this    Holy Fuck I remember this commercial from watching cartoons as a kid, I hated it.     The closest US equivalent I can think of is the Meth Commercials https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGiAxwgrF_k#t=156   and this anti-smoking commercial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zWB4dLYChM   Fox News    alarm clock    I'd be afraid that my car would be vandalized    it is called CFBOfftopic so I though whats more off topic than this    same here its good during large school tours for prospective high schoolers but after that it turns to shit again    A FUCKING MEN!!!! They control the dining hall at my school (small liberal arts school with 2100 people) and they suck. The food is awful, even the employees admit that not much there is worth eating.    This article from NBC Sports gives us a more detailed overview http://collegefootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/02/08/houstons-new-tdecu-stadium-at-center-of-audit-and-outrage/   thank you! I don't know what people see in this movie, it's just very average to me and not the spectacle that they make it out to be.    Where are you from?    As a gay man I don't understand why gay people go to private christian schools and expect to be treated with respect    I'm weird   darn I was hoping for a fellow fur here, oh well    As a gay man here is [my opinion of the pope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sph8Qu8wLAk#t=22)   gotcha. I was curious as to whether or not you were a furry   how did you find /r/furryLobby?    hello fellow Georgian!! Atlanta area?    exactly!! I remember talking to the lady who drove my school bus in high school. She said that most people (herself included) drove busses  for the benefits and had other jobs that were their main source of income.    [My opinion of the Pope](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sph8Qu8wLAk#t=22)   guess which political party?

However he will not officiate wedding ceremonies as he fells that they go against god. Other local media sources says that all wedding ceremonies will end so that gays can't have ceremonies in the courthouse    It took me a minute to tell who was who.    Hell will freeze over before Cobb accepts MARTA. Remember MARTA brings "crime" ^cough black people ^cough    Kansans only have themselves to blame as they elected him TWICE    I thought you were referring to the AIG Insurance company    Thank You!! I'm not the only one. My dad said I was crazy for thinking this.    because of course    Concrete hasn't even been poured and this is already a shitshow    And he's resigned http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/02/05/3619996/aaron-schock-racist-resignation/   It's even dumber considering that the court charges $12 for marriages at the courthouse which brought in over $5000 last year.

All the hype over recruiting has never made sense to me     how so?    I'm active in like 6 of them    I'm currently subscribed to 79   here's a Deadspin article with more background http://deadspin.com/byu-signs-67-410-lbs-hulk-based-on-two-year-old-pick-1683902467   I personally am not that much of a beer drinker - or really alcohol drinker to be honest - and have a negative opinion of alcohol in general because my mother is an alcoholic so I don't drink much of the stuff. Of course it helps I've never really found a "real" alcohol product that I liked (the only alcohol that I like are mixed drinks - daiquiris and the like - and Bailey's )    I'm still baffled that ALA-FUCKING-BAMA beat Georgia in getting gay marriage    It's the KFC Double Down Dog, available in the [Philippines] ( http://news.yahoo.com/kfc-unleashes-double-down-dog-philippines-084419953.html)   what was the rule that was changed?    Mad Men, I find it incredibly boring    I heard that it was the Women's Temperance Movement (the same people who pushed for prohibition) that campaigned to make it illegal    I haven't been to that many games involving my teams, the worst experience that I can remember having is at the peach bowl (it was either 2002 or 2004). We live in the Atlanta area and my dad gets tickets through work every year to the game. So we usually don't have a stake in either team. We had some extra tickets and their was this family of Tennessee fans that needed tickets. My mom was like "oh they look like a nice clean cut family, why don't we sell our extra tickets to them". We did and they were so thankful, get to are seats in the Dome and they are right next to us. Well the moment the game starts these people turn into the most obnoxious drunk fans I have ever experienced. They were shouting so much that the people in front of us had to ask them to shut up because they were shouting right into their ears. The last straw was when the wife spilt beer on the guy in front of her, security was called and they were escorted out. We have never sold extra tickets to anyone since.    I'm not trying to trivialize the issue, what I'm criticizing is that the NFL is all of a sudden caring about this issue and saying that they are going to do more and donate money to charities. When in reality  they are spending so little on domestic violence considering they make $10 billon a year. I'm also criticizing the fact that they partnered with NOmore, an organization that is not a nonprofit and is completely fake seeming to only be for branding http://deadspin.com/do-the-nfls-anti-domestic-violence-initiatives-actually-1682681513   Don't worry it was at an NCAA approved transaction    The tarp heyday    How did you become a Bayor fan in France   Watch Pete Carroll try to explain the last play call https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjUzsaQ9a_E   Maybe so but at least Always did it of their own accord and aren't doing it because of a PR disaster ^cough NFL NOmore.org ^cough and the Always also came across more natural and sincere than the NOmore ads which again are nothing but PR. But people see things differently so I can see where you are coming from   I don't follow CBB that much, did your team regress or something?    I don't think it was an entirely bad idea, it may have just been poor execution (pardon the pun). I think the idea is that instead of promoting their product they are promoting household safety, like the Always commercial isn't promoting their product but treating women with dignity and not ostracizing women/girls.    I don't think it was entirely bad. I think the idea is that instead of promoting their product they are promoting household safety, like the Always commercial isn't promoting their product but treating women with dignity and not ostracizing women/girls. It was probably just poor execution (pardon the pun)    well then   But the thing is that it's just an NFL PR move and nothing more. If the Ray Rice fiasco hadn't happened you wouldn't be seeing any of these ads.    Ha we linked the same video 10 minutes apart    But not every video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUNaarTm7n4#t=252   the same thing happened on /r/CFBOffTopic in during the last 5 minutes of the game   Here it is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUNaarTm7n4#t=252  Edit: HOLY SHIT!!!

HOLY SHIT!!!!!   anyone else having problems with reddit?   where are you?    anyone else having problems with reddit?    GRONK STRONG!!!!   apparently its based on an Australian show    Even though Bud Light sucks life sized pac man would be awesome    So is everyone watching the game by themselves or are you the guy amongst your friends with a laptop/phone in your lap?    exactly    Holy shit its the 4th quarter!! This game was fast    especially sense Mila Kunis isn't going to be in the sequal    E! pumping out shit as usual it looks like    what was that?    I'm in Rome    people who drink budweiser don't drink it because "they like to drink beer" they do it because they are either too cheap or don't know what good beer is    they're bringing Heros back?    a toenail fungus commercial, really?    for me it's that one, the Fiat one, and clash of clans   Clash of clans afford a superbowl ad with Liam Nelson? It was awesome though    I tried that thread for a little while but it was awful so I came back here among sane people   me too! Where in the area?    They haven't even produced a real "star" from that show   I'll chip in a few    Who wants to bet that Katy Perry will be ESPN's new Fall Out Boy in the fall    I want that dog!!   my roommate said it reminded him of the Hardee's / Carl's Jr. logo    I was going off of history, I will admit I was impressed    I know I was doubtful that she would deliver but she actually did a good job. It was a lot better than last years    Kim Jong Un's favorite part    She changed her outfit again   Those sharks and balls look so sad    Katy always needs to show cleavage otherwise she wouldn't have a career    They went all out on the special affects they couldn't afford lip singing technology      I want that tiger thing    Let's see how bad Katy will be singing live   11 Alive?    I got a CPI security commercial, must be a local one    yep   I'm surprised Hoda and Katy Lee aren't holding wine glasses in that commercial    I know it is, thats why I don't like them because they didn't give a crap about it until Ray    I got a Carolina panther player helping a girl eat her brussel sprouts and then saying that he uses CPI security to keep his family safe, where do you live? If scientology is popular in the area that might explain it      I hate the NFL mandatory domestic violence commercials because it screams a PR move after the Ray Rice mess    whenever I hear Chris Matthews i think of the guy on MSNBC    this is way better than last years game.    touchdown, great call by Carroll    wait r/hockey made it to the front but not r/nfl? that is awesome    Just go for it   Umm you paid $3.5 million for that??   	198
    So what he's saying is that we pissed away taxpayer money on him to do his job, that he didn't do.   Zero justification for what happened to him.   Why the hell aren't you asleep in bed yet?   "I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul."   Passion of the Christ and 42 are the only two that come to mind, though I know there are a few others.   Shut up Kevin   Though the "i" is missing, -ism makes me think "orgasm."   When she's putting in a new tampon.   Do these idiots have anything serious to run on other than "Obama is bad?"    then people would actually read a tiny percent more about politics and make more of an informed decision  One can dream...........  My original post was sarcasm.  Too many people I've met have no idea exactly who they are voting for (meaning what the person stands for) and just vote for a party.   So people don't have to do research, they can just vote based on whatever party they want.   not good at math, are we?  What math?  I asked "What neighborhood is this?"    Not good at reading comprehension, are we?   You're the only one here who didn't get that it was a joke.  It didn't have to be explained to the rest of us.   When asked if the FBI ever tracks Americans geolocation without a warrant, Hess reluctantly answered yes but declined to provide details to the public   What amazes me are the people who seem to be alright with this and seemingly are the ones who oppose "big government."      The boy had shopped at the store alone many times without incident, said his father, and **had spent thousands of dollars there  he earned the money shovelling snow and babysitting.**  Holy crap what neighborhood is this?!      You missed the point as well.   I don't really care, I just find it amazing that people on reddit miss the point so often.  I worry about societies future.   But Pete didn't like the odds of the movies success.   Yeah, because that was the focal point of the TIL, that she went to the doctor with him.  [OK](http://i.giphy.com/LVIbmaUwpRJ1C.gif)   I've had TILs taken down that mention Bill Clinton that have nothing to do with politics, just the name alone, and it got taken down.  Pretty weak but out of my hands anyway.  EDIT: I guess I *can* understand it in that, as with many posts on reddit, people get off the rails very quickly and turn something into a whole other matter altogether.  And politics is definitely a touchy area.   Obviously you missed the point of my post.   These are the types of stories that just add fuel to the fire.  How many times did we hear different things in the Michael Brown case that, in the end, were total nonsense?  But people eat up every little nugget that comes out if it buys into an agenda.           Relevant text:  One of their claws can exert pressure of up to 100 pounds per square inch.  So they may not feel pain, but they can cause some serious pain. Researchers discovered that after having the lobsters larger claw, the crusher claw, clamp down on a load cell, a pressure-measuring device. This claw looks like it has molars because its used to break up anything hard like crabs, clams, mussels.

As a result, plaintiff claimed, he and the general public had been led to consume defendant's products, which defendant knew were dangerous and likely to cause serious health problems, including addiction and death. In support of his claims, plaintiff pointed to defendant's television advertisements featuring Bud Light as the source of fantasies coming to life, fantasies involving tropical settings, and beautiful women and men engaged in unrestricted merriment. Plaintiff sought monetary damages in excess of $10,000, alleging that defendant's misleading advertisements had caused him physical and mental injury, emotional distress, and financial loss. Defendant moved for summary disposition, arguing among other things that it had no duty to warn of commonly known dangers. The trial court agreed with defendant's analysis in this regard, and granted summary disposition in its favor. We agree and affirm.

I encourage you to read more about Abby in the link provided, but in a nutshell  shes one of the most inspirational people I have come across. Abbys younger brother Cameron was born with Cerebral Palsy and she would regularly accompany him to Lutheran General Hospital on his medical visits. Abby noticed that the other pediatric patients liked to color, but many of the crayons were broken. Abby had purchased some crayons with her parents for the patients, but it didnt end there. For Abby, it was the obvious thing to do  think up a way to raise money so that she can buy crayons and other coloring materials for the patients. Abby conducted a lemonade sale. Soon the 8-year-old came up with a plan to raise money by creating lemonade kits using bottled water with attached packets and tags with her very own message, When life gives you lemons, color!. She gained the help of family and friends and before she knew it she was on her way to a goal of purchasing 1000 boxes for the children at the hospital.

Inspired by watching his young son draw smiley faces on a frosted window, Potts created the Pitcher Man, a glass pitcher with a wide smile emblazoned on its side and filled with Kool-Aid. It was one of several designs Potts created but the only one that stuck, and General Foods began to use the Pitcher Man in all of its advertisements.      Who's using if they are gay or not against him?   I love when things like this happen to politicians.

Pretty conceited on his part to expect someone to move for his camera shot.

If LEO retaliating against successful lawsuits  There was no lawsuit in this matter.  there isn't a point in conversing with you  That's very apparent as you've just displayed up above that you likely didn't even read the story and are going solely on the headline.  You should probably read up on and understand something before discussing it instead of merely arguing on your own personal bias.    As someone who frequently gets stopped while walking because "someone" reported some minor unprovable crime or "suspicious activity" I have my doubts in this case. It's one of the most common go-to reasons police use for a bullshit stop to provide reasonable suspicion.   Why would you doubt someone calling about you?  It's one of the most common go-to reasons police use for a bullshit stop to provide reasonable suspicion.   Source?  considering how often police have been proven to lie lately  You need to step away from the media machine.  Take into consideration the number of police officers there are in this country, the number of interactions each may have every single day, and then compare to the number of instances that actually get blown up.  Too many people are drinking the media kool-aid.    You seem very convinced that this person and their "report" aren't fabricated.   I'm never 100% convinced of everything unless I know the full details of everything from both sides.  With that said, and from what I've read on this specific instance, there is nothing there to cause me to doubt what happened.    That is not a reasonable attitude.  Sure it is.  Why?  Because there is nothing there to cause me to doubt it.  What exactly is there about this instance that makes you question the reliability?  Have you wondered at all about the man that was stopped at all and what he was/may have been doing or is the fact that he's not the police officer enough for you to not question his motives?      Spotted by who?  By a person whose yard he was running through.   Someone always has to be the Debbie Downer.  Thanks for nothing /u/Smokabowl.   Apply that logic to income inequality.  Because that's an entirely different subject.  The wage gap continues to grow and the lower classes do not resort to violence. But because they don't take drastic actions, they don't get results.  Occupy Wall Street certainly didn't do anything.  That's his point, America praises the Boston Tea Party in which America finally revolted and took charge. America fought a violent war to get change from Britain.  The patriots fought for independence, to become their own country.  What exactly are the riots doing and how is it going to change things?  Strictly non-violence is exactly what your opposers want you to use because it doesn't insight enough fear in them  Yet show your full hand right off the bat and it's not going to instill fear either.  Additionally, things like this have been played out before.  Someone fucks up, huge uproar, riots, riots, more riots but not as bad, less riots, and then eventually people go home and do whatever it is they do.     At that time of day I'd still be sleeping the past night off   every single time  Source?   There is video of this police officer doing something illegal and filing a false report?     This is called taking an argument to the extreme  That's what people do when they can't argue something on its own merits, jump to ridiculous statements.   Is the store in your neighborhood of six houses?  Did you ask all of the neighbors?  If you did, is it not possible that they were lying?  Is it not possible that your son was lying to you?  Was it your neighborhood that someone was seen running through the yards?   IF he was actually doing that.  And until anything else comes out this is all we have to go on.  I mean, that's how things roll right?  When a police officer is accused of doing something wrong then in the eyes of the public they are guilty.  Shouldn't it be the same the other way around?  Not like we're talking about an angel of a man here:  *Pusok, 30, has felony and misdemeanor convictions over the last 10 years, including resisting arrest, animal cruelty, grand theft auto and attempted robbery.*  That is from [this](http://www.sbsun.com/general-news/20150424/francis-pusok-questioned-by-sbpd-day-after-650k-settlement-okd) article.     So did you ask everyone in the neighborhood?  Did you personally have eyes on all of the yards at whatever time a call might have come in?    Did anyone actually see him running though backyards other than a police officer ?  Yeah, the person that called the police.    There are [other articles](http://www.sbsun.com/general-news/20150424/francis-pusok-questioned-by-sbpd-day-after-650k-settlement-okd) about this online besides the one here that appear to be a little more detailed.   Well, show me it's just something the police are saying then.  He wasn't spotted by the police, they were responding to a call from someone else about someone running through the yards.   Nobody in the neighborhood had reported any such thing to the police.  Did you ask everybody in the neighborhood?  And if so, and they knew you were asking about your son, do you trust that they'd be honest with you?   Francis Pusok, 30, was stopped sometime between 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. April 22 in the 3700 block of Elm Avenue after he was spotted running through backyards of homes,   I would hope a person running through people's backyards at that time in the morning would be stopped to see what they were doing.

Relevant text: The 2009 Pittsburgh police shootings was a shootout that took place on Saturday, April 4, 2009, at 1016 Fairfield Street[1] in the Stanton Heights neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States, stemming from a mother and her 22-year-old son's argument over a dog urinating in the house.[2] At approximately 7:11 a.m. EDT, 22-year-old Richard Poplawski opened fire on two Pittsburgh Police officers responding to a 9-1-1 call from Poplawski's mother, who was attempting to get the police officers to remove her son from the home. Three police officers were ultimately confirmed dead, and another two were seriously injured.  According to Pittsburgh Police Chief, Nathan Harper, Poplawski was armed with a semi-automatic AK-47-style rifle, a shotgun and three handguns (a .357 Magnum revolver, a .380-caliber handgun and a .45-caliber handgun), protected by a bulletproof vest, and had been lying in wait for the officers. According to police and witnesses, he held police at bay for four hours as the fallen officers were left bleeding nearby, their colleagues unable to reach them. More than 600 rounds were fired by the SWAT teams and Poplawski.  The victims were the first Pittsburgh city officers killed in the line of duty in 18 years. The incident was the second-deadliest attack on U.S. law enforcement since the September 11 attacks, following a shooting two weeks earlier in Oakland, California. On June 28, 2011, Poplawski was sentenced to death by lethal injection on three counts of murder in the first degree.

Support for justice of Freddie Gray, 25, who was arrested one week ago, in West Baltimore. Who died on April 19th, from injuries sustained while he was in police custody.*  Here's what that does.  It shows a united front of all different types of people.  It shows that people want something done and they are willing to be civilized human beings, sit and discuss the problem, figure out a solution, and fix the problem.   The police are not innocent people  Pretty broad brush stroke there no?  Are there bad cops?  Absolutely.  Are they in the minority.  Yep.  If we want to paint broad brush strokes, would you then agree that "black people are criminals" based on a small percentage that are acting out violently and criminally?  they need to be brought to justice and held accountable  The ones that abuse their power?  Absolutely.  it will not happen thru peaceful means.  Yet it's been proven time and time again that it does.  What do violent/criminal acts do?  They give the city a reason to increase the number of police officers on the street and hire more.  It creates and/or strengthens a stereotype that then turns into bias/profiling.  HAHAH fuck off with the mlk thing  Yeah, because that would go against your agenda and proves you wrong.   like things havent changed since 9/11 that make peaceful resistance useless  You're right.  Things have changed.  Such as, this country is far less racially divided than it was during the time of MLK.  **HE** was able to bring change, peacefully, in a far more hostile environment.  The environment is nowhere near as hostile today, yet people cannot impact change peacefully?  This just sounds like sheer laziness.  Boohoo other people lives are being disrupted while others fight for their fucking lives  If that's the attitude you want to give, then expect the same attitude in return.    It's time to stop using the race card and playing victim.  People want to blame others for their situation instead of pulling their own shit together and taking personal responsibility.  You don't want the cops bothering you?  Then don't give them a reason too.  You want to succeed in life?  Then work for it.  Harming other people's lives, ruining their livelihood, creating destruction, and not acting like a civilized human being has never caused progress.               Keep on fighting for your rights and freedoms peoples  Fighting for what rights?  The right to attack innocent people for no reason?  The right to destroy property that doesn't belong to them?  The right to disrupt other people's lives?  The right to steal for their own selfish benefit?  Peaceful ways dont work  Martin Luther King Jr.  disagrees.     Waze is a balloon knot?

Looting, trashing/burning businesses, and attacking civilians has nothing to do with a police union.  That has to do with a bunch of chicken shit thugs criminally acting out.

Relevant text:  Liu Kang was originally going to be a Japanese character called Minamoto Yoshitsune, but Mortal Kombat co-creator and character designer John Tobias stated that the staff could not "deal with the name." According to Tobias, Liu Kang "was originally going to be a traditional monk  bald and in robes  but he wound up resembling Bruce Lee." As stated on his Mortal Kombat: Armageddon bio card, Ed Boon mentioned that Liu Kang was designed to be the most easily "accessible" character, meaning that both casual and experienced gamers could play as him with little difficulty. According to Tobias, Liu Kang was purposely the only character that voiced his finishing move in the original game, and was "the best" in the first sequel. Liu Kang was the only character in the first game whose finishing move (Fatality) did not explicitly murder his opponent, and also without the background dimming. This was because Liu Kang was depicted therein as a Shaolin monk, who in general have strict beliefs regarding killing and murder. However, starting with Mortal Kombat II, he was given gory Fatalities as he was thereafter depicted as a renegade monk who decided to grow his hair back, and who had "strong Shaolin beliefs, but was no longer a part of the Shaolin monks." In response to rumors that Liu Kang would die in Mortal Kombat II and therefore not make it into Mortal Kombat 3, Boon said, "It'd be like doing part three of Star Wars and not having Luke Skywalker in there. You don't do that." His eventual death caused Dan Forden, the music composer of the series, to make a "funeral song" for Liu Kang as he felt saddened for his death. The track titled "Liu Kang's Tomb" would be used in Mortal Kombat: Deception in the arena that shows his tomb.

Of the 12,000 blood cancer patients who require marrow, 70 percent do not have matches in their families. When I got the phone call, I was so shocked, said Lyle. I totally forgot I even signed up a couple of years before. Even then, I did not think I would be a match. The odds are so ridiculous. After additional testing, Lyle was confirmed as a definite match. There was no time to waste. The surgery was scheduled immediately for April 25. There was one catch: the surgery would take place one month before the end of his college career. Lyle never feared the actual marrow donation surgery. He worried the most about telling his coach that he would be sitting out the final part of his senior season because of the surgery. His coach, though, was supportive. Jim Boulanger, director of New Hampshires track and field program, told Lyle that sports do not triumph life, they are merely a part of it. If you have the chance to save a life, do whatever it takes. If Lyle chose to be a donor, his collegiate career would stop cold turkey without the closure a championship win would bring him. As he threw his last shot at the Stony Brook Invitational on April 20, his teammates surrounded him to help bring one chapter of his life to a close. For him this was closure. Hugs were shared and although it was not the ending he planned for, he was allowing a stranger the chance to start a new chapter of his own. Even with that elusive conference championship within reach, Lyle never had any second thoughts about donating  especially when he learned about the man who would be receiving his marrow donation. Lyles 28-year-old match was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia a few days before Christmas in 2012. He had a fianc and a nineteen-month-old son. For Lyle, this information solidified his decision to donate. I would have done it anyway, said Lyle. But knowing he is just starting his life, he has so much ahead of him, makes it worth it. It hits home because he is only a few years older than I am.

 So I am playing through the lessons and I simply cannot get 100 percent on any of the practice tracks. Specifically, once I get up to the 12th fret and higher rocksmith has a really hard properly recognizing notes.  For instance, in the shifting lesson, it asked me to play the 15th fret. So I did. It kept complaining that I was hitting the 16th fret. I had to play the 14th fret to pass that part.  It is especially bad in the sustain track because it simply refuses to acknowledge that I have hit the 12th fret notes at all unless I pick the string way harder than should really be necessary.  I have my pickup selector set to the neck pickup. I have the pickup volume the whole way up. I have increased the line in input in my mixer settings. I have recalibrated and retuned (both with rocksmith as well as my snark clip on tuner). I've tried tuning at both the neck and the 12th fret (guitar geek tip - tune by playing at the 12th fret). Everything should be working. But it isn't.   Anyone else run into this??   I just noticed this a few minutes ago.

I found an ethnic Asian market that sells it frozen, but I know ethnic markets can sometimes play a little fast and loose with legality. Not that I care if they have what I need, lol.  So, does anyone know? Is it really illegal to sell pig blood in the US?   What the title says.  We use capital one 360 and have one checking and a ton of savings accounts (its how we handle budgeting).  I know if I transfer out of a savings account to checking it counts toward the monthly limit, but I don't believe I have ever seen a notice when transferring between savings accounts.   Hey everyone! I'm in the process of planning out my wife and I's first at-home Christmas dinner. We got tired of figuring out whose family/friends/whatever we were supposed to attend each year and decided to just spend it together.  As of now I'm working on putting together the menu. Obviously this is a special meal so I am going all out.  Appetizer: ??  Lemon sorbet in between  Main course:  * Crown rack of lamb * Couscous with nuts, fruit * garlic custard * asparagus bundles tied with bacon  Cheese plate:   * Roquefort or stilton * Cabot clothbound cheddar * Camembert * Some TBD hard cheese * Some TBD chevre or sheep milk cheese  Dessert: Chocolate mousse, a lemon curd tart, creme brulee or a tart tatin and espresso  Wine pairing: * cote du rhone * Chateau Ste Michelle Eroica (her favorite)  So, I have most of it planned out. There are a few things TBD the one I am having the most trouble with is the appetizer.  I know traditionally it should be a soup or salad. I'd like to go a bit beyond a salad, so I'm trying to think of soups.   Any suggestions? Any other ideas for apps that would fit?   Pretty simple question. It's nice enough that Rocksmith shows you hand positioning, but some songs seem to have kind of wonky finger positioning that doesn't really make sense with the positioning.   It seems like tremolos show you the finger, but otherwise it doesn't really seem to help too much.   So, I've always had an issue with the occasional muscle spasm. Usually it's minor, and it doesn't happen frequently. But every now and then I'll be practicing and one of my fingers will have a single solitary "twitch."  Now, i've never been to a doctor for it because it is pretty seldom, but it does seem to happen more often when I'm using my hands - like when I'm playing guitar.  So, does anyone else have this problem? How have you overcome it? Thus far it hasn't really impacted my practicing, but I'd love to understand what it is and how to ensure it never does impact my practicing.   Hey everyone. I grabbed CDLC for 21st Century Digital Boy (bad religion), which was PC only. I used the toolkit to convert to mac.  At the song select screen, the song shows up. The music plays. When I select the song, the "rocksmith recommends" stuff all shows up properly, tuning shows up, etc. When I press play, if it's the first song, the tuner will show up. If i'm already in standard E, it won't.  At this point through something weird happens. The foreground graphics all fade away, leaving just the background (and the amp stacks on the sides of the screen). Then it just sits there. Hitting escape/enter/whatever doesn't work. The game stays responsive, but it just sits there with no way to escape.  I've had to force quit trying it 4 times now, so it's definitely repeatable. Could it be an issue with the CDLC? Or maybe something went wrong during the conversion from PC to Mac? It's the only one I've had an issue with so far!   Hey everyone. This is impacting me on both Classical and Electric guitar. During warmups and initial practice my fret hand has no issues. For classical, my thumb placement is exactly where it should be, behind the second fret (first position). I'm sitting correctly, guitar in my lap at a 10 degree angle (ish) learning in to my body and at an ascending angle.  With electric, my position is a bit more sloppy and relaxed. Usually I'm sitting on a couch or chair and playing whatever feels most comfortable at the time (the electric is more for fun and less for serious study for me right now).  Either way, after about 30 minutes or so, my fret hand starts to ache. I find myself squeezing the fretboard a lot, so I'm wondering if this is causing it?  My classical guitar teacher has suggested letting gravity pull my hand down on to the string as opposed to exerting force, but when i do that I tend to get buzzing more than clear notes. He also suggested bringing my fret hand's arm's elbow tighter in to my body, but still, not much improvement. Other than that, he said my form is fine. So I'm kind of at a loss.  I'm a relatively new player - about 6 months, so could this just be simple muscle fatigue that will go away? Is there something else I could be doing wrong? Any other ideas would be really appreciated. Usually I can just shake out my hand and it goes away, but there have been a few times where it has caused me to cut my practicing a bit short. Since I've been practicing more and more lately, it has been limiting me more and more.   A buddy is letting me long-term-borrow his fender deluxe player strat. There are the 3 pickup knobs, and the normal pickup selector switch. There is also a button which has no label. Since it's used, there's no guide with the guitar. For the life of me, I can't find anything on google other than it controls pickups. I don't know what it does exactly.  The official fender blurb says: "The powerful Deluxe Players Strat guitar is set apart from the pack by features [...] standard five-way pickup switch paired with push/push mini-switch offering an even greater variety of pickup combinations, brown shell pickguard and gold-plated vintage hardware."  Which, is great for saying what it's supposed to do, but how the heck does it work? So, can anyone help an ignorant newbie? :)   Hey everyone. I have been taking classical fingerstyle lessons for about 6 months now, and feel somewhat accomplished with it.  I have been planning to start dabbling in rock and jazz for awhile (I figured learning rock and jazz with the full knowledge of theory behind it would be awesome). A buddy is letting me long-term-borrow his fender strat to start doing just that. Well, as a gift my wife picked me up RS2014, and I now have it fully decked out. The thought was it would give me the ability to practice stuff that isn't from the book, let me start playing around with other styles, and most importantly keep the guitar in my hand.  I have no plan to stop taking lessons.  So, who else out there takes guitar lessons in addition to playing RS? Are there any teachers or students out there who can provide information or tips about this approach? I want to play with both, but I don't want to sabotage my lessons. I want RS to be an enhancement to my learning.  My guess is I need to focus a lot on the guitarcade because it doesn't so much teach songs as it does teach techniques that are always important. The songs should just be a fun addition. What does everyone else think?   So, I've been messing with the guitarcade in RS2014, but I'm getting kind of frustrated that to learn, I play through (but usually fail pretty fast).  The problem is, after I lose, I have to watch the losing animation, watch a game over screen, watch a high scores screen, go to the title screen, "make some noise," wait for opening animations, etc.  Is there any way I can skip all of that stuff and get right back to gameplay? It's annoying having 45 seconds of downtime between each attempt.   Pretty much what I put in the title. I've been studying fingerstyle for awhile, and had an opportunity pop up to get an Fender Strat (a buddy is considering selling it, but isn't sure if he really wants to, so I am "long term borrowing" while he decides if he can live without it or not).  This works for me, because in a few months I want to pick up a hollowbody to start venturing more into Jazz and rockabilly.  So, now I have this thing, I don't know where to go first. I tried fingerpicking but it started gouging the hell out of my nails, so I'll be picking up some new alaska piks soon. Are there any good books for jazz that I can start with? This is less serious study and more for fun, so I'd love to hear everyone's opinions. Something for jazz fingerpicking would be spectacular because it's what I'm most comfortable with.   Pretty much exactly what the title says. What do you find yourself buying most often? Picks? Reeds? Strings? Cork oil? Cables?  I want to start with basics musicians always need, and then eventually start moving towards larger items (things that are tough and expensive to build up an inventory of initially).   As of this evening I'm borrowing a buddy's Les Paul studio that he never plays (he is considering selling it but isn't sure, and figures it will give him a chance to see if he really never uses it if I long-term-borrow). It gives me a chance to futz around on an electric before I make the jump on a hollowbody next year.  Pretty simple question - does anyone know of a current deal on RS2014 for pc/mac? I know I'm a week late, but maybe someplace still has a cyber-week sale going on.  If I can find the core game, I'll order one of the cables separately. Otherwise I'll be ordering the physical bundle.   It arrived yesterday. My wife and I have been fed up with replacing 1 to 2 coffee machines a year for years, and getting consistently terrible support.  So, we figured the time had come, so we took advantage of the 20% sale at Williams-Sonoma and placed our order.  My first impressions - I like how it's built. While it will be a pain in the ass for folks who hate washing small parts, for kitchen clean freaks like the wife and I, it's awesome. It also shows you what you're paying for - a crazy pump and heating element, with some well designed plastic parts to hold and drip coffee through.  I had the first brew this morning, and I had mixed results. I made enough for 10 cups of coffee, using their guideline of 7tbsp (usually we each have 2 mugs of coffee a morning, and measuring it out with water that was about what was needed). The coffee came out surprisingly timid taste-wise (not the coffee maker's fault, I have to dial it in). I used a paper filter instead of a mesh filter, so the mouthfeel was slightly diminished from what I'm used to. I'll pick up a new filter today.  Despite the first pot being a little light, I will say that it packed a hell of a punch of caffeine. I had to be up for work at 4:30, and about 10 minutes after finishing my travel mug I got a very noticable jolt. I weigh 230 lbs. That almost never happens with coffee, especially cheap bulk beans from sams club (I don't use "the good stuff" until I have it dialed in). This could have been psychosomatic, but it was noticable to me.  So far, I am very impressed, I just have to dial in the right amount of coffee to use. It looks great, albiet a little industrial.  I also like the 5 year guarantee - at the rate we were replacing pots this alone makes the ticket price worth it.   Hey everyone. Like lots of folks, I got involved with cryptocurrency during the boom last december. However, much of the time between then, and honestly, even now, I was flying by the seat of my pants and guiding myself with back-of-napkin math. I didn't keep much in the way of records.  Since getting involved, a number of the parties I've worked with have shuttered their doors, gone bankrupt, or worse (gone rogue resulting in lots of losses that I've more or less shrugged off). With these places closing their doors, I've lost the ability to get records of the transactions to/from them. I still earn some bitcoin weekly through online mining contracts.  So, my issue is I'd like to try and comply with the IRS advisory, but I simply lack most of the records I would need to comply. I'm not really sure what to do. Part of me wants to take the paltry sum of bitcoin that I have now (as in this moment, it's small, about $200 USD) and set it aside, and start keeping immaculate records.  The benefit of doing that is I can start freely converting some of my earnings back to USD so long as I pay taxes on the capital gains/losses, which is a good thing right? If I am correct - I pay taxes on the income the day that the bitcoin is received, and then if it is held, I pay taxes on the capital gains between the day it is received and the day it is used for another financial transaction.  However, I haven't been able to get any real information about how to do my taxes. What forms do I need? Usually I do my taxes with turbotax, but I'm guessing that is out of the question? For a non-tax-pro, the whole advisory is really confusing and I don't really know where to begin if I want to go "green field" and start keeping immaculate records.  I just need advice about what to do and how to best proceed. I've tried starting a conversation about this in /r/bitcoin but the majority of folks there just say not to bother which is counterproductive. I've also seen folks say to talk to a tax attorney or cpa but the prices in our area dwarf the amount ive earned significantly.   So, I've been playing with cryptos for a little over a year now. The issue I have is that in that time, I didn't keep good records. I don't know how much I mined, how much I sent where, etc. Worse, there is a lot that I have lost in places like Gox and Bitcoin-Trader. I can't get records from them. Likewise a number of the altcoin pools I was participating in have dried up and closed their doors, so I can't account for my transactions from them.  All said, I honestly don't know how to handle the taxes.  So, what I'm considering doing is sending everything I currently have to a paper wallet, and starting to keep detailed records from that day forward (kind of a "green field" approach). At least then I can be somewhat in compliance. Is this a good/bad idea? I'm in the US and the reporting requirements are confusing to say the least.   Hey everyone! Hopefully this is my last pre-purchase question. I'm pretty sure I'm getting rocksmith and rocksmith 2014, but now I'm torn between PS3 and PC.  PS3 seems like it is the easiest to get up and running. PC, by nature of being a more open platform, should give me more versatility - stuff like custom DLC (I really want more jazz stuff to be included, and this seems like the only option).  Are there any other major differences I need to be aware of between the two??   Hey everyone. I am interested in picking up ricksmith and rocksmith 2014. I am currebtly studying classical guitar, but I feel that this could help me pick up the guitar a bit morw and in a different way.  I have seen several articles mention that in rocksmith 2014 you can pay to download the song library from the original rocksmith if you have it already.  Does this require that I have a copy of the original rocksmith? Or can I just buy rocksmith 2014 and download the original rocksmith's song library as dlc?  This is for PS3   Simple question I hope. I am re-outfitting my GT Transeo 2.0 to be a training bike. As part of that, I picked up a lower end cycle computer that had gotten thumbs up for rear mounting.  Now, I'm having a hell of a time getting the spedometer sensor to work correctly. My bike uses disk brakes, so the chainstays and seatstays are extremely wide. According to the manufacturer, the spoke magnet and the sensor have to pass within 1-3mm of each other (2 business cards thickness). There simply is no where on the frame of my bike where that is possible. Even at the hub (if the disk brakes weren't blocking me from putting it there) there is still about a half inch between the magnet and the sensor.  The only place I've found that gets the sensor close enough to the spoke magnet is on the sheathing to the brake line right before it goes into the disk brake mechanism. If I mount the sensor there, it finally is close enough to the magnet that it can pick it up. My major concern is that the zip ties will restrict movement of the brake line.  I am also considering beefing up the magnet by using some neodymium magnets - i just have to find a way to hold them.         Over the weekend I picked up a several games. The Jak and Daxter collection, The Ratchet and Clank collection, Rayman Origins and Rayman Legends, Lego Hobbit, and GTA5. Well over the 100$ requirement. However I haven't seen anything from Sony about the credit they promised for spending over 100$.   Hey everyone! My wife, for christmas, is getting me a set of rollers for my bike. She let me know, so we can pick them out together. Right now I'm looking at Elite Atrion mag rollers. It's on sale at Performance Bicycle for black friday, and it seems like a good option. Has anyone  Truth is, I've got a sedentary job, and I've gained about 55lbs since I started working there 5 years ago. I've been trying to lose weight. We have a very good treadmill, but I seriously can't stand running anymore (I've run 2 half marathons, my knees can't take it with the weight, and my mind can't take the boredom). I can get an OK workout by walking/wogging on the treadmill, but I just enjoy my bike more.  I have a GT Transeo 2.0 hybrid with the stock tires. I've been told that the tires will work, but I should look at getting some smooth tires. Is there any truth to that?  I'm also thinking about getting some kind of cycle computer to monitor cadence/speed, but what other features should I look at? I feel like GPS would be wasted because I won't be using the computer while I'm outside riding. What other training specific features would be helpful? Are there any models anyone can recommend? For heart rate, I've got a Polar F11 (it's old but it works great).   Well, our turkey cooked far faster than expected for a 23lb bird. It is now done nearly 2 hours earlier than expected.  Will storing it in a cooler dry things out?   This is something that has been bothering me for awhile - why do so many people make the assumption that women cook and men don't? What defines our biases associated with foods and who we think is "good" at making them?   I'll give an example. I spent all day making a series of dishes for a community meeting. Everything 100% from scratch, slow food style, so when I say from scratch I mean as close to scratch as I can reasonably come. Stromboli with homemade mozz, sauce, homegrown veggies, home ground sausage, etc. The yeast was the only thing that came in a package. Fruit leathers from berries I picked. Cupcakes filled with home brewed chocolate stout cream. Things that took a long time and a ton of effort.  I show up to the meeting, and the first response I hear after "this is amazing!" is "Please tell your wife this food was awesome!" I was fit to be tied.  We regularly have pot lucks at work, and it happens there too. Muesli cookies? Apple pie from hand picked apples and home milled flour and home churned butter crust? Vanilla bourbon salt caramels? Again, people seem incredulous that I, not my wife, made it. "You made this!?"  It feels like a huge slap in the face. Yes I freaking made it! Spending hours tweaking something to get it perfect only to have someone assume that you didn't do it because you have a penis really, really sucks. I am exacting with cooking. I have a deep sense of pride in what I cook. I'm passionate about it. If I could do it all over,  I'd have gone into the CIA. So it feels horrible when I get that doubtful "yeah, right" look after I explain that my wife didn't make something.  I just don't get it. People love celeb chefs like Alton Brown, Robert Irvine, Bobby Flay, and more. So why do so many people on the whole seem to assume that men generally cannot cook?  The crazy thing is, there is an inverse to this. If it is grilled or bbq, the assumption is I'm the one responsible, even though my wife is excellent at grilling.  Has anyone else experienced this? How pervasive are these biases?   I've wanted one for about 2 years. After wrecking yet another candy thermometer and knowing that I have a massive thanksgiving meal to cook on the horizon, I dug deep and placed the order.  I just got the notice from fedex that it was delivered today.  So, anyone else out there have a thermopen? How do you like it? The reviews are all glowing, but I'd love to know more about how well it has worked for you.   Hey everyone. I'm taking advantage of the 1$ galaxy S5's from Best Buy this week to upgrade my wife and I's phones. We are eligible for upgrades as of july of this year, so that isn't a concern.  We currently have 2 lines on an unlimited data plan (the one you can't get anymore). According to best buy, they will just renew the current contract. However when we started stepping through the process online, they say they will just renew the current plan but CONDITIONS MAY APPLY. But no where on the website does it list any kind of conditions, so we haven't pulled the trigger online. We're going to the store tonight instead.  So, does anyone have any idea what those conditions are? Will they force me out of my unlimited data plan as a condition?   Hopefully this is a quick, simple question. What is the effective difference between a traditional cleaver and a straight back cleaver ? I can't tell if the curved blade near the front would be helpful or hurt the my normal usage of a cleaver (hacking up carcasses).   I mean, no front point SHOULD make the second one less likely to be damaged, right?  Examples:  Traditional: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001505OT6  Straight back: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B005CFSMVM    Hey everyone. I would like to try my hand at making a tofu press. I was thinking something simple like this: http://www.amazon.com/EZ-Tofu-Press-Removes-Texture/dp/B007LLGMG2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1416623778 sr=8-1 keywords=tofu+press  What I was wondering about - what would be a good wood for this? End grain like you would use for a butcher block? It's going to be exposed to prolonged periods of pressure against a wet food surface. What kind of finish would work and be safe?   I am lucky enough to be very good friends with the son of one of the founders of Ithaca hours. For those who are not familiar, check out the wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ithaca_Hours  The short version - it is a local currency that had had a very large amount of local buy-in from businesses.  I was thinking - wouldn't this be a great model not just for bitcoin, but also for any crypto in general? If bitcoin could start being evangelized at a local level similar results should be attainable, right? Thoughts?   It seems like a natural fit - all of the usability of a local currency with a high amount of buy-in, PLUS it would be accepted worldwide.   Hey everyone! For a fun little project, I am trying to build a simple little prank circuit comprised of a power supply, a photoresistor, and a piezo buzzer. The idea will be to lay some white tape on the floor, and attach the circuit (in a small project box) to the underside of the chair. This way when the chair rolls over the white line, it makes a buzz.  Now, my question is - how sensitive is a photoresistor? Suppose this circuit is underneath a rolling chair - it will be shading the floor. Is there a better way to detect the white tape?   Basically what the subject says.  This year we stocked up on fresh cheap turkeys thanks to the holiday sales, and I spent the past hour breaking them down (nothing fancy, just removing the wings, removing and splitting the legs and thighs, deboning the thighs, and removing the boneless breasts, bagging the carcasses for stock). The legs will probably get turned into pulled turkey, the thighs are going to get stuffed and wrapped in bacon. The breasts will get brined and smoked in the smoker (I'm considering making turkey pastrami but I'm concerned about it getting dry). The wings got set aside - we're using them to make our thanksgiving stuffing.  That said - the real point of this post is - does anyone else find breaking down an animal really therapeutic? Almost zen-like? I'm entirely self taught, but it feels almost like if you "tune out" your hands just innately know where to go. Maybe tune-out is the wrong way to put it because I'm paying 100% attention, but, hopefully I'm getting my point across.  Obviously I'm not breaking down beef primals yet, but I'd love to give it a go one day.  So, does anyone else feel the same way??   Pretty much the subject.  We get Merrick Grain Free duck for our greyhound, and he seems to enjoy it. Via amazon, we were getting it, with tax, for about $47 a bag. The same bag has gone up $9 over 1 month BEFORE tax. We thought it may have just been Amazon, but it seems like every store has seen an increase.  We started looking through other premium brands and saw that prices seem to be up across the board.  Is this a permanent thing? Is it a temporary shortage of some ingredients...? I love our dog, but his food budget is now larger than my wife and I's food budget.   Pretty much the situation described in the subject. My wife and I are both 30. We are starting to discuss the possibility of trying to have a baby in the next year. I am currently in my open-enrollment period at work, and have the option to sign up for an FSA. We have no major medical expenses, and only currently purchase vitamins and calcium supplements for my wife.  I'm considering signing up for the flexible spending account and putting 10$ out of each paycheck into it for things like prenatal vitamins, but my concern is that at the end of the year, if we aren't successful, that's essentially money we lose.  So, any insights would be very much appreciated.   The subject should sum this up. We're taking advantage of the seasonal prices for 2 fresh turkeys which I'm breaking down into boneless breasts, thighs, and legs to be frozen for future use. The back and rest of the carcass will be boiled down with some chicken carcasses we have frozen for poultry stock.  For the cuts goal will most likely be to thaw and smoke them in the BBQ.  So, is it best to brine before freezing, or brine after freezing the birds?   See the subject. I see tons of the hollowbodies without tremolo for both right and lefty. However the Tim Armstrongs with tremolo only seem to be available for lefties. Is this true, or am I somehow missing the right-handed ones with tremolos?   Pretty much the subject. I'm not used to using mobile wallets. I am using one of the HD wallet addresses, and I'm noticing it changes ~once per week. What concerns me is that I'll send a large amount there right after it changes and I'll end up sending bitcoin into the aether.  So, is this how it's supposed to work? Is it a feature of an HD wallet? Is there something I'm missing? Do the old addresses keep working?  Totally newbie questions I'm sure, but I'd love to get an explanation.   Hey everyone! So, I'm in the market to purchase a new guitar over the next few months. I'd love to do it with bitcoin, even if it means buying a gift card.  I was looking at amazon as a possible route, but they don't set up guitars for you, and I don't want to spend cash to have it done when it arrives.  I saw that amazon sells Guitar Center gift cards, but they're physical cards in $25 or $50 denominations. I would be kinda ludicrous to go into the store with 20 gift cards, you know?  So are there any places like guitarcenter/musician's friend/dave phillips etc that accept bitcoin?   Hey everyone! I was just wondering if anyone had heard anything about the sprint black friday deals this year? I haven't heard anything at all, and usually they'd be published by now.   Hey everyone. I've been a sprint customer since 1999, and have basically just been moving from plan to plan inside sprint. My wife and I are now on the same plan for the past 2-3 years.  2 black fridays ago we picked up 2 galaxy S3's (I only buy new phones on black friday since they got rid of the technology upgrade credits and sprint premier benefits). They're starting to get older and clunkier.  Does anyone know if there are going to be black friday specials this year?? Usually they would have been posted by now.   Hey everyone. I have an idea for a store to sell products for bitcoin. I wanted to start putting it online, but I am not really familiar with e-commerce solutions.  Initially I will be accepting cryptos, but eventually I would like to start accepting fiat as well.  So, how does it work exactly? Do I just set up any old e-commerce solution? Do payment providers act like plugins?  Sorry if these are newbie questions, but I've never done this sort of design before and I'm a little nervous.   Hey everyone! I've been studying classical fingerstyle for the past 6 months, and have really been enjoying it (plus the guys at /r/classicalguitar are really awesome).  Eventually I want to branch into jazz a bit (I still have a lot of learning, but I want to set aside cash so I can get a really nice instrument when I'm ready for it). However, that's where it starts to get a bit fuzzy because I don't know a heck of a lot about steel string guitars.  What would be best to learn on? I mean, Django played on an acoustic. BB King plays on an electric. So, it seems like I've got a ton of options and could really go the acoustic route (which I'm already used to from my classical guitar) OR the electric route (I'd probably be leaning towards a nice semi-hollowbody). Or do I want an acoustic with a resonator? I just don't know!  So, for those who have more experience than me, what would you view as preferable for learning jazz?       Hey everyone. Yet another noobie question :)  So, my wife (a professional music teacher) and my classical guitar teacher both tell me that I should try to avoid practicing much more than 30 minutes at a time. This almost never happens - by the time I am done doing hand exercises and warm ups, 15 minutes has usually already passed and I usually end up spending another 45 minutes on material and I still don't feel like I'm mastering it between lessons.  But both the Parkening and Provost books mention practicing for 3 or more hours a day. This is almost impossible given my schedule, but I do feel like I accomplish way more when I can set aside 2+ hours at a time to just work through the material over and over and over at ever-increasing tempos. Is it better to split that large block into several smaller ones?  What is the better approach? A few minutes a day or hours a day? Which will help the material "stick" more?   Hey everyone. I am looking to buy a PSMO to break down into filets and a chateaubriand roast. As of last night we scored a great deal on a membership to Sam's club off living social (deal may still be going, it's 45$ for the membership, a 20$ gift card, and 4 vouchers for free items - a rotisserie chicken, 2 baguettes, some dip, and some cookies). I figured this was a golden opportunity to break down some loins.  I went to the butcher case and only saw "beef loins." They had a nice heavy layer of fat so i couldn't see whether or not the chain muscle was attached. So, does anyone know if this is a PSMO or not? They were priced around $70-$90 which would seem about the right price range. There wasn't anyone working the butcher area that I could bounce questions off of. I know BJ's used to actually call them PSMOs so I'm a bit lost here.   So, I haven't played Destiny for close to a month. I played through the single player, and ran through each of the strikes. I'm not part of a guild or clan or anything, and due to lack of ability to really communicate meaningfully in game, I couldn't find one in the game. I wasn't looking to have to have 2+ screens open at all time just to play a single game, so I kinda lost interest and stopped playing. So, I just wanted to check in on the status of the game.  First, is there more content, or a better story yet? Or is Rasputin still a seemingly major plot point that is instantly forgotten the instant you leave earth? Does the dude in the Tower now tell you about all of the things he says he COULD tell you about?  Second, is playing the same strikes over and over and over still being masqueraded as content, or have they actually added real beefy content?  Third, have they added any kind of matchmaking to raids to allow players who aren't in clans/guilds to actually have a chance at seeing the content?  Fourth, have they made drop rates any better on blue and better gear so I don't have to run the same strikes/crucible matches 100 times a week to progress in the game?  Fifth, is RNG still as big of a PITA?  Sixth and last - can I finally talk to people for matchmaking? Or do I still have to rely on outside sources like destinylfg for something that should have been included in-game in the first place (based on the feedback received in both alpha and beta)?  Maybe these seem a bit snarky, but they really killed my enjoyment of this game and I'd genuinely like to know if they've been addressed.   Another newbie question - right now I am using my wife's electric piano's built in metronome, but it bottoms out at 40bpm. My snark has a visual metronome, but again it bottoms out at 40bpm. In fact, most of the metronomes I've found seem to bottom out at 40bpm.  For some of the pieces I am having a lot of trouble with, 40bpm is simply still too fast.  So, does anyone have a metronome that goes slower that they'd mind sharing?   Hey everyone. I've been taking lessons for about 2-3 months now, and I feel like I've made real progress. We're following the Christopher Parkening method book, and it seems to be moving at a decent pace (though I will admit when you start getting to pieces like Melancholia I just can't seem to play fast enough for the piece to sound decent, and my hands still don't move around the fretboard and strings fast enough to play the fugue decently).  Anyway, I am still noticing that if I skip back to the first few exercises of the book, I occasionally hit the wrong string or play the wrong note. I feel like I should have those earlier pieces mastered.  Is it just beginner clumsiness? Or should I go back and try to completely master those pieces so they can be played perfectly every time? Is mastery really knowing the piece, or perfect flawless execution? What should I be aiming for as a student - especially on pieces that I've been playing awhile?    Hey everyone. This is hopefully a simple question.  I paid off my car this year, but have continued to "pay my bill" into a savings account. At this point it's about 1500$. The goal is to eventually use thay as a down payment for a new car, or to pay off a new car completely for either my wife or myself.  The savings account earns .75%, not great, not horrible. I'm considering taking that money and putting it into a well diversified portfolio of funds instead.  Is this a good idea? I figure if one of our cars dies, my wife and I have an emergency fund and the ability (even if it sucks) to drive one another to work (i even have the option to telecommute). That contingency should cover us for the time it takes to sell however many shares necessary. My wife's car has about 70k miles on it, mine has about 101000 and we both plan to drive them until they cant be realistically maintained anymore.  Any feedback would be appreciated.      So, interesting question I hope. Does anyone know of any funds which collect companies directly related to the growing/sale of marijuana?  For instance, lots of folks have heard of Medbox and the massive boom they encountered. I can only imagine as more states move towards medicinal marijuana, decriminalization, and full legalization we will see many more business opportunities.  In that same vein - are there any "vice" funds? Funds comprised of companies that cater to mankind's baser urges - condoms, casinos, alcohol, tobacco, etc?   Basically what the title says.  We keep our mortgage money in its own separate account from everything else, and it gets funded from our checking account automatically ever pay period. Thanks to 3 pay months, the account that account has 2 mortgage payments worth of cash in it in addition to the amount that we're paying on the 1st of november (assuming something bad would happen, we would cancel the extra we are paying and just pay the minimums).  I want to keep 1 months payment on hand at all times just in case something weird ever happens with paychecks or whatever.  However, we're a few thousand away from paying off PMI (home cost 194k, we are at around 159k on principal now, pmi should go away at around 151k/78%). We are already paying about 860 towards principal (150 base plus 710 extra), but if we sacrifice that extra month's security we could get PMI to go away even faster - about 2-3 payments faster (a savings of 160-240 or so dollars).  So, what is everyone's thoughts? Sacrifice the security for 2-3 months less of PMI? Or just play it safe?   Hey everyone! When I added my card to circle, it stated that I may get hit with a cash advance fee for using their service.  My cash advance rate on my credit card is astronomical, and I'd really like to avoid that. Is there any easy way to tell if I'll get hit with it or not?   Hey everyone, we are entering fall now in my zone (USDA 6), but I recently received some 5000 seeds for Spilanthes Oleracea (toothache plant) that I really want to begin growing. I know nothing about grow lights.  I'd like to avoid HPS/MV/MH due to fire risk and cost of equipment.  So, can I use CFLs/LEDs for growing these guys? Do I *need* HPS/MV/MH bulbs?  How do I go about figuring out the ratios of time for lights on/lights off? Sadly when I start googling about it, I find lots of information about growing pot, but not much about growing other plants. For a flower like this, I would assume I would start with 24/7 light over the seeds while they germinate, and then some other ratio once they are ready to flower??  Any help would be appreciated, I've never done any indoor growing like this.   Hey everyone. I am trying to find a service that offers a similar service to what sharebuilder used to offer. They used to provide a membership option where you'd pay N dollars a month and get up to X AUTOMATIC trades a month as part of the package. It gave you an excellent discount for folks who wanted automated dollar cost averaging.  However, the plan isnt offered on their website anymore, and I spoke with their support and it has been removed. The new price structure is significantly more expensive (a flat $3.95 per trade).   So, is there any other brokerage that operates the way sharebuilder used to?   Hey everyone. I received a $25 iphone gift card a few days ago. I more or less never use the itunes store, so it doesn't do much for me. BTC however does. Is there any safe market for me to sell the itunes code?   This email was received this morning:  Dear Clients    Regrettably I have to announce the failure and closure of Bitcoin Trader.    While preparing for the final audit results, a task we were working on for weeks now, our bitcoin wallet has been hacked and emptied, just after exchanging our fiat holdings within the exchanges to bitcoin and transferring our entire holdings to our wallet, in order to proof our solvency.    It is a known fact that I personally opposed any proof of solvency, but agreed to conduct it for the sake of a few dozen small and medium investors.    The hacker contacted me shortly after he took advantage of our holdings and demanded a ransom in order to transfer the coins back. I have agreed to a 25% ransom of the entire sum, but havent heard back from him for several days now.    My aim was to create something based on trust, just as bitcoin itself is based on distributed trust. Unfortunately I must admit today, I have failed. All left to do now is to declare bankruptcy with the Panamanian authorities and to hand over all relevant files and information for further investigation.    Sincerely,  John Carley  This same John Carley whose staff has been claiming that he was "lost at sea" for close to a week now.  Let this be a lesson - trust no one. Anyone who says to "trust the earnings" has never been burnt, or is lying to you.    Hey everyone. I am reading through the gift card rules for ebay, and it's kind of dismaying. I was hoping to start selling gift card codes (I'm a reseller with several vendors) via ebay, but it appears you need to have a physical card in hand, can't have more than 1 card selling at a time, etc.  However, does anyone know if I can sell a gift card VOUCHER? Essentially I would purchase the gift card voucher on my end, and when the customer purchases the gift card voucher, I would mail a print out of the voucher to them with tracking information.  Is this a violation of the rules? For the life of me I can't seem to get feedback from ebay about this.   Hey folks. I am trying to start getting my tax info ready for 2014 for mining.  I had done a bit of mining using multipool, so I have a large number of transactions for small coins; stuff like TIPS, DGC, etc.  How can I figure out the value of those coins on the day they were mined? For many, there is no direct USD price history.  For instance, I looked at the chart at the bottom of this link: http://myip.ms/view/market_coins/147/TIPS_LTC.html  An example - on feb 5th 2014, it says that at that time, 1 TIPS sold for an average of 0.00000051 LTC. Does that mean the value of LTC at the time? Or does it mean the value of LTC now?  At the time 1 LTC was 21.149991995 dollars USD: http://www.cryptocoincharts.info/pair/ltc/usd/crypto-trade/1-year  So is the math: 21.149991995 * 0.00000051 * N where N is the number of TIPS?  Or do I need to use the current value of LTC in USD?  Any advice would be appreciated.  I'm trying to make my taxes honest this year as my mining operation starts getting larger and larger.   Hey everyone. I am looking to start purchasing larger quantities of gift cards with the intention of reselling. My big issue right now is sourcing. Given most of my selling avenues will take a bite out of my margin, I can't seem to find a good source that can absorb the cost of overhead and still leave meat on the bone for me.  Amazon offers an API to generate codes, but there is a minimum of $50,000 a year, which is going to be darn near impossible. This means I have to buy varieties of them in orders of $5k or more. Still too much for me to start with :(  When I google for it, I get a TON of seo-optimized zero information websites made to play the googlebot, so I'm unable to find real leads.  How does one get started in this industry? Do you have to start reaching out to the retailers directly? Do they offer APIs to purchase gift cards on the fly?   Hey everyone. Last week, bitcoin-trader.biz issued a statement that the audit that their users had paid for was not going to be released because they felt it was "unsatisfactory." A number of users became very concerned about this, especially considering that the users themselves had paid for the audit to be conducted.  As of this afternoon when payouts were scheduled to begin, BT issued this statement on their facebook page:  Due to technical issues with the key server, which occurred during the processing of cashout requests not all pending bitcoin cashout requests could be processed. We have contacted our sys admin to look into the issue and will resume bitcoin cashout requests as soon as possible. About 200 or so bitcoin requests accumulated during the weekend had been processed, as well as all the other payment systems, Litecoin and Ripple.  BT supposedly deals in USD. A number of users waited until bitcoin bottomed out over the weekend before requesting their payout, locking in the amount of BTC. However, given the increase, some users now are owed BTC that is up to 25% more valuable. So, for instance, if someone requested a cash out of $260 over the weekend when it was valued at .92BTC, that amount of BTC was locked in. Payments aren't processed until monday - and that .92BTC is now valued at $330+ USD, but BT owes the locked in amount of BTC.  If several hundred users did this, it could spell major financial trouble for the site.   Wheeeeeee!  Who else is enjoying the firesale? Who else is picking up tons of cheap bitcoin?  I've got cash set aside and am buying a little every day for the next few weeks until things stablize to let dollar cost averaging do its work.  The way I see it, all those underground markets that we try to distance ourselves from? They still use bitcoin. Those companies that started up built entirely around bitcoin? They still use it. It has utility. Utility equates to demand.  There is a limited supply of bitcoin.  Limited supply + some amount of demand = a market price.  So, the market may crash, but bitcoin isn't going anywhere. I'm just hanging on and enjoying the chance to lower my cost basis.   Hey everyone! I work for a large, fortune 500 company. I am submitting the idea for us to add bitcoin as a payment option for our customers (no promises, we just have an internal "ideas" portal). However as part of it, I need to have some realistic information.  Right now, the best options for a payment portal would be coinbase, paypal and circle. Bitcoin *would* automatically be converted to fiat. Does anyone have any idea what the fees are for the automatic conversion to fiat? I know credit processing runs anywhere from 2-5% depending on the processor.  Also, does anyone know what percentage of purchases bitcoin payments make up for some of the big names out there (newegg, overstock)?  As a benefit, there's no way for a chargeback to occur, which is a great selling point too.  Any other selling points? I'd like to think that as a vendor, any way we can help a customer to give us their money is a good thing :)         Hey everyone. We picked this up for my wife, and she has a good 6-8 hours of playtime in it. The issue is, she was playing under my account. She wanted to transfer it back under her account so I could play as well.  If we attempt to copy the save from my account to hers, it gives an error saying that the save appears to be from another user.  Is there any way to fix this?      Hey everyone. Christmas time is coming, and I'd like to get the wife the matching pearl bracelet to go with the necklace I got her last year. The one downside is, bluenile doesn't seem to accept bitcoin which sucks. I've always been a fan of them because A) their documentation rocks, B) their support rocks, C) they specialize in a lot of simple, elegant designs which my wife loves.  I see lots of gift certs available for zales and other companies, but nothing for bluenile. So, any ideas?   Hey everyone! I'm just curious - what made you focus on classical guitar?  For me, I can point to two things in particular.... these guys:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PT9hvyDvKHA  And this piece:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPiatDf3Rxs  More flamenco/nuevo flamenco than classical obviously, but through a lucky combination of lack of knowledge and eagerness to get started I ended up going the classical route to get started. I just have never quite shifted over to flamenco (my hands are still kind of clumsy).  So how about you? What kicked it off for you?   Just tried the moon strike 4 times in a row. Each time, got to Phogoth. Each time, had at least 1 person quit after we wiped. Each time, ended up being the last person left. Seriously feeling completely unsuccessful because other people suck.  Seriously, if you join up for a strike, quitting the first time you die is just lame. Stick through it.       This may be long. Sorry.  I am a successful 30yo male engineer. I've lived on my own since I was 16 - my parents and I get along ok so long as we aren't under the same roof.   I'll come out and say it - I'm smarter than them. Or, at the very least I research my decisions before making them and back them up with said research. I was a straight A student. Racked up tons of community service, was active in a church youth group. I led several student groups. I won congressional good citizenship awards. I was never in trouble. I just asked questions and wanted good answers.  So, when I lived with them, I would point out things that didn't make sense. that maybe a gigantic steak with mashed potatoes, a big helping of cake, and soda wasn't always the best dietary decision for each person. I am the only person in the family without diabetes now. I would point out that if they have to take a 3rd mortgage out on their home, maybe giving 500 dollars to charity isn't the wisest choice. They are almost 70 and still about 80k in debt, whereas I have all of my loans paid off save for a mortgage and one private student loan (in total, less than 2 years salary for me). I'd point out that if their church is pressuring them to fork over mortgage money, maybe it's time for a new church. They'd take me wanting to make myself a healthy soup for dinner instead of having the same calorie-ladened food as them and I'd get screamed at for hours as "unappreciative." By the time I graduated high school I weighed nearly 350 pounds ("you don't get up from this table until you've cleaned that plate!").  I'm doing well, not because of them, but in spite of them. I know this sounds arrogant, and maybe it is. But so far everything we've had it out on when I was a teenager has worked out well.  Back then though, any time I'd point out logical flaws or fallacies, or try to improve things for myself, they took it as me being "ungrateful." So, to "teach me a lesson" they decided to send me to a family friend for some "tough love" for a summer. I never went back home.   The first week was great. He had been someone I looked up to. He was a decorated retired soldier that I thought would understand that my parents are a bit off kilter and prone to making bad decisions and hyperbole. We talked about it a lot the first week. He actively asked me about the issues I was having at home.  Then one night while I am sleeping, I get slapped. It was him with a steel baseball bat, standing over me. He told me I was his for the summer, and he was going to teach me how good I had it "back home." So began a summer of physical, emotional, and mental abuse. He'd force me to work outside for hours with no sunscreen ("what are you, a little bitch? Man up, you dont need sunscreen.") which led to my shoulders blistering, cracking, bleeding. I still have those physical scars. That put me in the hospital for heat stroke. He beat me several times for whatever perceived slight he could conjure up. He said he had people spying on me, and claimed I destroyed his pool by pouring bleach into it because "one of his spies saw it." (I had had 2 people over that night and we were inside the whole time, so no, it was not me who touched his pool). I got a summer job and begged to stay there for extra hours, but when I got a paycheck he threatened to beat me if I didn't sign it over to him. He refused to feed me, and said I had to pay for my own food. I lost nearly 40 pounds that summer from stress and lack of food. The only things I ate were free food at my workplace (a pretzel place in a walmart that had an "employees can help themselves" policy - i literally lived on pretzel dogs and pretzels for the summer). I begged my parents to take me home but they were the ones who put me there. He busted my nose. My parents kept telling me "it's not that bad. You WANTED a vacation from home, right?"  But the worst was one night after a day of work, I came home and he forced me to sit down next to him on the couch. He turned on a porno. I have no idea if this was genuine or if it was just more mental abuse. He started talking about how when he was in the military he participated in an orgy and it was the most sexually thrilling moment of his life. He hands me some tissues and tells me to jerk off for him. I say no, that I'm uncomfortable. He keeps saying it's ok, if I jerk off he will too, I keep saying no, no, no. He keeps pressuring me. He starts throwing tissues at me and telling me to whip it out. I get up and run out of the house and sprint as fast as I can down the nearby highway.   Police are called and pick me up, I tell them I want to go home. Police listen to my parents, and take me back to abuser's house "because they want to teach me a lesson and scare me straight." He proceeds to beat the shit out of me, threatens me with the bat that he'll bash my skull in if I ever try that again, etc.  Finally summer ends, and my parents take me back home. I contact my best friend and move out immediately. I leave everything behind. I just want out of my parents house. I sever all ties with the abuser. He severs ties with my family for the most part. I am on poor terms with my family, I see them maybe 1 day a year.  I never talked to them about everything that happened other than the fact that when I needed them, they weren't there for me and refused to help me or believe me. They keep saying it was for my own good.  Fast forward to a year ago. I get a message from the abuser in facebook. I ignore it. I get another, and I ignore it. I get a friend request. I deny it. I get another. I ignore it. Then I get a call from my mom asking me why I won't talk to the abuser.  It turns out that my parents, who are both very sick (mom in a wheelchair, dad in and out of the hospital) have been getting tons of help from the abuser for free. He put a roof on their house. He repaired their sidewalks, etc. They view him as a son. I like that they're getting free things out of the asshole. So long as I don't have to see or hear from him or hear ABOUT him, I'm content.  I tell her to stop trying to force it. I don't want to talk to him. I don't want to see him. My mom keeps trying to set up days for me to come over to the house when he just so happens to be there. I turn around, grab my wife, get in my car, and drive away.  Finally I told the abuser point blank that I have no desire to ever speak to him. To leave me alone. Stay the hell out of my life.  Yesterday my wife had to drop by my parent's house to grab a phone charger for my dad who was rushed to the hospital a few days ago. While there, my mom tells my wife that they my father had asked the abuser to "give me a rough summer to see how good I had it at home." my dad wants to talk to me about it. I don't want to talk about it.  I don't want to destroy the guys life. He had it rough (mom shot herself with a shotgun, dad was an abusive alcoholic and ultimately killed himself). He has kids. He does help my parents. I am content to have no contact with him. My parents just won't drop it. Maybe the jerkoff thing was some fucked up mind game. I'm not broken, I've done very well for myself. I'm paranoid of people and an introvert, but I've always been that way.  It's when he reaches out to me and pushes the issue, then I want blood. I also am concerned about my nephews who live with my parents. What if it wasn't a mind game? Maybe he'll try the same thing with my nephews? Would my parents even believe me if I said something? They have a very strong penchant for denial about bad things in their life.  And now here I am. Asking you all for your advice. I want this person out of my life. He so far has respected my wishes to leave me the hell alone, but he bitches to my parents and they pressure me to talk to him. I just want it to go away.  I just don't know what to do. The only people who know the whole story are my wife, a very close friend who was also the victim of abuse, and now all of you.   https://blockchain.info/tx/2947c4b2134aaf0fcd110638b724c0c17313772bacc89a0aad1b71dff332b9db  It's been showing in my coinbase account for hours now. 0 confirmations. I'm trying to understand what I'm seeing - it looks like scores of addresses each getting a small transaction with btcsmart listed as the source address? Is it basically bitcoin spam?   Did they get my address somehow?   Hey everyone. My wife and I are planning to have a child in the next 18-24 months, but we were thinking we could jump start an educational account now by putting 50-100$ of every paycheck in ahead of time to maximize growth. It's not much, but that 2400-4800$ will grow over 18 years or so.  The account that seems to come up the most often is a 529. When we would create the 529, do we have to name the beneficiary? Since this is a kid that doesn't yet exist, that would be hard for us to do.  Are there any other types of account that would give beneficial tax treatment for this kind of savings?  Also, what are the caveats if said child would ultimately choose not to seek secondary education? Say, if they decided to go entrepreneurial, or if they went to a tech school?  Any advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you!!  Edit: Found some old threads. I've already maxed out the 401k up to the point where my employer stops matching, and I'm contributing an additional 1% to a roth 401k. My wife is a teacher and should get some kind of pension, in addition she contributes to a 403b. She just got her masters, and will be significantly upping her contribution.   Hey everyone. Apologies if this has been asked before, a quick search didn't show me anything.  I've been looking at zenportal all day today, and I keep seeing a pink "progress bar" saying that payouts are in progress. They've been in progress since about 9am EST. Is this normal...? From what I was reading payouts are usually handled by 10am CST? I picked up my first hashlets yesterday and today.   Hey everyone. I'm struggling to find reasons to keep playing destiny. As it stands for me, it's lonely and kind of dull. I picked it up for the coop.  I just got my first PS3 about 2 weeks ago. It's the first console I've owned since I had a sega genesis decades ago. Most of my friends have moved on to a newer gen, so playing with them isn't an option. I'm also not a young guy with a ton of friends who are gamers, so my friend list is empty.  I hear folks saying they get tons of invites - after about 20 hours of gameplay, I've gotten a total of 1 and have never interacted with the person. It's also kind of clunky to see someone in a pvp match, hit R3 to select them, then open a menu, send an invite, only to find out that in that time I've been killed and the selection isn't there anymore. So, after awhile I just stopped bothering.  So, I see folks suggesting clans. Well, how does that work exactly? Do I join the clan, and then manually add every single person to the clan to my friend list? Do I have to keep maintaining that? Is there any way to automatically sync it with the game? Do I need to have a PC with teamspeak/rogerwilco nearby?  Seeing folks in game and not being able to really interact with them is just killing this game for me. I'm feeling like I wasted 90$ to socialize with people and am being limited to jumping and dancing, which is really disappointing to me.   I havent really been silent about how much I dislike the refusal to allow much, if any, interactivity between players. I know golks try to justify it by saying that everyone ELSE is an annoying 12 year old, or whatever.  I think what really bothers me is the fact that their ads show people talking to one another. They dont show the players dancing or jumping to communicate - theyre talking. Social interaction was advertised. But it isn't there unless you start adding a bunch of random people to your friend list.   Hey everyone. I personally have a sizable stake in a closed end fund. It has incredible results, and has for over a decade. I understand their strategy, their financials are good. By all normal investing standards, they would be a great place to invest.  Yet every time I see them mentioned, there are huge cautions that they are a closed end fund and you should understand closed end funds before getting involved. I DO understand closed end funds, and honestly, I don't quite get the concern about them vs a traditional mutual fund.   I get that there are a set number of shares in existence and that will not change, and their price is determined by the market value of the fund shares themselves, as opposed to the value of the component stocks behind the fund. But why the constant warnings for additional caution and scrutiny everywhere? It seems like a pretty easy thing to understand, and I can't quite put my finger on the reason for all of the warnings. It doesn't seem any more dangerous than any other investment vehicle.  Any thoughts?   Hey everyone. I snagged the list of compromised "gmail accounts" from this site after seeing some of the news stories: https://forum.btcsec.com/index.php?/topic/9426-gmail-meniai-parol/page-3  Happily, none of my accounts are listed. Sadly though, my wife's account is.  Is there any way I can find out what password it was that was listed with it? We probably only need 2 or 3 characters to figure it out from there. Luckily she usually uses complicated passwords, and different ones at every site. It may provide a clue as to what site the compromise came from.  I know there had been an online checking tool that would list the first 2-3 characters, but it has since been stripped out of most of the articles I have found.  Any help would really be apppreciated.   This is something that has been bothering me since last night. Given the lack of communication abilities, would you notice if 99% of the other players in the game were bots? How do you know they aren't bots?  I'm just thinking of Guild Wars 2, where in the early levels, you'd see the exact same bots "playing" at the same time as you. The same names, the same race as you, often even the same class. The first few playthroughs it gave the illusion of having lots of people playing, however eventually you started to notice the exact same player every single time and the illusion got shattered. They were playing beside you, but it was obvious that it was a trick.   Since bungie seems dead set on not letting players communicate, I propose reviving morse code. In game, you can use your gun and simply shoot.   For example, need help? SOS! 3 shots in rapid succession, 3 shots with long pauses between them, and then finally 3 shots in rapid succession.  OR we could do a single jump for a dot, and a double jump for a dash.  OR we could spam eachother with fireteam invites in rapid succession, but that would require the other player to decline the invites.    OR... well... bungie could just let players talk to each other. But that's just crazy talk.   About 2 hours ago I got to sit down and finally play Destiny for a bit. I've had it since this morning, but with work, dinner, helping the wife etc I haven't had a chance to play. These are the scattered thoughts I have about the experience. I'm not a fanboy. I didn't play beta, alpha. I'm also not negative about the game. I do think there are a lot of places this could be brushed up, and Bungie should really know better.  So, let's start with the install. This went super easy. I'm using RCN 50mbps down service, so there's very little that doesn't scream when it comes to downloading. This was no exception. The full download and install took about an hour (the install taking the lion's share of that on my PS3).  Next, I registered my Sparrow code (I preordered the DGE via Gamestop for the uncommon Sparrow). Again, no issues at all. This part, for me, went painlessly. I've seen tons of issues on reddit though, so it looks like a bunch of folks got unlucky, which sucks.  I logged into the bungie site and registered the full list of codes, nothing gave me any problems.  So, game launch! Almost immediately I encountered an error. I've posted about it on here, and over on the bungie forums with no real suggestions. When the brightness setting comes up, it says to make it so the logo to the left is barely visible. The problem is, the logo is never visible. Like, it simply isn't there. When you go into options and bring it up, you see the logo briefly, but then the entire background goes black (Here's a snapshot: http://imgur.com/QZw9WAa) No idea how to fix it. Some folks have suggested my TV, but it's a very high end 51" Samsung plasma that supports every video option from the PS3. Some folks have suggested to change the color settings - no, this has been professionally calibrated. I'm not changing it for one game. No other game has issues. My post on the bungie support site has been ignored. -1 for a bad first impression, even if it doesn't seem to impact gameplay. I went so far as to eventually try a full uninstall and reinstall because my new 95$ toy seems to have been partly broken on arrival. Bungie seems to have no real support on their website either - just a forum where if you ask a difficult question, you basically never get a response. In fact, the vast majority of questions on their help forum have gone unanswered. That's troubling. I get it, it's opening day, they're focused on triage. But seriously, not even a "open a support request" page?  So, that aside, I went ahead and created a character, specifically a human male titan. One of the things I kept hearing about this was how in depth the character creation was. I was actually kind of disappointed here - it was nowhere near as limitless as it was hyped to be. Choose your race, your gender, your skin color, your lip color, your eye color, your hairstyle and color, and if you want any facial markings or scars. But if you're human, you can't get cool markings. If you're one of the awoken, you don't get to have scars. It seems artificially limiting - especially when folks have been talking up how deep it went. I was expecting Skyrim type customization where you can control everything down to facial geometry. Still, i was able to put together a fairly dude-ly toon and I kicked it off.  The opening video has some interesting stylistic choices. There's lots of screen jumping and color palette flickering that goes on, to the point where I actually thought it was a bug or problem with the video file (you can see what I mean here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN9nWByWQD4). Or, I thought it was going to suddenly pull back and turn out to be a monitor someone else was watching. Having watched it 2-3 times now, I get that there are little text blurbs saying "video feed," so it's supposed to look grainy and jumpy. But the first time through, it still felt like the style didn't jive with what they wanted. Still, it got the point across. There's a big snowball floating over mars that makes it rain.  The opening cutscene was flipping gorgeous even on the PS3. I can only imagine on current gen systems. The HDR effects are wicked. Suddenly I'm whisked into existence, and the game starts. I get told to run by a little floating snowball-eye-beholder-dude because some robot lizard men are apparently after me. Except, they're not. I just stand there and they never come. The snowball-eye-beholder-dude starts yelling at me that i'll die, so I stand there to spite him and prove him wrong. I don't die. I get that it's supposed to get me inside, but wouldn't it have been better to have something actually chasing me? Something to make me have a reason to use the sprint button it's telling me about?  So, I played through the first level, the tower, and then the second level from that point on. It played like a normal console FPS. Except I see people around me. But I can't really do anything with them. I can kind of jump towards them a bit? I can't say hey. I can't say "hey dudebro, let's go kick this big mechasaurus dude's ass." I can't say "I need some help, got a sec." I can't say "hey fuckface, I was killing that mechasaurus, beat it." Other people are just NPCs, except you can't interact with them like you can the NPCs (which isn't asking a lot - I'll get to that later).  Everything is super pretty. So much so, that I kind of wish they'd fleshed out other portions of the game a bit more instead of being so graphics focused. I came from the Zork generation, so anything more than text on a screen is decent by my standards.  The voice acting seems kind of meh at this point. For all of the production value, I would have expected something better than what I'm hearing so far. Maybe I'm still dealing with generic low level characters, but still, nothing. What bothers me more is that there's no real dialog with the NPCs. They have one tagline they mention when you approach them, and then when you leave. What should be dialog is instead just a series of menus with a quip at either end. There's no discussing the impending doom of everyone, there's no talking about how good it is to be alive. Hell, I can't even ask the little floating snowball-eye-beholder-dude why the hell he raised me from the dead. It seems like they created a world ripe for interactivity, in which there is basically no interactivity at all. Hell, so far as I've found, I can't even sell crap I don't need to vendors. I guess that would be just too darn interactive! Instead I have to dismantle items instead, so yet again, a chance to interact with SOMETHING is dropped.  At the end of the second mission, some dude in a mask comes out and tells me about the doom facing us all, and I was excited - finally a chance to ask questions! But nope, dropped back in the tower.  So, I switch my gear around, only to find that literally every single piece looks the same. To the point where I honestly can't tell whether or not I've switched anything.  At this point, I have to be honest, my feelings are mixed. It feels like a shooting gallery. You go out shooting, you go back to the tower/lobby. Maybe some other people visit the shooting gallery at the same time as you, maybe they don't. You don't have any control over it, and you can't say hi even if you want. You can try to talk to the vendors and people around the shooting gallery, but they're just shills who say "go shoot more in the shooting gallery!"  I'll play through to the end, but thus far I wish I could say I'm more impressed. But I can't. There are so many good things here, but there are so many missed opportunities it hurts. It also feels like the game has no idea what it wants to be.  So, does this ever get more interactive? Does the voice acting improve? I'm guessing the story improves, but am I basically just going to be shown a movie/cutscene, shoot, watch a movie/cutscene, shoot, ad nauseum? Let me know.    When you go to help.bungie.net it gives you the option to search for your issue, or it points you to the support forum. I've had a post on there for several hours now with not a single response. I'd like to at least get some kind of acknowledgement that someone has seen my issue.  Is there any way to actually get real support?   Hey everyone. Woke up and installed this AM. I briefly hopped on just to take a look (working today so I won't get to really play until tonight). One of the first screens the game shows you is the brightness setting.  The text goes something like this: "adjust the brightness until you can just barely see the symbol on the left."  The problem is, there's no symbol on the left. The only thing that changes with the brightness is the background behind the dialog area. I've tried every brightness setting - no symbol. So, I went by the background.  Is this a typo or is something weird?    I also noticed that during the opening FMV with the astronauts, there were a bunch of weird color shifts that would occasionally pop up. Once I got into the game everything seemed just fine though.  Not sure if my install is just bonkers or what.   Hey everyone. I work for a large telecom company doing research and development work. It's a rock solid job, and for the most part I like the work. But, I just got headhunted by a recruiter for a startup.  This would be a significant wage increase, plus it would shorten my commute from 5 hours a day 3+ times a week to about a half hour daily. No idea about benefits yet. As it stands, I'll be talking to the recruiter tomorrow to find out more, completely noncommittal. I've done some snooping around and I *think* I know who their client is, and if my suspicions are correct, it could turn out to be a pretty cool opportunity.  However, I know my current employer tends to make counteroffers when one of their R D guys splits ways. So, how does that usually happen? Do I go through the interview process at the new place and then tell my manager "oh yeah, btw I'm leaving, make me a counteroffer now if you want?" with a resignation letter?  Do you tell the manager that a recruiter contacted you ahead of time, but act noncommittal?  I'm just trying to figure this out because I've never left such a good job before at such a stable company.        Hey everyone.   I've been looking at the possibility of picking up an adapter to attach a keyboard/mouse to my ps3 because there are a FEW FPS's I'd like to play. I've always been a PC gamer, and one of the biggest problems is that FPS's feel so clunky to me on a controller. I feel like I can't aim. The analog acceleration throws things off. As someone who has literally played FPS's for more than 20 years, it's hard to feel comfortable.  I was looking at the eagle eye adapter, but what I'm reading basically says that it just translates mouse movement into analog stick movement, so it doesn't really get me closer to my goal of having a natural feeling mouse.  Now, most of the reviews I'm finding are from 4+ years ago. So, has this ever changed? Is there a mouse/keyboard driver available for PS3? Maybe they've added the bluetooth keyboard/mouse profiles to the OS's bluetooth stack?  I don't have high hopes, but I'd love to find out.   Hey everyone. I am kind of torn - I've decided to pre-order, but I'm not sure about what edition to get. I'm leaning towards getting the digital guardian edition code from gamestop so not only do I get all of the guardian edition bonuses, but I also get the sparrow upgrade.  However, what has me torn is the fact that I'm not sure how much I like the idea of a download vs a physical disk. With a physical disk, if I end up not liking it I can always take it back to the store, right? With the digital edition, I'm more or less stuck with it. No refunds, no store credit.  I'll be getting this for a PS3, so if I DO end up liking it, if I've bought the physical copy I can take it to the store, get trade in credit, and use that to buy the PS4 version, right?  Or is this going to be like MMOs, where even a physical copy only matters for the first buyer - you can't resell them because they're bound to a license key that is non-transferrable?  Anyone have any ideas?  Do you think the extra bonuses from the digital guardian edition (the ship, the new version of ghost, and the upgraded sparrow) are worth the lack of flexibility? Just interested to get some feedback from people.         So, I just got a PS3 this morning (well, actually yesterday, but it took 4 preowned PS3's from gamestop before I got one that worked properly). I picked up a 50$ PSN gift card too, with the intention of taking advantage of the Sly Cooper and God of War collection flash sales this weekend.  Well, thanks to douchey mcdouchebag, I can't get into my PSN account to buy them.   When stuff like this happens, do the flash sales get extended to make up for the lost time? Or am I more or less boned?      Hey everyone! The title pretty much says it all. I am trying to find somewhere to buy PSN/PS gold gift cards with bitcoin. Every place I find with google has a big SOLD OUT sign over all of their offerings. Any ideas would be super helpful, thanks!   Hey everyone, I need help. 2 years ago I picked up a pair of galaxy s3's for my wife and I. She had had an old nokia POS that she never bothered to answer because she always had it on silent. It was an endless source of frustration.  As part of getting the new phones (doubling our monthly plan's cost), I made her promise to keep the sound on on her phone. In my view, we usually call each other when we need something ASAP, so the phone is like an emergency device. Her reason is she doesnt like to have a ringer in public places or at work, and she cant hear or feel vibrate, so it can take hours of calling over and over to get through for her. Not very good when it's an emergency, right?  This morning it took close to 2 hours to get in touch with her, during an emergency where I was stranded on the side of the road. It ended up leading to a loss of money, and a huge argument. I want this resolved. So, is there any way, or any app that will automatically raise the volume/enable the ringer for a particular set of callers? That way she can keep her phone silent as she likes, but she can still have a ringer go off when I or her family call her.  I've heard folks say locale can do it, but they have no demo and I haven't gotten a response from emailing them. The app is 10$, so it's a steep jump to have it not turn out to do what we need.  Another suggestion I got was WhoIsIt, but that only seems to let me assign different ringtones to people. It doesn't enable sound when the phone is set to silent/vibrate.  Any advice would be really appreciated.      Luckily I am working from home today, and my wife has off from work. She went out to the garden and found the most adorable little girl poking around.  We've brought her inside, given her something to eat, and are now going through the motions of trying to get her checked for a microchip and calling the police. Does anyone know of a decent sub to post info on found dogs? The only one I could find was /r/lostdog which has a total of 1 post on it, so that didn't seem too helpful.  Does anyone have any idea of the breed? I'm not too good with small dogs. Here are two photos:  She weighs about 10 lbs.  Face: http://i.imgur.com/8fkeqmJ.jpg  Body: http://i.imgur.com/W3r2KfC.jpg   UPDATE: Super timely - the wife just got back from the vet, she was microchipped, and we've gotten in touch with the owners. Thank you guys!!   http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/20/us/ferguson-column-police-reaction/index.html  I'd really appreciate some feedback here. How many of you agree with this opinion?  "Don't challenge an officer" - so, how can I ask if I'm being detained? Isn't THAT challenging an officer? What about asking to see a badge number? Isn't THAT challenging an officer? So, what rights do we really have? Saying I don't consent to any searches, isn't THAT challenging an officer? So, using ANY of our constitutional rights requires us risking being attacked?  The officer states that if the officer you are dealing with is violating your civil rights, we're supposed to file a complaint later on. But let's see what happens when people try to do that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8v7lF5ttlQ  Are police officers aware of how this looks to the public? Do what we say, or we will hurt/kill you, and if you try to complain, we'll hurt/kill you then? I'm just incredulous by this attitude.   I am trying to gauge interest. Do you like coffee? Would you buy doge coffee? How much would you buy a month of coffee beans (1 12oz bag? 2 12oz bags? 4? 8? 12? 100??)  I am working to start a small artisinal coffee roasting business. Beans will all be of the highest quality, single origin, and roasted to order. We will grind them if requested.  I've got some administrative things that need to be handled, some equipment to buy, and we also have to find a certified kitchen that doesn't charge ridiculous amounts of cash and doesn't mind getting flooded with smoke, so this won't happen immediately. But I'd love to help support the community!   Hey everyone. First, this post is largely copied from the same post over in /r/smallbusiness. I hope that's ok - I couldn't find anything in the rules that discouraged duplicates and because there's no links allowed, I couldn't crosspost. Mods, if that's a problem let me know and I'll delete this (or at least retype it, haha). I have added some additional details.  I am looking into starting a small artisinal coffee roasting business, operating largely online and locally. I'll be starting small because of the larger startup costs of industrial roasting equipment. I also don't have access to a certified kitchen - we can't get our personal kitchen certified because we have a dog and cat, and I'm hesitant to rent space because I doubt I can make it profitable with the additional overhead, plus, there's another reason below.  From a business perspective I believe I am in a good position to pursue this. I am on the board of directors for a local food cooperative, and as such am networked with several hundred local "foodies" who would love the chance to support a local coffee roasting business. I'm also networked indirectly with several thousand more throughout our state. I've been doing the simplest market research possible - just asking people in the community if they'd purchase coffee, and about how much coffee a month they'd purchase. Results have been positive across the board, which is encouraging.  I can find plenty of information about certified kitchens and regulations on food prep. However, I can't seem to find any information about what applies when you are preparing food outdoors. Roasting creates a lot of smoke, so currently when I roast it is done outside. This is another reason I'd be worried about renting space. If I am just going to roast outside (until I am doing enough volume to warrant an actual work space, industrial equipment, and proper ventilation), why would I want to rent a commercial kitchen?  I know at fairs you see people making and selling food with grills and friers, but nothing is 'up to par' with what you'd see in a certified kitchen. I also see the occasional "pop up" bbq place selling ribs and brisket outside gas stations. So, does outdoor food prep have regulations? Are they different? Are they relaxed? I know in several states the handling and roasting of coffee beans is exempt from requiring a ServSafe food manager.  Not sure if this is the right sub, but if someone could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate any advice. I've written to the state dept of agriculture but haven't gotten any response.  This is in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, USA.   Hey everyone. I am looking into starting a small artisinal coffee roasting business.

This is in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, USA.      Seriously - in the past 3 years, I have lost entire crops to vine borers twice. We have an organic garden, and only use neem. We have been wrapping stems of our squash with nylons, and spraying 1-2x a week with neem (more if it rains). This week we lost our yellow squash, our cucumbers, and our zucchini. Somehow the little bastards still get in.  So, since we are at mid august, I am considering planting my pumpkins. We've pulled up all of the dead squash, cucumbers, zucchini, and I plan to plant in the same places. I'll be giving the soil a good soaking with neem, turn it a bit with a cultivator and a hoe. I'm HOPING we are past the time when vine borers hatch since they usually do that near the end of july/early august. The infested plants have been burnt to keep the eggs out of my compost and to make sure the larvae never make it to adulthood.  Is it too foolhardy to plant pumpkins in the same spot? Should I just give up on pumpkins for the year?  I can deal with losing the squash and cucumbers because they produce so well early on in the season. But for some reason I get emotionally devastated when I lose pumpkin crops. It breaks my heart to see hundreds of beautiful pumpkins get reduced to rotting piles of mush over the course of 2-3 days.  I've found a lack of really decent options for dealing with vine borers outside of nematodes, but companion planting radishes can screw them (nematodes) up so I feel like my hands are a little tied.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.         ...because there are literally 2-3 wedding "congratulations" cards that are appropriate in any card store we visit. And they all suck.  My wife and I have 2 dear friends who, despite being together for 20 years, have been unable to be married in Pennsylvania. Well, thanks to our courageous attorney general, we finally have marriage equality! Which is awesome, and, our dear friends, as of yesterday, have tied the knot!  So, this brings me to the problem. We stopped in hallmark first, only to discover that half of the cards in the entire wedding section referred to "his and hers" "she and him" "husband and wife" "man and wife" "mr and mrs" or something else based on traditional marriage. Then, the rest of the cards usually had pictures of wedding cakes, with a topper of a man and a woman, or silhouettes of a man and woman, etc. The few that didn't fall in that group were either "to the grooms" or "mr and mr", but they all were meant for brand new couples. The interior messages saying things like, "Congratulations on your new journey!" which would be great, except they've been living together for well over 20 years.  So, on to papyrus.  SAME DAMN THING. Seriously, check out their website: http://www.papyrusonline.com/greeting-cards/wedding-cards/same-sex-wedding-cards.html  Those are just the explicitly "same sex" cards, but the rest of their wedding cards nearly all have some other sort of problem with them.  We finally found a card wishing them congratulations on their marriage, and telling them to have a fantastic life together. It's simple, sweet, and gets the point across.   But seriously? That was frustrating! What's worse is that they're pretty popular guys, and I am pretty damn sure that someone else out of their scores of friends is going to get them the same damn card! I mean, they really have like 8 total to choose from.  On the upside, the store clerk in Papyrus came out to us when we told him what we were looking for, and we ended up talking and laughing for about a half hour about the absurdity of the lack of cards for same-sex marriage.  So, someone needs to start a business, pronto. I'm delivering the business idea to you here. Go for it! Make some millions!   Hey everyone! I am currently a product development/R D engineer for a fortune 500 company. I am not formally trained in engineering - I began my college career with a dual major in computer science and psychology, and at all times had to maintain at least 1-2 jobs (at least 1 tech job at all times) because of financial responsibilities. As the comp sci class demands got larger (80+ hours in the lab a week), I couldn't find a way to get the two schedules to work, so I eventually switched to a pure psychology degree because I could maintain my jobs and pay my bills while still maintaining good grades.  My penchant for working in the tech sector the whole time I went to school gave me years of experience, which put me over my peers when it came to job hunt. I found a full time job while I was in my senior year, and after spending 6 years there gathering technical certs, I left, joined the fortune 500 telecom, and here I am 5 years later.  The problem is, I'm starting to hit a point where the lack of formal engineering training is handicapping me. Some of the higher job tiers have education requirements I can't meet, so I can't progress. There are times when some of the decomposition and project management skills I never developed are hamstringing me. I feel like an engineering focused degree would be helpful.   But then, I have bouts of time where I feel like I can't stand technical work, like I'm burnt out - I've always stuck with it because it comes naturally to me and it pays well - not so much because I want it to be my career. I have looked into starting a small food business, but that would still be years away because I would need to be financially stable and have my student loans paid off first.  So, I am now looking at the possibility of pursuing a master's degree. I'm looking to shift towards management, because I think it complements my psychology degree, and my technical acumen will work well in an engineering environment. But the choice is between an MBA, and a masters of engineering management.  The MBA is the more generalist approach. It works well if I eventually decide to shift out of the technical arena.  The MEM contains a lot of the same information from the MBA, but everything is tinged with a focus on engineering.  So, does anyone have either of these degrees? What information can you provide that may help me decide one vs the other?   Hey everyone. I have been unable to find a decent tab for this anywhere. I can find tabs for part 1, tabs for part 2, and tabs for the solo. But no one seems to have the full 3:25 8-track version of the piece which combines all plus the solo. Any advice would really be awesome. Thanks!   Hello everyone! Last year, my wife and I went on our honeymoon to Brugges Belgium, and while we were there we visited their lace museum, and the lace society. We also picked up 2 pieces, both of which were well over 200 years old.  We would like to display them in frames, but I'm unsure of how to mount them. The woman we spoke with said that lace needs to breathe, and sealing it in will destroy it. Given they have lave well over 600 years there, I am prone to believe her.  So, does anyone have any ideas how how to best do this? I was thinking of taking 2 appropriately sized frames, wrapping the backing in black velvet (so it holds the lace in place without lots of needles) and then enclosing it into the frame.  Will this work? Is there anything on black velvet that could damage the lace over time? Will this make it too hard for the lace to "breathe"?   In 2013, the SCOTUS affirmed that police who are currently on duty have no legal right to ask a citizen (whether press or civilian) to stop recording or filming them. In fact, it is a clear violation of their first amendment rights.  Here is the actual ruling that was affirmed by the SCOTUS: http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/garcia_SOI_3-14-13.pdf  So, why do we still see constant reports of people having cameras taken, film taken, people being threatened with arrest for filming, people being told they cannot film, etc? It's blatantly wrong and also illegal.   I ask for 2 reasons - first, the events in Ferguson. But on a more personal note, last week I was threatened with arrest if I didn't stop filming police who were breaking up a large altercation at a music festival on a public street in my home town. Thankfully when I mentioned the case law and started asking for names, badge numbers, and they realized that I know both of their shift supervisors, they backed down. But why was this even a question? Why do so many officers blatantly ignore the law?  I'm not expecting every officer to be a scholar on constitutional law, but it seems that given the prevalence of recording devices today, this should be common knowledge.   Hey everyone! I am still very new to guitar, so I hope you don't mind me asking this.  I picked up my guitar last week, and am patiently waiting for my teacher's schedule to be set (the best classical guitar teachers in our area also teach in music charter schools and colleges, so at the end of summer they pause scheduling new students until they have their schedules set for the schools and colleges).  In the meantime, I figured I would start attempting to learn some basics, but not go so deep as to get bad habits. I expect to start lessons sometime in september. So, in the meantime I've been practicing free strokes and rest strokes, alternating fingers, and learning the fretboard - all basic stuff that seems fairly hard to screw up. Oh, and I've been growing out my nails.  I am following along with this basic course:  http://www.classicalguitarcorner.com/level-1/  The lessons are brief, but they give me enough information that I can find reinforcing material around youtube to get a solid idea of what I'm supposed to be doing. The first time I've been genuinely confused was this morning when looking at the lesson about the Cmajor scale in first position.  From what I can gather, first position means you are keeping your fret-board hand at the first fret. But then the lesson stipulates playing the Cmajor scale starting with the 5th fret on the third string. However, it looks like there are a bunch of other places where I could start playing it - 5th string 3rd fret, 2nd string first fret, etc.  So, are these ALL the Cmajor scale in first position? Is one more correct than the other? Why are they called "first position" if the root note isn't on the first fret? Is it just a rough descriptor more than anything?       Hey everyone! Let me begin by saying I'm not a luthier, and am not even that great of a woodworker. But I think this could be a great way to learn a bit about both.  My wife (a professional music teacher) ended up ruining her christmas surprise last night by buying a manhasset music stand (the same one I was planning on buying her), so I'm now scrambling for new christmas ideas. So, I figured, why not try something a little different?  So, I started looking at the stewmac uke kits. This is the kit I'm looking at: http://www.stewmac.com/Materials_and_Supplies/Kits/Ukulele/Soprano_Ukulele_Kit.html  To tweak it a little, I'm going to be getting the grover tuning knobs instead of the normal friction knobs that come with the kit. Also, I'd like to remove the strips around the soundhole, and use some paua abalone purfling. They sell this: http://www.stewmac.com/Materials_and_Supplies/Inlay_and_Pearl/Purfling/Paua_Abalone_Purfling.html  So, I guess what my question is - can anyone offer advice on skipping the strips that are provided, and instead using the purfling? Will the purfling I linked above work? How can I cut it so that it makes a nice smooth circle around the soundhole? Even some books would be welcome at this point. Since it's a christmas present, I want it to be a little more special than just the off-the-shelf kit.   Hey everyone. The wife and I are looking to trade in a good bit of gear for a new PS3 (Last of Us bundle).  Sadly, we missed the gamestop 50% extra promo by just a few days.  I know that in grocery stores promos and sales tend to be on a 6 week rotation. Is the same thing true with gamestop?      Hey everyone! Right now we are looking to trade in our xbox 360 and wii, all of our hardware and games for what will most likely be a PS4. I want to be able to play Last of Us and if it ever happens, all of the older Final Fantasy games from PS1/2. My wife wants to play Kingdom Hearts.  But beyond that, well, I'll be blunt, my wife is a PITA to find games for. She likes RPGs and only RPGs. They have to be active combat without any kind of menu system (so final fantasy games are all out). She tried FFVII and determined that from that point, she didn't enjoy games with passive combat and menu systems. She is obsessed with the Kingdom Hearts games. She tried Fable 3 and while she didn't mind the gameplay, she couldn't get into the story (TBH, I can't fault her, the story doesn't get really decent until it is nearly over).  She gets freaked out by the idea of things jumping out at her, to the point where she wouldn't even play Portal because she had already convinced herself that something was going to "jump out and try to get her." Anything FPS for the most part is out.  She won't try fighting games, and she has no interest in sports/racing.  But yet every night she sits there looking at steam trying to find something to play. She's just too damn fickle to try anything because she's convinced herself she doesn't enjoy it.  I just don't know what to do. Every time I suggest something it seems like there's some reason it doesn't suit her. So, any suggestions for people who like Kingdom Hearts-esque RPGs?   Hey everyone. My wife and I have an Xbox 360 and Wii along with about 20 games we are looking to trade in at Gamestop for a new PS4.  One of the things that I find attractive is the downloadable games that are available. I can't however seem to find a decent listing of all of the titles that are available on PS4. For instance, when I go to the PS website and search for final fantasy, FF:IX shows up with "buy download!" but it doesn't indicate what systems the download will work on. Does it work on everything? Just the PS3? Just the PS4? How do I know?  Their FAQ doesn't contain this info, so it's a bit confusing. Any help or pointers would be helpful, I haven't had a PS since way back when Playstation 2 was the big thing.  The reddit faq here http://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/wiki/faq just says that the downloads have to be coded with PS4 in mind, but doesn't contain a listing of the games that this applies to. So, basically I feel a little blind.   Hey everyone. I've been on Robin Hood's waitlist for a few weeks now, and I'm noticing that it doesn't really seem to be moving at all. So, what's the deal? Do you guys think this is going to be a legit service or is it vaporware? They have a number of big backers, but you'd think they'd have SOME sort of updates on progress - app updates, news about getting SEC and FinCEN approval, etc. But nothing seems to be going out.  Just interested what ya'll think.  For those who aren't familiar, it's a commission-free online stock brokerage which is backed by google ventures.

I am just trying to find out what a zencontroller looks like. I've recently sold off my old mining rig, and am considering picking up an asic from GAWminers. It includes a zencontroller, but I can't seem to find out much about what the zencontroller is, what it looks like, etc.  Is it essentially a rebranded raspberry pi? Or something similar? Can I connect it to a USB hub and connect multiple miners to it? Should i just get an rpi instead?  I'm asking because if I jump back into this, I need to make SURE that there is an ROI because unlike normal video cards, asics tend to not have much resale value.   I was super excited to see this in my messages earlier from /u/dogegiftbot telling me I'd won a giveaway. But for some reason, the link didn't work... it sent me here: http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2c300i/winner_train_subject8232_has_won_the_dogegiftbot/  I was super excited either way, so I accepted the prize. I even got a message back saying I'd claimed my prize!  But then a few minutes later I got a message from /u/TheLobstrosity telling me that it was a bug. The really sucky thing is, I'm still seeing threads for other winners showing up, so it kinda feels like a slap in the face. Are they all bug threads? Or was I just unlucky? Poor form to tell someone they won, then send them a message saying they didn't win, only to turn around and have other people win.  I'm not bothering to re-enter. Thanks either way for trying to help the community.  +/u/dogetipbot D8vVxYMKkmUKRpmG82Z6FCfwZWC4rgVT5w all doge verify   I know it's bad form to ask for advice on what to buy, so I am going to try and do my best to avoid that.  I am interested in these 3 styles of guitar playing: -classical -Spanish -bluegrass  Essentially anything that contains a lot of finger picking. I love getting lost in the complexity it creates. I'm assuming this would point me towards a nylon string guitar, because that's kind of the standard for classical and Spanish, yes?  My wife is a music teacher, and is apparently aware of a very well regarded classical guitar instructor in our area, so more than likely I will be beginning lessons with him.  So, am I better off finding a guitar at the upper end of my price range that I like and is well reviewed? Am I better going to the first class without a guitar and getting the teacher's advice for a first instrument? Should I ask the teacher to come to the guitar store with me and help me pick out a guitar?  I'm just trying to figure out the correct approach.   First, let me begin by saying that I am not a musician. I am, however, a geek. That puts me in a rough spot because I see lots of numbers and knobs and switches and I get all excited. However that doesn't always translate into what will be a good instrument. So, I am hoping someone can help me with making a decision about buying my wife a wind controller.  My wife is a musician. She's a classically trained saxophonist with a masters of music education. She teaches general music and band at our local school district. She has several instruments - 2 saxes, a flute, a clarinet, a trumpet, a keyboard, and so forth. She also teaches lessons privately. If I had to describe it, I'd say she tends to be a teacher first and a musician second most of the time. She doesn't play very much for pleasure, but rather for teaching. Usually when she does play, it's at gigs for municipal bands or she's improving with a student.  A few weeks ago she was watching a music video for a mash-up band she enjoys, and noticed that their horn player was using a wind controller. She got all excited and said she really wanted one! So, I started doing some research for a possible xmas present.  I figure her uses will be:  1) Putzing around and having fun 2) Playing along with private students in new and fun ways 3) Scoring music for her students - I'm not sure about this one. Are there any apps that will let her plug in via usb/midi cable and let her type in what she wants?  Everything I am reading seems to be pointing towards the AKAI EWI series. I figure the "playing along with students" part throws out the ewi-usb, so i'm trying to pick between the 4000s, and the 5000.  Since she has students who play several different horns, so I figured at the very least the 5000s has fingerings for significantly more instruments than the 4000s.  The wireless on the 5000 is a cool feature and will free her up to work with students and walk around the student. I'm afraid if she circles a kid a few times with a 4000s while she's checking out their form it will just make a tangled mess. I figure I will most likely pick up a mid-range keyboard amp to put in her studio to go with the controller. Is that a good choice?  I can't tell if the move from an analog synth on the 4000s to digital samples on the 5000 is a good thing or a bad thing. I can't see her using a lot of "beeps" and "buzzes" and she'd more likely spend most of her time sticking to traditional instruments.  I've talked to several other music teachers in similar positions and have gotten a wide array of answers from "waste of money" to "she'll love it!" to "well, she could find it useful with the right setup." So, I'm not getting much in the way of help.  So, I guess these are my questions: -Given the use, is this even worth it for her? I know that's a tough question and probably a bit unfair to ask. I know she can use it with her students, and either one will give her the ability to putz around. Can it be used for scoring music too?  -I've looked around and a lot of folks seem to be pointing to "Sample Modeling Sax Brothers" as a "virtual instrument." I assume this would require her to be connected to her computer. If she were to use a USB cable to connect an EWI to her computer, would that be the only thing she'd need? Or would she have to have an external midi interface box thingies? This is where my ignorance is hitting me.  -Is a keyboard amp the right choice to plug this guy into?  -What are your thoughts on the analog synth of the 4000s vs the digital samples on the 5000?  Sorry for the wave of questions, but I just can't seem to find many good answers - everything expects a good knowledge of MIDI and wind controllers already.   Hey everyone. I am trying to find a way to purchase an amazon gift card for my sister-in-law's birthday. The issue is, she is a fairly lowtech person, and things like egifter and gyft both require the person receiving whatever card have either email/sms/smart phones.  So, how can I purchase a gift card in such a way that I can just print out the redemption code, put it in a card, and mail that to her? The way that Amazon usually does it.  Sadly Amazon won't let you use gift cards to buy gift cards, so that is out.    Well, for those who saw my post yesterday, a few months ago I picked up a whole packer-cut brisket weighing in at 18.7 lbs. After splitting the point and the flat and trimming, I had about 5 lbs of fat, 8 lbs of flat, 6 lbs of point that. The point turned out incredible - it got corned and turned into awesome pastrami.  The flat had been sitting in my freezer for the past 2 months until I had time to smoke it. Well, I did that yesterday. It took 17 hours from beginning to end, starting at midnight, ending at 5pm the next day. I stalled for about 14 hours between 150 and 160. I was running into issues with my kettle (using a modified weber kettle with pitIQ, and smokenator) where every time I'd open the dome to add water/charcoal, the meat temp would drop about 15-20 degrees. It was a pretty extreme drop. By the time it would fully recover, it was time to add more water/charcoal.  Finally when there were about 4 hours until guests arrived, I wrapped it, and then the temp started to consistently climb. I brought it to 203 and moved it over to a cooler to rest for an hour before the guests arrived.  It turned out dry. Like, really REALLY dry. The only way to make it edible was to slice super thin, on a bias and against the grain so yoru teeth could get through it. Luckily I threw together our house coca-cola bbq sauce so that added a lot, but this was NOT the moist, succulent brisket I had hoped for. Tonight I'm going to take a page out of the pastrami book and steam it to reheat, and maybe that will add a little moisture back in.  So, I'm wondering where I went wrong. Is it bad to have frozen the meat? Should I have just sucked it up and wrapped it when it first hit 150? Do I need to brine/inject next time, instead of just using a dry rub? Should I have gone higher than 203? I didn't have time at that point to let it go until it was "like butter" but given the dryness I'm not sure there was much collagen at the party.  So, any ideas for how to keep brisket from coming out like cardboard?   Hey everyone! I recently broke down a litecoin mining rig and started parting it out on ebay. I sold off both of the power supplies, however one has not been paid for. It's been 2 days. I sent the buyer and invoice, and I've also sent them a personal message to try and contact them.  If I don't hear back by tomorrow afternoon, I'll be opening up a claim with ebay. If they aren't able to resolve it, what happens? I assume I relist it, but do I get charged for the amount that should have been paid on my ebay statement?  This is the first time I've ever had what appears to be a deadbeat buyer, and I'm kind of confused about what it ends up meaning in the long run.   Hey everyone. I currently have an 8lb brisket flat on my weber kettle. I'm using a pitmaster iq110 (drilled manifold), a maverick, and a smokenator. I'm doing low and slow at ~225. My goal temp is 203. The only other mod is a brand new notch in the back right hand corner of the kettle to thread probes through.  Whenever I open the lid to add water/charcoal, not only do I see the dome temp drop (completely expected), but I also see the temp of the meat drop pretty substantially, about 10 degrees (from 160+ to 150 or lower). The problem is, I have to add water/charcoal about once an hour to keep things going. By the time the meat has recovered, I have to open the lid again and the whole process starts over. As it stands, it is 11:30AM now, and the brisket has been in the 150's/160's since around 2AM. I've heard of plateaus, but this is ridiculous.  This is the first time I've run into this issue - I've seen small temp drops with points and shoulders, but nothing this significant.  Any ideas what could be going on? Maybe the probe thermometer from the maverick is too close to the outside of the meat? Shouldn't carry-over keep the meat from dropping that fast?   Hey everyone. I'm located in Pennsylvania.  I am in discussion with our local zoning board and a coworking space about the possibility of starting an artisinal coffee roasting business. As part of this, I'd like to do online sales, including accepting cryptocurrencies.  My biggest concern is the tax implications based on the IRS guidelines that came out a few months ago.  I see lots of resources for helping businesses accept cryptos, but I see relatively sparse information about reporting the taxes involved. For instance, https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/How_to_accept_Bitcoin,_for_small_businesses basically just says that they can't offer advice. Are there any good resources to help businesses handle the tax reporting needs of accepting cryptos? For the most part, everything will be getting converted into fiat while things get moving.   So, this may be an unpopular view, but here it is.  The NY regulations are a consequence of the IRS decision of how to handle cryptocurreny earlier this year. Most of this community simply said "ignore it!"   Well, now we will reap what that ignorance has sowed.  Every single thing they have listed is expected of a company that handles securities. When I buy or transfer stock, every single one of these items is required for reporting purposes to the IRS. The same when I do a forex trade on an accreddited exchange. NY is instituting regulations to treat cryptos the same way, and therefore coming into compliance with the IRS regulations by enforcing record keeping.   In the eyes of the IRS, every time someone opens a business that accepts *coin, they are effectively becoming a small exchange. Paying for a sticker with dogecoin in the eyes of the US government is the same thing as me paying for the sticker with some vested stock. With that comes regulatory requirements because they are trading securities. Every time someone creates a new coin? In the eyes of the IRS and the SEC, they are creating a new security and issuing an IPO. Replace the (insert coin name here) with the word "stock" and everything listed more or less matches what exists currently.  You can complain all you want, but the time to nip this in the bud may have passed. We should have been in an uproar when the IRS decided to treat cryptos as securities, instead the community collectively had the ho-hum response of "ignore it, I'm not a bitmillionaire."  The consumer protection angle will largely be used to sell the legislation to the public. After all, a lot of "bad guys" still use cryptos. Plus MtGox and the other exchange hacks will give them even more fuel.  So next time, try not to tell people they are worrying too much, and actually listen to what they are saying. Because it may bite you on the ass later.   I just took a look at dogechain.info, and noticed that we're at block ~302000. Did I just miss the halving??                  Hey everyone. I am looking to drill holes in my weber performer so I can thread in the temp probes of my Maverick thermometer. I know I am aiming for them to be above the cooking grate (obviously).   However, is there anything I can do to help reinforce the hole? Like, a small conduit or something?      I am picking up a full packers cut brisket tomorrow, weighing in at about 15 lbs. I am going to be making my very first pastrami. For the Corning brine, all recipes I find call for:  * 1 gallon/4 liters water * 1.5 cup/350g salt * 1 cup/225g sugar * 42g/8tsp pink salt * spices  This assumes a 5lb brisket. I am planning a 7 day soak. I will very likely need more brine given the size of the brisket. Can it be safely doubled? Tripled? I am asking largely because of the amount of sodium nitrite in the solution, and it's potential dangers at higher amounts.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_nitrite puts the LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of the population) at around 71mg/kg. If tripled to 126g, pink salt (containing 6% sodium nitrite) would have 7.56g total. That sounds incredibly high.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.     Hey everyone! Simple question I hope - does anyone know if it's against the youtube TOS to put a tipping address in your video descriptions? I'd like to put a dogecoin/bitcoin tip address for folks who enjoy videos.   EDIT: I'm asking about pastrami, not a Texas brisket!  Hey everyone! The wife's dad is going to be coming out next weekend to help us install our new front door. Thanks to her parents' lovely birthday gift to me this year, I was finally able to get the Weber grill I've wanted for years, so this is my chance to show them gratitude AND show them I know how to use it.  I'm going to be making homemade pastrami from scratch (from corning the brisket through bbq) and doing pastrami sandwiches because it's one of her dad's favorites.  So, my next step is figuring out how much time to estimate. I know with pork I usually have to aim at the 2 hour per lb mark because I tend to do low cooking (200-225). I also don't plan to foil wrap. I'm a bit concerned considering I've read the full brisket can be upwards of 18 lbs, but after the last BBQ session I've decided that if I won't sleep for 2 days I've got to make it worth my while, lol.  The corning takes about 5 days, and I'm estimating somewhere around 1-2 days of bbq.  Any advice would be appreciated on helping to refine those numbers.  Also, any recommendations on wood? I have cherry and hickory on hand at the moment.   Hey everyone! I've tried asking around on the food sub and haven't gotten anywhere. I'm looking for a recipe for vobla. Most of the recipes say that you use "salt and water" to make a brine, and then you dry the fish but that's all I can find. I don't know how much of a ratio to use so that it doesn't get too salty (or maybe too salty is what I'm going for? Ha!). Any advice would be really appreciated.  Sadly, I can't read Cyrillic so that limits my options, lol.   Hey everyone! Years ago I had the chance to spend a large amount of quality time with folks from Moldova. They introduced me to a Slavic custom of eating salted, dried fish while you drink a beer. Traditionally the fish that is used is "vobla." Needless to say, vobla isn't readily available. The closest I can find that matches shape and size in the US is smelt, but vobla has a darker meat compared to the lighter smelt.   I'd love to make some. Does anyone have any ideas about what fish are readily available in a US market that could be substituted?      I've typed and retyped this post about 8 times now, and I still don't have it right, but here it is.  The problem is us. Our community. Right now, we're sick. When doge first came out, everyone was friendly. No idea was stupid. Businesses were launched to do silly things, but they got our coins circulating. There were the occasional scuffle, but for the most part everyone supported everyone else.  But now, when we're driving hundreds of people to our sub daily, you see people taking pot shots at people asking questions "because it's been asked 1000 times before." Oh, that's great, invite someone here, actually get them here, only to tell them when they ask a question to shut up and go away and read. How welcoming.  People post ideas on how to help the community. But then, instead of people actively interacting with them to see what the problem is that they want to address and actually taking note of how to possibly incorporate the good ideas, people attacked them. "You're a scare monger!" "There's nothing wrong!" "Oh, you're concerned because the dogecoin you spent 300$ for after being told over and over that we're **going to the moon** are now only worth 10 less than a month later? I guess you're not a REAL shibe!" "Oh, your online wallet got hacked? Sucks to be you!"  And devs, that includes you. People submit ideas on here constantly, and 99% of you are too busy putzing on IRC to take notice. Instead of people getting positive reinforcement for trying to help things, they get torn down by asshats who just want to shit on everyone else's day. Devs whine that they don't have help testing, or that a feature is *sob* HARD to implement. But instead of doing the logical thing and getting help, there are excuses about how "the source tree is guarded!" "We don't want just ANYONE testing these things!" So, you whine (and yes, it's whining) that you want help, but when people offer help, you say that they're not good enough to help. Well, we're a community and you can't have it both ways. Either everyone is valuable, or not. It's sad how the devs like to say that resources are limited and they're all volunteers, and yet there's not a single "Help us test X!" link to be found to get more help.  People make suggestions, and they get shot down because "OH DEAR GOD IT WOULD REQUIRE A FORK!!! THE HORROR!" Our coin is 6 fucking months old. We are a brand new product. Now is the time to try things and fork and get it to where we think it's perfect. We've executed forks before. The honest truth is it's not that big of a deal. Does it require some effort and coordination? Yes. But we've done it before, and we can easily do it again. It's just easier to hide behind it than to actually get things built. "Oh man, this feature could make us the number 1 coin on earth!" "Oh wait, we'd have to fork. If you think the feature is so great, go buy into that coin instead." "Oh, nevermind. I'll go try that coin then." "GET RICH QUICK FAKER!!!!!" I got tired of seeing this same conversation every single day. Think of this as a product. It can have flaws. That's ok. What's not OK is saying "the course is set, let's not change anything no matter what." You know what happens in the business world when you say that? You stagnate. Then you go out of business. It's pathetic that we have an amazing community, and our devs and a massive part of our community would rather refute almost every suggestion than try to make them into reality.  I'm not posting this to trash anyone. I'm posting it because your trashing each other and your ignoring new ideas and your not paying attention to one another and your NOT UNDERSTANDING EACHOTHER is killing us. Think about what you post. Is it going to bring people together, or is it going to drive them apart? Guess what, if it's going to drive eachother apart, STFU and go play a game or something. I don't care if you have 1 doge or a million. We don't need your negativity. I'd rather take someone who sold all their doge for bitcoin but actively helps people and treats everyone with respect on the trip to the moon than someone who spreads negativity.  With that said, even if you decide to downvote this post, try to stop being dicks to each other. Listen to why people are concerned, and instead of telling them they're dumb, assuage their concerns. If it's not working, then the problem isn't with them, it's with you. Your arguments aren't good enough. It's a chance to improve YOU and YOUR arguments. Maybe they have a valid point. Maybe their idea is really good, and that's the real reason your argument isn't good enough. Accept it, and move on and improve things. If you want our coin to be the coin that's different - do it by being the coin that actually responds to changes instead of arrogantly sailing forward just because you started out going that direction.   So, I picked this puppy up for 2$ at a yard sale, and it was almost completely full. Since we're going camping tonight, I decided I'd top it off. For some reason I thought I remembered it saying kerosene only, so that's what I got. Well, it doesn't actually say WHAT it runs on on the lantern, so I figured, what the heck. It's got whatever fuel the old owner ran it on inside, so at worst i'm making a mix.  That said, are there any dangers in running kerosene in a lamp made for coleman fuel? When I get back home, should I drain it and fill with naptha? Just trying to figure this guy out! Any help would be appreciated!  	145

 "That's real loose butthole," and "Let's get weeeeeird." Both Adam DeMamp from Workaholics    "Let's see where the night takes us."    COMPROMISE. Seriously, it's key. You'll never get anywhere if you two can't come up with some sort of middle ground during an argument. Sure you'll have your fights and fits of rage regardless, but at some point you both need to come to some sort of an agreement that benefits the both of you. That being said, don't be a complete push over either and let her have everything. Make sure you're coming out with something as well.  Another huge thing is trust. You need to have the utmost trust and respect for this person. She needs to be your best friend. I know it sounds cheesy, but it's the truth. You need to be able to trust her to go and do whatever she pleases. And vise versa, same goes for her, she needs to be able to trust you too.   If you have any doubts about this person at all, then forget it. Don't plan on it being a long lasting relationship if this isn't what you want for the rest of your life. Don't settle for anything less then the best in your eyes.   Most of all, have fun with it. You'll learn knew things about her everyday (again cheesy, I know sorry).   Hope this helps a bit! May not be exactly what you're looking for, but it's what I've learned over the years!   Pretty random, but I was driving to school in upstate New York and while on my way I saw this morbidly obese child skip around his yard. When he came full circle around the yard he met up with his grandmother and started to frantically beat her in public. I wasn't sure whether to stop or keep going.    Wow, great eye! That is Highland Light! I can't personally say I've ever been there myself. What a coincidence though! I'd love to see how yours came out!   It is a very, very hard decision. You'll find the one that speaks out to you though. There are so many around the world, so many to choose from. Just take your time, that's all!   Thank you for the question! My family and I have always vacationed in the Cape, ever since I was little. The beach and lighthouse theme has been a huge part of my life, we have pictures of lighthouses everywhere at home. That was my main inspiration for the piece. The symbolism of guidance and light were also pretty huge to me. That lighthouse specifically was just because I really appreciated the design!       You're welcome!   Very beautiful place.     	11

    You have to wait until your teammate passes it to you. As soon as his foot touches the ball, that where your relative position on the field counts. In this case, it should be behind the last defender. If you look at the video on YouTube you can see he was good to go and used his speed and perfect timing to catch up to the ball   Then what is conscious of our consciousness? Kind of like a torch in a dark room. (Torch is awareness) when you shine your light at an on object in a dark room (say a chair), you then have perception of an object. But what is aware of the torch (awareness/consciousness/brain)?   But you can break them if you feel they are unjust. Not saying it's correct or incorrect. It just is. Slavery, inequality, etc. Not at the same level but same concept.    Take all the legal advice everyone is recommending. A lawyer is a must here. From a father's POV, if that IS your kid, then man up quick and take responsibility. The kid is going to NEED a father in their life who is there for them REGARDLESS of what adult problems happened along the way. It's going to be ok man. Whatever happens, have integrity, take responsibility, and keep your chin up. Judging from what you have already posted, you seem to head strong.   	5
 **Buy, buy, buy!** trusst mee IAMA a stalk bro-ker   I thought the point of pre-ordering was so that you were guaranteed a copy if they ran out of stock... so what's the point with digital purchases? They can't run out...   Plot twist: toxic gas   Oy. She hot.   Woah dude. Adult Swim teaches me something new every day.    I can relate. My thoughts are too interesting for my brain to let me fall asleep.   It might be hard to believe, but life will get better. Just remember that you live *now*, not in the future. Just focus on enjoying the moment that you're experiencing right now. Sending you love, brotha.   Thank you for sharing... absolutely made my day finding this out. :)   You think they're at peace now? Or did the fire anger them and force them to find a new home?..   *Ur all trowls   Aw man, I know nothing about motorcycles... but that thing is beautiful!

       Title says it all - Please **VOTE!!!**                  I recently read this quote from our president:   A few timid people who fear progress, will try to give you new and strange names for what we are doing. Sometimes they will call it fascism; sometimes communism; and sometimes socialism.       But in so doing, they are trying to make very complex, something that is really very simple, and very practical.    --------------  And I read what they say about him:   * People everywhere are growing impatient.  On the right  organized by some of the most powerful industrialists charging that the presidents actions are only making things worse.    That the president has become a dictator, defying the constitution, encouraging class warfare. Saying the president is hell-bent on socialism. There can only be one capital, they say; Washington or Moscow. There can only be one flag. The stars and stripes, or the flag of the godless Soviets. His enemies only referred to him as that man in the White House. Because they cannot bear to say his name.     On the left socialist and some communist took to the street denouncing the president as a captive of capitalism; incapable of bringing about real change.  ---------------------  Hearing this makes me wonder what they will say about Obama in the history books in the years to come.  What are your thoughts about what they say now and do you believe he will be remembered differently or just like what the say now? I mean has any other president been so hated at the time, ever end up being considered a great president after all the smoke clears or is Obama stuck with the hatred forever?            I have been negligent in sending out thanks for all the support and cards you have sent me and my 92 year old mom. She laughs and smiles when I bring her the cards. It has been rough but all of you have made things more bearable.  It's amazing how the support comes from every corner of the world. I just can not express my appreciation in this challenging time.  She is still in the care facility and her mental capacity has returned. But physically she is still extremely weak. We are hopeful that she will keep getting stronger and eventually may be able to bring her home.  Your support means everything to both me and her.   Thank you. Thank you so much.   train_subject8344         The time has come and in this last crucial week /r/democrats will be dedicated solely to election issues and getting out the vote.  The only reason democrats lose in the midterms is because of voter turnout.   **It's time to get off our asses and rally our base to make their voices heard.**  Many important contests are in a virtual tie. We can make a difference if we just get out and vote.  And don't tell me your vote doesn't count. That is the lamest excuse I have ever heard. It counts now more than ever.  * **Effective until November 4th, all posts in /r/democrats must be election and get out the vote related. We can do this. It's time to do your part!**                     My mom is 92 and very hard of hearing and bedridden. She has to have the TV full-blast for her to hear it. I'm looking for something wireless that I can plug into her TV sound she can listen to it through an earbud or headphones. She will have the TV at the foot of her bed.  Nothing fancy is needed at. Just something that will give her basic loud sound without other having to hear it.               In the episode "Birthday Month," Axe Cop say he was born in 2004. How can he only be 10 years old?  And yes I know it's a cartoon but it seems weird he would only be 10 years old.            They keep panning to fans dressed in panda bear costumes. What is that all about?   **EDIT: Question answered**         Most states cut off voter registration 30 days before the election. Tomorrow is that day.  **REGISTER NOW - And I mean today!**  **Last chance!**         We have one of your countrymen starving out there and we want to get this guy a pizza. I live in the US and could not find a way to order and pay for one.   If one of you can get him a pizza, I will send you the money to reimburse you.  Here is his post in our subreddit /r/Assistance:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/2i7xwv/havent_eaten_since_monday/  I promise I will reimburse you. And I never break a promise.          I'm late at sending out thanks to you all. Mom got really sick and has been in the hospital this last week. Up until today it did not look good. Her mental state was gone. I was fearing the worst.  But today when I visited her, she was back. She was asking questions and  her mind was obviously back. I brought the cards you sent for her birthday that are still coming in and she loved them. From Germany, New Zealand, cities throughout the US, Australia and so many other places. She was reading them and smiling. Medicine that could not have come from anywhere else and it was working great.  Thank you all for keeping my mom happy and alive. Say some prayers that her recovery continues. Bless you all! :D    **Sue's project:**  **[Check it out here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/2gl5hn/help_me_make_some_little_girls_christmas_need/)**   As some of you know BackPackWayne and I are working very hard to get the Christmas Sub ready to  pen..http://www.reddit.com/r/SantasLittleHelpers[1] .. And I have been asking for American Girl Dolls to fix up and give away in a contest for Christmas, A very nice person on RAOK had his Niece give up one of hers to donate. icehouse15 you ROCK!

They agreed to sell me boxes the real boxes for $5.00 plus shipping!! I am asking for help to pay for these boxes and hopefully a bit extra to order some new clothes or books or hair products from them. If you wanna be part of this please pm me for Paypal info.. Every Dollar will be spent on this project. And after Christmas lots of pictures and a video showing what this sub does... Please help this is the email.

They need everyday items, like soaps, shampoo,lotion , socks, slippers, underwear   person body care items.. I hope to post a Amazon/Walmart wishlist. I am also going to be collecting new   used items. If anyone has any other ideas to share that will be great. . Thanks again. : )   **-----------------------------**  Other projects from the other mods to follow.   And yes Christmas is just around the corner. :D                                                            I seem to remember ISIS's black flag being flown over the embassy. Was it ISIS that attacked our embassy and killed our people?  If so, doesn't this warrant going after the people responsible?   It's all over but the voting. Who do you think took the prize? And maybe say why.                        Today I went to my sister's house for my mom's birthday. I kind of hate going to stuff like that because I always have to hear all that right-wing extremist crap. I mean they make FOX News look liberal. Especially my evil brother. The ignorance that comes out of his mouth is excruciating. I gave up long ago trying discuss anything with him.  So they are going on and on about the football player that beat his wife and the black guy that got killed in Ferguson and somehow made it about how unfair they were being to white people. How they got there I will never know. I was just biting my tongue but finally mentioned Zimmerman. The conversation went on without my participation but it was just so vile and ignorant. Talking about how unfair Zimmerman was treated and what a piece of shit the kid that got killed was. And how the black guy that got killed in Ferguson ruined that cops's life. After several minutes of listening to this garbage, I finally just stood up and said:  "Yea..., those fucking niggers!"  Everyone just went silent and gasped. Even though for the last 20 minutes, that's what they had been basically saying. They thought it was horrible how I paraphrased it for them. They were not happy with me today. But I was giggling to myself how I actually out-extremed the extremists.         You may have noticed I have been pretty absent  here the last couple weeks. It's because I have the flu. And this thing just doesn't seem to want to go away.  Please by all that is holy -   **GO GET YOUR FLU SHOT!!!**  This thing is the worst.  Here is a government site that will give you locations to get yours:  * http://www.vaccines.gov/getting/where/   Please don't wait. This thing sucks. I'll see ya again soon when I get well. God forbid you get this damn thing.   Hearing that Scotland is voting to leave the UK is kind of surprising to some of us less UK-knowledgeable Americans. Could you give us the basics of who and what makes up the UK?   Some races are very close and upsets are very possible if we join together and just vote. But to do so, you need to register and do it soon.  **PLEASE REGISTER NOW!**  I will gladly find out how and where you can register in your state if you just tell me your city and state.   **And please vote in November.**            I've had it with ATT. Not because of the price or any other service. But because they continually manipulate and lies to me. Each month for the last six months I had to make that dreaded call to ask why my bill went up $20.  I would win the argument but then they would do it again the next month.   Anyway, I need a new internet and TV service. Who should I get?      A really nice redditor provided us with this link on how to add an address to your Amazon wishlist. It was soooooo helpful. It saved the mods so many headaches trying to explain to people how to do that. They made it in pictures that was so simple anyone could understand it. Check it out:  * https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B37BFyksMPvcNUpNeW9VT0N2TGc/edit  What we really could use is the same thing that explains how to make an Amazon wishlist from scratch. It would be aimned at people who are not good at computers and have never made an Amazon wishlist before. Come Christmas we are running both subs and it is an insane amount of work for us. Explaining the wishlist consumes way too much of our time. The format with the pictures like the one above would be most preferred.   Is there anyone who would be willing to make this for us?   P.S. Christmas is closer than you think. :D   I promised to buy a needy Canadian some coffee. But every frickin' place I try to order it from will not send it to Canada  from the US. It doesn't have to come from the US. It can be sent from Canada to Canada. I just have to pay for it from the US.  Not looking for anything fancy. Just some plain old regular coffee. I've been trying for hours with no success. It's such a simple thing but is turning into a major hassle. Can you give me an online site that will allow me to send this poor woman some coffee?  ----------------------  **EDIT:**  **Thank you all for your help. I finally found a place to do it. :D**   I run /r/santaslittlehelpers where we require requests to include am Amazon wishlist. We spend so much of our time coaching people in how to make a wishlist. Some of these users can barely send an email. It is so frustrating and time consuming for us.  We of course had the problem of them not adding their shipping address until a very kind redditor gave us this link to show them how:  *https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B37BFyksMPvcNUpNeW9VT0N2TGc/edit  It really helped out. Now we are looking for the same kind of thing that explains with pictures, how to make a basic wishlist.  Is there one in existence or would someone be willing to make one for us?   Our subscribers last year provided over $20,000 of gifts from Amazon to those in need so you could see how frustrating it gets instructing so many to make a basic wishlist. To have a link we could give them that would explain it in the simplest of terms, with pictures like the link above, would be awesome beyond awesome.  Anyone out there know of one or would be willing to create one?                  I'm curious if people of reddit would consider this as an abuse of presidential powers. So many of you questioned  whether the president can legally authorize the killing of a U.S. citizen fighting for a foreign terrorist group in the past.  If so, what would make this case different than the other ones he targeted. If not, do you think he should be powerless if he can't get at him to bring back to America for trial?                           Yes. In fact your votes are the only ones that matter. Elections are not decided by republicans or democrats. Their votes basically cancel each other out. They sway from one side back and forth, but rarely are the deciding factor.  In most presidential elections, the percentage difference is around 5%. If all the people who say their vote doesn't matter would vote, then they would matter. They would easily sway the vote one way or the other. The direction our country takes can easily be changed by a small percentage that does not vote. The very people who say their vote does not count.  **In practical reality, your votes are the only ones that do count.**         Last year saw the launch of our sister-sub, /r/SantaLittleHelpers. It was a smashing success and you awesome people made the difference for so. so many people.  We are currently working behind the scenes to not only supply Christmas for thousands, but to have the time of our lives doing it.  **We need your ideas for events, contests and just fun things to do over the six weeks we will be operating.**  Myself and others will be donating prizes for contests but we are looking for fun ways that keep us all in the spirit of Christmas. Please be creative. Of course we want to bring Christmas to those that who otherwise wouldn't have it. But we want to have fun while doing it. Looking forward to hearing your ideas.   ------------------------------   Oh and by-the-way, here is our video from last year, in case you missed it.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUyt_JwBDeQ  And may I be the first to wish you all a Merry Christmas 2014.

 Canon DSLRs suffer from automated gain control. When the sound in the room is quiet it boosts the gain automatically. So what happens is when you talk it might sound normal, but in between lines the sound of the room or the room tone becomes louder as auto gain control rises. Even with a Rode mic it does the same thing. Magic Lantern gives you a few set gain options and disables auto Gain.   Your best bet for a long term solution is to get an external audio recorder like a Zoom H4n and sync the audio and video up later. H4n's have decent on board mics that are far superior to the rode mic and you have the option to plug in two additional mics via XLR ports in the future when you can afford a decent shotgun mic or Lavaliere.  *credentials - I am a Location Sound Mixer for film       Thanks Killing Music   When I made films in high school I forgot quite a few things. So you are so far ahead of where I was. You kept pretty good continuity and had plenty of coverage. That being said, start asking yourself what the shot looks like. Change up the shot size.  For example, a great way to show how alone and vulnerable the kid is is to take the camera all the way to the other end of the hall (an extreme long shot) and show how empty and big the hallway is. Take this approach across the film. Use camera distance to convey emotion. Close-ups are more intense and can be used to show extreme emotions or build tension. And don't be afraid of coming from a different angle than just eye-level.  Anyway, that's my two cents. Good work!  	4

 Thought had a question mark next to it :/ but yeah he seems to go in and out, I think he would be just out of the warriors but not really overall in the supports.   Guardians ~ Khumbhakarna, Geb and Athena  Warriors ~ Hercules and Sun Wukong  But I mainly just like the Guardians, not a big fan of warriors for support    They said on a reddit post that you won't be able to obtain it until after odyssey since that way you would be able to get the skins for 200 gems instead of 600 gems. http://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/2dz1ro/buying_treasure_chest_for_runexe/  Edit - Link   Mine was stuck there for a few minutes around 7 minutes ago or so, but after a while it started to go up again, so for me all I had to do was wait.   I just tend to sit there searching the Smite reddit... like most other people   I love when people are actually friendly and a lot of fun can come from it, wish I was in that game with you sounded awesome.   Support Apollo   As soon as I saw this I thought of the custom W3 maps too, could be good for inspiration.   It does seem to be that way, all of the players I've used it with have been friendly and it really helps improve your teamwork, the only downside is when you go to chat and only one other person has it.

Can look at stats here https://account.hirezstudios.com/smitegame/stats.aspx   Your job is to try and help teammates, whether it's bodyblocking basics to save them, or using abilities to help them. Another job of yours is to set up kills for people and try to help them obtain kills. On top of this, you must ward all around, steal objectives with hand of the gods rank 3 and rotate all around helping other lanes and taking mid camps.   Does anybody know if you get a total of 150 gems, or does it stack each time so you get a total of 600?   Done and done   Might be able to get a copy for you, I'll post again if I do so to stop multiple attempts   	18
 There's even a mighty poem about these poor lads:  http://schoonerfare.com/schoonerfare/8886.html  POWDER MONKEY Words and Music by Steve Romanoff Copyright 1985  In days of old, so the story's told, Of boys who went to sea, All of seven, eight and nine years old they say, To serve upon the warring ships, their captains and their kings, To serve the purpose they still serve today, To serve the purpose they still serve today. To carry up the powder from the magazine below, From a hold too dark and crowded for a man, The called them Powder Monkies, every schoolchild ought to know, The price we pay to keep a promised land, The price we pay to keep a promised land.  Send for the Powder Monkey, Send him down into the well, Send for the Powder Monkey, He'll fetch us a pail o' hell To keep out cannon burnin' He'll fall behind the gun, We'll just send for a Powder Monkey, 'Cause there's more where he came from.  They come from the city sidewalks and They come from the family farm, To trust their fragile futures to the wind, They come from the Land of Plenty, Through the evergreens and corn, With more to lose than all the angry men, With more to lose than all the angry men. Was it the hunger of the family, Was it the anger of the street, That drove a lonely child to Satan's door, Where death was all but certain and Damnation near complete, Save all for the holy innocent ashore, Save all the holy innocent ashore.  From high above the gun deck Ring the orders of the realm, To roll out a battle cadence on the drum, As forward into darkness Sail the cowards at the helm, And they shoot the stars to see how far they've come, Look at their sons to see how far they've come. In days of old, so the story's told Of boys who went to sea, All of seven, eight and nine years old they say, To serve upon the warring ships, their captains and their kings, To serve the purpose they still serve today, To serve the purpose they still serve today.       It just occurred to me: she could've save a lot of trouble if she'd checked the state of his equipment.   If you're asking "did I mean 'compelling' instead of 'compulsive', then no, I meant 'compulsive'", as in this definition: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/compulsive "Caused or conditioned by compulsion or obsession."  This is clearly the work of an inspired and gifted madman.  But the work is compelling, too :)   Unfortunately I can't find any videos, or even a website, I'd just assumed that he'd have one that I could find later.  I think maybe he's too busy reinventing the past to upload stuff to youtube.  But I did find these pictures which of course do no justice to the experience of seeing them in action:  http://s579.photobucket.com/albums/ss237/Steamachine/?action=view current=DSCF2686-2.jpg http://s579.photobucket.com/albums/ss237/Steamachine/?action=view current=DSCF2730.jpg http://s579.photobucket.com/albums/ss237/Steamachine/?action=view current=DSCF0623.jpg newest=1  Oh, and it was a 90 degree day and I got to watch him tending his propane-powered steam generator!   I guess I just wish his story was less believable.  I wish my government didn't have a history of abducting people and holding them in secret prisons.  I wish it didn't have a history of fabricating evidence as a pretext for an illegal war.  Maybe he's telling the truth, maybe not; I just wish I could say to myself, "No, my government would never do something like that."   Well, you've clearly given up here.  You've got some preconceptions that you won't let go of, even in the face of viable alternatives.  After you've spent as much time researching homeschooling as I have researching public education, maybe we can talk.  Later.   So you have no research, just an anecdote.  I'd be more reassured if there weren't so many examples of people who didn't develop "thicker skin with everyone out there who tries to build themselves up by tearing you down", but ended up excluded from cliques, miserable, harassed, and sometimes bullied to the point of committing suicide: http://www.cbs3springfield.com/news/local/97624929.html  If public school is really supposed to teach people how to deal with that bullshit, it's not doing a great job.  In real life, you can in fact "bug out" if you decide you're not having a good time, you're not forced to hang out with jerks.  You should read some Gatto: http://www.informationliberation.com/?id=11375   I'd love for you to cite the research that demonstrates that "forced socialization" is "crucial in developing fully as an individual", or that the lack of it has damaged the thousands of kids who have been home-schooled.  Home-schooled kids have plenty of options for socialization that are much more similar to the "real world" than the highly controlled, age-separated prison-like structure of public school.   You should seriously consider home-schooling.  It sounds like your wife has the time/inclination, and he'll just be held back by public school.  As many posters have suggested, you shouldn't try to force-feed him a curriculum, but there's no reason not to keep presenting him with opportunities to grow and learn.   Guess I was expecting something more Looney Tunes-ish, you know, with the barrel looking like a banana peel.   I can't believe I'm bothering to post to this thread, but there is a scene in [The Last Emperor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Emperor) when the former emperor is in the re-education camp, and is spoken to about this very subject, i.e. when peeing in the middle of the night, he needs to make sure to hit the side of the bowl so as not to wake his cell-mates.   So this woman's husband dies.  She says to the undertaker, "All my life my husband has worn nothing but black suits.  Just once I'd like to see him in blue suit, but I don't have one.  Can you help me out?"  The undertaker says, "Sure."  A few days later she shows up at the viewing, and there's her husband laid out in a handsome blue suit.  She says to the undertaker, "Thank you so much!"  The undertaker says, "No problem.  As it happens, on the same day there was a woman who wanted her husband dressed in a black suit, but all she had was blue suits."  The woman said, "Oh, so you ... ", the undertaker says, "Yeah, I just switched the heads!"

 I'm probably a tad late for this one, but I'll post anyway. Not even my story, either, but my Parents'.  I was 12, and I was staying out at a friends place a few miles away, my sister was also out at her friends just down the street.  Must have been about 11pm, my parents were sat on the sofa downstairs, watching TV and getting ready to go to sleep, when they heard a small thumping upstairs from my room, then nothing.  A minute or two later, down the stairs came 5 or 6 little bouncy balls (You know, the kind which are tiny, choking hazards to children and bounce like motherfuckers)  Now, in order for the bouncies that were in my room to come down the stairs, they'd have to roll out of my room, down a corridor, turn left twice and then bounce down.  Here's the funny bit.  *Mine were still in my room*   My sister didn't own any. She wasn't awesome enough.   I'd imagine just holding it out if your arms are long enough (Or if the chainsaw is shorter), then stabbing yourself with it.   [](/pinkamina)   Making a Re-entry, Commander Shepard style   I'm in Warehousing and Transport. I like the transport side of things, but the warehousing is monotonous and boring as all hell. But it gets stuff shipped countrywide, so I guess I'm doing a good job.   If it's just a quick, write a list and you get whatever's on that list..  House for me. House overseas for the parents, when they retire, Spain most likely. House for my sister and her boyfriend, just to shut 'em up  Clear all current loans. Buy a new car for me, nothing flash, though!  Buy a bunch of tailored clothes, because I'm sick of wearing Jeans and graphic tees. :(   It's been 5 years, but every time your name comes up on the Instant Messenger and we talk, the memories come flooding back.  I don't think I'll ever be fully over you.. It's probably why I'm not even slightly interested in dating still.    Well, as I open the most played playlist on my phone..

I've raid healed on a druid (85) in ToC before, but druids and paladins are totally different. xD   I can heal... when I eventually get back to playing properly.

Full time Warehouser/Van Driver/Techie for 5 years, Engineer's Assistant for a year before that.  I keep the Ponies and IRL seperate.

When it comes to society breakdown, or invasion - us brits are screwed. xP I wouldn't even know where to begin looking to find a firearm.  I got lots of sharp pointy things. Do they count? (I'm an avid weapon collector. Got various axes, swords and daggers mounted in my room)   Sorry. I mean I'd just forget the doors were smaller, and bash my head on the top of the doorframe.  I type like I talk. :D   Hide in the woods. As long as I was quiet about it, I doubt they'd come looking for me. Take a lot of tinned food and see how long I'd last. Sneak out and scavenge shops for more tinned, precooked food.  I'd be a terrible fugitive.   I'd say the same, but only if I was a pony myself. Those doors are tiny, I would slip up and twat my head on a door many times.  [](/hahaha"Because Ponies are awesome.")   What?! Sweet is outdated?  Fuck.   Hell, I still kind of like them. Their new album I can quite happily listen to. I listen to music to fill the day, I don't listen for imperfections, or genius.  It's a band (or a person) who's picked up an instrument, or sang, put it on a CD so I can listen to it.  I'm not gonna give anyone shit for listening to anything.  Haters gonna hate.   Could be, though I'm not sure how they'd get in the space between my floor and the kitchen roof.  Hell, how they'd even get in the house is a question in itself, I have a dumb, lovable dog and 2 bastard cats which attack anything that moves.   Every single night, about 1am-ish, there's a scratching in my floor. It doesn't wake me up, I just hear it if I'm awake.   At first, I thought it was my dog, scratching at something downstairs, but one night, I was downstairs and I heard the scratching above me.  I've been hearing it since I moved in, about 13 years ago. I want to know what it is!   [](/derpwizard)I derp'd     I saw some "Malteaster" chocolates in Mid November. Kinda did a double take at the petrol station I was at.   Not sure.

No harm done, but I will be checking properly every few weeks from now on...

 Written by Kenneth Kohl (kowale). This is a long read that began as a single short story on Creepypasta. More parts of the series were provided and it was eventually combined into one large work. The Remover has gathered a considerable fan base since its original posting, and has since been incorporated into a full-length novel of the same name.  Part 1  When I left my office, I already had a premonition that something awful was going to happen that evening. Im not psychic. I am quite perceptive, though, and the signs were easy to read. I had worked late  nine oclock and already dark  and my ordinarily enjoyable walk to the parking lot struck me as a little bit menacing. I parked in a lot that was about a ten minute walk from my office. In the early evening on a crisp autumn day its a pleasure to stroll there and take in the sights of downtown Indianapolis. Occasionally Id take a detour and walk along the canal, checking out the street art. This was past nightfall, though, and right in the middle of a hot and humid August. There were only two sorts of people in downtown Indy that night  those who had to be, and those who had no place else to go.  My walks always took me past the Wheeler Mission. There was a flashing neon sign reminding me that Jesus Saves every ten seconds. The mission was a magnet for the homeless. A lot of my sort of people ended up there, but some others as well. Addicts, mentals, criminals on the run and looking for a meal and a place to stay. According to the missions rules felons were usually turned in, so the police visited regularly. None of the citys finest sitting outside that night; just a collection of bums waiting to scam some loose change off of whoever happened to be out on this humid night.  One of the panhandlers called out to me. Hey! Can I talk to you sir? Can I ask you a question? Are you afraid of homeless people? He was young, maybe pushing thirty. He was clean-shaven and had a number of tattoos running up his arms and neck and ending just shy of the bottom of his dirty red baseball hat. The design hinted at a former stay in prison.  Every one of them always has a story. Its typically well practiced and smooth. A bum tells his story so many times that he begins to believe it himself. He gets into his character and will debate at length on the subject of why he needs money. The stories can get quite elaborate and sometimes amusing, if you have the time. But unless you want to be followed all the way back to your car or to the door of your office its best to just say No or Sorry. That night, I was feeling antsy and just wanted the conversation to end quickly, so I opted for Fuck you.  Red Hat responded in kind. At first he stopped in his tracks, looking sort of stunned. Then he started following me. You think youre better than me? Dont you walk away from me. Then he grabbed at the back of my shirt. Thats when I knew for sure that things were going to end badly.  I shrugged him off. I could have easily outrun him at that point, but I didnt. I dont know if it was pride or arrogance; or if it was due to the fact that I was tired, irritable and in an excessively bad mood. I did start walking faster, though. I hoped that he would tire of the game and go back to his roost outside the mission. I hoped that the situation wouldnt go any further.  Then I saw a chance to end the game. There were two routes to my car  one being along a well lit, albeit virtually deserted street and the other a slightly shorter route through a small alley behind the Robertson Parks church. I aimed myself toward the alley. I could still hear Red Hat shouting behind me, but I was doing my best to ignore him. Where you going man? Stop! I want to talk to you, he said. I had a pretty good idea that when he saw me heading towards the alley, he thought that he had me beat. How stupid did he think I was? I knew that once we were alone, Id have the upper hand. I could either disappear into the shadows or, if necessary, kick his ass. What I didnt know, however, was that he had a couple of friends waiting for him.  They must have seen us head off and circled around the block. Its like they were expecting me to walk through that alley. For them, it was the perfect place for an ambush. Ill have to admit that I was startled when I first saw them. I had allowed myself to get too distracted. Not only by Red Hat, but by the anxiety that Id been experiencing since leaving my office. The two buddies, dressed similarly and tattooed like Red Hat, stood at the far end of the alley. In addition to seeing their silhouettes I could smell them from where I stood. I stopped dead in my tracks when I saw them. Red Hat closed the distance behind me and pushed me further into the alley. Then the other two approached and boxed me in.  One of them pushed me and laughed. What now, Chris?  Now we teach this little shit how to respect people, Red Hat replied.  I had backed up against the wall of the church. Trust me guys. Bad idea, I said.  The one who had previously been quiet came forward and shoved me  hard  back into the wall. I remember feeling the back of my head bounce off the brick. Then he punched me in the stomach. As he drew back his arm to get ready for another swing, my arm flew out and I grabbed his head, palming his face like a basketball. I pushed backward and twisted his head as he fell. Thats when I saw Red Hats knife.  Red Hat had drawn his arm back as if he were going to pitch a softball underhand. He had the point of the knife aimed at me. He lunged, but I managed to grab his wrist and deflect his thrust. At this point I could no longer see the first of his two buddies  the first to punch me - but the other one landed another blow directly to my nose. That diverted my attention long enough for Red Hat to bring his knife around for another attempt. A thousand thoughts were racing through my mind. How could I have let myself get drawn into that situation? Why did they pick me? Why that night? How was it going to end? How was I going to handle the cleanup after it was over?  Between all of the distractions and the surprise punch to the face, I must have missed seeing the knife until the last moment. It sunk deep into me. Low, directly below my ribs and angled upward into the place where a normal man would keep his liver. The guy had been in fights before. He was a pro. I felt pressure, but not any actual pain.  Then I felt myself becoming very hot and my vision faded to white.  *****  When the numbness went away, I surveyed the scene in the alley. One of the guys  the one who managed to land a punch on my face  was running around the corner of the church screaming. Around me, there was blood all over the ground and even sprayed up onto the wall of the church. The guy whose face I had grabbed was lying prone nearby, his head cocked at an unnatural angle. His neck was clearly broken. It was Red Hat who surprised me most. He was lying at my feet eyes open, mouth frozen in a perverse smile, and throat ripped open. He looked like hed had a date gone bad with a table saw.  And all I could think of was how long it had been since Id last eaten.   Part 2  Dear R.,  I can no longer trust my own decisions. As you hear my story you will understand why. Right now, it will be enough to say that I cant focus, my thoughts are racing, and my emotions are taking over. Im in no condition to make the sort of decision thats necessary, and so Im asking for your help.  Im putting my unconditional trust in you. In order for that to happen you have to trust me entirely  and the only way that can happen is if you know the truth.  At this point I have no doubt that you believe Im insane and you might be right, to a point I believe that youll hear me out, though; if for no other reason than to find out how far gone I am. I sincerely believe that by the time Ive said what I have to say, youll believe me  if not before then.  Since others are involved, Im putting their lives in your hands, too. You must never repeat this to anyone. Im laying a great burden on your shoulders; but you owe me. I dont need to remind you why.  Just about every form of life begins in an embryonic stage. Interestingly, when we are in our embryonic stage we have two hearts. Two hearts! Can you believe that? This heart primordia, as its called, eventually fuses together into one heart with four chambers. Embryologists at the University of Indiana performed an experiment in the 1930s in which they kept the heart primordia from fusing in embryonic frogs. Amazingly, the frogs grew up with two hearts. They had extensive genetic damage, though, and didnt live very long.  But imagine for a moment that the same thing happened in nature, with greater success. Imagine that the heart primordia never fused in the embryo of an otherwise ordinary man. He could theoretically develop two hearts. Not that farfetched - humans have many redundant organs: two lungs, two kidneys, two eyes.  Are you with me so far?  The body is a system and that system normally runs at full capacity, so the addition of a second heart alone wouldnt make much of a difference. But there is an added potential. Suppose that this new creature (and I call it that because now weve taken a leap of faith and are no longer talking about your unremarkable homo sapiens) also develops a system that can exploit this additional power plant, much in the same way that an athlete can train his body to function at higher levels. It would require larger lungs, or perhaps even a third lung to provide additional oxygen. Other organs might be affected, altered, enhanced or even eliminated. The end result would be a creature possessing unimaginable strength, speed and endurance.  You can see where Im going with this, cant you? Such creatures do exist. This is as much of a fact as the sky is blue. I not only believe it, but I can prove it  will prove it  to you, in due time.  I wish that I was there with you now, so that I can more accurately gauge your reaction. Ill have to rely on your inquisitive nature and assume that youll continue reading. Since Ive told you this much already, I may as well elaborate further.  God, in all his goodness, had gone so far as to create these beings. Then Mother Nature threw in her own cruel little trick. You see, that second heart needs a way to get vital oxygen and nutrients to cells; and that way is through blood. Plasma to carry nutrients and red cells to carry oxygen. Blood is produced in bone marrow and spleen. An average, healthy man is blessed with just enough blood-producing tissue to sustain him. These creatures, however, being approximately the same size dont have the ability to produce any more blood cells than a normal man. Yet their two hearts continue to feed their bodies in overdrive. Left in that state they would literally starve or suffocate.  Nature is also forgiving. Taking advantage of their physical mutation, they have the ability to absorb plasma and red cells from the ingestion of the blood of other living creatures. The mechanism by which this works is too specific to go into. It wouldnt interest you anyway. Not at this point.  And so these pseudo-men have evolved, exploiting their superhuman strength and abilities to become the perfect hunter  after all, other living creatures arent too keen on the idea of donating their own blood to sustain the lives of these things. I call them things because thats what normal men consider them to be. Fiends. Monsters.  Im certain that you know what these creatures are. This fabulous, complex, species; homo sanguineous; no less Gods children than their human brothers; hated; abhorred have come to be called vampires.  But they are real. And I can prove it.

This fabulous, complex, species; homo sanguineous; no less Gods children than their human brothers; hated; abhorred have come to be called vampires.  But they are real. And I can prove it.   Part 3  There comes a time in every vampire's seemingly endless life when he reaches an age at which he begins to question his choices, doubt his past actions, wonder what mistakes he will continue to make in his future. Call it a midlife crisis. At this point one of two things usually happens. A vampire can accept who and what he is, or he can go insane. The latter more often than not ends in some form of suicide.  Vampires are not truly immortal. I think that a more appropriate term would be un-mortal, if there were such a word. Immortal suggests that they live forever, and thats just one of many myths about vampires. They are not graced  or perhaps I should say cursed  with eternal life. But they do live a very, very long time. And that leads to the especially worst aspect of being a vampire. They are almost guaranteed to outlive every one they love  the human ones anyway. Think about it: having to experience the death of all of your friends, making new friends, and seeing them die also over and over and over again.  Its right around the time that they begin to lose their second generation of friends that they realize whats happened, and worse, that it will happen again. Think about that for a moment, and take my word for it that no matter how many funerals youve been to it doesnt ever get any easier. It helps to believe that theres an afterlife.  Having your friends die off is only one of the things that a vampire will think of when he hits this age. He begins to think of all the things hes missed out on. Sometimes hell choose to never enter a relationship with a human because he fears what will eventually happen. Then hell wonder if he made a mistake by deciding on following that path.  And then he thinks about what he is  what he truly is. What his base instinct and purpose in life is. He feels cheated that hes had to hide his true self for all of the years hes been alive and that hell have to continue hiding it. He feels resentful that hell never be able to do what he really craves, what he hungers after  to hunt  without restraint.  Fulfilling ones purpose in life is of ultimate importance to every man: vampire and human alike. A person with no aspirations has no reason to go on living. So what is a vampire to do? His core desire, his meaning of life, is considered morally repulsive. Isnt it? After living amongst humans for most of his life he takes on their values and most vampires agree with acceptable human opinion. How is it that older vampires can hunt so easily with no heaviness on their consciences? Its during this midlife crisis that they begin to sort things out.  Most vampires, like most mortals, can eventually come to grips with whom and what they are. Some turn to religion. Sometimes it takes a good psychiatrist or regular sessions with a therapist to help them out. For most vampires, this means that they must abandon their empathy with mortals ideas of morality. (Not implying that vampires do not have their own set of moral standards.) This greatly increases the contentment with which they can live out the rest of their lives.   	3
 Dumb and Dumberer was a prequel. He's talking about the sequel.    Had a really bad trip and experiencing an eternity in an unexpected hell. It felt like years had passed in a few moments. Also minutes before, having a girl narrate exactly what I was feeling as it was happening. Drugs are bad, kids.    [Messed](http://i.imgur.com/cPcXE.jpg) with the levels to see if I could get a recognizable barcode for my phone to read and got [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=11247678 tbm=shop hl=en aq=f).    Very dreamlike.    ;D   She has literally thousands of pictures of her in the same pose with celebrities on her [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/sarahmonline). It would be really cool to see a 5 minute gif, but for my own sake, I'll stick to just the ones in the original post.   [Context](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/n84l2/my_sister_meets_a_lot_of_celebrities_thought_id/) since original post was deleted.      [Animated GIF complete!](http://i.imgur.com/5oOe4.gif)   Am I the only person here who has read Uzumaki by Junji Ito?   I would imagine it going something like this. http://youtu.be/oolu-k3tY-g?t=45s   I was literally JUST thinking about making this comic. Made [this](http://i.imgur.com/PVxdX.jpg) earlier today before I even read your post. I start off by boiling about 1/2 a cup of water, adding only about 3 tbsp of natural peanut butter and adding garlic powder, sesame oil, soy sauce, and Sriracha, and when I'm feeling a little cheery, a bit of vodka. Its so god damn delicious.   Awesome! Totally worked this time. You are a god amongst men.   Not working D:   Oh god,  definitely. My roommate's girlfriend tried using it like any other cooking oil and she almost burned down our apartment. The smell was awful.    I use it in tons of different Asian style recipes. It's great for quickly adding a nutty sesame flavor, and is quite potent in a few drops. I also use it a lot for when I marinate stuff.   Quick dipping sauce recipe for pot stickers and dumplings  - 2 tbsp soy sauce - 1/4 cup water - few drops of sesame oil - 1tsp of brown sugar   Definitely use a natural peanut butter over the kiddy sugary kind. I probably should edit that.    If you got it, by all means use it. The recipe works either way.    A few days covered in the fridge. Keep it in some tupperware and it should last you a week or so. If you make a really good batch, it shouldn't have to last that long ;D   Try some roasted red pepper. Maybe even throw in some sriracha.   My local grocery store's cheapest can of tahini is exorbitantly expensive at about $15 (even with a pretty good Arabic population) and might not be as easily found in some places. I also went through the supply I did buy rather quickly. It could be found online for pretty cheap, so I might just do that in the future and revise this recipe, but for now, this is a quick and dirty way to get hummus without having to pay too much for it at the grocery store. Its also far and away a better alternative then most recipes I see that don't use tahini.   I used unmixed, unsweetened peanut butter in this recipe. Using something like Jif or Peter Pan adds a little more sweetness, but I wouldn't go out of my way to add sugar to the hummus.    Its a pretty good approximation, especially if you use something similar to Naturally More peanut butter where you have to mix in the oils before you eat it. Something premixed like Jif or Peter Pan is going to have a lot more sugar and probably make your hummus sweeter, but not so much that its inedible.   I haven't tried it without. It might be totally fine, but that's how I've been making it and I think its supposed to add a nutty flavor. If you're allergic to peanuts, it might be worth seeking out actual tahini, but from experience, it does come at a premium.     	25

Agreed. These bonds between receptor and ligand also have differing association/dissociation constants, meaning the ligand/receptor can be together for varying amounts of time. Some very short, some nearly permanent. This all has to do with the relative associative forces bringing the molecules together, and it's balance with the repulsive forces pulling them apart. Things like electrical charge, simple diffusion, conformational changes in the receptor shape...they all can help push things back apart, and work against the non-covalent bonds that are formed.   Capsaicin is a strong activator of a transient receptor potential (TRP) channel called TRPV1. This channel is found on sensory nerves and plays a role in nerve signal conduction. The neat thing about capsaicin is that it is also a strong desensitizer of TRPV1 - so much so that it can actually cause the amount of TRPV1 protein expressed on sensory nerves to decrease for extended periods of time. Less TRPV1 = less sensitivity to capsaicin = less burning-mouth perceived by you. I mean, it's not really "hot"; it's just perceived as such due to activation of TRPV1 channels. No TRPV1 means bland food, no matter how much capsaicin you put in it.   Euchre. Well-known in the Midwest US, but otherwise not so much (it seems). Three and 4 player iterations exist.   	4

Can't I get at least two minutes of hate anymore?   I don't get [no respect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCVR_ajL_Eo).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Nothing beats Mossad's dental plan though.    They even cover cab rides to and from appointments.     [No respect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZCVR_ajL_Eo)!   Come on, everyone knows you only got to be a moderator via magic powers.   You hypnotized people into making you a moderator.      Just like me.      The guy from 60 Minutes I miss the most is Ed Bradley.   He was great.    With a side of butt hurt.    I'm /u/Bechus, and AL is /u/ProbablyHittingOnYou.      Team..... Can't they just use the proper name: Mossad Golem Project Ice Cream Foundation.       That guy is such a big old evil agent of Mossad.    I heard he ate a live baby once.     Dude, I'm just with Mossad.   To find out if Rito is an arm of the NSA you'll need to check with /u/Agentlame.   CIA can be contacted via /u/Karmanaut.    /u/Bipolarbear0 is the representative of the Walmart Agency.     I'm sorry, but shilling for a gaming company only gets you a T-shirt.    The hats are only for employees of intelligence services.    And our space lizard overlords.     For the record, I was [cast as Tyrion Lannister](http://np.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/24w9xh/nsapril_revolution_leader_uhonestduanes_shadowban/chbahp0?context=3) and I'm not giving that part up.    They can be Cersei, but she isn't really a member of House Lannister anymore, since she married Robert.  They're the weird people who sleep with their siblings.      Who would want to control such a place?   I have better things to do with my time.   Like root out spam infestations.     Let's get these things straight.   I work for Mossad.   /u/Agentlame is an NSA wunderkind.      As if either of us would stoop to work for the crappy CIA.   Do we look like /u/Karmanaut?    All down votes for me are currently counting as up votes.  Thanks the counter measures built into Reddit.   So, thank you for your unwitting support.    Oh, I am sure the admins are on it.   As it is right now now...... all votes for me, regardless of their being up or down votes, currently count as up votes.  The more they down vote me, the more comment-karma I earn.    It's kind of funny to watch.     We asked him to remove his Bird Mask.  After repeated requests we discovered the horrible truth: It's not a mask.     But, you're an evil /r/History moderator.  You would think that.    Oy vey.    I love /u/Agentlame too.   That guy is great.   He makes the best brownies for the /r/Food mod team pot luck breakfasts.     This is a useless discussion to have in that subreddit.   These are people who think everything is slavery and rape except for actual slavery and rape.   Which they are sure aren't all that bad really.    Which means logical communication with them is inherently impossible.     That is a good idea.   I will look into maintaining a list.   I've added it to several subreddits I mod.  I was an early adopter of it.  It's a very decent tool.    Slaves do not get paid hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.   That's why Universal Health care is not slavery.     Slaves are not highly paid.      Probably just burning sulfur.  Nothing to worry about.    Thank you.  Added those to the list.     In /r/Cancer we see a lot of  phony "I'm sick, I need money" spam submissions.  To the point that we were forced to ban fund raising entirely.   99% of them are really spammers or scammers.       The subreddits I mod do a lot of that.     It's a good way to limit the impact of the spammers.   But they still need to be reported to /r/spam.      When you have a young subreddit, you have to submit a lot of content yourself.    Also mention is **when appropriate** in comments in other subreddits.      * Advertise it via places like /r/newsubreddits and via a nicely worded one-time self-posts in related subreddits.   One-time means one-time.   If you do more than that, the mods of those subreddits may take offense and the users may start to think you are just being a jerk/spammer.    * You can also politely ask other mod-teams to list you on their sidebar.  But sometimes they will say no.   Be gracious when they decline your request.  If they think your a jerk, then they may block you entirely.  * Ask some users who you see submitting similar content elsewhere to also submit to your subreddit.   If you like them a lot, maybe ask them to be a mod.    And continue to submit content to it. This is the most important thing.   The more stuff you submit, the more people may take notice of it.   If there is no new content, then even if somebody discovers it months later, they won't come back again.      Let's cut this on to the chase.  Question: Does believing the earth is 6000 years old make you "an idiot"?       Answer:  Yes, it does.     You know Hitler and Elvis share a second floor walk up in Cleveland.  But they had to evict Jim Morrison for not paying his share of the rent.     So far reddit moderators are still going undetected by society-at-large.    The plan is working.      For our purposes it is the same picture.   Removed!   Yes, it is.  This repeat submission has been removed.    The Duggar family, even without all the weird religion and stuff, is still just weird.  To be honest, revelations like this about a family of 19 kids.... not a huge surprise.   These are very weird people.    Throw in the very, very Mormon beliefs, the TV show, the extreme right wing politics, and it all was bound to spin out of control into something very bad.     I don't know if it could have been prevented with all that crazy spinning all around.     Are you the Warl.....  Hummm.... might kill me like a Warlizard.  Never mind.     I'm sorry, but this submission has been removed.

 will do!      I read somewhere a while back that it was Michael Jordan who accidentally started the look. After he went pro, he continued to wear his "lucky" college shorts underneath his NBA uniform, making his NBA shorts ride a little lower. People tried to copy the cool lower-riding shorts...fast forward... ankle pants!   There is, they have to sign it for us to work on it, and those never hold up in court... :/   If she was a former employee, she knows how easy it is to get money from big retail corporations. Best Buy normally tries to settle things like this out of court... I would assume since it IS going to court that Best Buy has substantial doubt.   When someone actually PAYS you to do the service though, you run the risk of them perpetually saying the problem was never fixed and you become almost indebted to them. Fix it quick and free and there is no further obligation to assist them and if they are being annoying about it, you can politely decline since money isnt on the table.   As a former employee, they go over all of this like CRAZY. Data privacy is Geek Squads #1 priority.  I'll preface that I could care less whether Best Buy loses money getting sued. BUT, everyone has an anti-corporation mentality, so 95% of the time that people take Best Buy to small claims, they win since everyone assumes that they MUST have been screwed over because it was a corporation.   Some examples include: Guy left his laptop to get fixed, takes a few days and he never comes to pick it up. In our system, we had over 20 logged calls to both his numbers, and 2 letters that he had to sign for saying we were going to recycling his computer if he didnt pick it up. He even signed paperwork saying he would pick it up within 30 days of us calling him, and store policy is keeping it for 120. We recycled it after 8 months, and he came in 3 months later looking to pick it up. Apparently the settlement was twice the ORIGINAL value of a 4 year old laptop. Guy brings in a TV that Best Buy had never sold and it has a hole in the screen. He said he purchased an extended warranty (doesn't cover damage like that anyways) but no one could find a receipt of it, obviously. Same thing, settled for an amount WAY higher than its worth.  Also, the services may seem expensive to someone who knows what they're doing, but to older people that have no other method of learning or getting things fixed, it was a useful service that many people told me that they were grateful we even OFFERED them.  TL;DR: Yes, people take HUGE advantage of corporations. In my experience, if you legitimately got screwed over, the managers would bend over backwards to help since they knew if legal action is ever taken, they lose.   49 cents for shipping    The news is reporting an 8 year old boy was among the two dead, so hopefully at least one of the girls made it.   Use www.ninite.com. You can do all your updates in one go and it doesn't ever download any crapware!   I 100% agree, the price gouging is ridiculous and no one needs $200 HDMI cables. I'm also not saying that unscrupulous salesmen are around... BUT the extra $$ on items is essentially the cost of having a sales staff at your disposal that can answer questions and give you face to face customer service... something that makes no difference for ME, but for many people, especially older generations, face to face interactions are a requirement, they simply don't want to or dont trust other methods.  Everyone uses the HDMI example when refering to price gouging as it is probably one of the worst products this happens with (and as someone that has a better than average perception of A/V theory, expensive HDMI is bogus). Otherwise, the prices aren't really that outrageous. Compare prices with newegg sometime, they're almost always the same.  Before I worked retail, I would have argued all the same points as I too thought it was ridiculous, but once you realize how desperate a lot of people are, you realize the services offered, albeit expensive, are a huge resource for many people. I have tons of stories of me telling people cheaper/better options, but they want to spend the money for a large variety of reasons.  I've heard countless tales of people coming from Mom and Pop stores with horror stories, just like any huge retailer. I've also seen ridiculous customer service, e.i. people dropped their brand new TV and got a new $2000 TV, something that would be difficult to do online or at a mom and pops shop.   I personally agree with a lot of what your saying, but there's a whole other perspective you probably haven't seen or experienced that changes a lot of things   Yes, this is true, but you clearly know how to use the internet. The majority of people out there are clueless when it comes to new technology and need to go into a store to actually be able to talk to someone about what they need. That extra service (and the convenience of having it right there) will cost you extra sometimes.   Also,Best Buy price matches Amazon, Newegg, tigerdirect, etc... and a lot of other big box stores do similar price matching   For those not familiar with Windows 8, there is a "Live tile" for your photos, that automatically scrolls through anything in your pictures library. Well... some guy came in for us to take a look at his new 27" All-in-one PC. I set it up and begin on the paperwork. When I turn around to look at the computer, which was facing the customer, the Live tile was scrolling through pictures of the man getting a blowjob from some white woman. The bad part was that the woman he came in with was black. The next few minutes while I was finishing up the paperwork were very cringe-worthy as I didn't my counter to erupt into a Maury episode if the woman were to glance over, luckily she didnt.   A nice family came in to purchase a new computer (iMac) and wanted all their data transfer from their old PC to the new one. I ended up dealing with the family substantially more than than a normal customer because the first Mac had some issues out of the box and we had to swap it. Anyways... Data is transferred, everything is good. Mom, dad, son and daughter are all super excited to get the new computer home.   About an hour and a half later, I get a scathing phone call from the previously friendly mother accusing me of putting porn on their new computer. I try to explain to her that there is no reason I would do that (It would take time, they were nice customers, i could get fired?!) and tell her to come in so we can investigate.   As it turns out, when they opened up their photo viewer for the first time, it populated ALL photos on the computer... including all the uncleared temp files which included some heavy fetish porn and gore. The priceless part was explaining this to the furious mother as both her son and husband were bright red standing right next to her.    You have two refrigerators?!

SOG's Pentagon Elite series has a similar look to the mini-convert although it is a larger knife   I had a lady bring in her keyboard and insisted I take the viruses off of it. After trying to explain that virus's can only infect the "box" everything connects to, she asked me to remove the virus's from her computer...at home... with the keyboard I had in store. When I told her that would be impossible and the would have to bring the computer in, she insinuated that I was incompetent at my job... :/         *Be adventurous, take reasonable risks.  *If you don't like something, change it; if you can't change it, stay positive and deal with it the best you can.   *Bad things happen, you WILL get over every single thing and grow from it.  *Dealing with the fallout from things you procrastinated is almost always more difficult than doing the work in the first place.  *Keep an open mind, always learn, and LOVE LIFE!

I currently live in Skagway and work as a tour guide if anyone has questions!   No, no! I've toured all over the lower 48 and I'm currently working a seasonal bike touring job in AK. My contract ends in September and I'm looking for another seasonal position outside the U.S.  Alaska is great!!    I'm trying to find a seasonal position somewhere preferably outside the U.S.  I've been leading cycling tours all around the U.S. for the past few summers and currently, I'm a cycling guide in Alaska. I'm an engineering student trying to get some worldly experience before I jump into the "real world". Thanks!!

 We get a 30% discount, but Amazon still sells their books cheaper. Amazon is my shit, but don't tell my manager. The 40% discount at the cafe is actually great tho. I started in October 2014, so I haven't been working here too long, and it's just a part-time job because I'm 18.   The weekdays are typically super slow, especially if you're back in the music/dvd section, where I usually work. Sometimes I'll have only like four or five customers within 4.5 hours. I don't even know why that section is even still open. The weekends get a little better. The B N I work at is part of an outdoor shopping complex and when there are special events at the complex we get a shit ton of customers, mostly annoying 13 year olds.   At any time, our most requested books are ones that kids have to read for school like Macbeth, A Brave New World, Animal Farm, etc. This being Texas, bibles and American Sniper are really popular.   Are you as totally fucking psyched to finally leave high school as I am?   A couple week ago a young guy came in reeking of weed and pizza and asked if we had a Raising Farm Animals for Dummies book. We actually had something similar but he ended up just getting a magazine.  	4

I'm happy to help, just hit me up whenever you've got a question and I'll help as much as I can :)   Happy to help :)   I think body spray would work, just use as little as possible on your hands. a bath would probably work in the same way, I just don't know how long after the bath their natural odors would return. Which I think is why my vet told me to try the cologne/perfume/spray route first, because it completely masks their natural scents for a good amount of time. you may also need to do it for a few days, but once a day only. my two fought like hell when I first introduced them, and I did it for I think 2-3 days. the fighting gradually toned down and they became best friends :)  I'd suggest cleaning the cage too, help remove some of the male's scent. Don't worry about toys and stuff that aren't washable, they shouldn't be too big of a problem. But if you want, try and remove them after you neutralize their scents, and put the toys back after a couple days. Make up for the lack of stimulation by handling them more, both at the same time. I did the same with mine.   Something that worked for me when I introduced a new friend to my little man, is to put a dab of cologne or perfume on your hand and pet them both. the tiniest amount possible and rub it over both hands. it neutralizes both scents and helps ease them into spending time together.

 One of the best things I have ever read on Reddit.    Real laughter was produced.   I am going to go against the grain and say Ned Stark would make an amazing King. Ask yourself where we would be today in the world of Westeros if Ned was king instead of Robert. The kingdom would not be in debt, no bastard children, the people would be well taken care of and justice would be handled properly. I also don't see treachery getting as close to Ned as it did Robert, as the latter made increasingly bad decisions over the course of years (as king, and with his wife) to end up in the situation that he was in.     Like...shaving?   Regardless of whether you agree with the current wars we are involved in, the man is putting his life on the line in the defense of our nation. That deserves thanks.   EDIT: Not saying you were disrespecting him or anything. I apologize if it comes off that way.    Yeah, probably $300-$400 worth.   You probably hear this a lot, but Thank You  EDIT: ...and have an upvote   MEG!   It has been a while for me, but didn't Theon claim Robb "King in the North" first in aGoT?   That song was amazing. Also, now I suddenly have the strong urge to play a JRPG...   You are not redoing the animations, just tweaking them.    That seems like something to me that can be easily remedied. It is not some game breaking combat glitch or graphical issue.    As well as new melee attacks (which look to be class specific). Also weapon mods, more customization under skill trees, smarter AI, and more responsive controls.  Plus, you are also only taking into account the combat we have seen thus far. There also looks to be some pretty cool on-rails combat sequences as well as a much more epic scale to the battles.    This game doesn't come out until March, so I think there is more than enough time to smooth out the animations on characters.    Knowing BioWare, Mass Effect 3 is probably going to be a lot more than that.    I would visit newegg.com and look at some of the available laptops they have on their website. Usually there are user reviews that accompany each laptop that will speak towards their gaming performance.    thanks for the advice! :)      [For if the IGN link doesn't work...](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQH3_Fydt-4)      Am as I.   I second this. Could use a new desktop background.    Not how I pictured him but HBO knows what they are doing.    Exactly how I pictured him.       I could only get to the 54 second mark before I could watch no more...   and this is the post that should be upvoted.    Will it ever stop? Yo, I don't know.    And it worked.  The only part I heard...   R'hollor be praised    See, it sounds like you're trying to rape them.  Sea: It sounds like you are trying to rape them.     See, it sounds like you're trying to rape them.  Sea: It sounds like you are trying to rape them.    Lets just say that Jon snow was killed by his attackers, then was brought back to life. That would mean that his vows would have been fulfilled, and he no longer is bound to the Nights Watch.  *Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my **death**.*     Yes, it was from Winterfell. In my OP, I was referring to the fact there was no raven from Winterfell sent to the king at Kings Landing.    There was never a raven sent from Winterfell bearing news of the battle to Kings Landing.   This. There should/would have been a raven from Winterfell if Stannis was defeated.    I would have to agree with your last statement. Theon and Jeyne are both with Stannis last we read, so if Stannis truly was defeated then it stands to reason that he would already have found Jeyne and Theon again.   Mance probably gave up that Jon sent him, but I doubt that in that short span he was able to defeat Stannis as well.    I just finished aDwD and was pretty pissed off when I read that Jon was killed. You have just gave me a small glimmer of hope.   I have been eyeing it up for a while, but was always afraid to click...haha   Just a thought, but I think it would allow a lot more people to discuss the events of the book without having to worry about accidently running into spoiler events from later on in the book.    What if there was alcohol involved?   It should be noted that you cannot have sex temporarily. I don't see this as such a big issue. The man that you are with is probably going to spend a lot of time with you "working" on your condition, so it's not like any kind of sexual interaction is off the table. Also, the potential payoff should things turn around is pretty high.    Yeah, I think was important to show these people so the reader can understand the motives behind their decisions.    I liked it a lot. Jaime's chapters were great, as well as Brienne's. I also thought the way Cersei's character developed over the course of the book was pretty interesting.    He doesn't count Jon as one of Catelyn's children  	45
       Personally, I always had an image of Ginny in my head that looked just like this:  http://img2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120326220605/disney/images/7/76/Goofy-disneyscreencaps_com-1634.jpg         I just moved states and I want to get back into playing netball.  I live in Croydon, so would like a team near there. Any night suits. I am of average skill and fitness, in it just for fun :)         I just moved into a new house and I now have a whole cupboard just for crochet!  It is a double-door wardrobe, with only a shelf up top and no cross beam for hanging, so I need to fit it out myself.  So, show off your organisational skillz here people! I wanna see inside your cupboards and get some ideas :)                     What odd thing do you waste your money and time on, and can I learn how to do it?            I keep seeing happy predictions, but more often it is the dark things that we remember more.   Who is going to be the next celebrity death?  Do you expect another attack on the West?  Who will go to war?  We will probably all end up on a list somewhere, but I am genuinely interested in what the pessimists think.  Edit: and by this, I mean next year, which for us Aussies is tonight                                       You've said "omg lawlz" so many times now, its no longer an insult and now you can't stop!   Not the big romantic gestures or anything. The mundane, the rediculous, the nonsensical.               I have taken to just saying "sneeze". They get their acknowledgement of bodily function, I don't have to bless them         The ridiculous, the redneck, the offensive, what are the worst names a parent of your country could call a child?  I wanna know what is the Chinese version of LaSquisha, the Indian version of Apple, and so on.  Also, who are your 'Chad' and 'Erins'?      I figured out how to create a sub, and then promptly made one just for the craftspeople of Melbourne.   So head on over to /r/MelbourneCrafters for tips, patterns, meetups, etc.  Get posting and enjoy!   Y'all know what to do. Post, share, chat and craft!   New to Melbourne, I recently had to give up my regular Stitch 'n Bitch crochet circle...so I am looking to make a new one!  I am thinking that a city park would be a great meet-point as it will be a sunny 28 on Sunday. I will be temporarily at Camberwell (usually in Croydon) but don't really know the area, so I am open to suggestions. If we were to make it a regular thing, we would need to decide on a more permanent spot.  So is anyone keen? I don't mind if you are a bare beginner, as I have taught a few of my friends before. I am just looking to enjoy the great company of fellow hookers :P  Me: 25 f, Scientist, crocheting for 2 years   1:30pm Fitzroy Gardens. Bring blanket, tools and snacks if you want. We will meet at the south east corner and find a spot from there :)  Edit: Look for the girl on the blue blanket!      http://i.imgur.com/T5VECQu.jpg  The girl and her arm on the righr are ruining this picture. It's not an important pic, but I'd like it if someone wanted to challenge themselves and give it a go! :)  Extra pics to help with my shirt pattern?  http://imgur.com/a9qur2C  http://imgur.com/MG31wG0      I just moved to Victoria from Queensland, and bought a house out at Croydon. In the meantime, I am staying with family at Ringwood.  Locals keep suggesting that Ringwood and Croydon are unsavory areas, which confuses me, as they seem lovely.  I am starting to think these people don't have a good grasp on what mkes somewhere truly scummy.   These people need to go on up to QLD; spend some time at Sunshine, Caboolture or Nambour stations THEN talk to me about scum.  Am I wrong here?      Today is my first day exploring the city after moving here from QLD. I am at Flinders St station and need suggestions for lunch!  Any food type, so long as it is tasty. Probably would prefer to sit and eat.   Yesterday we arrived after driving all the way from Brissy.   I am exhausted now, but once I am feeling human again I will want to start enjoying this fab city. Currently, I am based in Ringwood, but will move soon with plans to buy in the same area.  If anyone has any general advice, offers of friendship or suggestions of cool places, I'd love to hear them! I need some friends, a gym, a hobby, sports, all the stuff I left behind.  I am a 24, female Medical Scientist. I love books, bike rides, fashion, tasty sweets, netball and crochet. I am chatty and energetic, love going shopping, and am always good for a conversation.   Has anyone got a casual netball team they need players for?  Or a crochet circle that needs another hooker?  Can't wait to start enjoying my new home!         Married to single?  Childless to parent?  Jobless bum to multimillionaire?  What has changed for you?         I know most people I talk to say that everything is different once you have your own kids, but I want to see if there are any ladies for whom this did not happen.  I just am starting to think about having kids soon but worry about my almost complete disinterest in almost every child I meet. I love my neices enough to spend large amounts of time with them, but they are the only exception and I am usually very relieved to return them to their mum afterwards.  I know women are meant to be all maternal and stuff, but I just worry that I haven't got what it takes.   Has anyone else been in this situation but had kids anyway? Did it change?  Sorry, if this is the wrong place to ask this.         There is that one customer that will always haunt your dreams. Be it because of pure gross factor, scariness, annoying behaviour or just hilariously angry            We all have them and I love hearing about the quirky little things minds do to keep occupied.      I was in a hardware store the other day, looking for some timber for a project. A little old man was in the same aisle, shuffling along while I looked over my choices, making sure they were straight.  As he came past me he leant in and said "You must be a carpenter, you look like you know what you are doing!"  I laughed and told him I wasn't but did know what I was doing.  At first I wondered the implications of what he said: That I must only know what I was doing if I was a carpenter. Why couldn't I not do carpentry as a trade and still know what I was doing?  But then I realised how uncommon it was for an elder man to make the assumption that I was a carpenter. Usually I would expect the assumption that my husband was one and I was running errands for him. He saw me as a strong, independant woman capable of doing a trade for a living.  It is something small and inconsequential, but it made me smile. I appreciated him for seeing me as woman, not a wife/girlfriend, and one who was perfectly capable of doing a "man's trade".

I was lying down in bed one night and my ears were roaring like I had just been to a concert. It was sudden, with my night before being normal and quiet. No injury or event happened that day as far as I can recall.  And it never went away.  Every night my ears roar and it makes it difficult to sleep because the world isn't silent.  During the day I get sporadic bursts of ringing/deafness in one ear. Sometimes it is so high pitched it causes me pain.  But lately something has changed. I hear noises that aren't there. It is most apparent when I am at work, late at night on a Call In and no one else is around.  I hear phones ringing, footsteps, doors closing and the distinctive tinkle of a bell that one lady likes to wear on her keys.  I brought it up at work once and everyone looked at me like I was crazy. I thought it was just my brain filling in the silence and figured it was normal.  So, is it normal? Do I reason to be concerned?  24 f Healthy weight, no medications aside from an Implanon which is a very recent change (2-3 months), non smoker, no other health issues   What do you have to deal with on a day-to-day basis that you are sure isn't a concern for the general population.   I am interested in seeing what others have to overcome daily so I might better appreciate my lucky lot in life.  Edit: I am indeed very lucky to have what I have, or not have what others have. Thanks for sharing!   I have lived in QLD my whole life, but my husband is a Melbournite through and through.   After living in Queensland for 6 years, he was keen to move back home and I have happily agreed. Goodbye Brisbane, Hello Melbourne. More specifically, NorthEastern suburbian Melbourne.  We make the move in a month and while I am moving with a local, one who knows a lot of ins and outs, I am keen to learn as much as I can for myself. Good cafes, crap suburbs, best hairdressers, etc.  So, sell yourself to me Melbourne, you minx.      Other mythologicl creatures to play a part in the final books?  Last night I had a bitchin dream that when Dany came to Westeros astride her dragon, with her two riders by her side, they were met in the air by Aegon and Co riding griffins. Awesome aerial battle ensued.  Now, we know dragons exist, giants, ice spiders and possibly unicorns do too but what other creatures could we plausibly expect to see, and do we really think that any of them would have a play in the final battles?  Be as tinfoilly as you want, I am just kicking around the Ideas Ball.            Ok, so I was playing social netball tonight and we were losing. Normally, I don't care a whole lot about the score because I am in it for the fitness but tonight, it was bothering me. I was getting frustrated that the ref was making a lot of petty calls against our team and ignoring them when the other team did the same thing. On top of this, their centre was constantly getting in my girls' faces and contacting them subtly so the stupid ref couldn't see.  I got sick of it, so I started sticking to her like glue. Wherever she went, I was on her. She started getting irate. Then, when I had my back to her trying to block her, she bumped against me to obviously draw a foul against me. Ref didn't see, so I bumped back.  She responded by slapping me *hard* on the arse!  I was like "wtf did you just slap me on the butt?!"  She denied it, of course. I pressed and said she did. Then she said it was an accident. The ref took her side and said it was just a general contact; part of the play.   I spun on him and said "I know what a fucking slap on the arse feels like!"   He threatened to send me off the court, to which I said "fine, if she goes!"  She wouldn't go and wouldn't admit anything. I called her out on her physical playing and she just stared. The ref was weak and once I showed him I wasn't getting off the court he just told the girl to apologise...which she wouldn't.  The whole situation ended with me just telling them to continue playing. The ref, the idiot, didn't try to resolve the issue and just allowed play to continue.  Later, when I looked at my cheeks, sure enough, there was a big red hand print.    The whole thing made me a lot madder than it should have, but I just couldn't believe she had the nerve to deny it, then to say it was an accident and than have the ref take her side. Like I said, I know when I have been slapped! Don't tell me what I felt!   I know this is petty and juvenile and not worth reading probably, but I just needed to vent and this seemed like the place to do it.

I am not looking for a Da Vinci and I want to keep it about $100 or under.  Thanks!   What is your bread-and-butter microscope view?  Share some pics of what you spend all your time and energy looking for each day   Like, those strawberry lollies that you just can't find in stores. Where do these mysterious items come from?!   And I can't believe it took me 24 years to watch it!!!  What a mastetpiece! It truly is a classic, in all senses of the word. The costumes, the sets, the music and Vivian Leigh!!! She floored me. She is so beautiful and powerful in that role. It made me so happy to have Scarlett as my namesake. She isn't nice, she isn't selfless...but she is *strong* and determined to have what she wants, and that made me love her. Yes, she was a fool when it came to love, but I guess that is what love does to us. It can make a fool of even the strongest of people.  The movie was an emotional rollercoaster and I loved every moment of it.  I stayed up til midnight to watch it and will be tired tomorrow but, frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.      I haven't felt truly impressed in a while, so give it your best shot            I am making a little monkey for a friend and I want to make a little bend in his legs so he can sit on edges on things. I dont really want 90, just a slight bend.  Any ideas on how can I do this without making two legs pieces and sewing them together?   Everyone in the world has one, I am sure of it, they just have to find them.  Who has found theirs? Were they cooler than you? How did you find them?   Not to judge or critique people's work, really. I just want to see what people have to share :)      As a book reader, I knew Sansa's mockingbird transformation was on the cards, so it felt nice and natural to me.   Although, I have the benefit of having her inner dialogue in my memory to supplement the scenes in the show.  So, tell me, did it feel natural to you? Was her badass transformation expected or did it feel contrived in any way? There was only really a few minutes of actual screentime between Meek Sansa and Badass Sansa, so I wonder if that was enough...   I only discovered this sub yesterday, so forgive me if this has been asked before.  In my early teens I began writing a fantasy story that, I felt, had great potential. Unfortunately life got in the way and I have ignored it for a long time. I want to get back into it, but upon reread, some aspects seem a bit contrived and...well, cliche.  What are some top topics, character traits, plots, etc that I really should avoid if I want to write a fresh fantasy?      I am captain of an amateur women's netball team called the Mix-Ups and we are in need of some players.  We play every monday night at Toombul Indoor Centre with games starting between 6:00 - 8:15pm.   It isn't a high-skill competition and we are all just in it for the exercise. Your skills can be old, rusty or non-existant; we don't mind as long as you have the enthusiasm!  Games are $14 each and that covers court hire, ref hire and sports insurance.  If you are keen, we have a game on monday night at 6pm. No commitment required. Just have a try and see if you like it :)      Who feels a sense of...emptiness after finishing a comissioned project?  It's like, "What do I do now?"      You don't get dust bunnies in your house...  you get yarn bunnies.               Sometimes changes for the good are the one of the reasons we love our SO, but I also want to hear the bad changes too.         It tries to sound like a love song but it just comes off as creepy   Let the peer psycho-analysis begin!               I like hearing the stories people have about small inanimate objects that show why they mean so much   Get it off your chest. We can stress about our burdens together :)      Hey Docs.  For a few years now I was under the impression that I had asthma. A doc in uni diagnosed me even after a few inconclusive tests (normal blood O2, good lung capacity, no lesuons in chest x-ray, no wheezing).   I do have low stamina for cardio, I get short of breath at times when it really doesn't seem like I should ( laying down for bed, watching TV) and I have had two 'attacks' (both while doing exercise). A puffer helps but I don't feel immediate relief, it usually takes a while.  It has gotten to the point where I am almost always short of breath and have to make an effort to take a good deep breath. I rarely feel satisfied after a yawn and I find myself trying desperately to suck in a little bit more air just to feel like I have enough.  It is really starting to get to me and I have spoken to a GP and he says it is psychological and I am just getting myself worked up which makes it worse. Is he right?

My father is a wonderful man, but has sometimes given me reasons to question his judgement...or at least his thought processes.   One Christmas I wanted a copy of The Da Vinci Code that had all the pictures of the churches in it (I love Roman architecture). He couldn't find it, so he gave me a book of Da Vinci's writings and drawings.  Close enough.  Another year I asked for a hammock. I told him specifically the one I wanted and where to get it. He got me one completely different and not really what I was hoping for, but it had stripes like the one I pointed out so I just didn't have the heart to fault him on it.  One time, just randomly he bought me a spellbook. I have no idea why, it wasn't my birthday. To this day I have never read it.  Anyway, all of these things have been funny little events that lead to me possessing things I never thought I would, and me appreciating my dad just for the effort he puts in.   But this birthday, I was serious. I wanted that bookset. I needed it. So, I gave my dad very clear instructions. I told him Game of Thrones bookset. It is *this* big, *this* much money and you can buy it from *this* shop.  Noticed my mistake yet?  So my poor dad went off in search of The Game of Thrones bookset. He went to the shop and looked around. He looked and looked and looked. Finally, after what he said was about half an hour he gave up. He headed over to a table in middle of the shop. He picked up a big set of books and took a quick glance at the back.   Dragons, knights, Queens and intrigue.  "This sounds like something YoureNotaGenius would read, I will get her this seeing as I can't find what she wants." And so he did.  Fast forward to my birthday and as I opened my present I noticed a look of apprehension my dad's face. I shrugged it off and kept opening.  I must have missed the look of confusion he surely would have had afterwards when I jumped up and gave him a hug, crying "Oh dad, it is *perfect*! Just what I wanted. Thank you so much!"  He finally got one right, and that was purely by chance.

          I watched the first episode of the season and the second made no sense. So I looked at the order of episodes on the wiki and it's completely different from Netflix.   Edit: I'm also down a few drinks so sorry for the grammar.       I really want an open air truck but the broncos are too expensive, the wranglers are too common, and there aren't any clean scouts around these parts. Is there any other type of open truck?       What did he do to you? I know that he spreads the party school rep, but that doesn't really seem like enough for most people I've talked to to dislike him.          The weight room in my high school has an assisted pull up machine. I have never seen one of those before in my life. Have I just not been looking hard enough or is it a rarity?          So yesterday I was weightlifting and one of the guys I was lifting with wanted me to do deadlifts. The form he showed me felt off but I went with it, legs straight and at shoulder width back bent when picking up the weight. After a few reps I felt a twinge on the lower right side of my back, initially I didn't realize what it was because it wasn't excessively painful, but I soon stopped when I realized ehat was happening. Since then I've had sort of a dull soreness in that lower right area of my back. I can't really feel it when I'm standing or lying flat on my back. Yesterday it seemed to go away when I was taking a hot shower. I really don't want to deal with a doctor but I also really don't want to screw up my back permanently. I know for certain that I won't use anymore free weights or do back exercises until I've researched proper form.  **tl;dr** Was deadlifting with straight legs and bent back yesterday and felt slight twinge. Today I have a sort of dull pain on the right side of my lower back that goes away when standing or lying flat. What do I do?  **edit**  I did a sort of stretching exercise and if I lift my knee so thet it's at a 90 degree angle while my body is turned to the right of my waist then when I put it down I feel a popping in my back.       My only riding experience is the MSF course. I was just offered a great deal on an FZ6 but I'm worried that it might be too much bike. I am a big guy, ~260 lbs so I have been looking for something bigger than a 250. My other options are an SV650 naked, and a ninja 500. I know the SV650 is tame for a 650 so I'm not as worried about grabbing too much throttle and launching myself to my death.      I really want to watch Common Law which aired for one season during the summer of 2012. It's a USA show so I'm surprised that it's not on instant.                      I've got two pairs of prescription ray ban sunglasses and now I need a non script pair for when I wear contacts, not looking to spend another $200.            I'm visiting SoCal and it seems like every other driver is looking at their damn phone, nobody signals their lane changes, everybody is going a good 10-20 mph over the limit, and there is debris everywhere. Holy fucking Jesus this place is insane. I feel bad for you CA riders. I could not ride here.  /rant.      We're staying about an hour south of SB but I'm going to go check out SBCC this week. Our entire group is coming. What can two high school seniors and four middle aged parents do in SB for a day?      How's it ride? How hard is it to build?  Is it comfortable for longer rides?    [For those that don't know what I'm talking about](http://www.rycamotors.com)         So I saw some scratches on my car today located below the driver's side headlight.  http://imgur.com/a/eN8rO#0  I don't know what did it. There have always been scratches there, but I'm not sure if they were that bad. I feel like if I was hit/sideswiped at some point,  or conversely,  scratched someone else unknowingly then I there would be scratches above those. I do tend to pull forward pretty far when I park so it could be damage from a bush but I'm not sure. Any ideas?               Are aviators and wayfarers still cool?      I'll be moving soon for college. The campus is sketchy to say the least... There are at least two days out of the year that I know for a fact I won't be able to keep my bike on campus, and there's still a lot of vandalism and theft and shit year round. Have any of you used a storage unit as a garage? I want to at least be able to take the bike out on weekends. I don't see why there would be any problems, but before I try to figure out the logistics I'd like r/motorcycle's opinion.   I'm not looking for anything difficult. Just looking for swooping curves and straights to really open the car up on. Preferably out in the country.       I had a Facebook friend "come out" as a polygamist today. He had recently been married but they got divorced. He is now in a relationship with a couple he met online.             I tried to watch Dallas, the remake of the show about the oil family, and I made it about halfway through the first season before I gave up. My mistake may have been trying to binge it, but it felt like it was just dragging on and a bit overly dramatic. Should I give it another try?   I tried to watch Dallas, the remake of the show about the oil family,  and I made it about halfway through the first season before I gave up. My mistake may have been trying to binge it, but it felt like it was just dragging on and a bit overly dramatic. Should I give it another try?            So I'll be attending a CCC in fall with the goal of transferring to a UC and becoming a resident. My parents will be sending me the maximum amount of money possible without claiming me as a dependent so that I can pay off tuition and housing. Now, my question is, once I become a resident can they claim me as a dependent again without putting me in danger of losing my in state tuition or residency?    I'm 18 and have about 100 lbs to lose, but the thought of having saggy skin for the rest of my life concerns me. I'm going to lose the weight regardless because that's a bigger issue, but as long as I'm at the very beginning stages of weight loss, are there any preventative measures I can take? I know I should take it slow, but I also want to lose as much as possible before college starts in august.         We've been debating for about 15 minutes now. I say no, he says yes, and the internet seems undecided. Unfortunately we're not able to test our respective hypotheses at the moment.             I've never really understood it because nobody is actively promoting rape or saying it's ok, and rarely do people defend rapists. But the term "rape culture" implies (to me) that most of society is actively promoting, committing,  and defending rape.   I really wanted to go to a mid-top tier UC as a freshman, but alas it proved to be too hard to do as an out of state applicant. I have made the decision to attend SBCC and attempt to transfer to UCSB, USC, UCLA, or any other solid California school. In an attempt to squeeze the most enjoyment out of my few years of higher education I have also decided to stay in a private dorm (Tropicana Gardens). My concern is that I was going through some posts regarding SBCC on this sub, and it seems like SBCC students are discriminated against. Apparently they are even forced to wear a wrist band to get into Isla Vista (wtf? I didn't realize that IV is a gated community). Will being a CC student cause me much grief? I'm mainly going to SBCC so that I can transfer into a good school, but I'd be lying if I said that stuff like Deltopia didn't help me make my choice. I don't want to get kicked out of parties or hassled for being a CC student. So, what's the deal? Will I be able to live happily alongside you guys?   So I'm going to be visiting SB with my parents during spring break to check out Isla Vista, SBCC, and downtown SB. I'm looking for a place where I can rent a scooter or a small motorcycle so that I can kind of explore without my parents. The only place that comes up on google is Moto Loco, but their website doesn't seem to confirm that they rent any motorized two wheeled vehicles. Any ideas?   It is one of the best war documentaries that I have ever seen. It's as powerful as Restrepo. The premise is that a tight knit group of childhood friends enlist in the National Guard together. They are deployed to Afghanistan in 2008. The movie starts with them preparing for their deployment, but by far the most powerful part is that they interview the family members as well as the soldiers during their deployment. Finally, it follows their transition back into society and their struggle with PTSD. It'll make you want to cry, it'll make you want to laugh, and it'll make you angry.                               So there's a really cool tour company located in Hawaii that I'm very interested in working at for a summer. A youtuber that I follow is friends with the owner and he is frequently featured in videos. I wouldn't work as a tour guide obviously, but if I sent him a resume with my qualifications and said that I'd be willing to do any job for near minimum wage, do you think I would get a response?  A bit about me, I'm in college and my work experience is limited. I'm studying business/marketing.         I was talking to a Hawaiian friend and he was complaining thaf nobody sells spam musubi here. Now I want to try it.      So I'm wondering if these are symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. [I posted a related question here yesterday](http://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1y1mg7/can_depression_cause_you_to_blur_or_confuse/)  So about six months ago a thought popped into my head. I won't say what it is because it makes me uncomfortable. Basically the thought was, what if I'm a (x)? From there it started spiraling out of control.  I couldn't get the idea that I'm a (x) out of my head. At first it was no big deal, but eventually whenever I started planning for my future (college, after college, etc) the thought would pop into my head and I would tell myself that I couldn't do the things I want to do for fear that I'm a (x) and won't be able to control myself. That made me sad, but I pushed on. Around two months ago (when i was at the peak of my depression) I had a horrible intrusive thought related to the idea that I'm a (x). Basically in reality the course of events went one way, but the intrusive thought took them another way. However, in the past day or so I haven't been able to separate the two in my memory. Consciously I know that one is false and the other is true,  but something in me keeps trying to convince me that the intrusive thought is reality,  which it is not. It's really messing with my head.   I decided to test this problem I have with keeping reality and my thoughts separate. Minor stuff was easy. If I told myself that on Monday I went out to lunch with John when in reality I went with James, could always pick out the lie. Same with very major stuff like when I tried to convince myself that I didn't get a traffic ticket two years ago. But there were some things that happened anywhere from two months to two years ago that I consciously know which one is the truth and which is the lie, but something in me says otherwise.    **TL; DR**   Consciously I can separate truth from reality,  but somethinv between my conscious and my subconscious is trying to convince me that something I imagined is reality.      I suspect I have depression. I plan on getting checked or tested or whatever, but something peculiar has been happening to me recently. I seem to be mixing a memory with an intrusive thought that happened at the same time (a month and a half ago) as the event I'm remembering. Now, I know which one happened and which one was the intrusive thought, but they're slowly becoming less separate and I fear that if this continues that I wont be able to distinguish them in 5, 10, 20 years from now. Now, the event in question happened during a two week span in which I was more depressed than I had ever felt in my life. Like I was seriously fucked up. I had a lump in my throat the whole time, intrusive thoughts were happening multiple times a day, I was nervous the entire time, I nearly had panic attacks. It was the first time I had ever thought to myself "Fuck... I need to get help". I was even crying when I was by myself which is very unusual for me. Now, my second question is, once I'm on meds, or my depression is gone, will it be easier to distinguish memories? One of the reasons I'm sure that I have depression is that I'm only 18, yet all of my memories have been blurring together. Like on thursday I couldn't remember whether several events had happened on monday, tuesday, or wednesday.   I suspect I have depression.

Tell me about the time you went dancing with the green fairy.         I've never owned a motorcycle but I've been wanting one for a while. Accidental broadcast has convinced me that owning a DS would be the bee's knees. I've got no more than 2750 to spend. Is there anything that's smaller than 500cc, reliable, and fun in that price range? I'm looking to do ~80% commuting and 20% trail, sand, forest type exploring.   There's a '99 WR400F on Craigslist in my price range if you think that's worth getting.       Their [Ninja Cafe Racer Kit](http://bluecollarbobbers.com/kawasaki-ninja-250-cafe-racer-aka-gpx-250r) intrigues me. How is the quality and ease of installation?                                 In the past if two countries were going to war with each other it was very easy for the respective Gov'ts to spread propaganda that demonizes the other country and it's citizens. Today I communicate with Europeans, Asians, and South Americans on reddit every day. I predict that most if not all of the wars involving first world countries for the rest of civilization as we know it will be fought against insurgents and disconnected third world countries.      I usually listen to the KNRQ morning show on 103.7 but lately I've been wanting to mix it up.  I don't really care about the music,  at least in the morning, I mainly listen for the banter.      She still doesn't think it's a good idea, but she agrees that squids inflate the crash data. [The findings can be found here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_findings_in_the_Hurt_Report)  Some interesting points:  23) Motorcycle riders with previous recent traffic citations and accidents are overrepresented in the accident data.  24) The motorcycle riders involved in accidents are essentially without training; 92% were self-taught or learned from family or friends. Motorcycle rider training experience reduces accident involvement and is related to reduced injuries in the event of accidents.  27) Almost half of the fatal accidents show alcohol involvement.  35) Motorcycle riders in these accidents were significantly without motorcycle license, without any license, or with license revoked.  43) Seventy-three percent of the accident-involved motorcycle riders used no eye protection.  44) Approximately 50% of the motorcycle riders in traffic were using safety helmets but only 40% of the accident-involved motorcycle riders were wearing helmets at the time of the accident.  55) Less than 10% of the motorcycle riders involved in these accidents had insurance of any kind to provide medical care or replace property.                        I started a circlejerk. Damn you, Reddit.      I've got school, so I can't get a job. I plan on selling stuff on ebay, but how else?                     http://www.superdrugsaver.com/  They've got [provigil generic](http://www.superdrugsaver.com/generic-medicine/451/Provigil.html) and [nuvigil generic](http://www.superdrugsaver.com/generic-medicine/563/Nuvigil.html)      **My 5 Questions:**  1. By making this movie you have become more (in)famous than ever before. 20/20 hindsight,  do you regret making it?  2. Did all of the drugs you took leave any lasting damage?  3. Do you think that the sentence you got was fair considering how many people you swindled?  4. What is your greatest regret?  5. How accurate was the scene where you were on qualuudes and trying to save Jonah Hill's character?   **Public Contact Information:**   http://jordanbelfort.com/  http://jordanbelfort.com/contact_us/   The term "mass shooting" has become synonymous with aimless killing, usually involving schools, or someone firing into a crowd. But I've noticed that recently many shootings that would have been reported on as gang violence five years ago are being called mass shootings. The same goes for murders perpetrated in a public place.       Victor Pride from [Bold and Determined](http://boldanddetermined.com/) does a great job of introducing people to nootropics, or life hacks as he calls them. He does an especially good job of [introducing people to Modafinil](http://boldanddetermined.com/2012/07/12/become-mighty-modafinil/). Here's the issue, he makes it seem like using nootropics, especially modafinil, will turn you into a Greek God capable of taking on armies and solving the riddles of the universe. He makes it seem like if you pop some modafinil today, then tomorrow you'll wake up as a billionaire. The issue is that when Victor Pride tells some kid that using Modafinil is going to be like using NZT-48, and it isn't, that kid is either going to tell everyone and their mother that nootropics are modern day snake oil, or he's going to try something stronger, like a high dose of adderall. I think that while he introduces people to nootropics, he is ultimately going to cause harm to the nootropics community. You've heard *my* opinion on the matter, but I'm genuinely curious to know what you think. I'm also curious to know if you think newcomers should be warned about him.   I've been saving up for a while now to get my first bike. I really want a WR250R, but they are so expensive used that I think I might just get another bike and trade it in when I get more funds. I found this Buell Blast:  http://www.cycletrader.com/listing/2009-Buell-Blast-110572701  I like the looks of the bike and I've come to the realization that I won't have any use for a D/S until I move to California in nine months, so maybe a street bike is just what I need. My concerns with the Buell is that they've been discontinued so parts will become scarcer and scarcer, I'm not sure how easy it is to get them serviced, and I'm not sure if it's as good a first bike as say a Ninja 300 or 500 or a CBR250R. I'd like your thoughts on the matter though. Buy this and ride it while I save up for a WR250R or just wait until I can afford the bike I want?   My evidence:  - The Mother has never been referred to in present tense by the narrator  - Whenever future Ted talks about her he sounds kind of sad. Definitely the whimsical, romantic Ted we've come to know and love.  - The last episode is titled "Last Forever"  - At the end of the last episode Ted makes a comment to the mother. "Nothing good happens after 2 AM (future Ted then interjects to say to his son, "except for you, luke)" before they set off to the hospital. After 2 AM.  - The producers decided on the ending early on. No matter how much they changed the plot around it wouldn't mess with an ending that results in her death.  - at the end of the "Time Travelers" episode Ted is seen pleading for more time with the mother. He wants 45 more days.  - The mother never narrates.  - She is never in any flash forward beyond 10 years or so.   Hey all! I'm new to this sub, but we recently had a men's rights victory at my school that I felt like sharing. My school has a daycare center that students are allowed to volunteer at. They receive credit for volunteering and if they do it for more than two semesters they become a paid employee. In the years prior to this school year, male student volunteers were not allowed to change diapers or escort the kids to the bathroom, even the boys. One of the male students saw the inequality in this and petitioned the parents of the daycare children to allow male students to change diapers and escort kids to the bathroom. He succeeded!                  Especially when it comes to things you wouldn't think to look up when driving in another state. Like lane splitting in CA or no right on red in NY.   I did it today but I'm starting to think it was illegal. Here's a drawing I made if the turn:   http://imgur.com/XEaDwNf      I mainly use my PC for netflix, school, and minecraft. It runs minecraft just fine. It's a Sony Vaio S that I bought new like 10 months ago. The specs I can find:  RAM: 12.0 GB w/ 11.9 GB usable   64 bit operating system, x64 based processor  windows 8  Intel Core i7 processor  and I know it has some sort of nvidia graphics card    Edit:  On the "Windows Experience Index" the processor score is 7.7, RAM is 7.7, graphics is 5.9, gaming graphics is 6.5, and primary hard disk is 5.9                     **My 5 Questions:**  1. Why did you defect?  2. It's common for defectors to be fined, did this happen to you?  3. What was life like at Gold Base (or whatever compound you were at, although I think I've only heard of one other)?  4. Did it feel like you were being imprisoned?  5. What was "The Hole" like?  **Public Contact Information:** If Applicable                              **My 5 Questions:**  1. Did it truly feel like you were in another reality?  2. How did the experience compare to playing a game on Xbox or Playstation?  3. Did you ever forget that you were playing a game?   4. Would you want to play a FPS on it?  5. If you could choose one existing game to play on it what would it be?  	165
 Four days ago, I suffered a heart attack. Pretty fit, early 30's, completely unexpected. I had some incredible plans for New Years Eve and suddenly, in what seemed like one split second, everything changed.          If you own a dashcam and you are not a police officer - you might be an asshole.            If you can be swayed on a subject as serious as the death penalty because of a comment on Reddit, you are a shining example of idiocy.   Begun, the Israel spin machine has.   Then you are incredibly weak minded.      I vomited in my mouth. A lot. And had to gulp it back down. Because of you. And I've voted Democrat for 20 years.   End existence of time.   From my standpoint as an American, it seems more countries are voicing dismissal/rejection of American policy. Brazil, Albania, even Mexico seems to be much more independent of US influence lately. I'd like to get perspective from other countries on this.      I am so impressed with this post. I am flush with envy at the stardom you are exposed to as you lick peoples boots. I would trade anything to be in your position, basking in the dying, faded light of the celebrity of others.   Only by the lowest denominator of voter, so I doubt it will do much.   You mean Governor McAuliffe?   You either win or you lose. Pointing out the margins is just petty at this point, and crying "Obamacare" while complaining about how much Dems spent is just ludicrous. You know that, right?   So the party that supported unlimited corporate cash in elections is bitching that it was "outspent"? I am loving every second of this.   If Republicans had won, it would have been a "referendum on Obamacare". When a Democrat wins, its "lesser of two evils". WTF   My vote is Money by Pink Floyd   What song do you think represents the previous century most accurately? Not albums, not bands - just one single song, taken at face value.       Yes, stay in your basement and hide, that'll show them!   I'm sure he'll beat the charges. And the people issuing the charges. And the camera crew on the steps as he leaves the court. And the girl waiting for him in the car.   This attitude is the result of a concerted effort over many years to disparage and disillusion the very core group that could actually influence voting outcomes. The fact that you are apathetic and "rebelling" via abstaining reflects a resounding success in their efforts to prevent change.         So you taught your kid a lesson by dressing like a convicted pedophile?   Ben Affleck will be Batman   Ouch.   Still laughing at this one      If this is considered "in the gutter", I've done things that would keep you up for days on end, sir.   My favorite reddit post, ever. Thank you.   Threadjack much?   I'm wondering if Google is testing empty defenses of poor business decisions on reddit now...   Hide my bottle of chloroform.   Article said they have 5 million max.                  I am looking right now to find out if there are any polls reflecting the percentage of Americans that approve of painful brain parasites for  comparison.            It is becoming increasingly obvious the NSA is carrying out a war on humanity as a whole.      If it makes you feel any better, he was shot to death and didn't die of cancer.   Really? Really?      Breaking Bad was a prequel to Malcolm in the Middle. Walt fakes his death, escapes, flees and starts a new life when he meets Lois.   If so, curious what finally caused the change? If not, why do you believe he is a traitor? Thanks!      Wow, everyone is downvoting and I didnt even mention the fact that she is a cow. Weird.   Pictures of awful parents are hilarious.   I'd love to hear your definition of the word 'art'. I'm a long time hitRECord member and a huge fan, but the concept of art is something I don't hear you discuss in detail so anything you could throw my way would be appreciated thanks.   Remember that his dick is none of your business.   Google has zero credibility at this point. They can backpedal and try to suddenly appear concerned, but it's too late.  We are the kids that walked into the bedroom and found our mom Google in bed with her hands around the NSA's throbbing shaft. There is no way they can erase those awful images from my mind. Not happening.   So you stole saline and IV tubing and set it up without an order?   I imagine that sucked   For myself, it was working in a storage clearinghouse for a large grocery chain. Below freezing temps in the freezer, no breaks, barely lunch and horrible coworkers. All boosted by 12 hour shifts and no benefits. Was curious what others have gone through.      After the most recent revelations regarding NSA accessing their networks, Microsoft supplying Outlook encryption keys and other data mining policies, I don't believe one fucking thing Microsoft or Google have to say on this issue.   Marriage.   I don't yiff but if I were to yiff, I would yiff Gadget until she called the cops.      Oil. Israel. Capitalism.   Apathetically rearrange, wash, repeat.      "Don't take the highroad. Kill her."   Ha ha molestation signs are hilarious...      The moment you put Reverend in front of your name, you volunteer for a higher level of scrutiny than the "rest of us" in my opinion.            pork stool   That girl deserves better than a guy who posts pictures of plants to reddit.   This is the new definition of mistake to me. If anyone I know ever comes to me and says something like "I'm thinking of starting up heroin" or "I think I should spend all of my money on Zynga stock" I am going to say "You are possibly making a major Ben Affleck is going to play Batman in the next Man of Steel film".      I would disagree on this, imo nothing is more dangerous to our immediate society than letting those under 18 think they can murder someone openly and not suffer consequences.   Questionable actions by a kid at night, creeping around a neighborgood then gets shot while assaulting a guard - Obama calls him his son, leads a firestorm of racist supposition.  Clearly innocent kid gunned down randomly by an openly racist kid and his friends - Obama hasn't said a word.  Interesting.      The two are about neck and neck imo. Both show the depths government is willing to go to get its way.         I don't think any of them are capable of feeling.             Who cares?      Transgendered people suffer from a form of body image distortion in my opinion. I'm not sure it's the same thing. I am frustrated when they are lumped together with bi/homosexual men and women. Trans is a different animal. It's like saying "All blacks,Asians and Arabs are the same because they are all minorities!"  Not the same at all.   I dated a gay man once who didn't believe in bisexualism. He did not handle it well when I left him for a woman.   SAY THAT TO MY ONLINE FUCKER, AND NOT FACE AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS FAGET      YOU -'- RE A FAGGOT, FAGGOT      Lets ogle at bones. Theres nothing primitive about that at all.   Racism isn't funny.   Wow, not only do you know how to link to my profile but you can post links to? Look at you go! Next you'll be pooping all by yourself!   No time today but I will as soon as I can. She has band practice Saturday so I probably can email them to myself and clean up before she's back.   No it isn't. We give Israel the money, there are zero repayment terms for Israel. They are waived. No repayment. No interest. Nothing.   Not that I have to explain myself to anyone, but sure. A country that dictates our policy, ridicules our economics in open public addresses and has less national debt than we do should be, in theory, able to support themselves without attaching their lips to our nipples. Just my opinion, but handing aid to a country that has repeatedly been caught spying in our government and repeatedly acts without consulting us (normally to the detriment of the entire middle eastern region) is not someone we should be shoveling hundreds of millions to when we have major economic problems in this country that could use those funds.   Yep, posting random figures without checking them is great work...   How? We have caught, in the past 15 years, more Israeli spies working in our government than any other country. They openly refer to us as cattle.  The blatantly refuse to end the temper tantrum known as the Gaza incursion and are dragging us and every other democratic society into the fray. In fact, I can't think of one single thing Israel has done for us.    http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/israel-will-lose-175-million-in-u-s-foreign-aid-due-to-sequestration-cuts.premium-1.506024   Now this is an answer that makes sense to me. Thanks. It would technically not be searching ones PC, but their use of open lines. Gotcha, thanks for shedding some light on that.   Now name calling. Your intellect and penis size must be genuinely profound sir because I for one am impressed.   That is what I found interesting. I was curious if this argument has ever been applied to corporations. Can the use of a service forfeit certain rights? Radical example, could a woman working for WalMart legally be told by the company that she is not allowed to vote?   1. You're assuming I mean this to apply to me. Poor stance. 2. You're assuming a stranger on the internet could not possibly read. Poor presentation. 3. You use arbitrary betting and worthless words instead of facts or sources. Wasted time.  Thanks though. Appreciate your effort.   So the federal ruling granting students the right to privacy from their educational institutions, which are not government entities, is incorrect?  For reference: http://education-law.lawyers.com/school-law/Students-Have-Privacy-Rights-Under-the-Fourth-Amendment.html   Based on what precedent? This is what I am trying to ascertain.   No, it doesn't specify government.  "The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized"   Based on what? If you're using Mcdonalds drive through, can they search your car?   We as a country have a little bit more to worry about right now than a pretty little soundbite that they can throw up in the 2014 election cycle. This is nice, but since the research was PAID FOR BY US, it isn't exactly a nice gesture to GIVE THE RESULTS TO US.  	118
    Can you change your major? If you did would you have more hope?   What is holding you back?   A blue Hawaiian or New Jersey turnpike.             Italy    They may be still exchanging fire during a ceasefire but at least they're making some progress.             I don't know, I was farley drunk myself.    Ron Paul.       High school, because it was simple, easy, and fun.    Idk my friends and dad were stationed in Alaska. It wasn't suggested as much.      God damn Mongolians keep destrying my shii wall.    What lead to becoming lower class? Also married 3 times, would you know why they would do that?      Until people learn exactly what the budget is spent on. ~12 billion on uniform development. ~400 billion on the F35 ~2 billion for the land warrior system that isn't used. Ect.....   They probably hung out as kids, and made a bet of who can be the bigger asshole.    Because I don't like commitment   Awesome, I like how they give a breakdown of how it works.    It did a great job in showing war deprevation and brutality. It didn't do that good with reality in the final battle.    They're going to be bored watching my dot stay in my house all day.    I think congress needs a few fist fights.    Roaring twenties. Everyone dresses up, decorate like a speakeasy.       If it's a debate for fun I'd go with "who'd win a grizzly bear or a silver back gorilla" "who's the better western actor John Wayne or Clint Eastwood?"    For something serious I'd talk about which European country has the best economy/government. Who's worse the Mexican Cartel or Terrorists? You could even go with which presidential candidate is best for America.    I don't really have a reason why I give I just do. Especially to the people with signs like "using the money for alcohol". If they're being honest they might as well get a few dollars.    I'm sitting here in an empty house, watching documentaries on Netflix, about the economy.

 What should change then?   This is mainly my way of expressing pain, however I would like a few suggestions.  I don't know if I'm a perfectionist or juts... a bad writer.  Just a brief background about myself: I'm 16, and English isn't my native language. I began writing last year on a novel I had in mind. I've spend hours researching about the topic and elements I could use that will make it better. I really wanted to write, and I became obsessive about it.  I could see this story so clearly in my mind, but I couldn't put it to paper. I gave up after a few months.  On April I began writing another story of Fantasy, I've reached 14k words and it seems as an incredible achievement. I was really delightful and I thought I was on track of achieving it. I could already imagine myself as a writer, and finally achievement something I wanted to do.   Writing a novel wasn't just writing a short-story I could exhibit to my parents.   Today I finally reviewed my story and discovered that I'm stuck. Again. No matter how much I rewrite, it doesn't come out well. I don't know if I'm a perfectionist or juts... a bad writer.   I tried every possible way of becoming more creative. Some of those ways contained smoking/taking something, but it didn't last forever. I don't want to be drugged in order to become a writer, but even that didn't seem to help.  Any tips/suggestions? Thanks, Daniel  TL;DR: I have a terrible writer's block that lasts forever. Should I quit writing?   I finished my first three chapters, but last month I reviewed it and said: "Well, I'll just edit this once a little bit." Now, I can't move forward. What do I do?  By the way, this is the first time I'm serious about writing a novel.   Thanks.  Grammar is my currently my top priority. However, could you specify on what was boring? Lack of action, non-unintelligible plot or perhaps bad descriptions?   Les Brown   Ludovico Einaudi. [Example.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWA4uZE3ZMU)    What setting and environment does it have?  Is it a city, or perhaps a village, and how does it compare to the 'familiar' world?      Different writers have different ways of writing. If you feel the process takes long, I'd personally advise you to stop for a while, yet keep the novel within your thoughts.  Don't just forget it, but continue to think about it throughout the day. Sometimes an idea pops out of just a simple thought. I've experienced many of those moments.   Electronics provide the 'easy way'. My characters can only wish for those.    Bioshock infinite takes place in 1912, and its environment was an inspiration for one of my novels. It's a videogame, but I suggest you take a look at it.   Irrational quote. Worshiping God is as developing skills or the spiritual side of your life. You don't have to admire only what's visible, but nonetheless I'm against destroying nature and other species.     She was disappointed in you writing?  I'm 16 and I also spend a lot of time in front of the computer, mostly writing or 'getting inspiration'.      I still haven't told my family, and I'm not sure if I even want to.  What about you?   Thesaurus! Thesaurus!   Hey, I really wanted to replay the entire Assassin's Creed series (As all of us), however I want to skip the chit-chat in AC:B they do in the beggining. Does anyone have a savegame of the game at Sequence 2? Thanks.  (PC)   I'm currently editing, however so far I maintained about 800-900 words/day.   I hear you brother I'm 16 and diagnosed with ADD, and if that's not enough- English isn't my native language. You can try Ritalin if you have a prescription for it, however I personally hated feeling drugged (other than coffee. Coffee is magical). Nonetheless, you can write fantasy. I don't know why, but writing imaginary secretions kept me more focused/motivated than other genres.  Generally, it also comes with experience. Writing is difficult, especially if you have ADD/ADHD however it does becomes interesting, and occasionally addicting.    http://i.imgur.com/S7wxzCZ.png Looks great, certainly easier to read (:   Windows 8.1   Please add an option to change the font. Other than that, fantastic website.    As the title says- which phrase of your story usually ends up as the best? Beginning, middle or the end?    Good advice, thank you.   I've been writing alot for the past year, however something disturbs me whenever I get an original idea. Is it wrong to write a SciFi novel about a theme that will most certainly provoke several societies (e.g., extreme religion, racism, )? Needless to say that I've no intention of offending anyone.   I wrote almost 35k words in my SciFi novel, and I'm beginning to wonder about illustration. I'm an amateur about anything that's related to the 'background' side of writing, and my question is how does illustrations affect a book?   'This is amazing! I'm amazing! - JESUS, THAT'S FUCKING TERRIBLE!'   I understand all the words I write, but describing without thesaurus seems terrible (I'm a student from Israel, and though I can understand every word an average American would say I can't think of those words by myself).  Ps, this was written without thesaurus.    I need a writing software which has those 2 features: 1. It has thesaurus. 2. It has an app for iPhone.  Do you know of a recommended program which has those features? Thanks.   A similar sound. I know about Ben Howard, he's pretty good. I'll listen to your other suggestions (:   Don't worry, I'm writing in Hebrew.   This is the most difficult thing to write.. Where do I even begin? Could you perhaps add a few good examples? Thanks.   I found this extremely usefull (and interesting indeed)- http://www.remorselessfiction.com/quotes.html    I want more. Please.   	33

There also may be marijuana of which I will partake as well.

Yeah, GTA V's audience is far more expansive than CoD's. They might have been able to do a fraction of GTA's sales if they didn't pump out copypastas every year.

Your girlfriend painted your toe nails...   not many people no that   Charlie Chaplin was [a]ctually a chick   I feel that every iteration of whatever racing series (Forza Motorsport, Gran Turismo etc.) all demo the amazing amount of detail put into the car models, yet they completely neglect some of the most fun parts of racing games - crashes.   You have games such as Burnout that focus on that part of racing, yet it is on a grand end of the spectrum of racing games and takes a common part of cars and places it to the highest level. As entertaining as it is, it would be enjoyable to see what other game developers are capable of in the realm of car crashes and overall vehicle physics.  You have independent games such as [Beam NG](http://www.beamng.com/content/) that are experimenting with the limits of car destruction simulation and real time automobile malleability, which is exciting, novel and fresh. The only thing that comes as a shock is why more racing game developers haven't researched technology such as this and brought racing simulation to new level beyond current damage models. In some ways, when I play a racing game without realistic crashes, it's like playing a football game without tackles.    Tradition   I totally feel that. I felt like the maps were more open and the kills very satisfying. Twas the only multiplayer game that I played that I was totally satisfied with playing alone.    I've also got something funny to say....somewhere around here...   Who are these people, and how do you plan on differentiating them as you drop said bombs?   Let's bomb the shit out of this.   this istupid, EA should make halp-life 3   or maybe we'll just give them more funding so they're "better equipped" for next time...

Bad things happen everyday, people say fuck and shit and niggerfaggot alike, yet our media will run an entire story about a celebrity or coach who uses profanity as if they opened fire at a god damned navy yard. The News is owned and blatantly retarded, yet all these nursing homes hobos won't stop letting it overflow their grey matter.    Sheep up Wakel!   why the fuck would you trust the government? are you deaf and blind? at least you can copy paste wiki pages.   why didn't they just let us do it in the first place? since the register gives out cash anyway?      bastard from a basket!            0.3.0.3 update was released on the 4th of September and I didn't know if it automatically updated or I had to download a patch through the game or external website?   I find death animations to be oddly distracting and repetitive. Is there a way to turn them off and use only ragdoll?    How do you think it should occur? All opinions are welcome.         I pray, I believe, I forgive, I read my Bible. I don't always go to church. I work full time as a nurse at a hospital. I work second shift and spend most of my time either sleeping, working, and free time late at night. My nights after work usually involve being with friends, or playing video games at home. I still struggle with pornography and various other daily sins that sometimes I do commit, and sometimes don't commit. I ask forgiveness and attempt to move forward. I just don't really know what I'm doing with my life anymore, because it seems like now that I'm working, time is flying by so fast. I feel like I've accomplished nothing for the Kingdom of Christ, other than trying to represent Him the best I can at work, I suppose. I don't get to see the body of Christ very often, and lately I've just been wondering if I am even fully following Christ. I just don't really know what to say or do anymore...   my origin name is JoelTheTroll  - add me or PM me if you want to play.

Thanks :)            It works fine once you set it as primary in singleplayer but once i get to multiplayer it turns off at the beginning of a match and i have to unplug and plug it back in and i just don't get what is happening?         I purchased the game but have no idea really how to update or do much of anything technical. help?         I know this is probably posted a million times but I could use some prayers. I struggle with pornography and I just don't understand how to completely overcome it. There will be periods of time where I'll go on without doing it and I'll convince myself that it is gone forever, then temptation comes at me even harder, and I fall. I pray. I meditate. I even attempted to deliver myself from an unclean spirit that I thought may be hindering me (of which I'm still uncertain) and I can only ever last for maybe 2 weeks at the maximum. I want to overcome this because I want to show God that I'm ready for a serious relationship with him and possibly a wife, if he'll permit it. But I feel so held back. I feel accused by it, and then I feel weak. I turn to Jesus and know that  I am redeemed but I always feel like I'm such a let down to Jesus. I very much want to cleanse myself of this so that I can show God I'm ready and mature. But I suppose all I can ask for is prayers.    This is a very general, basic question...answer individually as you deem true.  But, I'll give you a specific example of my life...I am a new nurse at my local hospital and there is a particular female that I have began to find very attractive. Her outer beauty of course. But her personality is just so boisterous and exuberant. She is just a fantastic joy to listen to and a very positive energy. And I think what created the greatest attraction was when she would openly talk about Jesus in such a confident manor amidst fellow employees. The only unfortunate part is that, though our interactions have been positive and a possible chemistry is there, I feel that our jobs are so busy. We hardly have time to truly create a foundational friendship. This leaves me in a very silly situation. Logic tells me, don't be moronic and rushingly ask her out before you really know her and end up looking like a fool. But instinct tells me, if I wait too long and don't establish some sort of relationship, I will miss my chance and regret it. I'm not sure what to say really, because I know my issue is really a generally mild topic. I'm just at a strange point in my life where I have begun my career and it takes up a majority of my time, and I feel that my primary time to mingle will be in my work environment and I truly would enjoy having someone to share my life with. I know I'm probably wayyyy over thinking it, but I have no idea how to approach this situation, or if I should even give it a second thought. An odd duality of all or nothing. Maybe you can Pray that God give me a clear mind?   The Bible tells us that there's a constant war going on around us. A war that involves the spiritual heavenly hosts and principalities of darkness. I personally feel that this says so much in regards to the Christian faith. I feel that this says so much more than just going to church every Sunday and putting on a smile for our white suburban brothers at a midweek bible study. The bible is essentially saying there are beings that have existed, spiritually, in our world, or realm, for an uncounted number of lifetimes. The beings have seen nation rise and nation fall. These beings are the ultimate researchers on the human condition and can predict what you're going to do before you even decide that you will do it. Some of these creations have even sat at the foot of God's throne. I suppose where my issue is, is in my own life. I, like many Christians, battle against Sin and the world daily. I pray. I read the Bible. I try to represent Christ the best I can. I fail many times. I know there is much more going on in our world than just what we see with our eyes and speak with our mouths. But at times, I wonder if I will ever truly understand or partake in this supernatural battle that rages on. I'm a nurse at a hospital who helps people daily, sure, but its still just a job at times. I then proceed home and fiddle on my computer and maybe be with friends. It's a relatively monotonous life, that has been replicated one billion times over in many other countries and timelines.   I guess my biggest question is: Can I expect to experience God on a supernatural level, the kind that changes lives, or is my meandering lifestyle going to hold me back from truly seeing what I know is out there until the day my soul leaves body?   Wonder, Miracle, Beauty movies?  Suggest your favorite, if you'd be so kind.                It truly is a fascinating piece of literature that fits within Biblical canon and timeline. It covers interesting topics such as End Times, detail on Fallen Angels interbreeding with human woman - creating giants (Nephilim mentioned in Genesis 6:4 and in Daniel, of whom were a primary cause of God's Flood) - and also covering "The Just One", commonly perceived as Christ. Below are also some references towards Enoch in the Bible.   **Hebrews 11:5** - 5 By faith Enoch was taken from this life, so that he did not experience death: He could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God.  **Genesis 4:17-18** - 17 Cain made love to his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain was then building a city, and he named it after his son Enoch. 18 To Enoch was born Irad, and Irad was the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael was the father of Methushael, and Methushael was the father of Lamech.  **Genesis 5:18-19** - 18 When Jared had lived 162 years, he became the father of Enoch. 19 After he became the father of Enoch, Jared lived 800 years and had other sons and daughters.  **Genesis 5:21-24** - 21 When Enoch had lived 65 years, he became the father of Methuselah. 22 After he became the father of Methuselah, Enoch walked faithfully with God 300 years and had other sons and daughters. 23 Altogether, Enoch lived a total of 365 years. 24 Enoch walked faithfully with God; then he was no more, because God took him away.  **1 Chronicles 1:3** - 3 Enoch, Methuselah, Lamech, Noah.  **Luke 3:37** - 37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch,  the son of Jared, the son of Mahalalel,  the son of Kenan,   What are you thoughts as to why it was not included in The Bible?             hes a drummer for the red hot choo choo fighterz         And why do people hate it?               I ask this because, the majority of the time we come across something related to secret societies, such as the Illuminati, they are presented as a "Satanic" group and oppose the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. Since the majority of the users in here are in opposition to this group, can I ask if your beliefs align with the Christian Theology?  Edit: Interesting that there is a lot of anti "religion" perspectives. Understandable. But when you examine the four Gospels and the example Jesus set within that narrative, some will note that Jesus too was against meaningless religion. He despised the Pharisees that had manipulated Judaism at that time for their own personal gain. It appears that what Jesus really came to do was demonstrate and create a way for individuals to be in direct communion with God. Jesus was liberating the people from religion and leading them to relationship and faith. When examining the source documents of the accounts with Jesus, one can immediately identify a paradoxical teaching that is prevalent between what Jesus said and what some modern religious establishments teach. In a way, The Illuminati, or Satan, would actually support the binding and legalism that some current "Christian" groups hold over there followers. While Satan has infiltrated religion, he fears the masses beginning to understand the relationship that can be had with God through Jesus.       What is its context? Why is it so harsh? Does it apply to modern day followers?      I think hearing about some people's low points in their faith or before they found Christ and how they bounced back through the power of Christ would encourage a lot of people who at times don't feel worthy of God's Love. But of course, God's Love is ever extending :)   I'm incredibly excited for GTA V coming out but I also feel as if though I shouldn't be and give up games all together. Any thoughts?   I have accepted Christ as my Lord and savior many years ago, but as many do, I have some questions. Lately, when I spend way too much time on Youtube, I get a really mixed message on Salvation.   I watch these [videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYINqTN1SBw) that tend to make me feel as if though I still am condemned, even after years of walking with Christ. I obviously haven't been perfect, and it's a daily struggle. But I just need some clarification on the life that Jesus excepts from me. When I watch these videos, it often times makes me terrified that I'm not doing enough.   I've always been taught that Grace trumps the Law, but lately I'm feeling very condemned by the message of Law that's being presented.   My life consists of working at a retirement home and daily reading my scriptures and praying. I still struggle with various sins and I just don't know what to think anymore. I am constantly bombarded with the message that I haven't done enough but also the message that only through Christ's sacrifice are we sufficient before God. When I come across opportunities to talk to people about Jesus, I do. Should I be doing more? Should I leave the working world? I feel condemned and I just need truth and encouragement.  TL;DR - I'm getting mixed messages            I'm surprised more games don't use the awesome [Euphoria Animation System](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6F3lT1v79I) that can be seen in games like Max Payne 3 and Star Wars: The Force Unleashed. With the repetition that comes with seeing the same death animations in games like Call of Duty through the use of Motion Capture, you would think that more development studios would utilize the novelty and variety of Euphoria Animation. It's one of the primary reasons I always looked forward to most of the recent iterations in the Rockstar franchise. The level of visceral movement that is procedurally generated from the Euphoria engine leaves me wanting more after every experience and I would love to see how it will shape this generation and next generation games' animation development.

(Rapid Eye Movement)     "Hey buddy whaddya playin there?", asks grandpa looking at his grandson in confusion        Grandson quickly comes out of his REM and looks at his grandpa cheerfully and replies, "My Nintendo Synfesis Gwandpa!" With a lisp :) (Nintendo Synthesis)        Grandpa's confusion quickly subsides with a smile of relief and replies, "ohhh, Nintendo? Shoot, I used to have a  Game Boy back in the day. Played the heck outta that thing"        "Grandpaaaa, dis isn't da same as a silwy Game Boyy", Grandson says laughingly annoyed.        "Whaddya talkin' abouuut? Lemme see that thing", retorts grandpa with confidence.        "We can pway together!" Excitedly replies grandson. Grandson proceeds to hand grandpa another one of the devices.  The device is merely a 3x3in rectangular chrome device with a rounded spherical bottom. Similar to a three dimensional ellipse  divided in half with central a flat surface.     Grandpa examines it oddly, looking on all sides, "Where's the D-Pad?...How do I turn this thing on?"        Giggling, grandson exclaims, "You just have to holwd it with boff hands gwandpaaa"        "Oh, okay", grandpa says as he places both hands on the device, "What're we even 'playing' anyway?"        "Caww of Duty: Stormfront!", excitedly replies grandson as he quickly gets comfortable and places both hands on the device,  at which point you begin to hear a low binaural beat begin to build within the system and slowly growing louder.        "Well CoD's kinda gay -- but What the heck is that sound?", asks grandpa in confusion.        "It's startin' up Gwandpa", replies grandson with a big innocent smile.        As the noise begins to grow grandpa's mind begins to wonder into nostalgic memories, "Oh...well you know when I was your age,  I would play Pokemon none stop. I swear, I had the best line-up ever. My Dragonite was level 100 -- " Suddenly,  within the blink of an eye grandpa is transported to a drop ship transport about to land in the middle of a barren planet war zone. He looks around  in frantic fear and confusion, seeing he is surrounded by a dozen other future soldiers preparing to fight. Everyone is strapped into their seats with  metal chest harnesses, wearing futuristic black and grey military protective equipment and wielding heavy assault rifles. The ship is severely turbulent  as it draws nearer to the surface of the battle. "What the hell is happening!? Where am I?!!!", cries Grandpa  to all of the nameless soldiers he is seated next to. All of which seem have their wits about them.        "Private! Get your shit together! Now is not the time to lose it!", commands what appears to be the Sergent of the ship's unit.        Grandpa is shocked in fear facing the Sergent, who returns his body to the upright position of his harnessed seat while someone next to grandpa gestures  the Catholic cross across their chest as they kiss their Christian pendant. Grandson then reveals his smiling face and waves "Hi, gwandpaaa!", says grandson  with cheer.        "Oh my God! What the hell is happeningggg!!!??" screams grandpa.        "We got to take the Cwompound, gwandpa" replies grandson as he rocks his head from side to side joyfully.        "What!!? What the hell are you talking about? What is this!!?, exclaims grandpa in utter fear and calamity.        "Just fowwow me grandpa!" laughs grandson as the ship comes to a sudden halt.        "OhGodFUCK! What is hap-!" grandpa is screaming as The harnesses suddenly rise, and the side hatch of this ship immediately burst open. The noise quickly grows ten-fold, with near by explosions and dust flying so thick that its barely visible to see more than 20 feet in front of oneself.     "Alright Men! Into eternity we fly!" shouts the Sergent as he throws his hand forward giving the command to charge. Large amounts of similar ships can be  seen landing, and leaving near their drop zone.The terrain is virtually flat as the dust bowl continues to fog any view besides what lies ahead.   Hundreds of soldiers are running into the clouds of fog.  Many of which are being mowed down by continued chain  gun fire and blown to pieces by explosions and artillery.     Grandpa, standing in the haul doorway of the drop ship stares in disbelief at what he is witnessing when suddenly he feels quick jab to his  right leg and a grab  at his hand from grandson exclaiming, "Come on gwandpa, follow meeee". Grandson begins to run haphazardly into the fray of smoke.     "Wait! NO!" Grandpa yells as he suddenly becomes aware of his grandson sprinting into a firefight. Grandpa proceeds to sprint after him. As he runs blindly in grandson's last known direction,  all he can see is random soldiers faces gliding with him in his run as well as the amount of vigor and strength he now has that was not previously existent in his normal body's elder state.  This revelation is quickly forgotten as nearly as soon as he sees more soldiers passing by him in the haze, they are quickly swept down by bursts and flashes of light and blasts from  whistling bombs from above. Dirt and debris began to soil grandpa's clothing.  A sudden cut back to grandpa and grandson in the living room shows both of them experiencing REM with grandpa's mouth wide open making odd screaming noises and grandson smiling and giggling.  Cut back to the battlefield, the only usable cover are large boulders that randomly appear through the haze. A large explosion in the distance knocks grandpa down to the ground, the heat from the blast causes his face  to be flushed in even more sweat. Grandpa scrambles on all fours to the nearest boulder that is nearly 12ft high and sizable enough  to cover four men. Large numbers of other soldiers continue to pass by on both sides. Grandpa presses his body tightly against the boulder next to soldiers of which are poised to return fire with no direct leader.  On grandpa's side is a medic attempting to revive an unconscious soldier with CPR and various medicinal shot administrations that only require the grasp of a trigger to instill into the skin. This is to no avail.     "God damn it, wake up!" Screams the medic to the dead soldier, of whom has a severe burns and lacerations to the entire front of the body.     The soldier on grandpa's other side nearest the edge of cover pops out and shoots blindly into the fog screaming, "Motherfuckerrrrsss!".  A stray bullet flies in and goes directly between the soldiers neck and clavicle. He collapses in front of grandpa grasping his neck as blood begins to spray out of his artery  with each heart beat. Grandpa's face is stricken with shock as he lets out a girlish screech.     "Fuckin' pull him over here!" Demands the medic. With slight hesitation, grandpa begins to drag the hemorrhaging soldier closer to cover and the medic. As he lets go, the medic screams for  grandpa to, "Hold pressure on it!". As grandpa places his hands in a viscous pool of blood, his clothes and face are quickly covered in red spurts and drops with each diminishing amount of  circulation. A sudden cut back to the living room shows a paralleled horror on grandpa's face.     "Stay with me!" screams the medic as he scrambles through his pack for more gauze pads. The nameless soldier is looking directly in to the eyes of Grandpa as the soldier takes his last  liquid filled breaths and his eyes leave focus past grandpa and into the distance. The pressure from the open vessel that grandpa is rigorously holding begins to halt completely and the soldier's eyes slowly fade shut.  Covered in blood and earth, grandpa stares deeply in astonishment at the man that is lifeless in his arms. Grandpa hears no sound around him.        "Whatchya doin' gwandpa???", abruptly questions grandson of which pulls grandpa from his haze in disbelief that his grandson was standing before him, let alone smiling. The assault rifle almost larger than he was.  "We gotta' take the compownd, gwandpa. Hurwy up!" Grandson grabs grandpa's hand and pulls him up off his knees and they begin to race in the direction that all the other soldiers are heading.  In the distance, the flashes from the machine guns can be seen quickly approaching. As they came closer, the number of bodies increased as well as the number falling soldiers all around them.  Grandpa sees a large trench system approaching, and grandson jumping into it. In fear for his grandson's life, he races into the trench. He follows his grandson's lead and keeps his head down.  They are now progressing through a large labyrinthine trench and begin to follow a small group of about eight allied soldiers. The gun fire and explosions are constant and it is nearly suicide to lift  attempt a view outside of what was becoming a mass grave. The dust was not as nearly as dense within the trench system and soldiers could be seen attempting to enter the trench only to be laced with crossfire. The artillery fire  was creating large amounts of debris and, at times, human extremities to soar through the air.          "They're fuckin' killin' us out there! We need to take that compound!" Exclaims the drop ship Sergent, as he slides to meet his team within the trench.        Grandpa's heart is in a constant state of continuous adrenaline and his pupils are fixed on following his grandson and the other soldiers in any direction they choose to progress.     "Don't worwy gwandpa, I know where I'm gowing. I beat this pwart yestawday", reassures grandson. Grandpa continues to follow in complete amazement and horror.  They suddenly approach within 25 meters, the flank of a larger artillery gun and anti-air guns that combined blasts create vibrations so dense that, with each explosive blast, the ground is shaken to its core and human  ears enter into utter shell shock ringing and tinnitus. Grandson abruptly throws up  his fist, giving the command to halt. Grandpa stares in focus and silence as he sees the enemy is completely unaware, garbed in  ghillie suit uniforms that match the gray and tanned tones of this alien world. Grandson motions for half of the assembled team to approach the artillery nest from a branching trench path, creating an alternative  angle of attack.     Without hesitation, grandson turns around to grandpa and says, "You eva shwot one-a deez?", revealing a missile launcher and tossing it at grandpa who nearly stumbles upon catching it. Grandpa stares in bewilderment.  "It's swimple, just aim and shwoot." Giggles grandson as he motions the remaining men to ready their rifles. "On my cwommand", says grandson. Grandpa quickly shakes himself out of his emotional paralysis and readys the launcher on  his shoulder, looking down the display system. Which aumatically targets the largest artillery canon, stating "FIR RDY". The artillery team continues their foundation shattering battery and the team of soldiers lead by  grandson have their rifles aimed at the ready directly towards the enemy nest and grandpa is sitting shaking with a rocket launcher reluctantly pointed at an unknown adversary. Time comes to a near crawl and the beads of sweat  roll down grandpa's jittering face....     "COVERWING FIYA!!!" Commands grandson with all the air in his little lungs as he and the rest of the team light up the air with assault rifle rounds into the naive opposing forces. At that moment, grandpa, reflexively pulls the launching  trigger and a missile expels a huge back draft that pushes the dust around the trench out in all directions and in the blink of an eye the projectile burst forward and then 100 ft straight into the air. The recoil cascades  grandpa onto his back. All he can see is nameless soldiers unloading clips in a congruent direction and his grandson laughing as he hip fires his gun using a shoulder strap. Without warning, like a comet, the projectile hurdles  directly downward and a bright flash of blinding white light and silence is all that can be sensed. Everyone takes cover and awaits visual clarity. Of which is obtained after a large gust of particles are pushed past the entire squad  through the cravas of the trench. All that remains is a massive thick smoke cloud, forming out of a crater in the ground where the artillery nest was previously located. As grandpa began to gain his bearring, white ash began to settle  over them like snow.     "Nice shwot, gwandpa!" exclaims grandson as all the soldiers cry out in victory. Amongst the shear epicness of the entire situation, grandpa manages to release a small smirk on his mug as the chills of success reverberate throughout his spine.   Grandpa looks at his grandson, as he begins to climb to the edge of the trench and stand before his fellow soldiers. "We have twaken down deir defwenses. Now we must bwing down their stwonghold! Fowwow me to Victorweee!!!"  Grandson cries as he lifts his guns over his head with both arms. Every soldier, including grandpa cannot help but roar with courage.     *CRACK*     Is all that is heard. Grandson stumbles at his perch, and places his hand on his chest revealing crimson painting his fingers.     "Noooooo!!" Screams grandpa as he rushes to bottom of the trench and catches his grandson as he falls. All is silent as every soldier stares onward at grandpa holding his fatally wounded grandson in his embracing arms. Tears glisten down his face,  unable to vocalize his grief past his disbelief.     "Gwandpa", whispers grandson in grandpa's ear.     "Yes", quickly relishes grandpa - at his kin's every word.        "GAME OVERRRRRRRRRRR", interrupts an ominous and robotic voice heard over top all the game world. At which the entire environment begins to suddenly breakdown around grandpa and he and grandson are rapidly whisked back to the their living room.     Grandpa looks onward in a stupor, completely motionless for several seconds when grandson interrupts, "What do ya fink gwandpa??" Pausing, and taking a few curious sniffs of the air, "What's dat smell?"        Cuts to an exiting add line from Nintendo stating, "Nintendo Synthesis - It'll make your grandpa shit his fuckin' pants"   A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its Kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover, some call it the thief, because it always drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. But when it does come, its always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's passing eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and you always know it's closest when the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime.  Sheel and I laid under the aquatic nightlight, atop our favorite get away spot overlooking our village - Of which was celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights gave illusion that the night's excitement was nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrated our night. I felt almost invigorated by the energy the blue bulb in the sky was giving off. And when we got away from all the noise, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. And as we laid there, holding hands, I could feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection.  "They say it's getting closer, you know", Sheel gently let out. In my near hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said.  "Ah... You don't buy into that Collision Course fear do you?" I rattled off in nearly the same words I've heard from my parents time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky.  "I don't know...my father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's changed." Her gaze never broke from the atmosphere, and I had no words to say. "He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The Event. Silence filled the air as what she said began to pass over me. Fireworks could be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brought a smile to my face. We laid there quietly, looking directly at what some held in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not over taken me. I knew I was exactly where I was suppose to be. Sheel grasped my hand even tighter, we looked into each others' eyes, and all I could hear was that gentle hum.   Can this fraud go on any longer? Can this self perpetuating cycle of debt sustain itself? I know no one can predict the future but does anyone have any predictions about the future of our beloved "centralized banking system"? Will their reign cease to fall? Or will it collapse in upon itself?      My life is pretty boring. I work 2-11pm and then go hang out with friends until 4AM, the majority of which aren't Christians. I try to hang out with some Christian friends but often time find myself bored because they think having fun is watching a Disney movie or something. I then sleep until I have to go back to work again. My life is boring and I don't know how to reinvigorate my Faith and life. Could use prayer and guidance.       I watched a video about an African pastor who had an out of body experience (OBE) in which he died and saw [Heaven and Hell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MA7mtcJ748U) and was brought back to life. The angel told him that if he died right now he would go to Hell because he did not forgive his wife of what she had done in the past. This filled me with a lot of fear, as I wondered what other Sins I may be committing that could detrimentally send me to Hell if I did not make myself right with God and how I go about that. It confused me, as well, making me thankful that Jesus presented this pastor with his separating Sin but wonder where the line is drawn where we are covered by grace but also held accountable?   I know this crosses the barrier of works vs grace, but I need some Biblical encouragement and clarification. Maybe some personal experiences?   I feel like I'm in a constant battle with sin and am constantly losing. I need encouragement, because at times I fear the loss of my salvation. I try to be good, but i make so many mistakes. Sometimes I wonder if i was ever saved at all. But i truly do believe and understand Christ forgives all sins and try to live a good life but I sometimes hide from God, in a world of sin. I just need prayer for this struggle. Encouraging words and thank you.    I live in the basement and my room has a bathroom on the other side of the room. In the dream, I thought I saw strange lights coming from the bathroom. Wearing only my undies, I went over to investigate. As I approached the door, I can hear a vibratory noise growing louder with every closing step. In a bold curiosity, I burst open the door to witness three shadowy figures standing side by side in my bathroom, one substantially taller in the center of them. The vibrational noise was nearly deafening and originated from a black portal that stretched the length of the wall. It was wide enough for one person to enter through at a time and had a purple energetic hue pulsating around it. In fear of these featureless entities, I immediately fall backwards out of the bathroom grasping the knob, pulling the door closed. Nearly instantly, I snap out of my shock and am determined that whatever they are doing is malevolent. Being already on the floor, I thrust my body into the door to stop whatever it is they are doing. Now there is a large gust of energy and sound that is pressing back to keep me from entering. I am barely able to peak my head in as my hair flies back from the propulsive forces. I witness the two smaller entities begin to depart by stepping casually through the portal. In utter terror, I am left beholding the larger creature standing before me. He proceeds to slowly turn, that which I consider to be the shape of his head, in my direction. I lay pressed against the door and forceful winds, vulnerable and powerless as to his next action. Suddenly, he projects a grotesque  image of a mummified face, wrappings loosely hanging off, and shoots this illusion in my direction with a swift breath. I am abruptly overtaken with a fearful paralysis that casts me to the ground, shutting the door.  That's when I wake up.       If a lot of people on here believe 9/11 was an inside job, who should be held responsible? Just like any other crime, who would have benefited the most from this particular string of events? I know many companies benefit from war, but are there any particular individuals that are highly connected?   ...and why there are no alternative theories besides creationism?      Its a beautiful woman with a green background and she has a beast with a snake body but with a ton of different animal heads. It's an amazing picture but i can't find it anywhere on the internet. Any ideas of who it is or a link? Thank you   Often times when I feel spiritually moved and sometimes without feeling internally emotional, I experience a vibration or chills that reverberate through my body. I experience this often times and most commonly only when I am partaking in or thinking about something related to Jesus or God. Does anyone else have experiences of "feelings" that they usually equate with the presence or stirring of The Holy Spirit?   A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home.

Does this perspective change in women as they get older and look back and wish they would have dated that nice guy? And if so, at what point do most girls then find the nice guy more appealing?   With oil controlling the market and primarily how most cars are fueled, what do you foresee the future of automobiles and overall transportation developing towards?     Flying cars is an acceptable answer         If he hypothetically didn't die and the news is just presenting him as dead, won't they easily be contradicted when he strikes again? If his wallet was found at the scene of the burning building, how was his ID identified at the U.S./Mexican border? Was the character of Dorner a creation of the media to distract us from something? There just seems to be a lot of contradictions that I am not understanding.          What are the riches that we receive in Heaven? I've realized I am nothing without God, and I have put my faith in salvation in Jesus as He who has given me the grace to enter His Father's kingdom. My only issue is that sometimes I do not always go "without sin" and I am ashamed of this. I'd ask that you pray for me about this. I am also curious as to what are the riches of Heaven that we receive? Do some of us get a gold mansion and others end up in a cardboard box? I would be okay with being homeless in Heaven than a landlord in Hell. Once again, I'd ask that you would pray that I would see no pleasure in Sin and love God through obedience, and if you can help me to understand my overlying question, thanks! Jesus is endless gracious :)   This is the internet. Fuck you --- Shun shunnnnn shhhhunnnn. Obama. Huffington Post. Papa Johns. Everyone better share MY interests! MY INTERESTS! MINE!!!!!!!!! ME ME ME ME MEEEeeeee       I see a lot of evil in this world, especially in the corruption of the United States government. Don't get me wrong, I understand the power of prayer and the coming of Jesus one day, but is it wrong of me to want to make a change with violence? Our forefathers were Christian, and they fought for their independence from tyranny a few hundred years ago. Is it such a bad thing to want to take a stand against the direction that I see our nation heading towards? Some may not see our country going in the direction of evil and tyranny that I perceive but I can feel it in my bones and feel it necessary to make some sort of serious change or resistance in the future. Any thoughts? Please consider what I'm saying, because countries like Germany and China have disarmed their citizens prior to enslaving them in past and I see it coming soon. It's obvious Satan has infiltrated our government long ago. I just need some serious discourse. Thank you.             At times when I read the Gospels I feel this amazing sense of freedom from sin when Jesus preaches his purpose and in the later books that speak about works NOT being what gets you to Heaven. But then I see other scriptures that talk very highly of repentance and completely ridding your life of sin or else you will go to Hell. It creates this confusion, or paradox that leaves me stranded in my Faith. There are certain sins that I struggle with daily, and am trying to overcome. Yet because I have not overcame them, I feel various preaches condemning me to Hell, even though I have faith that Jesus is my representative before God and has justified me. I don't use Jesus to reason why I should continue sinning, I just fall sometimes and I can't comprehend this mixed message of Law vs Grace.    I've been having difficulty lately as a new RN grad to find a job that doesn't require at least 6 months of experience and I was recently hired as an RN in a local nursing home. Apparently I will be one of the only RN's they have and their pay is, from what I heard, "an insult to RNs" - 15$/hr. Which for me is fine, as its a pay increase from minimum wage and I need the experience. Any advise from other nurses who worked in the assisted living field?                            2 interceptions in his first two drives in a needed win for a playoff spot against Washington. And a huge turnover in the last drive that could have pushed them into the post season. I'm sick of Romo, its time for a change.       such as the federal reserve, etc. Don't know much about them, but they have such an impact on one of the greatest topics within our countries politics.   You would think there wouldn't be so much insecurity and scrutiny about something that all men have and have no control over    why or why not?   Don't spare the details. How you felt, what it looked like, why you did it. All killers are welcome   ...particularly a female :D      I work at a bar so my sleep schedule is already pretty off. I sleep in everyday and stay up late normally. But lately, as we enter winter, I sleep in longer and longer. What's even weirder is sometimes I'll wake up, have a hearty breakfast and want to go right back to sleep for a few more hours. I'm also struggling finding a real job out of college and I don't know if that is creating a depression inside myself that also adds to my desire to sleep. But I'm also just generally interested in the normal changes that happen to the human body entering into the winter months. Thanks    Crisis 2 wasn't as great a hit as they anticipated, mainly due to it's CoD style compromised gameplay. I just don't anticipate Crisis 3 to do any better due to in part that it seems like it being rushed out the door.    there are other good musical artists out there. Wait...he must be atheist? no? liberal? no? ahhhhh, wait, wait, a white, college educated, cat lover?....I'm stumped   I keep hearing the US economy is about to implode and I hear it is smart to put your assets in Gold and Silver rather than paper generated money. Is this pointing to the idea of a debt based economy that we all just put our faith into? Also, how would I go about purchasing gold and silver?   BORRRRRRINGGGGGGG                           make that 7   I always find that as soon as I demonstrate an interest towards a female, she seems to hold very little interest. But the girl that I don't care about and pick on, most commonly has interest in me? It just seems to be a cruel cycle.             I know a lot of games have deadlines and I'm curious to hear from the perspective of the developers who are forced to put out a product long before they feel it is ready or satisfactory. Thanks :)   I'm curious as to their purposes and how and what the body uses them for. Also, in what order and when does your body break down your own body's tissues for energy? Maybe you could also relate this to working out so people have a good idea of what workouts burn fat/and build muscle and maybe proper nutrition? I know its a lot, and tackle this as you see fit. Thank you ahead of time   For most Christian men, masturbation is a struggle. Lust is accompanies it. About three weeks ago I stopped looking at porn/masturbating and felt incredibly strong in my faith. Oddly enough, the temptations became stronger as I felt my hormones rising daily. My hope was to have a wet dream - so I'd feel blameless etc etc. I didn't and just today I suddenly gave in and now I feel super guilty. But people alert me that guilt is not from God, and that it's not through anything we do that gets us to Heaven but through Christ alone and what He did on the cross. So, why do I still feel this incredibly amount of guilt when I should, quite possibly, be joyous that even in my lows, Jesus still loves me?  Thanks  PS - also, I gave in kind of after I felt that I had received what I wanted, which was a passing grade on a huge certification exam. I told myself that didn't play into it and that I just wanted to love and obey God, but I feel that after getting what I wanted, my selfish motives were presented 10 fold. Thoughts/prayers? and thnx  EDIT: Sorry if im not politically correct about terms. Just being honest         When I asked my father about the recent bombings, he responds by saying that he hopes they kill all of those muslim radicals. I try to explain to him that the situation is a lot more complicated than that and that Israel is more so to blame than Pakistan and that Israel is just as horrible to Pakistani people, he just brushes me off. He tries to quote the news but I attempt to explain to him that the news is going to paint our allies in a good light because the news is run by Israel and his immediate response is , "oh, you're an Antisemite". And it's just so frustrating trying to have a conversation with him because he sees everything from the perspective of a closed minded american who sits on his couch and watches football all day. I just don't feel educated on the topic enough to present my points out reasonably. Can someone help me to justify that Israel isn't as good as we make them out to be and why we're even allies with them?  EDIT: Palestine....shows how much I know....         I met this non-Christian girl and we hit it off very well initially. It went so well as for me to, in some ways, set aside my belief that Christians have to marry other Christians, as I thought it would be too closed minded for me to give up an opportunity with someone like her. She is very kind, beautiful and loving and we had a great time the first few times we hung out. She then, randomly, alerted me over text message that she is in a 2 year relationship that is now long distance, but obviously still wanted to be friends. When I heard that, I actually cried, it was embarrassing, and I was at work and my boss saw me and let me go home. I thought I'd probably never hear from her much after that but she would still contact me in the mornings via text to see how my day was going and we went on a hike where I was able to share the gospel with her and very briefly express my feelings and desire to maintain friendship (tho I want more). As much as I figured the relationship would remain platonic, the generally flirtatious messages were still being sent from her. Eventually I felt as though she was tapering me out of her life, as I didn't receive any messages for a few days. But then, just yesterday she invited me over to watch a movie with her. We did so and nothing happened but at this point I just don't know how to take her. Because in her mind, she might think she has cleared the air with me and can play the innocent card if I confront her about our purposes together, but I can't help but feel as if though she is using me just for attention/back up in case things with her boy friend don't work out. I on the other hand struggle deeply because, I want to do the things of God and love her unconditionally without expectation, and not even focus on a relationship, but my internal fleshly desires want something more and its really confusing/tearing me up inside. I constantly feel like there are things unsaid between us, and I am afraid to be completely honest with her as I fear that I will ruin what we have or what God is using me for in her life. At the root, I know that the only relationship I require is in Christ, but I am struggling deeply and could use some wise interpretations as to what is occurring. Thank you.     	199
 thanks   They'll recycle it, I'm sure of it. And Hillary's army hasn't even got started yet.    what are you doing to Silva's thumb?   is there a comprehensive list of where Sanders will be? I'd like to go if he comes to my hometown   They lost their coach and many players. Their QB isn't playing up to expectations. The three teams in their division are better.    did someone play my mix tape?    a lot can happen from now and next november    while it's reaching to take something out of context that he wrote before most of us were even born, I'm sure it won't stop Hillary's Pac's from using it   If he wins Iowa and New Hampshire his chances become real.   He doesn't have the same mechanics bruh! It's apples and oranges.  Just look at their footwork and releases.    He's pure. The only thing I have heard negative about him so far is he wrote some erotica like 40 something years ago. When they try to catch him by calling him a socialist or wanting to raise taxes etc, he doubles down on it and wins.         For a a short QB they won't pay more than Cam Newton? you're overpaying   The best I can do is WR Jaron Brown and a second round pick.    it's not the colbert report, it's stephen colbert   it's not the colbert report, it's stephen colbert         It's a typo. They listed him at [6'7](http://search.draftexpress.com/profile/Anthony-Brown-6222/), which means they rounded up from 6'6 1/2. If he was 6'8 1/2 with shoes they would have listed him at 6'9.         It would be funny if Trump got the nomination by accident.    I'd enjoy that fight.   Conor will finish Jose quickly and everyone will lose their minds.    You know, there are other routes besides your veins to get hydrated quickly.    Trying to understand your writing hurts my brain.    imposibru    I dunno why people are hating on you lol. I gave you an upvote but it appears your count is going to keep getting lower and lower. Haters gonna hate.    Jinx. Now he's going to LA.    Jalen Rose was turrible.    The Lakers signing somebody, be it Gasol or Aldridge or somebody else.   Or San Antonio?    Is it just me or does it appear that 4/5 of these candidates just want to make a name for themselves more than actually planning to win the nomination?          I actually think he'll be an all-star in a few years.    Lakers?    There's substantive issues to take with Clinton, but they focus on nonsense.             Please let him be the Republican nominee!    What if my religion is against straight marriage? I want to impose my values on everyone! No more straight marriages!       You're right. She could have grown. She should embrace that angle and tell how republicans they can do the same.    Totally. You can't use your religion to impose your morality on other people. What if my religion is for gay marriage? Your religion can't impose its  values on laws of the land over mine.    Hillary used to say marriage is between a man and a woman. But now apparently she's LGBT supporter #1.   She's an opportunist.             We are unfortunately the minority.    Why not strip Aldo? Make it so only Conor can become the champ if he wins.                      Stop subjecting yourself to fox news and stop with the CAPS.   You don't understand what fascism is. Having health insurance is tyranny? So, is having to have car insurance tyranny too?          Consideration segregation ended decades ago, I think they can let go of their segregation flag.       what happens if Aldo doesn't make weight but Conor does?    The Suns not making any moves and drafting another player who will ride the bench.         I'm gonna say no to 99% of the population in regards to your question.    playing politics    God, I hate Ellie as a Suns fan.    The protesters were on the money. He knows he has 0 chance of winning. He just wants to get his name out there for future jobs like lobbying or Fox News.          9.9ppg for CSKA Moscow  better watch out   Maybe this tweet somehow changes the King's owners thought process that was going to have him make one decision, and he ends up making another one   he has to throw an off speed pitch so when he hits us with the fast ball we feel it      the butterfly effect bruh  this very seemingly insignificant event could alter the fate of the entire off season    no code lol      Morris twins, 13th pick, and a 2017 Miami Heat first round pick.    noooo      I heard a lot of negative hype about Amare before the draft. Once he started playing summer league, I knew he was going to be d dominant rookie. He was.    me? please don't associate me with bjpenn dot com, it's like the worst website in the history of websites, it is the leach of mma websites   I love BJ, but his website is appallingly bad         haha!   "great"   hahaha, nah, I'm good      let's hope they use this video in the few debates there will be   how about that play button that makes it look like a video? but it's just a link  i wish websites could get cancer   BJPenn dot come will surely clickbait it   That's a great young man.    I'd rather have him Congress than as a VP that Hillary will shove off to the side while she's taking her husband's advice.    Bernie will have to attract more minorities and women in order to have a chance at pulling off the great upset.          he's trading boogie because he's black?    i'm still waiting in case anyone wants to give me an example where people live without taxation    So, please educate me where on earth there is a place a person can live without taxation? I'll wait.   Don't be so small minded. There are some things we need to do collectively.       I'll be voting for him 100% and I'm talking to many people I know and trying to get their vote too.       really? how do you figure? i think a narrow field would help her challengers because the non-hillary votes are split up among fewer candidates       Love Makwan, but he isn't ready. He should try beating someone with a wikipedia page first.    Maybe he missed every ethics meeting ever?    If the ACA unravels million of people would stand to lose health insurance. Many of them would be in red states. I think if Republicans get their way on defeating the ACA, it will assure Democrats take the Presidency and both the House and Senate.    Sanders is the only moral candidate.    You realize the Bush administration set us on a death spiral and the Obama administration brought us back, right? Sanders would bring up the middle class. You know what people in the bottom 50% do with money? They spend it. His rebuilding infrastructure alone would do wonders for the economy. Millions of new jobs and many positive externalities.    Paul wants a flat tax. Neither will happen, unless congress goes pure red or pure blue. Does this take away from the fact that Sanders would be the best President possible for 99% of Americans?       Len is garbage. Pick 13 is likely garbage. The two other picks are likely not worth much either. Bledsoe is all we'd really be giving up.   Bledsoe, Len, pick 13, 2016 first round pick, 2017 Heat pick.   Interested?    centers seem to have the highest bust factor               all you gotta do is copy paste the top paragraph in google and go to the story that way and no pay wall       it's about momentum, those 6 count for a lot more if they set the tone    you should watch DS9 and see what you think then, check [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CC1vSKTX5SQ) out   did you forget about [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Orj5rNe5AEE)?    Because they are owned by the same corporations that own Clinton and Bush.    Granted, we don't have deep pockets like Hillary's banks, but we average like $40 and there are more of us every day. I'm ready to vote for him in the primary.   It says gymnasium, not oven.   His brother is a politician in England :)   You should reconsider your views on socialism. Learn more about it.   What if I told you Sanders's positions are aligned with the public more than Paul's was? And even more than all the so called mainstream aka corporately owned candidates?    I was wondering where the photonic cannon was in the finale against the borg.         why? if he's performing no reason he can't go another term   he wrote that think like 40 years ago, he's old, he too far left, etc etc BS  	139
 I haven't heard any news yet. It's probably a heart attack or an aneurysm. But it's surely worth it to be skeptical.     He " was found unresponsive on the lawn" and "pronounced dead at the scene," but chill out because "no foul play is suspected and the death is considered untimely." Well thank you officer; I'll be able to get absolutely zero hours of sleep tonight.    Dear Reddit, I've reached out to the virtual void to plead for a reason, any reason, on why I shouldn't commit suicide. I'm fully prepared. Please, enlighten me. What would you tell me? In fact, what would you tell your friends, family, or just a lone stranger like me on why he/she shouldn't commit suicide. This is hypothetical, and not in a cruel way. Just what would you tell me?    Thanks, this is really great. Wingnut is sick.    Oh Susquehanna is sweet. My top is Backpack by Andrew Jackson Jihad. Very popular but brilliant.   I've re-entered the world of folk punk and came across Ramshackle Glory, and they're very much like an Andrew Jackson Jihad. Live the Dream is their first album from 2011. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oK-79GfA9s I'd just check them out.        	7

  This time, the doors are standing wide open.   Edit: doors not soors    Well my hope was that since its in the second person, you make that choice. What would YOU do in that situation.   Damnit Abigail. Get your shit together!    makes sense. western jets are indeed, the coolest shit to ever have. ever.   I hate to tell you, but i've read a nosleep with the EXACT same plot, but I believe there was only one clone of the original...   Yeah, OP, i get you want this and i think its nice, but the truth is, they cant (and wont, i dont blame them) change a whole system that is already made, just to make crafting a bit more challenging.  Also, in some ways i dont like your idea. If you think to dayz epoch, it is very hard to build there. That has its problems, as it creates an extreme gap between the group of 10 guys with a cinder fortress and the noobs in the tent that get gunned down every five minutes.    Even in dayz, kos city, i make it my goal to not have to put anyone down. Dont get me wrong, i die a lot, but i plan to be the friendliest guy you will meet.   Yeah the garand is the one im praying for.   Here's my gun list: * **Pistols** * glock 19 * glock 21 * baretta 92fs * baretta px4 storm * Sig sauer p226 * Sig sauer p229 * S W .44 MAGNUM * Other revolvers * **Shotguns:** * Remington 870 (tac   wood stock) * Mossberg 500/590 * Saiga 12K * Benelli M4 * **Bolt-Action Rifles:** * Remington 700 * Mosin Nagant (go away DayZ fanboys) * M24 * M40 * **DMR's:** (super mega rare b/c same damage as bolt actions) * M1A Springfield * Mk17 SCAR-H * M110 * Dragunov SVD * Mk11  * SKS * M14 (+EBR version) * **Semi-Auto Rifles:** * AR 15 (Noveske [HQ]) * AR 15 (Bushmaster [Avg]) * IWI TAVOR * AK-74 * Mk-16 SCAR-L * Bushmaster ACR * Bushmaster M16 (AR-15) * M1 Garand (not sure if DMR or rifle) * **Assault Rifles:** * M-16A4 * M4A1 * AK-74 * L85A2 * G36C * Steyr AUG * (these were all chosen due to usage in modern militaries) * **RARES** * AR-15 (.300 AAC BLK) * M-27 IAR * Bullpup mod SKS * Bullpup mod Remington 870 * M249 * Honey Badger (5.56/.300 AAC) * L96-A1 (.338 LM) * M240 * Glock 18 * SIG SAUER 5.56 (Swat Variant) * M1A (.338 chambered)        I would personally rather see more practical weapons. The xm2010 is rare as hell as is, and same for the m82. Desert eagles i guess, but they shouldn't be abundant. As for the tar and famas. The famas is an exotic weapon and should be rare. And the tar would probably be the civilian version (iwi tavor) and not have to be ultra rare   Alright so nearly every gun on earth... Don't forget, this is America.    "America, where you can buy a gun for cheaper than a month's rent"  	11

 Ya I have read all her books.  I liked Dark Places the most but ya you're right.  She writes some brutal stories.     Sharp objects by Gillian Flynn    You should check out Gurren lagann.     Freedom.   I'm throwing my money at the computer but nothing is happening.   Kill la kill.   I finished madoka magica but I'll check those out!   I was the same way man.  Check out kill la kill, first 2 or 3 episodes will seem a bit silly and girly but it quickly rakes a real dark turn.   Thank you!    I read all of the light novel translations that can be found in the sidebar.  My question is; is there a difference between those translations and the official ones? And how is that different from the progressive?   I actually wouldn't mind spending time with the avatar.  As long as I am an earthbender then I'm fine.    What is the middle one on the bottom row?   Congratulations, that Is officially my new wallpaper for my phone.  That is really good!   The struggle is real man.      Well tell them to hurry their ass up then.  I need to get my fix.   Does anyone know when vol.15 will be translated?   That's a good album.        R.K. Flame has some pretty cool knives.   I think Half-life has one of the best story lines in the business.     Who is your favorite fictional villain?   I can honestly say on the last episode I will loose my shit.   That bike looks like a death trap...and I absolutely love it!   The deepest circle in hell is reserved for people who knock over motorcycles just because they can.    I would have liked her more in dexter if every other word out of her mouth WASN'T a swear.   I love my 82' cb900, it is truly a great bike!   *just curious.   I agree with you, I was    Do you know when 15 is gonna be out?   I started reading them about a week ago...I'm already in volume 10.  Read them you won't regret it.   Wow.   I can understand that.     I never saw the appeal for knives like that.  Unless you're Sam Fisher or something they really aren't that practical.     How can you mend this broken heart - Al Green.   What is the third one from the bottom?   Michael is a Demigod.

 *Ensure ..... I highly doubt he's going back in time to buy insurance. That's just way to convoluted for any time travel paradox. Edit: Although it could make him rich with the payouts.....   His probablity logic is not off. They have a higher chance of having a smurf on their team because there is 5 people that you don't know if they are or not but only 4 on your team. So smurf chances are stacked in their favour unless as he suggested you are a smurf yourself. Of course that doesn't diminish the odds of the four on your team of course, but still higher chance on theirs.   I don't think mmo's which are a different type of game in all honesty but still a game with major updates, content and balancing still don't require you to be a certain pvp rank or have completed so much content to be a QA tester. So why should it be different for riot?   Quality assurance tester.   I don't think that Is the point the op is trying to get across. I completely agree hiring people based on their skill of the game is just silly, if it is true of course. That aside I have never heard of this from any game before other than their usually being a stipulation of a love for the game in question. Edit: For spelling.   I'm sure that isn't supposed to be possible, in ranked at least, in normals I'm not sure.   I am not entirely sure because I don't use target champs only. But I would imagine Riot had intended to not use both at the same time because that would make poking through the wave incredibly easy and thus would have set attack move to override target champ only. As I said not entirely sure but it makes sense to me.  	7
 Haha my singlet looks nothing like that... It's more of the "wife beater" type of singlet... And that's just my casual doing the gardening clothes. Also I leave all of my clothes at work as they are actually firefighting clothes (I'm in emergency services)   Thanks, I will go see one when I'm home for sure   This gorge is actually about a 10min drive from my work... It looks so much better in that picture then when I see it   So it really started yesterday after I finished ripping up my old lawn from my backyard. It took me around 10 hours and I was wearing a singlet. Dumbass me forgot to put sunscreen on my back where my skin shows... So I got sunburnt. My girlfriend gave me some moisturiser to put on it to make it better she told me "this works really well for me" so I put it on. This morning I went to work, putting more on in the morning and also at around 1pm (during lunch) getting towards the end of my shift my sunburn was starting to get pretty painful but because I'm a man... I worked through the pain. It wasn't until the end of my shift I couldn't take it anymore so I went to the medic. Took me shirt off and what do you know... I've had an allergic reaction to the moisturiser and my sunburn is now fully blistered and pussy... Half of which has popped and not very pleasing to look at... The nurse gave me some burnaid and sent me to my room to relax and go back to see her in the morning.

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.   A spider came down on his web from my ceiling and ONTO MY FUCKING LAP PILLOW. He landed on the pillow and began crawling across it, I was frozen in place unable to fucking move by this unsettling and surprising move.   Out of a rush of panic and delirium i used MY FUCKING HANDS to squish him into the pillow. But the pillow isn't a hard surface, there isn't enough surface friction there, I don't know if I killed him because I CANT FIND HIS GUTS OR CORPSE.   And to make matters worse I think he is a spiderling babe, so THERES PROBABLY MILLIONS OF THEM PLOTTING REVENGE.   I'm so fucked reddit. I gotta burn my apartment down. MY CAT IS NO FUCKING HELP. FAT CAT ASSHOLE.   I'm gonna try and find him, but my carpet is brown and my shorts/ and recliner are both black. FUCK. I'll try and update as the situation progresses into the early morning. Not sleeping tonight.   **UPDATE: Well reddit, I can't find anything. I can't find the spider's remains or his guts or his live body. Save yourself reddit. I'm a goner. I think maybe I will buy a hotel tonight. I'll bring my cat, as lazy and fat as he is, I don't want him to be killed. This is the end, I'm sure of it.**  Update: Still not found. Hard to sleep. Got a hotel with my cat the next two nights and set a bug bomb off in the apartment...  **TL;DR  can't find the spider i did or did not kill, may have to leave all my possessions and move...tonight**        Comet      This was a great forgotten film I feel like. It wasn't the best of movies, but it had some good acting, a solid story, and enough weirdness to say the time was well spent watching this creation.   So here's the discussion: What other forgotten films do you think are good? (or films no well known by the general movie buff)   It's still the strangest movie I've ever seen.                   Thanks to /u/KingCaspianX for counting down the last 200 with me!

When a video ended I went to start another one and VLC crashed immediately. I went to try the last video file that worked but it crashed too. I tried using my other video players but they all crash immediately.  HDC, VLC, Realplayer, itunes, they all crash when i start to play a video file- audio files they play fine.   I do not know why it started doing that so suddenly. It happened yesterday too, but I ran a malwarebytes scan and got rid of some malware and then it started working again. However, I ran malware again and it found nothing today. So I am confused.   I have windows 7, 64bit, 8GB Ram   All my graphics card drivers are up to date. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the video players. Any suggestions?          Does anyone think that this lady probably had a bothan husband? The way she conveys the information is so sad and filled with such sorrow.   I'm willing to bet one of the dead bothans was her lover.

I began using it a few hours ago to watch a television show .avi file and another was a .mkv file. It worked fine as it has always worked fine. Then I decided to listen to some music. So I listened to an audio file on the VLC player. When I was finished I went back to the video file and VLC crashed. It kept crashing upon trying to open a video file. It still plays music files .mp3 but not mp4, .avi. or .mkv files. It just crashes immediately. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling which did not work, as well as resetting all the preferences. Troubleshooted some stuff on youtube/google but couldn't find anything that was like this issue.  In addition, I tried installing older versions to no avail. I also ran a virus scan, but nothing changed.  EDIT: Fixed it. I ran Malwarebytes and it removed some malware and now VLC runs again. Weird.

It also goes to support a local artist in Columbus, Ohio. It also helps the artist attend art school.

'I've got your permit right here!' And thus began the best movie ever filmed. Kung Fury, a short film, about a cop who becomes Kung Fury, master Kung-Fu martial artist, via lightning/cobra strike.  He protects the city of Miami from crime with his super awesome one liners and impenetrable forces. This adventure he must hack time with the help of his friend Hackerman to rid the world of Hitler, who wants the pwoer of Kung Fury for himself.            Written   directed by David Sandberg, it was originally a trailer turned into short film. Made with the help of an amazing kickstarting campaign what David Sandberg has accomplished here is nothing short of brilliance in animation   filmmaking. After my first viewing, I thought it would be better if it could be a feature length film. Then I realized, I could just watch the film three times in a row and it would fulfill that need.    This film has everything you could ever want from an over the top, cheesy one liner 80's flick.   1. Laser-Raptors  2. Hitler, the villain  3. Triceracop- Half mancop/Half Triceratop  4. David Hasselhoff singing 80s style music   5. Cheesy one-liners   6. Arcade machines with lasers trying to kill people   7. Thor   8. Barbarianna   Katana, Viking Age warrior women with machine guns  9. The Nintendo Power Glove hacking time with 80s computers 'breaking' time.   10. T-Rex Vs Golden Metal Eagle monster fight with small t-rex arms vs small eagle legs.   11. Anime sequence with cobras as spirit animals.  12.  Amazing action sequence where Kung Fury takes on Hitler's minions. This scene is perhaps one of the greater achievements of the film. It reminded me of playing Mega Man   Sonic where the POV moves horizontally. Simply genius.   13. Cheesy product placement.   **14. And finally paying homage to Laser Unicorns with the beginning arcade game being laser unicorns and a laser unicorn seen in the anime sequence when Fury goes to 'heaven'.**     Every so often a film comes along, once in a lifetime, where it makes you rethink your entire life. This is that film. The greatest film ever made.  I salute this film. And now will go watch it again.   **Also, watch the film in 144P or the lowest setting on youtube if you can. It's better than HD. HD is good, but to get the full effect, go for the lowest setting in quality.**                                                                  I have an HP All in one. It is old I got it in 2011. I have used it to play two games in the past: Ultima Online and Dark Age of Camelot. It's always worked fine playing UO, never any overheating problems. I've never had any problems with Dark Age of Camelot until today. I went to re-download the game and play after haven't played for about a year...  When I go to patch the game, which takes some time to patch 3 GBs... my GPU gets up to around 80 degrees and the computer shuts off so I have to wait for it to cool down. I have a fan pointed at my computer to help, but it doesn't help so much. I don't have my computer connected to a TV or anything.   What could have changed in the past year that my computer would start overheating playing a game I've played for years on this machine? What can I do to ensure it won't overheat without having to buy anything at this juncture?   My drivers are all up to date. I have ATI Radeon HD 5570      Does anyone know if they have an ETA on when they are coming back up? It's a free server.                One of my favorite films growing up. It's not a particularly good film, but it is pretty awesome. It's such a different superhero type movie.  [Anyone remember this movie?](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099365/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1)            His Aunt Arctica.        *source: The Oatmeal*         I watched this movie again today. I figured it would be different than the last I watched it which was when I was 15/16. I liked it a lot then and I loved it even more now.     I understand the director has made really terrible films since this starting with The Village; however, Unbreakable is quite amazing. I enjoyed the acting from Samuel L Jackson. I think, besides a few other roles it may have been his best acting job. I liked the cinematography and the music. It gave each character a theme much like superhero films. For Bruce Willis, his character had cool colors always around him, greens   blues. While the supposed supervillain was immersed in purple. I liked that contrast.   I think what I enjoyed most in the movie was this idea of understanding our place in this world.   I liked watching it in contrast with the influx of all the comic book movies that are popular right now. This is so different from them, even more different than Nolan's Batman films. His Batman's films attempted a sense of more realism I think, but this film captures it ...differently, much more dramatic less action.   What are some movies similar to this? I can't think of any. It's unique.                                                                            Why couldn't they beam Spock/Khan back to the Enterprise while they are fighting? Chekov says it is become he can't get a lock because they are moving. But..in Star Trek (2009), he beams Kirk and Sulu back on board when they are falling without a parachute. So they were moving a lot faster/worse then, why can't he simply do the same this time when all they are doing is fighting?  Also...wasn't Kirk dead too long for them to save him. I mean, he was dead for what 30 minutes? That's...I don't understand this. So..Khan's blood can effectively raise the dead? Why don't they just harvest his blood?   I've seen 1, 2 and 3. I enjoyed 1 actually because it was more in space n shit. I liked Wrath of Khan a lot and the search for spock was interesting to say the least but wasn't really as good as 2, but it was better than 1.   I read the synopsis for 4..and ..humpback whales? It just seems kind of strange. So out of 4, 5, and 6 which one is seen as next best from 2?      I heard some stuff about insurance money 10 million dollars not to play golf ever again. But that was over a year ago. He was a solid golfer, I loved watching him play.                   What order should I read middle earth books in?   I have read The Hobbit   Lord of the Rings.

    Can someone please explain to me exactly what a Homeowner's Association is?    No. Just No. Stalactites is the place you go at four in the morning when everywhere is shut.   That man is very attractive. I found it very distracting.    "He's not coming back"   I loved it. I don't know how many interminable entitled rich family dramas I've say thought thinking 'I wish someone would come and kill all these people.'   That said, I think it did go a little too far into schlock at the end.    I thought it was too soon to be in other formats.   I sing Space Oddity to my daughter as a lullaby. We took her to see the movie at the drive in. She slept through it.   I didn't realise this was available as a download.    As little respect I have for Hubbard and his 'works' there is little evidence he actually said this. This article covers both sides.  http://www.sweenytod.com/cos/didhesaythis.html     Then we can finally get The Street Fighter II movie the world deserves!    Heath Ledger slowly opens his eyes surrounded by machines and chemicals.  "What happened?"   "Mr Ledger. You've been dead for fives years." says the scientist. "But, with the latest technology, we've been able to cheat death itself and raise you, like Lazarus, from your grave. We don't have long though. The process is only temporary."  "Oh god! Thank you! I'll have one more chance to hold my daughter. To say a proper goodbye to my family. I'll be able talk to Michelle. I always regretted how things ended between us. Thank you for this second chance!"  "I'm sorry Mr Ledger. There isn't much time and we need you to make another Batman movie."     Cancer?   I agree. All characters in all movies should be played by a beiged coloured, genderless creature with no distinguishing features at all. That's something we can all enjoy.  https://fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net/hprofile-ak-prn1/50515_243006402673_3668975_n.jpg   I'd suggest re-reading what you just wrote and having another stab at it.

Technically, it was promoted by Melbourne City Council as a place to watch the fireworks last year. 10,000 people showed up and trashed the park. This year, Yarra City Council begrudgingly provided some services.      You're an idiot.   Asking people to use a bin is not the same as asking people not to have an abortion.      It's only a disaster if you live in the area.   I'm calling bullshit. While there might be true events that inspired filmmakers to create a fictional work, there is no way most of these films are 'based on' true stories.      I had the opposite reaction. Wait? The  guy who made Braindead/Dead Alive, Meet The Feebles and Bad Taste is being given millions to make Lord of The Rings?   Steven Sodeburgh always surprised me. Magic Mike, Haywire, Schizopolis   You'll need to google it like I did.    I do that all the time. I was trying to google 'Racist Mascots' the other week and my mind wandered half way through. Long story short, I now have the phrase 'Racist Masturbation' on my search history.     My daughter is 36. She's getting really sick of my shit.    George R. R. Martin bought an old movie theatre and watches films from the cry room so we can enjoy the movie without the rest of the audience noticing him as the owner/author.   http://www.npr.org/2013/10/07/227772024/george-r-r-martin-author-and-movie-theater-guy   I take my daughter to the drive in and the special bring your babies sessions.    Also, cash converters.    Also, don't use a boxcutter. Good advice.   It. Not I. Sorry. I should have been clearer.   He was in the movie so, yes. Yes, I do.  EDIT: Clarity.   He could have played Parker too.    I know right? How DARE they feel bad when someone tells a racist joke? I feel so oppressed.   Sadly, the large majority of people who make racist jokes lack the cognitive abilities to be able to tell whether their friends is smiling politely or genuinely amused.   I have friend who CONSTANTLY makes Jew jokes. He just does not get that it offends and annoys our jewish friends, despite what they tell him.

Life is Beautiful killed me.    Fun fact! This is called Gestalt's Law of Continuity. With information removed, our brains tend to fill in that information by continuing the already existing pattern.

And not to be confused with 'The Double'  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWhikLYeSQ0     I really enjoyed Side By Side. Keanu Reeves' contribution to film is underrated, even if his acting isn't.     Is that the Saddam Hussein one?    Where can I see it?   But we're in love with the IDEA of them. That counts right?    My pick is Fortress (1986) the Australian horror film about a group of children and their teacher kidnapped for ransom. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfTkKaSZFyk  Upvote the movies you haven't seen, downvote the ones you have   I thought you were telling us that 'Suggestions   Requests' are the two things canadians can't live without.    A lot of people see Enemy of the State as the sequel to The Conversation.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conversation#Enemy_of_the_State_connections   The original video is deeply disturbing.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOyDrycsS2g   Coburg is a great suburb but Pentridge Village is not great. It has a depressing vibe and isn't really near very much of interest.   If you're on a budget, you could do better.      Shane Maloney's series is fantastic.

I don't care how good you think Mamasita is, I'm not going to stand in a stairway for an hour when I can get dumplings a couple of hundred metres away in minutes.    Snowtown   Life Is Beautiful    The most depressing piece of movie trivia is about the 14 year old girl from The Crow.    After the death of Brandon Lee on the set of The Crow, she had to return to the set in order to film the scene in which Eric Draven says "Sarah, I do care." with a body double in the character of Draven, but did not appear in another film until 2009   That's a long commute.   To be honest, it was a charity raffle and I didn't really want any of the stuff in the basket that desperately. (except maybe the box of favourites)   I don't know, my wife would probably not be too keen on the idea...   nah, that's ok...i guess.     Woah! There was an ICE CREAM MAKER? Deals off, I'm coming to get it. :)   If you could provide us with a list of the wonderful crap in the basket, that would be great!   Or lazy :)   Thanks   Cool, is your real name Alannah Rose?   It's a raffle I entered full of random stuff. DVDs, Gardening supplies etc. I live in Preston and don't want to make the journey.   EDIT   Turns out the gift basket contained an ice Cream Maker, Two Nickelodeon DVDs, a man dvd boxset, a pack of screwdrivers, a portable gas bbq, a 30 metre hose, wooden blocks that spell HOME, a box of Favorites and two bottles of Wine.          Here in Australia we had thing happen. After 35 people were killed in a 1996 massacre, the conservative Prime Minister, immediately put a strict control on guns   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur_massacre_(Australia)   I'm not sure I understand the point of this film.  The conclusion the films seems to be the exact opposite of what actually happened.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._L._Travers#Disney_version      I was going to post a link to some Danish Cookie pics I submitted last week but don't want to be accused of being a karma whore.

What if they were able to study the ship and use what the learnt as a basis for modern computing.  This would make it more believable that the two systems work in a similar enough way to connect the ships.     Where can we hear him play?

It broke my heart.  *After the death of Brandon Lee on the set of The Crow, she had to return to the set in order to film the scene in which Eric Draven says "Sarah, I do care." with a body double in the character of Draven, but did not appear in another film until 2009.*   One of my favourite films of all time.    Neil Hope, much like the character he played, lost his parents young and struggled with alcoholism after Degrassi. He died in 2007.  What's really sad it the general public didn't realise he had passed until last year.        I feel genuinely happy for that man. It probably made the mascot's day too.   Die Hard 4.0.  The computer nerd is play by Kevin Smith   My favourite review quote so far.   "The Crocodile Dundee II of superhero films-in a good way!" - Slate     I read that whole storyline when it first came out. I was 13 at the time and read it at my local newsagent/newstand after school. I'd finish school, go to the shop and read a couple of pages of the latest issue until the owner told me to get lost.  It was the first comic storyline I read from start to finish and has coloured all of my reading since.     I work as a writer and consultant on con artists and scams so this is somewhat my specialty subject.   Most 'real world' pickpockets lack the delicate skill of pickpocket entertainers or 'honest' pickpockets. After all, some one like Apollo will steal the watch off your wrist even after he's told you that he is going to.   Street pickpockets rely on crowds, heavy misdirection and teamwork to steal your belongings. Entertainers have to do it under a literal spotlight.  Bob Arno is also very good but, if you're looking for a teacher, Apollo can not be beat.   You might enjoy this annotated video I made of the opening scene of The Pickpocket (1954)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ighoD9vtpGQ   This is brilliant.    Hipsters aren't that bad! They're they ones who listen to all the new shitty music and find the good stuff so the rest of us don't have to!      Really not a fan of that film. The opening 10 minutes is an amazing piece of film making but the rest feels like a series of oscar baiting cameos and mindless patriotism.     There is nothing natural about riding a horse so hard that it breaks it's leg, something that happens regularly in the horse racing industry.   There is employment in many, many terrible things in the world, that does not mean we should continue doing them.    The danger of running is that their leg snaps to the point of having to kill it where it lays  How is that not dangerous? Or cruel?  The horse racing industry know of the risk they are putting these animals into and they continue to do it.         Bullshit! This activity puts horses into dangerous positions again and again and then kills them when they are injured.    Rucker's Hill baby!

 What *is* popularity? Does it accurately show the preferences of people who have been on rpggeek.com who were arsed enough to vote? Close enough. Does it accurately represent what rpgs are played most around the world? No. Does it accurately represent what rpgs people *want* to play around the world? No. Does it accurately represent how much money is being spent on each game? No. Does it accurately represent what games someone could expect to see being played if they walked in to a random gaming store? No. Does it accurately represent what you would see being played if you walked into a random gamer's house on game night? No.   In fact, every single one of those questions would have a different ranking. All being "correct", and yet all being different, despite representing the same basic thing. Without a goal, the data has no meaning. With a goal, the data has a bias. Decide which way you want to be wrong.   I can actually give you a *real* answer though. D D5e is doing really well, and is *mostly* replacing all other forms of D D for a large majority of people who like D D. Mostly because it is new, and is "good enough" to not piss people off. Hype isn't really a major driving force in its success. It is not better or worse than Dungeon World. They are also not mutually exclusive. There are people who like both, people who like one and not the other, and people who don't like either. None of those people are wrong.   I generally think these lists are garbage, and don't really think they represent anything accurately (I know way too much about data collection/interpretation).   However, seeing Pathfinder all the way down at 33 brings a tear of joy to my eye, and so god bless this list for that.   Here are some of my favorites:  [Deadzone](http://www.manticgames.com/games/deadzone.html) (kickstarter for new stuff [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1744629938/deadzone-infestation-sci-fi-skirmish-game) ): Miniatures skirmish wargame. I'm not going to list all the wargames I like, but this one not only has a pretty low buy in, but also uses a pretty small table space (relatively), and has super cool terrain bits.  [Zombicide](http://zombicide.com/en/): Cooperative miniatures strategy game where you play as people trying to survive a zombie apocalypse.   [Mars Attacks](http://www.manticgames.com/games/mars-attacks-the-miniatures-game.html): Miniatures game based on the movie (sorta). Can actually be combined with Deadzone, funnily enough.  [Netrunner](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android-netrunner-the-card-game/): Cyberpunk card game.   Exactly what I thought when I saw it. I'd watch that movie though.   Each box is full of staples that you will most likely use in many lists for that army, and jacks/beasts that can be magnetized.   I've been playing Warmachine for a few years, with an army of some size for at least half the factions, and these boxes are such a great deal that I have bought/pre-ordered every single one. For some of the boxes I already have some of the units (like bane thralls, gun mages, choir, etc), but the box is still a good deal even if I just threw those models in the garbage (except Cygnar, where it's only an okay deal if I throw the doubles in the garbage). If I can use two, I'm going to keep them, but a lot of them I'm going to give away to some people I'm trying to get into the hobby.  Keep in mind though, I got mine at about $97, so ymmv. I did the math though, and even if you are paying the full retail of $130, you are still getting a good deal (assuming you need the models). Cygnar is probably the least good deal (discount-wise), as you could buy everything that comes in the box individually (minus the mini-rulebook, another nice bonus to the box) for about $140 from somewhere like discountgamesstore. Skorne *was* probably the best (I don't even like Skorne and I had to have it).   I add Fate to just about every game I run. 5e is pretty easy. Anything true about a character works like an Aspect (all the things in their racial description and background, for instance), and just bump the number of Inspiration points they can have at a time to 3 (they are now Fate points, but you don't have to tell them that). Reward them like you would Fate points, and tell them they can use them to take advantage of "aspects" of their character.   Games I've done this successfully with: Paranoia, Iron Kingdoms, Stars Without Number, Gamma World, Rogue Trader, D D5e, Shadowrun, and Numenera.  Funny thing is, I've never ran a Fate game on its own, and I haven't liked any of the Fate games I've played in. I technically don't like Fate by itself. Really I just hate the "well, how about you word it *this* way, that would make it a better Aspect" thing that happens, it makes you sound like an ass, and it makes people not used to that kind of game hate the game. Sometimes crappy aspects are perfectly fine, especially when you are just starting out.   I definitely start low and ramp up higher as the group gets used to my style of GMing (and the game system, if they are new to it). I would say I start in the 2-3 range, and end in the 7-10 range. It's a bigger range at the top, because I don't ever have just one option for success.   1 group in 100 might do *everything* right, but most are going to have to make tough choices about what gets done well. Groups that don't care usually have everything go wrong, with maybe one thing working out in a way that isn't a complete disaster.    [Space bard in action.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRYNYb30nxU)   I started with Mercs (bought a full Searforge army right off the bat) and I don't regret it at all. I can't say it's for everyone, but it's served me well.    Models acquired this way will stare at their owner with judging eyes all the time. They also will make every win they have taste bitter with shame, and losses all the more crushing served with a side order of guilt.   A dark wash and some highlighting would really help bring out the details, but I love the color choices.   I'm just kidding, she's four. Great job!  Thin your paints... or something.   I would have pegged the Prince of Persia as a GURPS man. And you think you know a person...   There is an official alternative option for initiative in the DMG that is basically this. I do it often in more narrative focused games.   Sounds like fun.   I've been running games since 1996, and I still get nervous when I start a new campaign. You'll get past that and to the fun fast enough.   Best of luck to you. There is some serious hate for GMs for hire, which is crazy. I think it's great, and in fact, when I stop blowing all my money on miniatures, I might hit you up (don't hold your breath though, wargaming addiction is a tough habit to kick).   Not only is it not copyrightable, if it was, your idea would probably be taken. Dice have been around for thousands of years, and even just in the last decade there have been probably a thousand games with different dice mechanics.   The good news? No one is going to steal your idea. Ideas are cheap, and common. Even the good ones. The work you put into an idea is what you sell, because that's what is worth something.   Bad news: No one cares about your "unique" idea. There are thousands of people with dreams and ideas that think about how cool it is that they had this nifty idea. Very few actually put in the blood, sweat, tears, time, and financial backing to make those ideas into something that other people can appreciate.   Best of luck to you though.   Link me.

I had an idea in middle school for running an rpg campaign where the races were different kinds of food. Human's were burgers, halflings were sliders, gnomes were hot dogs, orcs were bbq ribs, elves were I think tacos, dwarves were pizza, half-orcs were pulled pork sandwiches, and half-elves were burritos. Pretty sure it hasn't been done yet, and I'm pretty sure it was about 10 minutes before lunch time when I thought of it. Speaking of, is it too late for dinner, or too early for breakfast?   Yep. I haven't run a full game of it yet, but it has a pretty good "job" generator section that's pretty good. Made by the same people who made the most recent Firefly rpg, and it apparently uses the same engine.   I've never played the Payday games, but there is an [RPG based on the TV show Leverage](http://www.margaretweis.com/index.php/shop#!/~/product/id=9555048).   [Not helpful, but relevant.](http://oglaf.com/kingshaped/)   I'm just curious, in what way did you think it was limited?   *edit: My science is bad and I feel bad.    Utter rubbish. What textbook did you get that out of? One from the 70s? You might want to try a more recent one, one not written by racists.    I feel bad for non-American cultures when aliens get here firing lasers. They just won't know what hit'em.   My favorites:   The Infinite Improbability Drive from Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.  The BTL or "Better Than Light" Drive from Spaceship Zero.  Warhammer40k's Warp (basically the same as Event Horizon).  The space travel from the Ender's Game series. This one is basically just a ship that travels really fast, but because it approaches the speed of light, time slows down for the people on the ship, but not for people who aren't traveling. Which means it seems like a 1 year trip to you, if you are the one travelling, but it might take you 20 years to get there.

Might not be what you are looking for, but if you want to check it out, it's for sale [here](http://paizo.com/products/btpy7z7f?Dungeon-Issue-99-with-Polyhedron-158).   I just picked up the All-in-one box for Legion. I saw I have the option between the two Strider units, and I thought I'd see which I should assemble them as. I have zero other legion.  I'm looking to eventually get p/eAbsylonia, pLylyth, and eThagrosh if that helps.  *edit: Also, what's the best way to do 15pt using the All-in-One box?   It's just a starter adventure and pre-mades for the new Unleashed book. It's the same as what's in the adventure kit, except digital. Map tiles / minis not included.   http://www.drivethrurpg.com/browse.php?keywords=Iron+kingdoms x=0 y=0 author= artist= pfrom= pto=         If only it was for something other than Pathfinder.   If they are souls in mechanikal bodies, with full human intelligence (something jacks don't really have), you might want to look at the Convergence of Cyriss Clockwork Vessel stuff for the IKRPG in No Quarter #48.    I was just thinking about this again today, and I think I'd settle for having a Searforge Junior Warcaster. Preferably female.  If she had 3 focus, she could run two bunnies and have 1 upkeep going.   [This is a great idea. I'm so glad I thought of it.](http://i.imgur.com/snLplqq.jpg)   If it's just paint by numbers, the person who said that must be able to do [this](http://www.coolminiornot.com/), right?

 have you restored or updated to 8.4 ?   let's hope it won't be necessary   and what if they get out of control ?    No issues here, have you restored or updated to 8.4?   Just bring the old app back !   Sure, I'm sitting watching tv and I'm sweating just like I was running    The problem is virus and bacteria will get stronger and will resist our medicines   Have in mind the Air have a slightly bigger footprint     if the size and weight aren't a worry get the retina, your eyes will thank me   you'll be probably disappointed in less than a year with the 4s .. the 5s is the sweet spot. if it's too much get the 5. you could get good deals on it   it's really to force people to use Apple Music   The thing is there's 5 button on the bottom but I only use one ! The paylist, albums are all mixed up   yes sure, if the're certified they're fine. There are even gold cables now !   don't use 3rd party cables/chargers    that'd be heaven .. For those who don't use Apple Music the new music app is rubbish .. great album artwork though   there are people that have a carrer like that, but i imagine it's not that simple   you're not harming your device by jailbreaking .. all messages are saves via iTunes backup. wpa2 I'm not sure, i used an app but was back in iOS 6 I dont know if it's working in iOS 8 but it knew all default passwords for thomson, linksys, and many other brands   indeed ! I wouldn't imagine having a stock iPhone, it's really boring .. that's what android users say   CCSettings for sure ! the stock control center is rubbish, you can't put the toggles you actually need ! C'mon Apple    it might be harder but iOS 9 will be jailbroken. cross fingers   I don't believe in 4K video. They'll start with 16gb storage ..  more ram maybe.. force touch please !   dreamboard and bitesms for sure .. Reading all the comments feels like travelling back in time    if nothing works I guess your only alternative is to try again   did you updated or restored to 8.4 ?    8.4 for sure. You'll get the new music app, of course it's rubbish if you don't care about Apple Music but still os the latest version. I updated from 8.1 and I notice better battery   it's just $1.8 in India   * backup in iTunes * you restore to 8.4 * jailbreak * restore backup * open cydia add repos * install tweaks, themes, anything you want from cydia  all App Store apps will be added after you sync your device in iTunes   you just need to write down the repos. Restoring from backup will get your tweaks working, make sure they're compatible with 8.4 ! Add the repos to cydia and install tweaks, all settings will be set    it will bring back all the tweaks' settings, just need to reinstall them.   you can try but restoring is 100% sure it'd work   all jailbreaks I did with 8.4 being the only exception (I haven't tried) were made after OTA updates   Actually you can,  you'll have to edit a file inside the backup which says the version.   I guess they're worried about you lol   Google how to put the iPhone in recovery mode    I restored my iPad and it was "waiting for iPad" maybe 10 minutes and it continued and restored fine. you have to restore it   it's enabled by default. I was just asking. If you have it enabled it's weird   it can be disabled inside apps in the stock settings menu. Check if you have it activated   they seem shorter, but the global clocks have one more second to count I am right ?   how'd we find stuff on the web ?   Exactly    That's really a shower thought ahaha   What about being in a self driving car and receiving a handjob ?   It just shows the diversity of the world. You can be hated in one place and be an hero in another    We would think how many people exists on earth. Limited number of children and so on    thanks ! The dedicated graphics it's not for everyone.. It's expensive but it's a great machine !!   it works just fine   Yes ! It's nice to have a jailbreak for the latest major release before iOS 9   just follow the steps and you'll be fine    i did a jailbreak using iTunes 12.2, the latest version and TaiG 2.2.0 today   that's the problem. I had the same issue. Backup your device and restore it. Then apply TaiG. Finnaly, restore from backup. Just need to add all repos to cydia. All tweaks' settings are saved in the iTunes backup  	50

 We can't stop you from using our hotels for your "escort services" (seriously, what idiot is going to pay $250 for a 15 minute chat with a woman, unless there is sex involved), but don't post advertisements using our hotel rooms in the picture.  You're putting our logo out to the world, saying "come here and there are prostitutes", and that tarnishes our reputation.  And I'm not even gonna get into the **underage** prostitutes!

Signed, a very angry Front Desk Manager at a local hotel, who is tired of seeing our rooms on Back Page.  P.S. If I see **you** on Back Page, I may let you check in to the hotel, then tip off the police. Fair warning.   It's being tracked on Lookout. Last seen near Angelo and Santa Fe.  Give it back.  Edit - good news! The person that had the phone got in contact with us, and show be returning it to the RTA lost and found today.   Obviously it is possible, but will they utilize it?  Doing so would allow Windows users to seamlessly move from the HoloLens to the PC with little change.   http://imgur.com/G9hBLQt  Can it be repaired to a playable level? And roughly how much would that cost?   ... can they do a Magical Boys anime that isn't... girly?  I started doing a writeup of costuming and theme to make a more serious version, mixing elements of Sailor Moon with the live action Super Sentai.  I wrote out the whole thing, making suggestions along the way (I hadn't posted it, because I hadn't gotten the reference pictures for it), and realized that someone *had* already made a serious Magical Boys anime, that had certain parallels to Sailor Moon without being a parody of the genre...  Yoroiden Samurai Troopers, also known as Ronin Warriors, featured an all-male troop of young men who transformed into powerful ronin. The costuming was mostly angular (straight lines are more visually masculine compared to curves), had little frills or excess (especially in the sub-armor form).  Like Sailor Moon, they fought with their faces uncovered, but (as fitting for the more stoic men) focused less on battle speeches and more on weapons and attacks.  It was funny, I watched the whole series when it came out, and nearly forgot about it when it was most appropriate...  So, the real question is... can we do a show like this again?            That one site frequented my Marvelous doesn't have a lot of them.   Do you not use mining software to gain ReddCoin at all, instead focusing on the proof of velocity to award?  Does everybody get a piece of the block reward based on their velocity (like interest on a bank account), or is it more random than that.  And, outside of tipping on different platforms, how useful is this as a cryptocurrency?         Yesterday, one of our regular, problem guests checks out of her room without saying anything. No big deal, happens all the time, but housekeeping needed my help getting inside the room.  On entering, I see ash from a cigarette on the nightstand next to the bed.  She comes back today (with the frequency that she does this, I'm sure she is a prostitute) looking for a room. I tell her flatly that she was smoking in the room before and because it was a nonsmoking room she would have to pay a cleaning fee.   I didn't smoke in the room, though. I don't smoke cigarettes.    My friend might have done some marijuana...  I tell her that regardless of the kind of cigarette, there is no smoking allowed in the room, and she doubles down.   My friend was probably just rolling a blunt...  I let the comment pass the first time, but I had to speak up.   Don't tell me you're doing marijuana in the rooms, because that's illegal. If you want to stay, you will have to stay in a smoking room, and you'll have to pay a cleaning fee for smoking in our nonsmoking room.   How much is that?   $50 (our reg card says we can charge up to $250)  She left, and I doubt she'll return while I am working. (But, she'll probably try and see if the night guys go easy on her.)                  During the play scene, after Bipierrot destroyed everything, the girls introduced themselves for the audience.  Mars mentioned her fire attacks and red heels. Jupiter mentioned her "talent" and thunder... Then Mercury loudly proclaims "I am the number one student on the practice exam."  You would think she would be smart enough not to say something like that, if they are *secret* identities.   Sorry about the long one.  We had a power outage last night. Nothing major, just an idiot crashing into a pole.  Of course, everyone demands special treatment in the morning because of it. Most of the people were happy to get a $10 discount and be done with it, some didn't even ask for that much...  But there is always one.  He comes in around 10:30, and asks us to comp him the entire room for his stay. I tell him, "No. I can't do that. And with your room paid through a third party, I can not adjust your rate. But, if you stay over tonight and pay with me, I'll give the room for $69.95 ($15 off the current room rent)"  Well, that isn't good enough for them, because they use some weird referral system that pays out in room discounts, so they were getting the room for like $62.  So, they go off and decide to use that system to get the room again, asking for a little extra time to complete it. I tell them that I can give until 11:30, half an hour past checkout.  About 11:20 he comes back in and says that he forgot some paperwork in the room, and he'll need to get it to pay. At 11:45 he tells me that he needs until 12:30.  At 12:15, his wife/girlfriend/drug-addicted-crack-ho comes out, saying they need until 1... at this point, I tell her flat out, "we can not keep waiting like this. You need to take care of this right away."  "Okay, I know... But your Internet wasn't working right and you just need to give us more time! Oh, and can I get some fresh towels."  I reiterate that housekeeping is waiting on her to pay for the room, and that we will not provide housekeeping in any form until it is done.  1 PM rolls around... still no payment. I call her this time, and she tells me she needs another 15 minutes... That she is putting in the information right then, and it will be showing up on the computer any minute.  No such luck.  1:10 - I call her back, and she says that it is *literally* being processed and it will only be another 6 minutes.  Now, at this point, I'm tired of the excuses. I told her flat out that we need this done *now*, and if it doesn't happen, I'll be contacting the police to evict her.  Wouldn't you know it... nothing happens.  So, I call the police (non emergency) and have them send a uni. While waiting for that, the guest comes out "trying to get the room taken care of". Even though she already told me that it was being processed. Cops drive up, and she goes back to the room.  They talk a few minutes, and she gets them to admit that if I can be convinced to accept payment, she can stay, so she comes back to the desk.  I stick to my guns, but there is one factor I can't control.  My boss decided to walk out from the back. I kept him out of this for a reason. He has a pathological fear of confrontation with guests, and if you talk to him, you'll probably get your way. And sure enough... the guest waves cash at his face, even though it's 2 PM and the police are here to remove her, and he says just let her stay.  Every god damned time. Bring in a pet? He'll break his own posted rules to let you stay. Smoke in a nonsmoking room? Don't worry about it.  He's so interested in the online reviews that he would probably let someone rent a room with money that was stolen from him.  TL;dr guest refuses to pay until police are actually there to evict her 3 hours late, boss lets her stay anyway.          How many of you are interested in *legitimate* shops utilizing this system?  I sell toys, games, and other licensed merchandise. Would it be helpful or harmful for me to run on Open Bazaar?          We had an official celebrity stay with us.  Simon Wright from AC/DC was playing at a local sports bar with his current band, Hellion.  I didn't feel right posting anything while he was in house.  Really cool guy. We joked a round just a little, didn't have a problem showing his ID or anything.  Unfortunately, I didn't get off work in time to see the show.      Mostly children were buying, as is expected. He sold a handful of Mystery Minis, a bunch of Yu-gi-oh 10-4s and a pair of plush dolls.  Luna is officially sold out now.  The three girls who came in the finals on the costume contest were quite excited by the Mystery Mini they each received and showed them off to me afterward. (They got Pinkie Pie, DOMO Riddler, and Batgirl).  I plan on going to the next one, which will be in March.  If you are in the area, stop by and see the Maidens (and me, come see me.)      Website is still screwing the pooch, but I am able to invoice using a new software.  Send an email with your order and your information to admin@betonwhite.com  This system will also be used for any partial - paid preorders and layaways, which are not able to be made on the site.               A passing mention by a car service (that happens to run prostitutes), listed Bitcoin as a payment method. Not explained or questioned, just a passing mention, as if it were a foreign currency.   Getting to Level 70 should be a cinch now. Only ~~1.5%~~ 1.7% of all PS4 players have reached that feat.  I just wanted to tell someone, since everyone is asleep. Carry on.      But, it it normal to have maintenance fees that are equal to 70% of your BTC mining?  Second major question, if I get referrals, I get 3% of their GHS, but are the fees assessed the same way?   It will be a corruption of Arnim Zola.  Zola feared death more than anything else, and so he put himself into the computer banks at New Jersey (insert joke about NJ being worse than death here). We can assume that he would have had a backup within SHIELD's databases.  When Natalya released the HYDRA/SHIELD files onto the internet, that purge included the backed up Arnim Zola.  Enter the enterprising young scientist, Henry Pym, who uses the Zola "program" as a basis for ULTRON, who in turn becomes the very thing Red Skull wanted in the first place.  Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.      We were talking about money (he is an Indian student working here while in college) and the conversation naturally ended up on bitcoin.  When I told him about the less than $1 transaction fee worldwide, he was convinced.   He's getting a coinbase and cex.io account set up, and once he does, I'll send over a GHS for him to start earning.     Why is it, when we live in a post-9/11 society, where people are worried about security, where you can't get on a plane of your credit card doesn't match your ID, would you get your credit card to have a nickname on it?  The one I saw wasn't even an imaginative nickname. It was "Sal Salinas".  Basically anyone with the last name Salinas could walk up, and use this guy's card, just by saying "Yeah, I go by 'Sal'".  It would be like me getting a card that read "Kinyutaka", then wondering why I get challenged on it.            Local customer comes in, gets the room for the night, causes no real problem until the morning.  11 o'clock rolls around, and they haven't left yet. Housekeeping asks them if they are staying, and to call me at the front desk to take care of it.  They don't. I call them, and they feed me the usual lie "we overslept and we'll come down to pay right away".  They don't. They never come down. We call again, and go up to find that they simply took their time to leave and didn't bother saying anything after they told me they were going to stay.  What's worse is the pile of dog shit sitting in the corner of the room for us to clean up.  We are not a pet friendly hotel. It is on the signs, it is on the registration, and we tell it to the guest's face when they are signing.  I wish I could plaster these people's names all over the place, so everyone knows what kind of people they are...   Idea comes from a post on /r/ravenclaw (on mobile, so I can not link)      ... and she felt there was something a bit off. She couldn't even explain to me what she didn't like about the episode.  [Lamebrained theory](#s "My thought was that feeling of unease was intentional by the directors, mimicking the Doctor's faulty regeneration and memory issues. Case in point, the scene at the end, where the robot may have jumped or the Doctor may have thrown him. Even *he* doesn't know what actually happened.")  I think the visual direction of the show is meant to mimic the personalities of the Doctor.  (Pardon the music video here) [The Ninth Doctor - Running Away](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flH-uPX3zfk)  [The Tenth Doctor - The Lone Wanderer](http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lek0lvl8ud1qb84lwo1_500.gif)  [The Eleventh Doctor - The Epic Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ecycHAZtaM)  [The Twelvth Doctor](#s "The Swiss Cheese Brain") (No video yet)  What do you think?      I have the whole script, and just need to get the images and sound files to complete the program.  Too bad I'll probably never be able to make a real release, as it would be quashed by Hasbro.      Only 2000 will be made. I have ordered a few for my store.  Snap them up quick.             But is it just because of the Square-Enix sale?               I would like to use small videos for my store to give a simple demonstration of the cards in use, but I do not want a boring demo with two people playing the game.  If anyone can make a short, less than 1 minute scene with Jace directing his Tidal Warrior (or other blue creature less than 3/3) to attack Chandra, who blocks it with a Cinder Wall, and you would be willing to work on other short videos for the same purpose, please contact me.  Videos will be uploaded onto a YouTube channel and linked to my website at www.betonwhite.com, with links to your personal website or YouTube channel.  Edit: I forgot to spell out that I do intend to pay for the work performed, but would like to speak with the artist that volunteers for this chance before negotiating a price.      We have a swim meet this weekend here in town, and of course that means that a number of teams are staying at the hotel.   They *all* want to leave their stuff in the rooms, go to the meet in the morning, come back around 2, shower and get their stuff, and leave around 3 PM.  Naturally, with our checkout time at 11AM, I had to deny their requests.  At least one team just decided they were going to take it anyway. I might have to just charge them for tonight, a couple more want to complain to my boss, which won't do much good, though they will probably lie on me and say that I was incredibly rude (the standard when someone is told "no"), which my boss will believe and I'll get in trouble.   But if I just let half a dozen rooms leave whenever they want, I'll get in trouble for that.      Forgive me if I mention one that was there that I didn't notice.

Naturally, my boss, who has known me for years, believes every word this guy has said and threatens to fire me.  I think it is time to find something new.    The grand prize? $1,000,000. Or is it?  Out of the entire promotion, 2 people (1 US, 1 Canadian) will get to draw a single number from 1-50, and if they get the right number, they win $1,000,000.  If they don't, they only get $10,000 each.  The promotional materials probably cost more than the prizes they are going to give out.  At least a car dealership gives a booby prize to everyone that enters.          I'm up to date on getting all previous Milestones issued (my time has been hard on me still), and I have noticed that we have now exactly 59 orders, meaning the next completed order (canceled ones don't count, even if the computer does) will be the recipient of the 6th Customer Milestone, $1 for any order under $50,  or 2% of the total if above.   He says he's the "ex-King of Cypress", black, young, blonde mohawk. He's rambling on and on about how he came down here from Houston to rescue a girl.  While here, he has had multiple tickets, his license suspended, and his car impounded.  All this sounds like a sob story by a homeless guy to stay in the lobby, right?  Another guest comes in while he's there, asks about rates, etc, and when she leaves, he pops up with a rifle scope in his hands, saying "she wouldn't even know what hit her" and starts talking about his skills at killing people.  I'm wondering if I should put a tip into Mental Health once we have him in a room.   It's by no means a complete set, and I think I got rid of most of the Energy cards, but does anyone still have, play or want these?  I'll try to post pictures later on, if anyone wants.   The following List is the price of buying the game on the PSN store on PS3 (if available) and the cost of a 90-day rental.

Games not available on PSN are not listed, as there is no comparison.   What exactly is the "Channel" games section?  Is that going to house games that we've purchased previously? Or are otherwise available with a monthly rental option?  I'll be honest, I'm not exactly stoked to have to pay $15 to play Final Fantasy XIII again, when I own it for the PS3. I hope they would link PS Now to the SEN servers and let us play any digital downloads for free, as well as let us use the PS Now service to play games we have the disc for.   Lady came in with an Expedia reservation. I ask for her ID and credit card and she gives me the usual "They've already charged it." speech.  I remind her that we just need a valid card in case of incidental charges, and she asks if I'm going to run her card. Now, I don't normally run the cards, but 9 times out of 10 when they ask me that, they are giving me a bad one. So, I reiterate that the card just needs to be valid (basically, she just has to tell me it is, because we don't have a way of checking without charging).  So, she gets angry with me, and we finish the check-in, finally. I point out her room on the map, point out where she can park, direct her to the stairwell, and she leaves kind of hurried.  My manager, who was in the lobby to supervise the painters, asks me to go up to check on a room that had a problem reported, and as I am coming down the stairs, I end up meeting the family I just checked in.   Where's the room, Mom?   I don't know, that asshole didn't tell me.  She sees me up the stairs, looking at her.   Yeah, I called you an asshole!  I say nothing and finish walking down the stairs, and I see them starting to pass the stairs to go into the first floor hallway. I step back closer to the wall and point up the stairs,   Your room is up this way, ma'am.   It's upstairs? Don't you have an elevator?   No, I'm sorry.  She rushes past me, moving up the stairs with her 7 and 12 year old children.   Stupid asshole...   Ma'am, if you are not happy here, you can stay somewhere else...  I turned my back to her.   And that's great parenting, by the way.   and tttles. let's ban tttles, too.       My site is www.betonwhite.com  Ask me about the different card games, toys, or memorabilia, or just ask if I can get something else.  Or just ask about my day job, that's cool, too.                           The mattresses, the nightstand, the microwave, the couch. They left the TVs only because they were bolted down.  I called the police and they tried to force me into a telephone report, instead of sending an officer as I requested.  Edit with updates - We found which guest had done this, they were checked into the room right next to the original crime scene.  After coaxing the police to come in, they said that they wouldn't be able to process the room for fingerprints or other evidence. They gave their case numbers and went to the car to file the report.   Housekeeping calls me almost immediately to let me know that the neighboring room was having trouble with the lock, and that they had seen guests climbing in and out through the window. I open the door and find the room in worse shape than the first.  The light fixtures had been torn from the bathroom, the bed was simply gone, the television was on the ground and the dresser it had been bolted to was missing, the couch and recliners were gone, the second bed was wrecked, and naturally they took the mini fridge and microwave.  So I got the attention of the cop again, and now we have a crime scene tech going over the rooms.   This is a warning for customers and businesses. I apologize if this isn't the best location for this.  Apparently, scam artists have found a way to tap into 800 numbers while they are queuing for an operator. When the call is redirected, a foreign operator will apologize for the long hold time and offer a gift card or other compensation, and ask for a credit card for processing fees.  Obviously, you should never give out credit card information for unsolicited items, nor should you ever give credit card information in order to get money from a company.  If you fall prey to this scam, make sure you advise the company that there may be unknown recurring charges, and treat your credit/debit card as stolen.      And what is your stance on buying cards from out of state?    I work at a sunny motel, all but managing the breakfast area in addition to front desk, and recently Corporate made the unilateral decision to change all of the breakfast items to be "healthy".  They took out a lot of the sweet items, like danishes, and replaced them with better choices, like cinnamon raisin bread.  The problem was, our location had previously had the best breakfast we could manage for our class of hotel.  The changes meant that instead of hand-cooked scrambled eggs and sausage, we had to make precooked omelets with 'cheese'. Our breads were almost all replaced by the cinnamon bread. We had to stop giving out oatmeal in the instant packets, and had to cook oatmeal in a kettle daily.  Needless to say, our guests are not happy. The omelets taste horrible and take forever to heat up. The oatmeal takes an hour to be ready to eat. We have a much lower variety of food, thanks to getting rid of most of our breads.  I was planning on calling to the GM hotline to give them a piece of my mind...  When the breakfast director called me, asking how the new breakfast was working out. And I told her the truth. It stinks.  We at the hotel hate it, because of the time it takes to prepare. The guests hate it because they were used to a wider variety from us.  I told her that we need a waiver to allow us to go back to the sausage and eggs and to put out the instant oatmeal again.  I also told her that we need to be given discretion on extra items, not on the list.  Even though I was polite and conversational, she still meekly stated that she will talk to someone higher up to make the changes I suggested.    I think we're going to have our good breakfast back.      I already have the My Little Pony CCG on my website, and now I can start selling toys figures and other collectibles from the show, and other related properties on the site.  I'll start adding items one at a time, first update will be tonight.  I'll let you decide on what to add first.  The ever popular Blind Bag figures, Travel Mugs, or the Derpy Tin-Tastic pencil set.   Leave comments below, I take all sorts of suggestions.   Edit: Feel free to still give suggestions, but I am choosing to start with the Blind Bag figures. I have an order of 48 on the way, and you can start buying yours now.  http://www.betonwhite.com/category-s/1952.htm   Because, I'm at 233% light speed right now.                     And I'm not even mad about it.      I don't know if this will happen, but this would be the best end that I can think of. The show has been signed for another three years, and this will assume it ends at that timeframe.  Over the course of the show, Penny has shown herself to be more and more interested in nerd culture and science thanks to Leonard and the gang. During the next two seasons, this interest can blossom into a full passion, leading to the second year finale, where she asks Leonard and Sheldon to help her start a show to make science more interesting to normal children, like Bill Nye or Professor Proton.  The third, and final, season of the show has her working with everyone to make the show-within-a-show, with her as the host and relating scientific concepts in a friendly manner, scripted by Bernadette and Raj.  The penultimate episode ends with Penny getting a call from Dr. Gablehauser, offering her an honorary doctorate for her work. In the last episode, Howard acts all steamed for a bit before getting over the fact that Penny gets to be called Doctor before he does. This also serves as a way of finally revealing her last name, which was carefully guarded over the series run.               I am operating an online card shop and had a package of cards sent to me by my supplier at the hotel I work (the shop is relatively new).  Fedex lost my package, saying they dropped it off at someone's house, but they don't know where.  I anyone got a package for "Bet on White" during the day Wednesday, please contact me here so I can pick it up.   Much shorter than my last rants.  Indian student comes into the lobby, asks if we are hiring and who the manager is. I offered my Indian boss's pseudonym "Bill" and proceed to hand him an application, like I do for any other person looking for a job.   Do I have to fill out the application? I want a job under the table.  I look to him with a straight face, then to the line of customers behind him, and tell him that he does, and that it is illegal to be paid under the table for work. (I don't normally go that far, but I didn't want the guests to have the impression that we hire like that, even though my stupid boss does)  He persists for a minute, and ultimately leaves without filling out the application at all.  Guest walks up to the counter with a laugh, and I tell him the funniest part. If Bill wanted to hire him under the table after he filled out an application,  he could simply throw it away afterwards.          It's Spring Break here, in a coastal town, to give you the background on this reservation.  Semi - regular guest comes in at 8, 9 in the morning and asks for a room right away. I explain to him that the room is not ready yet, as we had a full house, but I get him reserved for the night so he doesn't have to worry.   He calls over and over again throughout the morning, asking for the room to be ready, parking in the back and bugging the different housekeepers, and generally being impatient. I tell him specifically not to bother housekeeping while he is waiting for his room.  2 o'clock rolls around, and he comes up to the desk again. I tell him that they haven't let me know yet, and that if I didn't know by the time my relief arrived at 3, I would find out for him.  He says okay, and walks off toward the back, then goes to one of the housekeepers and convinces him to let them into a room (that wasn't even the room assigned to him), saying that I told him it was okay.  I wouldn't even have known about it if the housekeeper hadn't thought to tell me after. I told them to leave. Period. We are busy enough that we will rerent the room, no problem.   Turns out the housekeepers know that he was dealing drugs from the room during previous stays.    Simple story, constantly repeated in any hotel setting.  Guest makes their reservation through ThatOneInternetSiteWeKnow.com (fake name if that is actually a domain out there) and gets the room to arrive on Friday. She calls me afterwards to make sure everything is good.  Friday comes around and she calls back, saying that she will be coming later than expected. Again, no big deal. I note that she will arrive late.  By the night audit, she still hadn't shown up, but I left the note, so the NA checked the room in.  Guest arrives at 3PM, Saturday, and asks for her reservation. The poor Indian student (I was off) at the desk is temporarily confused by the missing reservation, as it was no longer reserved. It was In House.  Guest calls TOISWK, who calls the desk and assists him in finding the room. Problem solved, right?   Wrong.   She comes in this morning,  Monday, to make sure she was credited for the stay Friday night, saying that the person who had trouble finding her room told her she'd be refunded.  So, I told her calmly, carefully, that we can not credit her back for any reason on a third-party booking, as we did not charge her. I also explained to her that despite any difficulty in finding the reservation, it was in the computer the whole night and that the room was not rerented in any way. But i told her that if she wishes to dispute the charges, she must do so with TOISWK.   She calls them, who calls me asking to refund, and I reiterate that we will not refund. The room was in house on Friday and was held for her to check in at any time. We also would have had to turn guests away, as it is Spring Break (not that you can tell from the weather).  Guest comes back to the lobby, TOISWK on the phone in her ear, and demands that I grant permission.  Now, at this point, I am stonewalling. I apologized for any mistakes or misinformation that may have been given, but I would not give in and remove the night's charge. I also refused to call the manager out from the more important things he was doing, as I know he doesn't like dealing with people.   After the guest leaves in a huff to call corporate to try and get a refund, I bring the information to the manager so he knows what is going on.  Lo and behold, he was *there* when the FD looked for the reservation and he most definitely did not offer any sort of credit or refund. He told me that if she came back, he would talk to her, but she simply left the building.   TL;dr Entitled self - important guest thinks she can dictate our refund policies.      My supplier is currently out of stock on Magica Madoka. As such, we are currently suspending backorders for single cards until reprint.  For those who have backordered cards (primarily Sayaka Miki) I will get in contact with you in short time to either amend or refund your orders.   I am sorry for any inconvenience in this matter, but rest assured that I will continue to provide the best service possible.       Hey, every pony, I've started a website devoted to selling single trading cards and collectible card games, and wanted you to know that shortly we will be adding some of the MLP card sleeves for sale. We'll be getting Trixie and DJ Pon3 to start.  I am also looking into a distributor for the Enterplay trading card series and the MLP CCG. I'll send more word when they are available.  Edit - I am getting a hoof full of 1 and 2 player starter boxes from my distributors. I'll set up pre orders for them shortly, so I can start shipping out as soon as they arrive.     Check out my [Facebook page](https://facebook.com/profile.php?id=1468747983347018) for up to date information.   www.betonwhite.com  I am currently focusing on Wei Schwarz, a card game growing in popularity here in the states and very big in Japan, and will be branching into Magic: the Gathering, Pokemon, Yu-gi-oh, and others in time.  Bitcoin payments are performed manually. You put in the order and email, and I will contact you with payment address and amount.               Don't stop.   Project Diva available singles include images up to E040 (Hatsune Miku "Pansy"), an additional 60 singles in the system without images.  In-stock, but not in the system are Sword Art Online and Fate/Zero singles, with Madoka arriving Monday.  I should be completed entering them in by the end of the month, but if there are any requests for cards *not* in the system, leave a message here and I will put it High Priority for addition.         From the Heart of the Cards Merchant Acceptance Letter,   Marketing Requirements   WeiB Schwarz is to be written with either a capital B or the german character equivalent. Note that "Weiss", while a popular transliteration, is incorrect, and should not have top billing. ("WeiB Schwarz / Weiss Schwarz" is okay, simply "Weiss Schwarz" is not). This is a high-priority request from Bushiroad themselves.   Lady comes into the office, kids in tow, her husband starts making a baby bottle on my counter, and she interrupts my interaction with the person in front of her.  I make her wait the half a minute it takes to tell my guest where to go, and get her information and she decides to take a room. So far, so good, though she told me that she was going to be the only adult, when I see her husband right there. The kids aren't old enough, so it doesn't change the rate anyway.  She pulls out an absolutely mangled ID. It's been cut into pieces and taped back together, with the ID number, name, and photo on three different pieces. Huge red flags in my head already, with her trying to rush me and then the questionable ID. And then I see my out.  The piece that has the ID number also has an expiration date of two weeks ago. I told her I couldn't rent to her with an invalid ID.  Edit: Part 2!  She comes back in, her children in tow, and brings along someone else with a valid ID. We start getting her signed in and I ask for payment, and get the response, "Oh! She didn't pay you yet?"  Nope. She didn't. I give them the price and they make a huge deal getting out the money, hand me the money, then change their mind about staying.  I didn't even have to be an asshole that time,  and they left.   My guess is that they were hoping I'd have forgotten about the fact that I didn't charge them for not taking the room.      	130

Just so I'm clear, I'm not asking for the most painful way to kill off your least favorite character. I'm asking what are good ways for a character to exit a show permanently.  Tag spoilers, of course.      I'm thinking of picking up Banks' Culture series. Do you recommend it as a must-read, or as an OK series, or not at all?   What books made you happy or euphoric (not amused or laughing) to have read them?  Some books that I liked are:  * The Stranger, by Camus * The Unbearable Lightness of Being, by Kundera  I'm not looking for any horror, tragedy, or romance books, though.   [May the Stu be with you.](https://web.archive.org/web/https://i.imgur.com/KAk3PDW.png)   What did you use for making the map?   What did you use to make the map?   There are some long-running manga that either:  * Drags the main story to run as long as possible * Starts new arcs that are not related to the beginning of the manga  What are manga that:  * Has a clear beginning, middle, and end * The end is concludes the story from the beginning * Doesn't drag   For anime that have a remake or a second adaptation, do you watch the original/first adaptation or the remake/second adaptation?  For example:  * Space Battleship Yamato * Sailor Moon   And why do you keep watching it?   To be a good cross-genre novel, does it need to portray each genre well separately, or does it result in a wholly different genre than the parent genres?   And if so, what is the best example that you know of?  	19
 Hayes is the first, and only, jockey to win a race after death. Sweet Kiss, the horse he was riding never got to race again, and she came to be known as Sweet Kiss of Death.    I found this, maybe for comparison. http://i.imgur.com/JHs8hcC.jpg  	2

Here's a nice tip to streamline the process *and* to reduce bug-probability (break, right).   switch (keyCode) {  case 38: // Up   break;  case 40: // Down   break;  case 37: // Left   break;  case 39: // Right   break;  default:   System.out.println("case " + e.getKeyCode() + ": // " + e.paramString() + "\nbreak;");  }  So, whenever you hit a key that's not yet digested, you'll get output like this in the console:      case 123: // KEY_PRESSED,keyCode=123,keyText=F12,keyChar=Undefined keyChar,keyLocation=KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD,rawCode=123,primaryLevelUnicode=0,scancode=88,extendedKeyCode=0x7b     break;     case 122: // KEY_PRESSED,keyCode=122,keyText=F11,keyChar=Undefined keyChar,keyLocation=KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD,rawCode=122,primaryLevelUnicode=0,scancode=87,extendedKeyCode=0x7a     break;  That's the simple way, if you don't want to carry around too much code baggage / want to do it from memory. If you want to get sophisticated, call this method instead:      final public static void keyCodeSwitchHelper(final KeyEvent e) {          final String paramString = e.paramString();         final String startText = "keyText=";         final int startTextPos = paramString.indexOf(startText);         final int endPos = paramString.indexOf(",", startTextPos + 1);         final String keyText;         if (startTextPos  0) {             keyText = paramString;         } else {             if (endPos  0) {                 keyText = paramString.substring(startTextPos + startText.length());             } else {                 keyText = paramString.substring(startTextPos + startText.length(), endPos);             }         }         System.out.println("case " + e.getKeyCode() + ": // " + keyText + "\nbreak;");     }  Example output:   case 112: // F1  break;  case 113: // F2  break;  case 69: // E  break;  case 10: // Enter  break;  case 18: // Alt  break;  case 115: // F4  break;  You could also use this concept to get the scancode, a keyboard language layout independent key value, but this will probably only work on Windows, and if so, then you should better use this method I posted on StackOverflow which uses reflection:  http://stackoverflow.com/a/26688875/3500521  ...

I can type code with the support that I also get in the editor, e.g. using Live Templates, which are context-sentitive, so they only work if you're in the respective code location (e.g. the shortcut for creating the main method does not work inside a method). This means that IntelliJ understands what's going on.  Yet the code is not syntax-highlighted. (I already did "invalidate caches and restart".) Only the keywords (class etc) and the String literals are highlighted like they should, the rest is just gray. Also:      class Test {         public static void main(String[] args) {             System.out.println("How do I run this?");         }     }  I can't find a way to execute the code. If I use "Run..." or "Debug...", the Run Configurations dialog pops up saying that it can't find the class Test.  Eclipse, for years, has had a Scratch file feature where you could enter code that would actually be evaluated/executed. I expected IntelliJ's Scratch files to be able to do the same.  **What are these good for at all?** I can't find any documentation that goes into details, it only says how to create or remove them.      EDIT:  The optimal solution, way better than my implementation, is zifyoip's solution      return v1 == null ? v2 == null : v1.equals(v2);  which is so short that it doesn't require a method at all.  ----  EDIT: In light of someone possibly getting mislead by this, please consider the critical comments. However, I had a specific use case for this when I created it, and so far I can't see a different/better solution or how this solution would be improper for this:  http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/2mmsic/whats_are_the_differences_between_a_set_and_an/cm5uts3?context=3  (Used while determining the index of a key in an ordered Map.)  ----  This generic utility method compares two elements using the .equals() method, even if one of the two elements is null. Call it like any other method, works with any pair of elements (though identical type is encouraged for logical reasons).      final public static T1, T2 boolean equalsEvenIfNull(final T1 v1, final T2 v2) {          return (v1 != null    v1.equals(v2)) || (v2 != null    v2.equals(v1)) || (v1 == null    v2 == null);     }  It happens often that you want to check for equality, and then you think "Wait, one of the two can be null, I better change a.equals(b) to b.equals(a)." But what do you do if both can be null in some cases? This method solves that problem.  I thought it would be *help*ful.  ...  Hm, I just realize that instead of making it generic, I could just use Object right away. So, why didn't I just edit the above? Because then you don't understand why I felt like making a post about this, given that it's so trivial. But now that I have spent so much effort, I also don't want to delete it.      final public static boolean equalsEvenIfNull(final Object v1, final Object v2) {          return (v1 != null    v1.equals(v2)) || (v2 != null    v2.equals(v1)) || (v1 == null    v2 == null);     }    I have been using IntelliJ for half a year now, and I can't remember *not* having had this problem sometimes - see screenshot:  http://i.imgur.com/sUYRUK9.png  Here's an example:      final MapInteger, Double ret = new HashMap(); // Could also be ArrayList.  This should work, and it does. In the source, IntelliJ sometimes just shows this line as erroneous, but I can still compile/run. If I go to that line and press ENTER at its end, creating a new line / triggering a text change, the error usually goes away. It also goes away by itself quickly when I edit somewhere else.  It's just annoying, that's all.  Did anyone ever observe this? Have it like three times a week at least.   So, in addition to this      if (idx = 0    idx  myList.size()) {  there could also be this      if (0 = idx  myList.size()) {  which is a much more concise way to express: "This is an intended-value-range condition." Conciseness/clarity *is* a relevant source code and hence language design aspect, right?  (Just a little drive-by post to get this out.)    German Heise article from yesterday:  [Mathematica rechnet falsch](http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Mathematica-rechnet-falsch-2435319.html)  PDF by the mathematicians who discovered and reported the error, from apparently tomorrow (November 2014):  [The Misfortunes of a Trio of Mathematicians Using Computer Algebra Systems. Can We Trust in Them?](http://www.ams.org/notices/201410/rnoti-p1249.pdf)    **EDIT:** SourceTree wants you to register after a month or so, and when this didn't work for me (Wrong password!?), I simply switched to a different client that is free for non-commercial use: http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/ It even has .class, workspace.xml and others ignored right out of the box. But you might need to use its Git shell to manually [prevent](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1967370/git-replacing-lf-with-crlf) CRLF conversion. (I did, because I wanted to use LF all the way.)  ----  **EDIT:** It *is* possible to create a BitBucket repository entirely with SourceTree, and to upload a project with files that so far had not been source controlled. But it's quite unnecessarily complicated.  http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2kd4uw/any_language_version_control_how_to_set_up/clkzr7f?context=5  ----  This is not *the definitive* guide. I just fought with these things for six goddamn hours, writing a tutorial for our team in the process, thought I'd share.  This might well work the same with GitHub, too. We chose BitBucket because it has free *private* repositories, even for (small) teams. It supports Mercurial and Git.  ----  When you go the BitBucket homepage while logged in, you'll see a big download link for SourceTree, which is not really wired to BitBucket, it just supports it well. It can not create a repository on BitBucket for you, so you have to do that on the site.  Btw., if you just created a BitBucket repository, the landing page will then offer a Clone in SourceTree button which will ultimately just show you an error message because there are no files in the repository yet. To get SourceTree up and running with your new repository (or with a "full" one), instead do this:  * Download, install, run http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ (Win/Mac)   * Click Clone/New, the prominent button at the left top. The quasi-window that opens has three tabs (Clone Repository, Add Working Copy, Create New Repository), Clone is the one we need and is already selected.  * Paste the URL of your BitBucket repository into the field Source Path / URL: at the top, e.g. "https://bitbucket.org/elpresidente/helloworld". My experiences today have not shown a difference regarding repository type (Mercurial or Git), except I think that the Staged files and Unstaged files sections are only one section with Mercurial.  * Create a folder for your IDE project on HD, e.g. helloworld, browse there, copy the whole address bar text, click into Destination Path:, the second field from the top, which will generate an autotext that you have to delete. (I fell for this one a few times.) Paste the clipboard into Destination Path:  * Leave the rest alone, click the Clone button at the bottom. If the BitBucket repository was brand new, then all that you have achieved is that SourceTree is now married to that repository. If there's already stuff online, it will now also be on your HD. (What do the cool kids call it these days, by the way? Could be a hard disk, could be a solid state disk, so what general term should be used?)  * Start IntelliJ IDEA. IN CASE ITS A NEW PROJECT: Create a new IntelliJ project by clicking New Project in IntelliJ. Java will be selected in the dialog, so click Next twice. No idea what the templates are good for, but as far as I know IntelliJ so far, they are good stuff. The dialog now shows two lines of text: The project name and its location. Replace the location text with your clipboard content. This also sets the project name field. You can change the project name field if you want, or you can rename the project later in the IDE. IN CASE ITS AN EXISTING PROJECT: Select Open Project. Paste your clipboard content into the file browsers address bar, the browser should then show the appropriate tree. Click OK.  * Assuming that it's a new IntelliJ project: Switch back to SourceTree. In the second column from the left, select Working Copy under File Status.  * There should be two sections: At the top is the empty Staged files section. At the bottom is the crowded Unstaged files section. You should mirror all files that are listed there (from our new IntelliJ project) with the source control system, *except the file workspace.xml*, so click on the ... which is really a button. In the menu, select Ignore file, select Ignore exact filename(s), select all repositories in the dropdown box (so youll never have to do this again), click OK. Btw, the menu entry Remove file actually deletes the file from HD (after asking you), just FYI.  * Check the cumulative box of the Unstaged files to turn them into Staged files.  * Now its time for the first commit. Click in the text field at the bottom or use the toolbar button Commit, enter a description (e.g. 1st). There are options in the dropdown box to the right, e.g. Create Pull Request which I think would notify the other guys, but I dont know. Click the Commit button at the right bottom. This committed the changes *to the local version of the repository*. In case you get an error message here: You might have to configure your identity first via the repository config toolbar button on the far right.  * To actually get your stuff online now, click the Push button in the toolbar. You probably have to activate the checkbox next to master in the window that appeared. Click OK, and thats it.  * If you change something in the code and save the file, SourceTree will show that there are changes. You'll have to do the checkbox thing again as described above, etc.  * BitBucket has a version history of the files, so you can compare the various versions. To actually return to an older version via SourceTree, do this: In the second column to the left, which shows File Status (Selected by default.), Branches, Tags, Remotes, click Branches and choose an entry (e.g. default). This will show the online history in SourceTree. Select any history entry you want, its only relevant for being able to choose a file in the list at the bottom. Right-click the file in question, select Log Selected. In the new window, right-click the file version you want to be current and select Reset to Commit. Confirm the Are you sure? dialog. Your local file should now have changed accordingly, which IntelliJ should immediately reflect in the editor, if its open. In SourceTree, the history list should have the new **bold** entry Uncommitted changes, so select Working Copy under File Status in the second column and continue with what I wrote earlier about uploading stuff, or keep working locally for the time being, until you think that stuff online should change.     **"Applications" are closed. (We've got a few guys now.)**  ----  I think this is not the right subreddit to ask this, but I don't know of a better one at the moment. I already [commented](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2k6eej/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/clj67pi) in r/gamedev's random discussion thread. /r/gameDevClassifieds is hardly appropriate.  It's 9 AM on a Saturday in Germany, and I'm in the mood to do some team programming in Java. Nothing serious, there should be no obligations either way. Kind of like a forum chat experience - something you do just for fun and stop when you wanna do something else. Except of course with more energy and dedication because that's what programming requires. Could be game related, but could also just be library code, or an application.  Java is my day job, so I'm far from being a beginner (but wouldn't call myself a pro). I haven't published anything privately yet. I'm very active (on and off, though) in the Java subreddits and this one. I don't mind if the other person is not very proficient as long as the outcome is two people programming on one project, not one learning and the other tutoring or something. I'm active from 4 AM to 18 PM [Zulu Time](http://www.zulutime.net/) on weekends, or 16-18 PM during the week.   The **[screenshot](http://imgur.com/G6FXU4S)** shows the rotation center under the mouse pointer. The smaller circle shows the rotation angle: It's at about 180.  Obviously, the position of the rotation center affects the effective position of the object even though its internal coordinates stay the same. But the user must be able to drag the rotation center *without* the object moving in a logically correct but usability-wise completely insane way: The object must stand still.  For that, I would need to translate the left-top corner coordinate of the object (which is at the right bottom in the screenshot) as the rotation center is dragged.  Could you please give me a tip (that does not involve matrices because they are completely cryptic to me)? I already toyed around with multiplying the drag-delta with the sin/-cos of the angle\*Tau in various combinations, even multiplied the angle (A value from 0 to 1 for convenience.) with it in a way that the closer to 0 the angle is, the less this adjustment takes place. I can't find the right way.  EDIT:  Found a few values through experimenting. Still pondering, though.      for angle 0 (0)     x stays the same (so, x changes to x + rotXDelta - rotXDelta)     y stays the same (so, y changes to y + rotYDelta - rotYDelta)      for angle 0.25 (90)     x changes to x + rotXDelta - rotYDelta     y changes to y + rotYDelta + rotXDelta      for angle 0.5 (180)     x changes to x + rotXDelta * 2 (so, x changes to x + rotXDelta + rotXDelta)     y changes to y + rotYDelta * 2 (so, y changes to y + rotYDelta + rotYDelta)      for angle 0.75 (270)     x changes to x + rotXDelta + rotYDelta     y changes to y + rotYDelta - rotXDelta       (rotXDelta and rotYDelta are the relative movement of the rotation center.)  I think I see now ...  The trick is to achieve for 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 the following:      ... - rotXDelta     ... - rotYDelta      ... - rotYDelta     ... + rotXDelta      ... + rotXDelta     ... + rotYDelta      ... + rotYDelta     ... - rotXDelta   Or rather:      ... + rotXDelta*-1 + rotYDelta*0     ... + rotYDelta*-1 + rotXDelta*0      ... + rotXDelta*0 + rotYDelta*-1     ... + rotYDelta*0 + rotXDelta*1      ... + rotXDelta*1 + rotYDelta*0     ... + rotYDelta*1 + rotXDelta*0      ... + rotXDelta*0 + rotYDelta*1     ... + rotYDelta*0 + rotXDelta*-1  Sounds like a job for Mister (co)sinus.  ----  Ok, found the working Java code. But I think posting this helped me find the solution.      final double rotCos = -Math.cos(rotAngle * MathUtils.Tau);     final double rotSin = Math.sin(rotAngle * MathUtils.Tau);     x += rotXDelta + rotXDelta * rotCos + rotYDelta * -rotSin;     y += rotYDelta + rotYDelta * rotCos + rotXDelta * rotSin;  The object now visually stays in the same place when I drag the rotation center, no matter what the rotation angle is.  Thanks for trying to help / reading.   Voice on the phone says: "Press 1 for tech support. Press 2 for ..." - Show this on the display right away! Use "modem"-sounds to transmit info.  This could be a life saver in urgent cases, and certainly improves usability *a lot* since you don't have to remember anything and are also under much less time pressure.  It seems like a no-brainer to implement this, now that phones usually have displays. A proper standard should be developed, so that even info like "2m 14s estimated waiting time left" could be shown *and count down* (so the phone would have to *understand* the info instead of just throwing text and standard-icons onto the screen).  Since the info to be transmitted is so little, this should be doable even in the face of voice-optimizied audio compression.  Had this idea a few years back. I don't care what happens to it, so take it or leave it. Just thought I'd put it out there.  This could become a billion dollar thing!   The more pairs you have, the easier the problem arises. For identical pairs, you don't want to wear an old sock with a new one. For others, you might have very similar patterns that you only later realize were different (when it's too late).  As a joke, but also with some use factor, I think it would be a good product idea to have socks with an identical [QR-code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code) on both socks that contains a [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) (Globally unique ID.) whose value the sock-user can compare. There could also be an app that explicitly allows to scan both and compares if they are identical. Might also have additional features like a personal database of socks that have no partner - it might eventually show up, identified by the UUID.  It's of course a problem to produce each pair with an individual code, but I bet that this isn't a hard problem any more today.  Had this idea this morning. I don't care what happens to it, so take it or leave it. Just thought I'd put it out there.   Observing over time that this subreddit does not deserve me, I retract my informative post text. Thy will be done, that's how I roll. Of course, people, being insane as they are, object to *that*, too.   **PREFACE**  The concepts in this text might be interesting especially to beginner gamedevs or people who [prefer to] work alone. They might have an enabling/motivating "I can do that!" experience because of the huge potential and ease of implementation. The language I work with (Java) is not important to the concepts, and very little of the text is about implementation, anyway.  If you aim to create Steam-level games, or (sadly) have some kind of subconscious clipper that makes you assume that only stuff that can sell in the PlayStation store is even worth thinking about, then save time and read no further. But if you have a text-adventure-ish mind-openness, you might find some great food for thought. Be warned, it's a lot of text (Sorry. But I'm writing this *for you*, I'd rather continue coming up with new shit, typing in my FreeMind document.), and you'll walk away *not knowing* what it really is if you haven't at least skimmed the whole thing.  I have been pondering concepts closely related to what the headline says for *months* in a row now, so I find the currently emerging concept all this seems to converge in worthy of sharing / discussing.  Key aspects that emerged as attractors during my ponderings of this year:  * Should be very easy to implement, so that as little as possible stands between my story-/game-idea musings and a working game.  * Should mainly build on the fantasy of the player, because I wouldn't be able to pull off (nor be willing to "waste" too much time on) adequate graphics. Those would also "bake" too much into place (e.g. the interface) - I am trying to stay flexible because I have been changing course *a lot*.  * Should allow complex object interactions with many different kinds of objects.  * Should allow spatial gameplay (e.g. to move around stealthily, to hide, to stay out of view), because I kept having a strong Deus Ex 1 and "escape from pursuers" vibe and like the idea of breaking into people's homes for loot.  I believe I have found a great answer to these demands:  ----  **OBJECT SYSTEM**  All my recent prototypes converged into one underlying system that I have hence put into a library: A container based object system (CBOS). At its core, it's just an object class that has a container and an inventory list, which allows arbitrarily complex object trees: a ring in a box in a drawer in a desk in a room in a sector (e.g. "apartment" in a multi-apartment house) on a floor in a house on a plot of land (e.g. police hq having main building and generator building) etc.. Building such a tree is easy: You create the desk instance, the room instance, then call "setContainer(room)" on the desk. (If there's an object that's contained by the desk, it will, too, now be (indirectly) in the room. Perfectly straightforward.) Btw., I used soft references (Object IDs, a simple long counter.) so that during loading a savegame non-existing objects are not a problem. For the same reason, I put various HashMaps into the object so that I don't have to save/load individual variables but can just bulk it all. Once you have this, you can do an awesome amount of things, so I heartily recommend this concept.  **WHAT CAN EASILY BE DONE WITH IT**  I made console-based prototypes with this where you could select from a list of local objects (e.g. bathroom door), which lets the door add its interactions to the mainloop's list of default actions. You could open and close doors, or water valves, to any degree you wanted, the outlet would generate water substance objects that are collated to one substance object (if their respective container was the same, I mean) by a special call in the main loop. The smell of dampness would spread through the apartment, relative to the openness of doors. (In a different prototype,) The player was a complex object tree of body parts. To eat something, you would put an object into your mouth - think about this. "Duh." right? Except all games would have an "eat" verb that is *fake*, a make-believe facade for the players that they might not recognize as such, just as a reader might not recognize bad typography, but the impact on the brain / experience happens anyway, so maybe it's a good idea to try to not just make things *seem* real but to kinda *make them real*.  Here's one of these CBOS-prototypes:  download (0.29 MB, needs Java 8, console game, so start it with `java.exe -jar cbosdemo.jar`): http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=00965712612844994833  **screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/Oc219oh.png**  ----  **THE CONCEPT THIS POST IS ABOUT**  ----  **SPATIALITY**  For spatiality, I had pondered all angles (abstract and tangible), but I ultimately settled for tiles. With a few radical twists, though:  1) I don't waste time on creating tile graphics or a tile graphics engine (e.g. defining which image rectangle is what object), instead I use *text-based tiles*. The screen background is white. Nothing-tiles (e.g. outside building on a floor above ground) are black, wall-tiles are dark gray, door tiles dark desaturated brown. The colors are strictly symbolic. Object tiles that you can enter (bed, toilet, shower stall) are bright gray and simply have a text written in them, saying what the tiles are (e.g. "bed"). Same for tiles you can't enter (office desk, washbasin), except the gray is darker. I tried to only have texts, but that was just confusing. This, however, is a golden middleground. You can even add details like "damaged" in a second line, even a bargraph that expresses the amount of damage - destructible walls or at least doors. The player ("YOU") would have the same bright gray as "enterable" object tiles, for the association. Or the player could have a couple of horizontal bar graphs in that color, expressing the current state of their most important stats.  **Photoshop mockups: http://imgur.com/a/0V1pm**  2) The tiles do not represent a precise size: They are only for the player's coarse spatial association. A bed is as big as a toilet or the player. Big bonus: You don't have to ponder the problem of multi-tile objects. I figure they measure from 0.5 to 3 meters, which sounds worse than it is. I invested a lot of thought in all this and wrote many kilobytes of notes, arriving at a system that would work as a whole. **Just look at the images and remember that you set out to play a *text adventure*.** But at the same time, you can use this spatiality to even implement the throwing or shooting of objects. This can even happen in the form of realtime action instead of turn-based gameplay.  Realize that you are looking at squiggly lines, fly droppings, circles - also known as "text". "You get used to it, though. Your brain does the translating. I don't even see the code. All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead." *The same would happen for the text tile system!* Except that the meanings that it can transport are very hard to transport via text, and/or it would take a lot of text / effort on the side of the player.  So, difference to classical text adventure: You don't say "go north" to visit the next location. Nor are locations here just one place were there's a desk, a bed, and two doors. If you are in a small bathroom, you see a small bathroom; if you're in a hangar, it will take you time to get from one end to the next, so the game could even feature view distance, especially for potential foes (guards etc.), and you can also have the traditional rotating camera you have to avoid. But how is this still a text adventure? Well, read on.  **INTERFACE / OBJECT INTERACTION**  The example uses 128x128 pixels per tile. The intention is to have the tile "map" occupy the whole screen. However! There should be a *very slight* movie letterbox effect: A thin black bar at the top and bottom, maybe separated with a thin line from the step-scrolling map. At the top, you have the "breadcrumbs" of the object tree, and the game clock. At the bottom, you have the list of current realtime interaction controls. More about that *key stuff* later.  You press the right mouse button to pause the game (if it's the realtime variant) and to get a mouse pointer, which is otherwise hidden, cause it's useless while you WASD around in the world. When you hover over a map tile with the mouse pointer, a description (If any.) is shown at the opposite side of the screen, e.g. "The office desk is old and sturdy, made from massive oak wood.", but what's also shown is a list of contained objects, e.g. "desktop", "left drawer", "right drawer". These are just CBOS-objects whose container is the desk. They might have "joint" information like "mounted" (drawer) or "isPartOf" (desktop), not shown to the player but relevant to potential interactions you might come up with later. The object list and description change/vanish depending on where you hover. When you click the right mouse button again, you're back in the (realtime) game. But if you click the left mouse button, the hover-effect is frozen, so you can now move the mouse to the object list (List and description would now be at a fixed position, e.g. always the left top of the screen). When you hover over objects, a second description text and object list is shown next to the first one, showing e.g. the "desktop" description and the objects placed there. Again you'd have to left-click to freeze the hovering. The first description/text would vanish, the second would be moved into its place. So, you could repeat this concept arbitrarily deep.  The actual object interaction, however, does not take place via mouse. The mouse only serves to navigate the object tree, it represents a mental act the player avatar would execute: It's equivalent to the "examine" command in text adventures. To actually flush the toilet, gradually open/close the door or a water valve, you use keyboard keys. Which ones? The ones that are shown at the bottom of the screen in the reserved black letterbox-layout bar. They are already shown while you hover with the mouse, so you immediately see what objects you can interact with, something the player will probably appreciate a lot. So, in addition to the standard keys (WASD and whatever else there will be), you get object-relative interaction keys. Optionally, the standard keys could be displayed at the bottom, too, but only while in the game, not in hover mode. Tutorial feature half solved.  Breadcrumbs: What selecting an object with the left mouse button did was not just to freeze the hover-effect but also to "focus" the avatar attention on it (See realtime interaction keys.), so it's a good interface metaphor. The object hierarchy path to the object will be added to the breadcrumbs at the top of the screen:  New York  Hell's Kitchen  'Ton Hotel  Paul's apartment  [Livingroom]  compartment behind painting  keypad  The rectangular brackets surround the location the player is in. (There might be some redundancy involved. The 3D array for the tiles is a building, hence plot of land, city etc. is practically defined for each tile, but to express which tile is in which "sector" or "room", a parallel CBOS tree would be required.) The kicker is that while in mouse mode, you can also hover over the individual breadcrumb elements, getting the description and, if not "left" of your own location, also contained objects. Same rules apply: Left clicking focuses on the object. So, you can easily browse the tree backwards, e.g. from "ring in box in drawer in desk in room" straight back to the room, or to the desk.  Game clock: If you hover over the date and time shown at the right top, you see a log of story steps you have already taken, incl. the time when this happend. From time to time, this list might be interrupted by short synopses. At the bottom, there would be a summary of the story opener text. At the top, you see the a summary of the current story state (e.g. "The League of Overzealous Medical Scientists (LOMS) has found out about you. You figure that it would be better to avoid being captured by them.").  Player avatar inventory: The avatar could itself be a complex object system, so that you could e.g. put an object into your mouth, or affix a backback to your back. In any case, the containers you have (Or just the one inventory.) could simultaneously be weight- and volume-based. The objects would be available via the mouse hover system (and maybe also a shortcut mechanic), so to give some kind of realism to them, a simple weight and volume (In liters.) value could go a long way. Can't fit the keyboard into a jeans pocket. Can't hold object x in hand because player strength is still too low. Capacity and usage could be shown by bargraphs or a percentage, which would be realistic.  **STEALTH**  Well, if you want to make it simple yet still interesting, just add a "hide" interaction for the photocopier, the bed, etc., plus some variables depending on the object, e.g. when hidden under table, you're less visible *the closer* the guard is because of the vertical angle, but you're safer "behind" the photocopier the further away the guard is. Otherwise, use a cone of vision and a visual obstruction simulation based on the tiles.  **NPCs**  Yeah. Still thinking about that one. But [A\*](http://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html), some intentions, some preferences as to the situation ("This door should not be open!") etc., are easy to do, nothing revolutionary.  **REALTIME ACTION**  Such a game would of course be ideal for a turn-based approach, but I personally like the realtime approach better, because you really experience how you e.g. are opening or closing a door by holding down your keys. Lockpicking would also be much more impacting if it were a realtime task. And what about holding down a key to pee? If you just program a pee action that takes 20 seconds (plus bladder fullness \* constant), how do you deal with a car outside that exploded 5 seconds into the action?  Since every CBOS object would get a simulate() call on every game step, some of which would actually do something (e.g. toilet tank refilling), a 30 or 60 FramesPerSecond gameloop is out of the question. Ok, you could just do a realtime thread with an actual move-from-tile-to-tile scroll effect plus a simulation thread, the latter only being called e.g. twice a second, but the goal was "as crappy as possible for quick implementation, while also as complex/enabling as possible". I think that a choice of 200 ms to 1000 ms per gamestep is reasonable. I personally opt rather for 200 so that possible bar graph changes while the player performs a realtime action are still reasonably animated. Also, there might be highly interactive actions like lockpicking that require a more fluent interface. Finally, there's moving/running: The higher the resolution, the more believable various speeds can be communicated, instead of having to resort to "dithering", multiple field moves etc.  ----  **SUMMARY**  So, what is this? A very easy to implement template for text adventures with spatiality, where the concreteness of the tile-map does not cripple the fantasy of the player and is soon "read" like words in a text. Complex object interactions are possible, complex object trees (Why not even have a simulate call to the avatar's organ objects? Or select "bladder" object, "open valve" xD) What's possible is almost entirely up to the game designer. Invent to your heart's content.   http://atheist-experience.com/archive/?y=2014  Only the other links remain, but the video links are gone. No info on the page or frontpage.  Screenshot in case our realities differ: http://i.imgur.com/E9rTktS.png      A tough nut to crack. But impossible?  The kind of text-adventure I have in mind is closer to a MultiUserDungeon than to InteractiveFiction (but will be single player): There will be lots of simulation, and the world (incl. the NPC and the player avatar) will be a container-based hierarchy, so you can find a ring in a box in a drawer in a desk in a room in an apartment in a floor in a house etc., and every object in the world will get a simulation call per gamestep (Gamestep size is 1 second, time progresses only if the player does something.)  I'm basically trying to implement "Thief"- or "Deus Ex 1"-like gameplay but via the open-to-your-fantasy approach that the abstract (read: non-spatial) world structure and description offers. Not 3D and not 2D but text - this also allows much deeper simulation. And many things that DX1 offers, I can make happen.  But even though I have been thinking about the spatial-gameplay-problem for quite a few hours (not just now but also months back), I can not find the solution for scenarios like these:  * Distance measuring e.g. for aiming/shooting or view checks: How could the player be at one end of a corridor, and a guard enters the corridor at the other end, too far to be dangerous, but the player needs to do something about it? In a room-based approach, the guard and the player would be in the same room, period. I thought about maybe secretly separating larger rooms into several, but 1) the inconsistencies that would inevitably occur (This room 2 sections, that room 5, and the section size is even different.) plus the fact that I would have to design *a lot* more (though some aiding procedures might nullify this concern) speak against this. Another candidate: To denote locations of objects by units of length, but this would open a whole can of worms.  * How could the player hide *behind* a person in a room? Normally in a text adventure, you either see what's "here", or you don't. There's no viewing direction, and no relative position (not to my knowledge).  * How could the player secretly move past a (maybe constantly turning) camera, maybe behind obstructions like a desk? Of course, there could be a specific "hide behind obstruction" feature for candidate objects, but the term "behind" is a problem here, what if the object is next to a wall and any "behind" is still in view? And what if the camera has moved on and so could you - is the next spot or the path to it clear?  I already solved ladders and the stacking of boxes, but these other quite essential things just don't want to fit the format.  Is there really no way?  Different view, same topic:  In DX1, at the end of the training, there's a demo scenario in a large hall that is split along its long axis by a river-like pool. On your river bank, a battle robot patrols. You have to get to the far end of the hall and to the other side of the river. This can be solved relatively easily because the location and the movement of the robot are almost 1-dimensional, so indeed units of length could be used to make this happen. But this is an exceptional situation. Or are there specific (but different) solutions like this possible for considerably different 3D stealth-action game like situations?   ~~[Deus Ex 1 script etc.7z](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=78244512708258032480) 2 MB~~  [Deus Ex 1 script etc.7z](http://s000.tinyupload.com/index.php?file_id=02218015918116915574) 3 MB - Same files, plus the Gamasutra Postmortem of DX1.

It's a very simple turn-based hack slash to demonstrate the game mechanic.  Screenshots: http://imgur.com/a/Uc1F4  Java console game: http://speedy.sh/EbmY4/SSBHNS-2014-08-24.jar (13.8 KB.

(Depending on the foe, its current life points, and the progress-dependent difficulty.) for about a second, then the player is asked to enter a number, which in the example case would have to be -1. The closer to the correct value, the greater the success when attacking or defending.  This can even express the nature and kind of foe, how high or low the foe's health is, and even if the player is currently irritated: In the demo, if you suffer a critical hit (A hit that takes more than 1/4 of your current health.), you are dizzy for a whole round, and then the cryptic string is not shown as consecutive characters, instead it is randomly spread over several lines.  Since I had to playtest this thing a lot today for balancing, I can say that it is an interesting and working approach, that it is somewhat fun, and that e.g. the dizzy-effect does just what you'd expect it to.

[author] I also posted in GIMP subreddit, but probably /r/gamedev is a good idea too. Thanks for suggestion.  That was 1 day ago, and you guys are *still* missing out. So here it is.   I'm making a text adventure game and am currently working on a television object. There will be a few channels. Just because it's so easy, I thought to put in a Bible channel where random excerpts are read to the audience. Same for Quran, was equally easy.  I would like to add a skeptic/atheist channel, too, but couldn't find a nice long text as material for this.  Do you guys have any suggestions?  (While we're at it: Any suggestions for other channels?)   http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2dior8/its_the_rgamedev_daily_random_discussion_thread/cjpwzy6?context=5            You play an NPC in someone's video game. You observe that the player is in a fight and loses. The guy in front of the screen, about whom you don't know at all, loads a savegame, so everything is reset to an earlier situation.  For some reason, you become aware of this.  (The cause for reload needn't be the player losing in a fight, but it should be something that is understandable, or it would be weird / bad for this game if there's suddenly a reset for no apparent reason.)  This could lead to all kinds of game ideas. For example:  ----  A "new game +" based game, conceptually like [Rogue Legacy](http://store.steampowered.com/app/241600/), where you keep your NPC stats while the whole world around you resets every time the player loses. This could e.g. be used in the following way: You lose accumulated values in between new levels, but each full level you achieve stays with you. Levels could be individual per stat, so you'd have decimal values that slowly rise, and once the next whole number is reached, that number stays. Items could get lost on every reset, if you can adapt the means by which you obtain items depending on what your stats are like, e.g. if you're strong, go to a better (but more dangerous) source.  But the game reset could also have *advantages* of some sort for you. One of which could be that everybody loses their stats while you stay strong and can hence reign supreme. Because of this (or another such reason), it could be in your interest to *help* the player survive longer, but on other occasions you might be interested that the game gets reset.  ----  Alternatively:  The fact that you become aware of this gives you profound insight. Is reality only a simulation, or what's going on here? This could lead to all kinds of story/gameplay, in the most extreme even to you somehow being able to gather/design/assemble parts for / via a 3D printer, so that you could become an entity in the *real* world there the player also exist. In the less extreme variant you'd explore the digital reality in the computer beyond the game. Even less extreme, you'd roam freely in the game, gathering more and more knowledge, hence being able to become the ruler of that world, or even obtain god-like powers.  Btw., the way in which you become aware of the situation could be that you increasingly (= less transparently) see your locations in previous runs on the screen, kinda like some racing games show your previous laps by drawing your car in transparent several times simultaneously in different places.  Maybe the closer you get to such a location, the more visible it becomes, so the first few runs would be about you having to kinda "increase the glow" until it reaches a certain level, and then some magic badaboom screen effect takes place and you are henceforth freed from this cycle of resetting things, so you can move around freely even though there was a reset, or you henceforth keep your stats, or whatever.  ----  This idea was inspired by the loosely related post "[Not a well thought out game idea: Henchman](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedesign/comments/2cjoeb/not_a_well_thought_out_game_idea_henchman/)" in /r/gamedesign.   To get a feel for how this should go, think of the situation in the zoo where Harry accidentally makes the glass of the boa constrictor cage disappear.  http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone CTRL+f "zoo"  The movie/story would just depict part of HP's young life without a distinct story arc behind it, the focus would instead be on what the title says: Situations, and human emotions (kind of the opposite of Hollywoods usual way of dealing with a superhero discovering their powers, which usually rather is like "Umm, ok. What's for breakfast?").  PS - If you find the title to be a little long: I copied it from my old post to /r/OneLineMoviePitch :]   Repost of a [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingPrompts/comments/26a8eg/create_a_text_adventure_with_simulation/) I made 2 months ago in /r/ProgrammingPrompts ("1,535 readers") - please also check the comments section there for more inspiring ideas/thoughts.  ----  ----  Interactive text-based stories, where the magic happens in the head - not new. But I haven't seen one with a simulated world in the background yet.  This idea is for beginners and pros alike - just pick your level of complexity.  ----  Example: "You are in a kitchen. You see a stove, a fridge, a ceiling lamp, a switch, and a sink. There is an open door to the north, a closed window to the west."  The objects in the room have properties, the room itself has an environmental situation (e.g. air pressure, smells, temperature), the player also has properties (e.g. when the light is low or the player is blind-folded, the data retrieved via the eyes is limited/removed, so the text is changed accordingly, all by procedure instead of manually typed!).  On every game turn, simulate(); is called on all existing objects in the game world. So, when you return to room X, the fruits in the bowl on the table might have become a little less fresh.  ----  Some ideas:  * The game could either be turn-based, like the classic ones, or it could be in real-time in 1-second-steps, and as soon as the player starts typing, the game is paused until the input line is empty again. Alternatively, the whole input could happen via dropdown-menus: The moment a menu is opened, the game is paused. I attempted this a little, works very well - there was an "exits" menu, a "you" menu, and an "objects" menu.  * Simple "sound rendering": Sounds could be muffled or too silent to identify. One sound could be "drowned out" by another one, so that you e.g. have to turn off a washing machine to be able to hear/identify the person imprisoned behind the secret wall. One way to do this, for example, could be to describe the sounds a bit to the machine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_frequency is an interesting resource for this. Based on it, one could describe with a boolean or double the significancy and volume of 4 or 5 frequency sections of the sound in question. This would allow to calculate how much a sound might be overridden by another one, to determine if it should be described to the player clearly, in a very coarse way that could be interpreted freely, or if the sound isn't described at all.  * Simple "light rendering" - or should I call it "em radiation rendering"? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum Nuclear terrorism, here we come! (Hi FBI.)  * Player and other beings could have rather complex and simulated stats, e.g. body temperature, hunger, weight, height, stance (Can you see the police car outside through the window while being bound on the floor?)  * Talking about police: NPCs could gather information (with some Garbage Collection to prevent data overkill), so if you drive your van to the city park and abduct someone, the police might be able to browse the tree of available options/objects to pick up an informational trace and ultimately get to you. I know, totally insane, but I believe it's not impossible. On the other hand, during your next game, you might play a cop yourself! An open self-experience system?  * Once you have a working system with rooms and some objects, start writing a world generator so that you have fun exploring your simulation while you're writing it. Tests will probably be pretty inspiring for the overall project.  ----  Suggestions:  * After a few attempts, I have figured out that the object model should use soft links, meaning that the objects should refer to each other via an ID number (e.g. 64 bit long), because ultimately you will face the beast that saving/loading is, and loading while related objects don't exist yet is a pain. Better just use soft links and look everything up in a manager class that also does the loading/saving.  * Every object (hence the master class from which all object classes inherit) should have an inventory. You could add flags and checks for/against the player/simulation using it, but it's good if it exists. E.g. put an object into your mouth. Or define buildings by "house contains floors which contain apartments which contain rooms" etc.  * Additionally, each object might have a variable list (in Java, it would probably be a HashMapString, Object), because that's again much easier to save/load than creating extra variables in each object and then having to deal with those.  * If you want to make a toilet (or whatever other kind of world object), my attempts have shown that it's best to create a separate class for every kind of object instead of trying to build the omni-object.  * Go crazy! E.g. in my realtime-attempt (Java) where input happened via dropdown menu, I made a toilet where you can lift/lower the lid and the seat (each pushing each other), you can flush, and you can abort the flushing which means that the next flush works right away but is shorter (the tank refills in realtime, the rest is logical - See the beauty of simulation versus just writing the story?). It's easy and fun to write world-objects like these, and they are easy to extend: Say, the toilet does not refill if the incoming water pipe is turned off. Of course you still have a free flush. Alternatively, you might be imprisoned and might need water. Hard choices have to be made, especially if you also simulate bowel movements.  * Again, go crazy: It's a *text adventure* system! Well, you can't just make up *anything*, because you have to give it some reality via simulation, but otherwise: Sky's the limit! Processing time is not an issue. Why shouldn't a turn take a few seconds? Do all the things you wished were in your favorite 3D action adventure game, but they didn't put it in because of development constraints, marketing, or simply because everything at once can't be done on today's PCs. But I double-dare you: DON'T fuck up the FoV!   I've read r/atheism's [guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/wiki/guidelines), the [rules of reddit](http://www.reddit.com/rules), and the [reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) before making this post. Please don't let this honest effort to ensure a proper post go to waste by dismissing this at trolling, please allow others to find this.  ----  I believe to be God, and that this is the beginning of the apocalypse, but I am not sure. Our interactions should leave you with a change in your personal life's flow (events, feelings, thoughts, the need to cough, deep-penetration-associations, ...) that you can detect/decipher in the next weeks, *starting* today (but today you'd really need a microscope). So, why not wait before posting? Because I want to get this show on the road already. The faster it happens, the earlier the dying of about 153,000 humans per day (worldwide) ends.  Ask me anything, e.g. about the creation of the world (which I completed about 13 years ago :) or how I plan to govern the future of mankind. These interactions should trigger the effects, should leave me with valuable data regarding the state of things, and should definitely accelerate things a wee bit.   In my near 2 years of Java, I have often come across this problem, so overall I can say that it took me *days* to find this solution (which ultimately I found [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9180408/how-to-use-jscrollpane-within-the-center-of-a-borderlayout)). I always evaded the problem with a different approach so far.  An example:  I have a JLabel with multi-line text (made possible by wrapping it in HTML/BODY tags). I added that to a JScrollPane. I added the pane to a JPanel in BorderLayout.CENTER.  This was unsatisfactory, the available space was not used. Only when the content grew large enough, the pane used all space and showed the scrollbar. Adding the pane to NORTH instead seemed to work - but once the content was large enough, the NORTH section would just start to eat up the rest of the vertical space (e.g. the SOUTH part would be squished).  The solution is simple (once you know it):  I put the JLabel into a new JPanel whose layout is FlowLayout (alignment left), then made the JScrollPane with the JPanel instead of with the JLabel. Done. Good night.  This took way too long.   Most games today have broken volume sliders: Between full volume and, say, 60%, you hear almost no difference. The programmers just blindly applied the 0to1 factor and moved on. Please don't make the same mistake when it's 1) so obvious and 2) so easy to fix.  Short and to the point volume slider problem info:  http://www.dr-lex.be/info-stuff/volumecontrols.html  Some formula suggestion for the problem:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1165026/what-algorithms-could-i-use-for-audio-volume-level  ----  Let's say you have walk sounds for grass, stone, gravel. Instead of doing a hard switch between them, you could play two simultaneously with different volumes resulting, as a sum, in full volume (and please regard the above topic, it applies here, too). If your map even has mixed ground or soft transitions, that would fit perfectly.  In a Thief-like game, you could mix the various footstep sounds according to walk speed.  But that's only a very primitive way to benefit from this cheap "additive synthesis" approach.  What if you want to express that a sound is playing inside a container / behind a wall in another room? You could use a low pass filter to muffle the higher frequencies. But if you don't want to get that sophisticated or want to work with e.g. vanilla Java, you could just prepare the original, slightly filtered, strongly filtered sound and then play them mixed according to situation.  You could even record spittle and gargle sounds and overlay them over speech samples at various volumes according to the degree of illness or the degree of blood-in-the-mouth or degree of zombie-transformation.  Car engine sound could be recorded as a smooth, round variant and as one where you can hear the nailing of the cylinders.  etc.   You've probably come across the Runnable interface in the form of      SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable(){         @Override         public void run() {             // Swing stuff. All of it needs to be executed on the AWT Event Dispatcher thread, that's what you use invokeLater for.             // Btw, you can also use this construct while you're already on the AWT thread:             // The commands in this block will be executed once the AWT thread is done with *everything* else,             // so if you need to work with the completely updated UI (e.g. size of components             // after a revalidate() call), you can make use of this construct.         }     });  The concept behind the Runnable interface is mighty awesome really: You can give one of your methods an arbitrary code block to execute! Remember how it was without Runnable, when you had to give a method e.g. an int and then create an if or switch block which would decide what method to call? With Runnable, you can just hand the code to be executed to the method directly - and other stuff.  You could for example use a setter in a class: "setCodeForShutdown(myRunnable);" And when that class is shutting down the program, you can have it execute that code first. Or you could create a HashMapString, Runnable() and use a Scanner(System.in) to type commands and have them execute with two more lines of code.  Of course you can create your own interfaces that use the same concept, because Runnable is not special at all - it's just employed by the Java libraries in so many places that it has a special status. Your interface could e.g. have two run()-like methods, one for normal execution and one for a special situation.  ----  But what really kicks the Runnable interface concept through the roof is when you use Java 8. Consider this code:      final public class MyApp {          final public static void main(final String[] args) {             SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable(){                 @Override                 public void run() {                     startUI();                 }             });         }          final private static void startUI() {             // create, initialize, and show JFrame         }     }  In Java 8, you can write the call in this shorter form (this is the famous **Lambda**):      final public static void main(final String[] args) {         SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() - {             startUI();         });     }  But since the run() method body is only one command, you can even write it shorter:      final public static void main(final String[] args) {         SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() - startUI());     }  If you think "Ok, I knew all that.", what about this then:      final public static void main(final String[] args) {         SwingUtilities.invokeLater(MyApp::startUI);     }  This is another novelty of Java 8 - a **method reference**. You can use it entirely as a replacement in your Runnable (and similar - more about that later) situations, for example:      final Runnable r = MyApp::startUI;     r.run();  This works and behaves as intended! Remember that startUI is not in any way special - it's not a class or anything, it's just a plain old method. Before Java 8, you would *have* to declare a class (e.g. an anonymous class) to do such a thing.  An example for the instance of a class:      final MyClass myClass = new MyClass();     final Runnable r = myClass::myNonstaticMethod; // you can even use "this::myMethod"     r.run();  Now, finally, an example that does not use Runnable:      private static interface PaintMethod {         void paint(final Graphics2D g, final MapEntry mapEntry);     }      final private static void paintSomething(final Graphics2D g, final MapEntry mapEntry) {     }  With this prepared, we can now do this in a method:      final PaintMethod pm = MyClass::paintSomething;     pm.paint(g, me);  See? You can also use method references like this for methods with parameters. The Runnable interface is not special.  ----  If you want to code in Java 8, to my experience (Which might be wrong.), you need IntelliJ at this point, because Eclipse does not yet seem fully ready for Java 8. The downside is that in IntelliJ you would have to choose the "javac" compiler instead of the "Eclipse" compiler (because the latter only works up to Java 7 at the moment), and the "javac" needs an error free project while the "Eclipse" compiler can compile anything just fine as long as the methods called are error free. Btw: The Community Edition of IntelliJ is free and fully allows to create commercial software. I used Eclipse for 1 year, then tried IntelliJ and am happy that I did so. But you can switch back to Eclipse at any point, it's not like IntelliJ swallows your project and doesn't give them back any more, it even has an exporter for Eclipse, but you can just work on your Eclipse project with IntelliJ for a few minutes, then close it and continue in Eclipse without need for an export.       ...      |  |  |      ...      |  |  |      ...   (I used two horizontal for each one vertical just because of the font proportions.)  There will be a 3D array of rooms. Each room can have 6 possible walls. Obviously, rooms 0,0,0 and 1,0,0 share a wall slot.  I am looking for a good practical data structure to store this. I currently have two candidates, but they rub me the wrong way.  Candidate 1: A wasteful array.      01234     ...      | | |   This would waste 9 entries for a map as scribbled at the top (which has 25 entries). On the room layer. If we imagine to denote the ceiling/floor layer of one story, even 21 of the 25 entries are wasted. And handling this array wouldn't be *that* easy, even though it seems simple enough at first. It's error-prone.  Candidate 2: Four arrays.  - the rooms XZY - the walls along the leftright (X) axis, XZY - the walls along the updown (Z) axis, XZY - the walls along the vertical (Y) axis, XZY, also known as floors/ceilings  I assume that the bulkiness of the task when it comes to data structures is due to the nature of more than one dimension. (Most of the things I wrote would apply to the 2D version of this, too.)  I also consider a 3rd approach: A box-class that has 6 wall slots. But this one sucks, too: Two adjacent boxes would share walls, so it's *yet again* quite unhandy.  Any suggestions?      Interactive text-based stories, where the magic happens in the head - not new. But I haven't seen one with a simulated world in the background yet.  This idea is for beginners and pros alike - just pick your level of complexity.  ----  Example: "You are in a kitchen. You see a stove, a fridge, a ceiling lamp, a switch, and a sink. There is an open door to the north, a closed window to the west."  The objects in the room have properties, the room itself has an environmental situation (e.g. air pressure, smells, temperature), the player also has properties (e.g. when the light is low or the player is blind-folded, the data retrieved via the eyes is limited/removed, so the text is changed accordingly, all by procedure instead of manually typed!).  On every game turn, simulate(); is called on all existing objects in the game world. So, when you return to room X, the fruits in the bowl on the table might have become a little less fresh.  ----  Some ideas:  * The game could either be turn-based, like the classic ones, or it could be in real-time in 1-second-steps, and as soon as the player starts typing, the game is paused until the input line is empty again. Alternatively, the whole input could happen via dropdown-menus: The moment a menu is opened, the game is paused. I attempted this a little, works very well - there was an "exits" menu, a "you" menu, and an "objects" menu.  * Simple "sound rendering": Sounds could be muffled or too silent to identify. One sound could be "drowned out" by another one, so that you e.g. have to turn off a washing machine to be able to hear/identify the person imprisoned behind the secret wall. One way to do this, for example, could be to describe the sounds a bit to the machine. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_frequency is an interesting resource for this. Based on it, one could describe with a boolean or double the significancy and volume of 4 or 5 frequency sections of the sound in question. This would allow to calculate how much a sound might be overridden by another one, to determine if it should be described to the player clearly, in a very coarse way that could be interpreted freely, or if the sound isn't described at all.  * Simple "light rendering" - or should I call it "em radiation rendering"? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_spectrum Nuclear terrorism, here we come! (Hi FBI.)  * Player and other beings could have rather complex and simulated stats, e.g. body temperature, hunger, weight, height, stance (Can you see the police car outside through the window while being bound on the floor?)  * Talking about police: NPCs could gather information (with some Garbage Collection to prevent data overkill), so if you drive your van to the city park and abduct someone, the police might be able to browse the tree of available options/objects to pick up an informational trace and ultimately get to you. I know, totally insane, but I believe it's not impossible. On the other hand, during your next game, you might play a cop yourself! An open self-experience system?  * Once you have a working system with rooms and some objects, start writing a world generator so that you have fun exploring your simulation while you're writing it. Tests will probably be pretty inspiring for the overall project.  ----  Suggestions:  * After a few attempts, I have figured out that the object model should use soft links, meaning that the objects should refer to each other via an ID number (e.g. 64 bit long), because ultimately you will face the beast that saving/loading is, and loading while related objects don't exist yet is a pain. Better just use soft links and look everything up in a manager class that also does the loading/saving.  * Every object (hence the master class from which all object classes inherit) should have an inventory. You could add flags and checks for/against the player/simulation using it, but it's good if it exists. E.g. put an object into your mouth. Or define buildings by "house contains floors which contain apartments which contain rooms" etc.  * Additionally, each object might have a variable list (in Java, it would probably be a HashMapString, Object), because that's again much easier to save/load than creating extra variables in each object and then having to deal with those.  * If you want to make a toilet (or whatever other kind of world object), my attempts have shown that it's best to create a separate class for every kind of object instead of trying to build the omni-object.  * Go crazy! E.g. in my realtime-attempt (Java) where input happened via dropdown menu, I made a toilet where you can lift/lower the lid and the seat (each pushing each other), you can flush, and you can abort the flushing which means that the next flush works right away but is shorter (the tank refills in realtime, the rest is logical - See the beauty of simulation versus just writing the story?). It's easy and fun to write world-objects like these, and they are easy to extend: Say, the toilet does not refill if the incoming water pipe is turned off. Of course you still have a free flush. Alternatively, you might be imprisoned and might need water. Hard choices have to be made, especially if you also simulate bowel movements.  * Again, go crazy: It's a *text adventure* system! Well, you can't just make up *anything*, because you have to give it some reality via simulation, but otherwise: Sky's the limit! Processing time is not an issue. Why shouldn't a turn take a few seconds? Do all the things you wished were in your favorite 3D action adventure game, but they didn't put it in because of development constraints, marketing, or simply because everything at once can't be done on today's PCs. But I double-dare you: DON'T fuck up the FoV!   I've been doing Java for over a year, and for String comparisons I often had to do .toUpperCase (or toLowerCase()). I can't believe I overlooked equalsIgnoreCase until now! Just saw it over at /r/javahelp.   I personally don't like it in applications when I have to wait for tooltips to appear (which is the default), and I absolutely despise it when they disappear before I have read them completely. The former is a question of taste, the latter is not. For my applications, I have set the tooltip delay to zero and the duration to about a month (which is max).  But they do get in the way because for some retarded reason, the Java team (which moved mountains and is awesome otherwise) decided that Java tooltips are not transparent to mouse events. When I was just now adding tooltips to dropdown menu entries, they just got *too much* in the way, and after two hours of fumbling, I found a simple and elegant solution:  Just set ToolTipManager enabled=false (which dismisses current tooltips) and immediately enabled=true for every mouse move event. Bonus effect: The tooltips move with the mouse pointer.  ----  **EDIT:** Improved the appearance a bit. Java's ToolTip system is really improper: If your tooltips have to be pushed to the left because they reach the screen's right end, they show considerable flicker behavior. I have even had cases where they had just been plainly black. To reduce the flickering, I introduced a counter.  ----      final ToolTipManager toolTipManager = ToolTipManager.sharedInstance();     final int flickerReduction = 10;      toolTipManager.setInitialDelay(0);     toolTipManager.setDismissDelay(Integer.MAX_VALUE);     toolTipManager.setReshowDelay(0);      Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().addAWTEventListener(new AWTEventListener() {          private int eventCounter = 0;          @Override         final public void eventDispatched(final AWTEvent e) {              eventCounter++;             eventCounter %= flickerReduction;              if (eventCounter == 0) {                 toolTipManager.setEnabled(false);                 toolTipManager.setEnabled(true);             }         }     }, AWTEvent.MOUSE_MOTION_EVENT_MASK);   An idea that keeps running through my head, so I have to get it out: Letting your in-game character walk/run by pressing one key for the left and for the right leg.  Press control for L: Left leg steps forward. Press R: Right leg. L: Left. ...  If you do this synchronous with the game, your character will just move with the speed you mirror with your inputs. If you do it faster, the character will pick up speed, the animation will smoothly change from relaxed walking to fast walking to running.  If you fall out of rhythm, the character will move slower or, if you totally fall out of it, will quickly reduce speed to walking and then standing still (but will probably jiggle a bit since you're still giving the legs commands to move).  A player could even assign the L key to CTRL left, the R key to CTRL right: When we walk and run in real life, we're moving our arms with this in rhythm. So inputting the action like this might even trigger our muscle memory and give a deeper experience.  This approach might ALSO be used to rotate your character to the left and right even, for advanced runners.  ----  Another example: An adventure game like Monkey Island, but in 3D first person, which is not a new idea. But what if you hold down a key which will give you, while the key is pressed, a mouse pointer and a small menu next to all visible objects in reach listing the possible interactions. This would be an efficient and smooth way to solve the "narrow interface tunnel between reality and the game-reality" problem that hampers game experience. Just move around in the world, and whenever your will desires to interact, hold the key and see the possible interactions, move the mouse pointer, click. It would feel efficient and un-hindering. The mouse pointer could start in the center of the screen every time, except if the player hasn't changed the viewing direction / position much.  ----  What ideas in this line of thinking (See headline.) do you have?  Sidebar-rules: I don't think that this violates submission rules, because this is just a way to discuss the topic, it doesn't ask for people to list games they like etc. - The idea is to come up with new interface ideas and possibly new game-play ideas along them.  I'm asking for possible new meaningful ways to interface with your in-game character or other aspects of the game world. Think "virtual reality", forget the decade and tons of games we have, don't be imprisoned in existing solutions. Take into account that the respective game's topic/game-play could be entirely different than existing ones - like e.g. Mirror's Edge. The game could well be designed around the mechanism you describe.         Follow-up question: Would this mean that in Germany, the sales are over at 19:00?      (Hey, why not. Know your enemy.)  http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/Xbox+One+Teardown/19718  http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/PlayStation+4+Teardown/19493  German article by the famous Heise company comparing the XBOX1 and PS4:  http://www.heise.de/meldung/Angetestet-Xbox-One-gegen-PS4-2052893.html  Forum claims that it's slightly biased towards PS4, but I can't tell.  Fun fact: It seems that both consoles are too loud to be used as music players. My PC is almost perfectly silent, so I just found an additional reason to be glad to be a member of the glorious PC master race.  ...  EDIT: Additional info that I happen to stumble over.  http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-11-20-all-the-xbox-one-launch-games-and-their-install-sizes         Games could just use hard-coded keys/buttons, and this input configuration library/interface would switch around everything before it even arrives at the game software. It should be an open library so that it's not bound to Steam. But Steam would be ideal, given that they already have their Steam overlay - I mean, it would be best if this universal input configuration system could be accessed without having to leave / Alt-Tab from the game.  So, again, in case it wasn't clear: In games, you can configure what keyboard or mouse button fulfills which function. But instead of implementing this anew again and again (at varying quality levels :P), why not just write this *once* and improve it gradually forever? The games would just provide info (e.g. via XML file) about what functions it provides, what properties those have (e.g. toggle, hold, ...) and what hard-coded input they would use.  This could even solve the Valve software pilot demand that I have: Several Valve games need exactly the same input configuration. Walk directions, jump, duck, the works. A pilot function would be great for this. Set up once, use everywhere.   I imagine that if we put a lens a few meters away from the laser, we can force the incoming photons to continue their "flight" in a perfectly parallel fashion (which would allow to project a millimeter-small speck on the Moon), just as we can arbitrarily modulate incoming photons that have traveled for billions of light years.  What's the catch?  full disclosure: I read these two very informative sources, but I still don't get it:  http://www.quora.com/Is-the-light-from-lasers-reduced-by-the-inverse-square-law-as-distance-grows-similar-to-other-light-sources (June 2011)  http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/152bf2/is_there_a_such_thing_as_a_perfect_laser_do_all/ (10 months ago)   ----     Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00          [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Eidos\Deus Ex: HRDC]     "g_fov"=hex:78,00,00,00           ----  Put the above into a text file and call it "DX HR DC fov 120.reg". Run the file, and click OK like 25 times. That's it.  Whenever you visit the "Gameplay" options menu, the FoV will reset, so you have to run the file again.  78 is simply the hexadecimal version of the decimal number 120. Use e.g. the Windows calculator (Switch to programmer mode.) to get the value you want. Or use any of the billion online resources that supply this service.  I made myself 5 such files for easy switching, but I guess I'll stick to 120. Mine are 100 110 120 130 140 (64 6E 78 82 8C). You can use any value in between, it's not locked to an interval of 10.  I'm off now to finally play the damn game.                     I'm in the same boat with you: Religion, no thanks. Belief without evidence, no thanks. AtheistExperience: Hooray. (I listen to a few bits every morning/evening while playing Rogue Legacy and listening to SomaFM.com, recommended.)  This submission is supposed to be an experiment: I have reason to believe that I, umm, have a special relationship with reality, or rather: That reality (which you inhabit) has a special relationship with me. I'll detail this further down.  THE EXPERIMENT now is to see if you do experience hints of this special relationship when reading this text and interacting with me in the comments.  THE OBSERVATIONS should follow this pattern, but they should be very slight, not "fist in the face" miracles or something:  I can not become guilty. I am holy. Any accusation against me is wrong, and even makes the accuser guilty. Reality should somehow express this, e.g. by the person who has the mental attitude against me having to cough, dropping their coffee, getting an unpleasant call that pulls them back down to the ground from which they quite lifted off when letting their fantasy run wild etc.  I don't mean to offend, I mean to conduct an experiment AND further my agenda (assuming that the experiment will be a success).  Thanks for your participation.   I heard that BestBuy and GameStop offer gift cards that someone can redeem to add to their Steam Wallet.  Are there other such services?  Does Amazon.de offer such a service / sell something like that?  [I got an Amazon.de gift card, redeemed it, but never seem to find good game deals. So, I'd like to have it in my Steam Wallet instead.]                        The reason that I ask this rather non-gaming-related question here is because I want to sample the "general population". From what I have gathered over years, no one really knows/uses this function, and I find that super sad. Only once you have lived in the Hibernate universe for a while, you'll know that this would be true. Why it's not the default is beyond me: I have used it at home and in the office, on three different machines, in WinXP Win7 Win8, for years. No issues (except *very rarely* in WinXP, and nothing serious).  When I go shopping, I hit the physical power button of my PC and go. When I return, I hit it again and log in. Difference between before and after: NONE. Super comfortable. And the PC is really physically turned off, you can unplug it, carry it anywhere, resume. All windows will be where they were. [Multiple Desktops](http://code.google.com/p/mdesktop/) will be as they were. Steam continues its downloads. Videos continue playing. I can't imagine why someone wouldn't want this! I never tried it on games that only have a checkpoint system, though. They might not resume properly, but it's worth a try.  All aboard! But please tell me if you knew/used it.  If you have never heard of it: It's not super obscure, it's (As far as I have gathered.) just the diamond right in the middle of the table that for some reason nobody sees/uses.

The only solution is to make the commenting box disappear in those posts.   Haven't seen the ... historical documents yet, just a ~~tr~~ excerpt. It said that two people are required because the neuronal load for one human would be too big.  If I press a key on the keyboard, and it starts a program, or if instead a nuclear bomb is exploded, pressing the key is the same. The size of the effect is irrelevant. What am I missing?  EDIT: And what's with all the downvotes? 3 versus **11**, something's wrong here.   There's a post with no comments. People write a few and move on. The post is still at 1 total votes. It can be assumed that those people would want the post upvoted for the visibility of the post and of the comment.  So, why not automatically upvote the post if the user commented on root level?  The vote can still be changed freely, like always. But the user *can't forget* to upvote any more. Total freedom is retained. It's just for practicality.  The example that inspired this: http://i.imgur.com/jJmBlMq.png  EDIT:  It could be a preferences-option, defaulting to off.               This sequence can be created with this algorithm:  [step 1] Initialize variables: u = 1; v = 0  [step 2] u = u - v; v = v + u  [step 3] go to [step 2]  Since you probably wonder why someone would ask this: I came up with that crap about 15 years ago when I was thinking about the universe and if there might be an algorithm to describe it. I thought that the most fundamental component of its system would probably somehow be wave-like, so I thought about the most simple algorithm to create a wave-like sequence. Since it's two variables played out against each other, it even has Yin Yang like qualities. Esoteric BS ends here.  I'm just curious if this could produce a proper sinus.   It is sadly a polished turd that I regret having paid 20 for, an assortment of the usual shooter clichs wrapped into high quality artsy visual design (though for some reason, all paintings have stucko texture, not paintbrush texture) - Dishonored is easily 10 times as good.  The sound design is remarkably bad, as everything sounds like it's squeezed through a brutal dynamic-compressor cranked up to 15, while additionally a set of high frequencies (I guess around 5 KHz) are boosted so much that it's just unpleasant and can only be beared by reducing the volume, and this is *not* to be confused with just being too loud.  The intro movies and too small FoV slider range can easily be fixed via settings-file-adjustment (for this and other tips, see [here](http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/27/bioshock-infinite-tweaks-let-you-skip-intro-videos-increase-fov-and-adjust-sensitivity/)), but be warned that the savegame system is *abysmal*, you only have far apart checkpoints between which you can easily have a lot of individual small activities (looking for the few kinds of existing goodies in trashcans etc.), and all those will be lost when you quit out of frustration to play something else, which can easily happen as you can easily miss such an autosave having happened.  Supposedly, this game is a descendant of System Shock and the much better System Shock 2, and while I see that they obviously took a few elements of those games, the game itself has nothing to do with those classics, it's a flat out lie to claim that it's actually a descendant, and if I purely use enjoyment as a measure, the game is at most worth 10 (rather 5, but the design, the sky-city, the pleasant companion experience, and most of all the curiosity as to how the story will continue (something the first play-through will kill) motivate a lot).   Seems like I can only play 1/3 of the game.  http://i.imgur.com/9K3NAZ2.jpg  Apparently **game-breaking glitch on PC:**  You must find 6 fish. In every video I could find (all of which apparently XBOX), there are TWO fish on the ground near Gollum at the beginning of that level. You can pick both up. I have played the whole level 4 times now, but I only get 5 fish overall: There is only ONE on the ground near Gollum at the start.  One is right below the bowl where you have to toss the fish, the other would be a few meters to the right, still on the same screen. I do not have that fish. I can't finish the level. Couldn't find any info anywhere.  Steam LEGO LOTR version: 1.0.0.519643  Windows 8  I heard that the XBOX version has seen updates but the PC version is still like on initial release.  Any tips/help?   I am asking this *partly* in jest, but I think it's a question worth asking.  After all, blind people have no choice but to believe in things they can not see.      http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1g1muv/to_all_do_you_think_religion_is_really_under/  I thought it might be interesting to you guys.            [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1et6lw/as_a_muslim_i_find_myself_becoming_intensely/) submission in r/Islam gave me the idea.   for not being recognized by his creation - a creation that, by comparison to Allah, is insignificant, to say the least.  So, God's work is insignificant, he wasn't able (or willing) to create something worthy of his greatness? Or did he actually pull it off - meaning that God isn't *that* unimaginably infinitely high etc., but has a quite graspable greatness?   There was more which I currently can't remember. Admittedly, the interactive movie that it is (It's basically Dragon's Lair with freeroam-scenes, combat and some stealth.) is very well done, and it deserves praise - but this, in turn, shows how bad the state of gaming still is. We're lauding improvements, but we fail to laud the improvement separate from the rest (which still needs improvement).  The FieldOfView is much too low, it's *work* to even perceive the landscape around you. Oh, there's a fucking PLANE? Surprise. I didn't SEE it right there in the open. The interface to the computer (keyboard, mouse, controller, 2D video, audio) is narrow enough as it is. This warrants that measures that can be taken to improve the interface *should be taken*. Instead, the developers can't be bothered to increase a simple integer number from 50 up to 100 or something.  I just quit the game for the second time in frustration, in both cases it was a quicktime event that put me off. I'm not an anti-QTE nazi, I see that they can make sense in some places. In other places, I am still willing to put up with them even though I'd wish they weren't there. But in some places in this game, they are just an impossible hurdle.  Get this: *Interface issues.* That is a topic that I have an absolute gripe with. And a quicktime-event *is* an intentional interface obstacle, so it needs good justification to be there.  So, there's this wolf that attacks you once you got that stuff in the cave an hour or two into the game. Mash left right left right, then press F, then mash E. I keep doing this, just as they say, just when they say it. (What am I, doing *homework*? This is *tedious*, that's not a game for me.) But it doesn't work. I always get to see the wolf-eats-croft animation.  And what's with the scene immediately before you enter that cave? Just when you have climbed up the last wooden "This is intended to be climbed. We are developers giving you a clue. This is not a breach of the fourth wall, return to the circle-jerking fan herd, please."-thing, *three* things happen:  * The wolfs howl and growl, insinuating that you're on the same plane with them, that they'll attack you now, so you ready your bow and, through the forced binoculars, look around. It's kinda funny that preparing to shoot narrows the FoV even further, but just a slight bit - because it's already ridiculously low. Then, as a joke, you can press Y to zoom even more. But again, just a slight bit. Because the FoV had been too fucking low to begin with.  * Lara says something that you are to process with your mind.  * A text appears at the right bottom of the screen, saying something that I couldn't process.  All this *intentionally* happens at just this point, it's not a quirky situation caused by simulation. The developers *intended* this to happen this way. The developers are hence stupid.  And what's with the interface in general? When you are at a camp, you have a root menu from which you can click yourself deeper into the topics. But you can't use the mouse to return to the root - you have to use the ESC key a few times. Also, when you choose an ability to master, you get an extra menu level where you have to confirm. This does *not* happen when you improve your gear, even though the interface is otherwise entirely the same - bad interface design. Also, the interface is cleary intended to be flashy, rather not to be useful. This can e.g. be seen when you hover the mouse over the skill etc. that you hovered over before: The flashy change-over effect happens *again*, which is entirely unnecessary since you're already there.  There were more things, I didn't think of them now. But I feel that I have to work to get my money's worth of experience. If the game would have been cheaper, I could just dismiss it.  It's a waste. Like in so many other cases, where e.g. the FoV is just too fucking low. Why do they do this? The map/graphics/engine guys did great work in this game and many other games - and then some retard decides to break everything with poor interface and FoV choices. Those people should lose their job, and this should happen so often that they get the message.  I wish I hadn't bought this. Fuck the circle-jerk for pushing this into my life. I am looking at various sources when I purchase games, but they betrayed me this time.  (r/Gaming's reception was poor, also someone suggested that r/TrueGaming would be a better place for something like this.)   There was more which I currently can't remember.

I am looking at various sources when I purchase games, but they betrayed me this time.         (I'm not sure if this content is allowed.)  When Jesus resurrected, his body was taken from the tomb, insinuating that the flesh was re-used for the new manifestation. Maybe akin to what happened to Lazarus.  What happened to the blood that he lost? What happened to the cells/flesh that stuck to the torture instruments? Did this stuff vanish/reintegrate, too?  (Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/1dvkfa/the_power_of_christ/c9uq0wx?context=10).)   Title says it.  A person who believes that their child could *possibly* end up in *eternal torture, designed by the almighty*, is risking this by creating new life. How can a person make such a decision!?  Pascal's Wager. "The risk is so high that you have to submit your reasoning to it!" This is how it is being used against us. Well, it can be used against them, too, as shown.         It was always my take that logic itself becomes a singularity when we go back to the very first moment of time. Every datapoint we, or any human, observe can lead to an abstraction that kinda "contains" all these and other related datapoints. Many such abstractions can lead to another level of abstraction that in turn contains these abstractions (insinuating that any datapoint might be seen as an abstraction from some perspective). The "Theory of Everything" is an example for this, as it would unify General Relativity and Quantum Theory, so it would effectively contain them.  All in all, I conceptualize the world to be kind of like a 2D pyramid or a tree of logic that indeed has a root. Also, I think that this concept is applicable on every level, e.g. in everyday life, and should be taught in school, giving pupils a map of reality, so they could map out their "location" - everybody starts at the bottom and slowly climbs up with their mind. To e.g. be the President of the US, you have to have an understanding of the world that has climbed quite high up in the pyramid. This might even be the very effort that is invested into what we call "learning/understanding".  To me, it seems clear that there is a top-most point of the pyramid, which is the true meaning of the word "existence", and its discovery/definition is the holy grail of science.  But to me, it seems like this highest level can never be climbed, because all meaning fuses into one indivisible unity (Singularity.), maybe the name of it is "the truth". The Uncertainty Principle might even be the mathematical version of what I just said: It says "we know something is there, but we also know that we can't precisely know it".  The Uncertainty Principle might even state that GR and QT can not ever be united. In any case: At this point, science is beginning to pursue the functionality of logic/causality itself. This is entirely different territory than everything before.  What do you think? Does logic itself become a singularity at the very beginning of time - so, does all meaning melt into one indivisible thing there? And would this imply that certain high level concepts (e.g. GR and QT) can not possibly be united?      I found this old comment by user "RubberTrees" (which is quite insulting at times, but I'd ask you to overlook that for the sake of the argument, please) which makes this interesting point: The Bible does not give enough data to allow proper belief, even if you'd want to, because you're believing incorrectly/imprecisely.  I think we can assume that you will disagree with the point he/she makes.  **Why do you disagree with this point?** That's the reason for this submission.  http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/h2l53/sometimes_i_forget_just_how_absurd_this_whole/c1s3ver   I just recently read it again from cover to cover. I took pretty extensive notes and painfully read each book.   First of all it's really boring and hard to read. The stories are filled with disgusting examples of humanity at its worst and the god of the bible is blatantly evil.   Some of the poetry is decent. I especially enjoyed Ecclesiastes and a few Proverbs but there is nothing in the bible that points towards a divine authorship. Nothing that even hints at omniscience. It is painfully obvious that it was written by, and for, ignorant men from an age of barbarism.   The New testament is mainly a bunch of letters from Paul of Tarsus who never even met Jesus. Nothing in Matthew, Mark, Luke or John is very compelling at all.   My biggest complaint is the "believe or burn" philosophy of the bible, which completely fucks everyone because the bible is insufficient for belief or knowledge of who Jesus even was.  **[START HERE]**   Nothing in the Gospels really expresses or describes Jesus well enough where "belief in Jesus" would have any real meaning. For all the Christians know their mental image of Jesus (Yeshua) is so fucking far off base that if he is real their version doesn't even count and they still burn.   "You've been picturing some white guy with a different name and his teachings weren't even translated correctly... fuck you, burn in hell." Yahweh (and this is completely within his character, he is insanely evil.)   You can't just say some guys name (which isn't even his real name) picture some face (that isn't even his real face) and then read some of his words (that probably aren't even his words) and then expect some kind of reward. Especially when the god is Yahweh. (seriously, most evil creature ever created by man.)   Christians have no fucking clue who Jesus was, what he looked like, what he was talking about or if the people who wrote the bible even described him properly. If the "believe or burn" philosophy is correct they should be freaking out because they have nothing to go on, no one does.   If you have to believe in Jesus, there is simply no way to do it properly. You are most likely believing in some fictional idealized version of some guy you can't even picture correctly. If there is a tyrant god like Yahweh, and belief in his son is needed to avoid his wrath, everyone is fucked, even Christians.   I found this comment by him/her very enlightening and want to share it. More ammunition to shoot people reasonable is good. If impatient, start in the middle.

This posting serves to bring said concept to your attention, and to allow its discussion.  Assuming that mankind will keep progressing, maybe even populate other planets, so we'd have a much larger population:  I believe we can assume that eventually, high quality digital content of all kinds for very low prices or even for free will be available to people of all tastes, and even in such an amount that nobody will ever run out. (This will not prevent content creation, as creating is an entirely different game/experience than consuming.)  If we crank this up to eleven, this might even result in cheap/free Hollywood-class (I mean the craftsmanship.) movies.   How do we "know" (Everything is best guess.) that these events that we call "random" are not e.g. a deterministic result of the total sum of all events in the universe, like water flowing down a drain? Are we not just drops looking at our neighbor-drop, unable to infer why it is behaving like that?  Or is the choice of the term "random" here just Occam's-Razor- and practicality-informed?   I always tried to understand what's going on there, and came to this view that at least ties it together for my head. But is it correct?  "Just think of high voltage sparking between two electrodes: The electricity jumps even without a (good) conductor. Kinda the same happens inside of a wire when the voltage is high - hence the resistance is less relevant."  And in the unlikely case that this is correct - why have I, 39 years of age, *never* read it anywhere?   I'll let myself out now.  PS: No karma for me, since it's a text-post.  PPS: Just in case you don't know, there's a very popular saying that says just the same about Satan.      I owned and played AoS at least a month prior. Getting the Europe server list was never remarkably slow.  But since that Sunday, it takes about 30 seconds (after 20 seconds, the list begins to fill, even with FULL and EMPTY servers displayed). Might have been 1 or 2 weeks earlier already, but definitely was Sunday, and definitely has been like this EVERY TIME / DAY since then. The US East / West lists are fast.  I didn't find anything on the Interwebs about this, which I find baffling.  Germany, ISP is Deutsche Telekom  I'm an AoS "noob", meaning I only know the Steam AoS, no custom servers, no randomly generated maps - just the standard stuff the average gamer gets. I have the Valentines DLC, but that was unrelated to the Europe list slow issue, timing-wise.  **EDIT:**  **MON 2013-02-25 It's still this way. I found a workaround: Add every server to your favorites, then use the favorite-page henceforth. You find new servers to fave several times per day, which I find weird, anyway: This is a viable way to play it and IMMEDIATELY get your server info.**                           This is my stance.  We use about 1.5 Earths today, resource-wise ([link](http://www.footprintnetwork.org/en/index.php/gfn/page/world_footprint/), [link](http://phys.org/news178269435.html)). We need much more than the planet can provide. http://www.google.com/search?q=resource+use+earths  We are heading towards an abyss, and we are not slowing down, let alone turning around.  The only *effective* solution would be to decrease population growth.  Of course we must keep having children, but even if we would step on the brake with effort right now, Earth's population would certainly not decrease drastically in 100 years, it would probably even still increase.  This must become a topic people care about in everyday life, because we, mankind, are *insane* as a collective. We must face the truth of our global situation and act accordingly on a local scale.                     (I searched for "formatting" in this subreddit but didn't see a fitting submission, so forgive me if this is effectively spam.)  So, again: The "formatting help" link under comments that shows a few things about how to format text could use something else: A link to a page that explains *all* of the formatting options.  Or is this omitted intentionally to prevent people from going crazy like they're just making their first Microsoft Word document?     	138
 Tyler Posey is too hot not to be. And all the other eye candy is a nice bonus. The show could definitely do with more lacrosse, though. I've watched a few MLL matches and it is quite good.   I was just reading that actually. While I do like what he is saying it seems to be essentially the same rhetoric I've heard from most of the other candidates on the Democratic side, so this isn't inspiring--it is stuff they're all parroting in some form or another (and I agree with it). Definitely not enough to have me choose Sanders over any other candidate, like Hillary. As I stated above, apparently I match up virtually the same with both Sanders in Hillary on the issues so it is unlikely that their stances on the issues by themselves will be enough to sway me from one or the other.  	2
 * Bad things cause bad things * Killing human beings without remorse is bad * Video games can cause you to kill human beings without remorse  therefore:  * Video games can be bad.  I implore you to make a morality judgement on this.   They were already mentally prepared to kill people.   That is an awfully casual way to say such an awful thing.   You should care about what any *compos mentis* older human being has to say. May I ask how old you are?  I'm surprised you mentioned the word 'love'. How would you respond if I accused your reaction to Lucas' thesis as being the result not of love but of fear?   The meaning of the quotation will become clearer after a little more question and answer between us.   That the thought of men being made to play Doom^TM and then being given a gun (or an Xbox controller) and being asked to kill **human beings** doesn't trouble you.         I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt and presume you're a troll.    What he thinks... means nothing  To criticise with compassion is more skillful than to criticise with hatred. Hatred blinds. Someone doesn't need to be a degree-laden 'psychiatrist' to have meaningful things to say. George Lucas has created beautiful films (American Graffiti), and has self-consciously exploited the study of personality archetypes as successfully as anyone else (Star Wars). But more important than that - he is an elder of our tribe. Something tells me you had forgotten that. Correct me if I'm wrong.  All bodies pass through the universal substance, as it were into and out of a rushing stream; cohering and cooperating with the whole, as do our physical members with one another. How many a Chrysippus, a Socrates, an Epictetus has been engulfed by time! Remember this where you have to do with any man or thing whatsoever.   Has anyone else reported Foldit or Eyewire causing the 'blue screen of death'? Or is it just coincidence?   That website has a .mil ending.   Doom^TM is ugliness layered upon ugliness. The words 'modern military' conjure up images of Americans killing Pakistani families with Xbox controllers. And yes that is going on.   Linking it there shouldn't discount my arguments (which you can respond to if being logical should take your fancy. lol!). If I had submitted it to /r/getUndisciplined however...    So that's what they mean when they say 'butthurt'...   You can subscribe to religious ethics without realising you are subscribing to religious ethics.   **Protestant work ethic** *n.* the view that to be successful through hard work is a person's duty and responsibility, which, according to Max Weber's analysis, first evolved in Protestant Europe through the teachings of Calvin.   Another reason it is called that is that the video game industry obeys that holiest of capitalist maxims - thou shalt not kill the cash cow. (Sometimes Moses reminds me of myself...)   Thought so; you were just blustering.    You should look at /u/rawkuts's example. I hope she is able to change some of your views too.   Very good.   How much of it do I have to play before I 'help science'?   * I know I'm not the only one who thinks it's a ridiculous name so you're wrong there.  * Why is it called that? and Does it involve killing?  * Just because someone is a good artist doesn't make them a good person. I'd rather have Eminem as an associate than a son-in-law. And by 'old school games' I take it you're not referring to chess?   Wrong, wrong, wrong.  I was trying to discourage those, (perhaps you fall into this category, perhaps not), who stumble blindly in the hell-realm that is addiction to video-games. I know a man who is in his thirties and plays video games. People mock him behind his back about it, and he has admitted to me that he feels 'shame' (his word) about his habit. True story. I, out of compassion, would like to save others from his fate.  And, **I was trying to encourage** the rays of hope out there, (One must never abandon hope. It was not without reason some Catholic theologians called despair 'the one unforgivable sin'), the comparatively enlightened video game apologist (like rawkuts) into singing in this chillest of chill lands.   I don't know what you are or aren't envious of. I can assure you however that the video game prison looks less attractive from the outside than from within.  Perhaps drugs can help one ['to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield'](http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/174659), perhaps they can't. One thing for sure is that they make for a better [Lotos](http://www.bartleby.com/42/638.html) than does video games.   Edit: added brackets for clarity   Is there greater wisdom than: 'Forgive them, Father. They know not what they do'? If there is, is that what you were employing with your snide dismissal of Lucas in your second paragraph? You might think I'm being facetious but this exchange, I believe, highlights precisely the foibles that civilised fellow-produce-of-the-Big-Bang and enlightened 'fellow passengers to the grave' shouldn't have.   What on earth do you know about Buddhist teachings on ego and pride?   http://www.army.mil/article/11936/History_of_Military_gaming/   It wasn't merely smug condescension. When I was a philosophy undergraduate at university they said the SEP was often more advanced than our purposes required. Equating an unknown Reddit user with an undergraduate philosophy student is not condescension (unless, perhaps it occurs in a sub such as /r/Academia).   Best comment yet. Still looking at your first link. The first comment to make me think of delta-ing someone. (Such a shame that it looks like a dunce's cap, though. Why couldn't they have picked any other letter?)   a) The science seems to state that video games do have a negative effect - http://www.psychology.iastate.edu/faculty/caa/abstracts/2010-2014/10ASISBSRS.pdf. Read that and see if you then disagree.   b) Other things being bad does not mean that video games are good.  c) I think you missed some of the subtlety of my original explicatory comment. I said that any good engendered by games is nullified by the pallid tone in which they cast 'reality'. Perhaps you'd like to tell me more about Spec Ops. My prejudices are telling me that, going on the first two words alone, the game is not one made by a devotee of Francis of Assisi or the Lord Buddha! Please disabuse me.    The suggestion that an American soldier could possibly not be morally corrupted I consider risible. (If that's 'rude or hostile to other users', then sobeit. I'd find it rude and hostile to humanity for me not to say it.)   Everything is conditioning. I parse from your comment then that you subscribe to the 'Protestant work ethic'. I'd say that someone or something 'corrupted' you into thinking that. Additionally if I found other assumptions of yours that I believe don't cohere with reality I believe I would attribute them to either corruption or ignorance.   An overly jaundiced take on proceedings.   Sorry I had overlooked that. Some things strike different people as needing to be justified.

Yes. It might help you to understand where I'm coming from if I told you that I'm beyond Good and Evil inasmuch as I think instead in regards to that which is *kusala* and *akusala* or 'skillful' and 'unskillful'.

I've not played Final Fantasy 10 (DAE think that is a ridiculous name. Like, 'Last of the Mohicans 2: Back with a vengeance!'). Is there a conscientious objector option or does one have to contort oneself into 'killer mode'?  * It wasn't an arbitrary statement/belief, sadly. I'm trying to help people. The lives that I will 'save' and the potential I will emancipate is worth my time. Of course it would be better if nothing had to be 'put down', that better world does not exist. Here in this world is suffering and dissipation. There are those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. And there are those who encourage, and those who discourage, those things that lead to suffering and dissipation. Often the opposite of dissipation leads to suffering. As often, and arguably more dangerous, is when the opposite of suffering leads to dissipation which then leads to increased suffering.  * Eminem has talent. I wonder what his 'Elegy for a Gamer' would sound like.

There are people who make the vow to do such a thing in a public ceremony. It is not uncommon in parts of the world.  * You are a 'moral relativist'. I am not. I am an 'enlightenment humanist' and, from the sounds of it, you are not. Our views of the world are incompatible.  * Hamlet may have said that but it is obvious he didn't believe it.   Was it the 'poverty of imagination' one?  May I ask that you not remove the comments of anyone who insults me. The insulting doesn't bother me, but the removal of potentially cogent content does.   I have played them and consider the time I spent on them time wasted. I do have acquaintances who play video games. I have noticed it having a detrimental effect on their 'lives'. A coldness, flabbiness, bareness characterised by grim companions and ethical indifference.   Poems can teach wisdom and represent beauty. Video games are more like sport without exercise.   'When you pick up the controller something switches off in the heart.'   The 'I'd wager' prefix flags the conjectural basis of my comment. A conjecture not without reason however. I know, and have sources to prove, that commercial video games have been used to train killers in the past ([Marines being made to 'play' 'DOOM'](http://imgur.com/a/iImUQ#8WNhipK)), I can't think of any that have been made to instil caring into nurses or competence and compassion into doctors and surgeons.   Note my 'otherwise healthy' bit.   'Violence' and 'rampant capitalism' are 'life-skills'. I just don't think they're particularly noble ones.   If it makes someone happy, how is that a bad thing?

What's your point?   How is what you choose to spend your time on morally superior to what a person who plays video games chooses?  Because I try to engage with things that are helpful, salubrious, or improving (- 'That makes better; spec. that improves the mind, understanding, or character; that makes agricultural improvements.) I believe that she who plays video games does not do so for reasons as noble as my motivators.   http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/action/#NatActAge  http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/personal-autonomy/  Are these helpful or would you rather something more basic?      I can't imagine anyone who wakes up in the morning and vows to devote themselves that day to the common good of all sentient beings would decide to spend the day playing board games in front of the television.   Nonetheless, I will say a few words in their favour. Board games at least (usually?) require human contact so they have that going for them.   With television, the consumption of the content can obtain with the agent's agency comparably intact. I am presented something, and then   I am beholden to no-one (not event the writer or director or leading lady) as to what opinions, and conclusions I have. I can 'make of it' what I like. With a video game I have to acquiesce with its creator to consume the content. Whatsoever she considers a door, I have to see as a door. Whatsoever she considers a task, I must consider a task. Whatsoever she considers the goal, I must assume as the goal. Whilst, one cannot 'fail' at 'The Godfather' (1972: Paramount Pictures) through being aghast at the characters' misdeeds, one could never possibly win at 'The Godfather: The Game' (2010: EA Games) without having to replicate (via your *avatar*) acts 'fearsome' and cruel.  An insect is capable of making the sort of decisions involved in Tetris. A human life wasted on such things is a sad thing however. If I was feeling poetic I'd say (after [Blake](http://www.poetryloverspage.com/poets/blake/to_see_world.html), of course)        A Tetris brick that falls right down        Touches the heartstrings without a sound.   * I am trying to say "it's so immoral you cannot justify using it".   * Life has bigger, bolder, more pressing, and more puzzling puzzles than any video game. Ergo, those bigger, bolder, more pressing, and more puzzling puzzles will provide better braining training.   * The first article you quoted was awful.    So the fact that video game players are better at 'using a joystick and looking one way while reaching in a different direction' shows they are better at 'laparoscopic surgery'? I'm glad that no one actually believes that playing video games makes one a qualified surgeon. I'd wager that the surgeons who play video games would be worse surgeons than those that don't because they would take life less seriously and value human life less.  * 'Brain flexibility'? What kind of newspeak is this? I'd rather have a strong intellect, or a keen perception than a flexible brain. Quisling had a flexible brain. If I was a military general, I'd like recruits with 'flexible brains'. All the better to turn them from men to animals.   And, surprise, surprise! Look who funded the study:  This research was supported by Air Force Office of Scientific Research (www.afosr.af.mil) grant FA9550-10-1-0268, Army Research Laboratory (www.arl.army.mil) grant  * I think the acid test to that would be if on your deathbed you wished you had played more video games. If you're telling me you believe you would, you have either my disbelief or my contempt and pity.   I think I also anticipated some of your thrust with my 'otherwise healthy' caveat in my explicatory comment above.   To state that one has the choice between 'seeking entertainment' and 'silently contemplating the mysteries of the universe' is a false dilemma and shows, if I might be so bold, a poverty of imagination.  Do I believe that with this precious human life, with so many different things to do, finding ways simply to 'pass the time' is a waste of time? Yes I do. The time will pass whatever we do. It is our responsibility to use it well.   * I have played, seen, and can name a video game.  * I am talking about the universe in which this 'morality system' takes place. If one were to 'save a tribe of villagers from a volcano' on a video game one would, on one level of consciousness, associate saving tribes of villagers from a volcano with what you did whilst playing that game. The necessary meaninglessness of the video game world (i.e. its video game-ness) has a toxic influence on a 'morality system' that has to exist in the world outside the game console, television and gamer ecology. The difference between saving a tribe of villagers and not saving a tribe of villagers on a video game has no effect on the number of lives lost (except perhaps that of the 'gamer', but that's an argument for elsewhere). The difference between saving a tribe of villagers and not saving a tribe of villagers - in real life - does have an effect that can be equated in terms of suffering caused and human lives lost. The 'morality system' cannot be equivalent or comparable between the two 'worlds'.  * 'Brutality beyond the minimum' is a phrase that has been forged by video games, I'm sure. I'll leave you to work out the irony. Correct me if I'm wrong.  * I don't think 'concomitantly' is a particularly difficult word. Let me know if you still don't understand what it means.  * It was George Lucas.

My argument is that in cases where they are 'merely games' they have no utility.   *All* video games.   In and of itself, no.          The distance to mars changes a lot, but let's say on average it is 230,000,000 km from earth (This number is about the distance from mars to the sun).  How could this possibly be the case?

All common things, each day's events,             That with the hour begin and end,       Our pleasures and our discontents,             Are rounds by which we may ascend.

The heights by great men reached and kept             Were not attained by sudden flight,       But they, while their companions slept,             Were toiling upward in the night.

Obama's victory-party over Mitt Romney, and [this article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/6057734.stm) from seven and a half years ago have apparently been amongst the 10 most read stories today.         **Dumur**: How was the new edition of Nietzsche's Complete Philosophical Works established?  **Deleuze**: The problem was to reclassify the posthumous notesthe Nachlassin accordance with the dates Nietzsche had written them, and to place them after the works with which they were contemporaneous. Some of them had been used in an abusive way after Nietzsche's death to compose The Will to Power. So it was essential to reestablish the exact chronology. This explains why the first volume, The Gay Science, is more than half composed of previously unpublished fragments dating from 1881-1882. Our conception of Nietzsche's thought as well as his creative process may be profoundly altered as a result. The new edition will appear simultaneously in Italy, Germany, and France. But we owe the texts to the work of two Italians, Colli and Montinari.  **Dumur**: How do you explain that Italians rather than Germans did the job?  **Deleuze**: Maybe the Germans were not in a good position to do it. They already had numerous editions, which they were fond of, despite the arbitrary organization of the notes. Also, Nietzsche's manuscripts were in Weimar, East Germanywhere the Italians were better received than any West German could have hoped to be. Finally, the Germans were undoubtedly embarrassed at having accepted the edition of The Will to Power created by Nietzsche's sister. Elizabeth Forster-Nietzsche put together an extremely harmful work that privileges many Nazi interpretations. She didn't falsify the texts, but we know well enough that there are other ways to distort an author's thinking, even if it is merely an arbitrary selection from among his papers. Nietzschean concepts like those of "force" or "master" are complex enough to be betrayed by a selection such as hers.  **Dumur**: Will the translations be new?  **Deleuze**: Completely new. This is especially important for those writings toward the end (there have been some poor readings, for which Elizabeth Nietzsche and Peter Gast are responsible). The first two volumes to be published, The Gay Science and Human, All Too Human, have been translated by Pierre Klossowski and Robert Rovini. This doesn't mean that the prior translations by Henri Albert, and by Genevieve Bianquis, were badnot at all. But if they were determined to publish Nietzsche's notes with his works, they had to begin from scratch and unify the terminology. On that note, interestingly enough, Nietzsche was first introduced in France not by the "right," but by Charles Andler and Henri Albert, who represented a whole socialist tradition with anarchical colorings.  **Dumur**: Do you think a "return to Nietzsche" is taking place in France today? And if so, why is it?  **Deleuze**: It's difficult to say. Maybe there has been a change, or maybe the change is taking place now, with respect to the modes of thought which have been so familiar to us since the Liberation. We were used to thinking dialectically, historically. Today it seems the tide has turned from dialectical thinking toward structuralism, for example, as well as other systems of thought.  Foucault insists on the importance of the techniques of interpretation. It's possible that in the actual idea of interpretation is something which goes beyond the dialectical opposition between "knowing" and "transforming" the world. Freud is the great interpreter, so is Nietzsche, but in a different way. Nietzsche's idea is that things and actions are already interpretations. So to interpret is to interpret interpretations, and thus to change things, "to change life." What is clear for Nietzsche is that society cannot be an ultimate authority. The ultimate authority is creation, it is art: or rather, art represents the absence and the impossibility of an ultimate authority. From the very beginning of his work, Nietzsche posits that there exist ends "just a little higher" than those of the State, than those of society. He inserts his entire corpus in a dimension which is neither historical, even understood dialectically, nor eternal. What he calls this new dimension which operates both in time and against time is the untimely. It is in this that life as interpretation finds its source. Maybe the reason for the "return to Nietzsche" is a rediscovery of the untimely, that dimension which is distinct both from classical philosophy in its "timeless" enterprise and from dialectical philosophy in its understanding of history: a singular element of upheaval.  **Dumur**: Could we then say this is a return to individualism?  **Deleuze**: Yes, but a bizarre individualism, in which modern consciousness undoubtedly recognizes itself to some degree. Because in Nietzsche, this individualism is accompanied by a lively critique of the notions of "self" and "I." For Nietzsche there is a kind of dissolution of the self. The reaction against oppressive structures is no longer done, for him, in the name of a "self" or an "I." On the contrary, it is as though the "self" and the "I" were accomplices of those structures.  Must we say that the return to Nietzsche implies a kind of aestheticism, a renunciation of politics, an "individualism" as depersonalized as it is depoliticized? Maybe not. Politics, too, is in the business of interpretation. The untimely, which we just discussed, is never reducible to the political-historical element. But it happens from time to time that, at certain great moments, they coincide. When people die of hunger in India, such a disaster is political-historical. But when the people struggle for their liberation, there is always a coincidence of poetic acts and historical events or political actions, the glorious incarnation of something sublime or untimely. Such great coincidences are Nasser's burst of laughter when he nationalized Suez, or Castro's gestures, and that other burst of laughter, Giap's television interview. Here we have something that reminds us of Rimbaud's or Nietzsche's imperatives and which puts one over on Marxan artistic joy that comes to coincide with historical struggle. There are creators in politics, and creative movements, that are poised for a moment in history. Hitler, on the contrary, lacked to a singular degree any Nietzschean element. Hitler is not Zarathoustra. Nor is Trujillo. They represented what Nietzsche calls "the monkey of Zarathoustra." As Nietzsche said, if one wants to be "a master," it is not enough to come to power. More often than not it is the "slaves" who come to power, and who keep it, and who remain slaves while they keep it.  The masters according to Nietzsche are the untimely, those who create, who destroy in order to create, not to preserve. Nietzsche says that under the huge earth-shattering events are tiny silent events, which he likens to the creation of new worlds: there once again you see the presence of the poetic under the historical. In France, for instance, there are no earth-shattering events right now. They are far away, and horrible, in Vietnam. But we still have tiny imperceptible events, which maybe announce an exodus from today's desert. Maybe the return to Nietzsche is one of those "tiny events" and already a reinterpretation of the world.  _________________________  Gilles Deleuze interviewed by Guy Dumur in *Le Nouvel Observateur*, April 5, 1967, pp. 40-41.                         Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed       The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;      But then begins a journey in my head       To work my mind, when bodys works expird:      For then my thoughtsfrom far where I abide       Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,       And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,       Looking on darkness which the blind do see:       Save that my souls imaginary sight       Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,       Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,       Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.      Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,       For thee, and for myself no quiet find.              At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and rising in his stirrups he cried in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:    Arise, arise, Riders of Thoden!    Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!    Spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,    A sword-day, a red day, ere the sun rises!    Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!  With that he seized a great horn from Guthlf his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of Rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.     Ride now, ride now! Ride to Gondor!  Suddenly the king cried to Snowmane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the knights of his house, but he was ever before them. omer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the first ored roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Thoden could not be overtaken. Fey he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new fire in his veins, and he was borne up on Snowmane like a god of old, even as rome the Great in the battle of the Valar when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it shone like an image of the Sun, and the grass flamed into green about the white feet of his steed. For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.            *"If you started in the wrong way," I said in answer to the investigator's questions, "everything that happened would be a proof of the conspiracy against you. It would all be selfvalidating. You couldn't draw a breath without knowing it was part of the plot."*  *"So you think you know where madness lies?"*  *My answer was a convinced and heartfelt, "Yes."*  *"And you couldn't control it?"*  *"No I couldn't control it. If one began with fear and hate as the major premise, one would have to go on the conclusion."*  *"Would you be able," my wife asked, " to fix your attention on what The Tibetan Book of the Dead calls the Clear Light?"*  *I was doubtful.*  *"Would it keep the evil away, if you could hold it? Or would you not be able to hold it?"*  *I considered the question for some time. "Perhaps," I answered at last, "perhaps I could  but only if there were somebody there to tell me about the Clear Light. One couldn't do it by oneself. That's the point, I suppose, of the Tibetan ritual  somebody sitting there all the time and telling you what's what."*  [Aldous Huxley, 'Doors of Perception', 5758]   **I. General Introduction**   A psychedelic experience is a journey to new realms of consciousness. The scope and content of the experience is limitless, but its characteristic features are the transcendence of verbal concepts, of spacetime dimensions, and of the ego or identity. Such experiences of enlarged consciousness can occur in a variety of ways: sensory deprivation, yoga exercises, disciplined meditation, religious or aesthetic ecstasies, or spontaneously. Most recently they have become available to anyone through the ingestion of psychedelic drugs such as LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, etc. [This is the statement of an ideal, not an actual situation, in 1964. The psychedelic drugs are in the United States classified as "experimental" drugs. That is, they are not available on a prescription basis, but only to "qualified investigators." The Federal Food and Drug Administration has defined "qualified investigators" to mean psychiatrists working in a mental hospital setting, whose research is sponsored by either state or federal agencies.]  Of course, the drug dose does not produce the transcendent experience. It merely acts as a chemical key  it opens the mind, frees the nervous system of its ordinary patterns and structures. The nature of the experience depends almost entirely on set and setting. Set denotes the preparation of the individual, including his personality structure and his mood at the time. Setting is physical  the weather, the room's atmosphere; social  feelings of persons present towards one another; and cultural  prevailing views as to what is real. It is for this reason that manuals or guidebooks are necessary. Their purpose is to enable a person to understand the new realities of the expanded consciousness, to serve as road maps for new interior territories which modern science has made accessible.  Different explorers draw different maps. Other manuals are to be written based on different models  scientific, aesthetic, therapeutic. The Tibetan model, on which this manual is based, is designed to teach the person to direct and control awareness in such a way as to reach that level of understanding variously called liberation, illumination, or enlightenment. If the manual is read several times before a session is attempted, and if a trusted person is there to remind and refresh the memory of the voyager during the experience, the consciousness will be freed from the games which comprise "personality" and from positivenegative hallucinations which often accompany states of expanded awareness. The Tibetan Book of the Dead was called in its own language the Bardo Thodol, which means "Liberation by Hearing on the AfterDeath Plane." The book stresses over and over that the free consciousness has only to hear and remember the teachings in order to be liberated.  The Tibetan Book of the Dead is ostensibly a book describing the experiences to be expected at the moment of death, during an intermediate phase lasting fortynine (seven times seven) days, and during rebirth into another bodily frame. This however is merely the exoteric framework which the Tibetan Buddhists used to cloak their mystical teachings. The language and symbolism of death rituals of Bonism, the traditional preBuddhist Tibetan religion, were skillfully blended with Buddhist conceptions. The esoteric meaning, as it has been interpreted in this manual, is that it is death and rebirth that is described, not of the body. Lama Govinda indicates this clearly in his introduction when he writes: "It is a book for the living as well as the dying." The book's esoteric meaning is often concealed beneath many layers of symbolism. It was not intended for general reading. It was designed to be understood only by one who was to be initiated personally by a guru into the Buddhist mystical doctrines, into the premortemdeath rebirth experience. These doctrines have been kept a closely guarded secret for many centuries, for fear that naive or careless application would do harm. In translating such an esoteric text, therefore, there are two steps: one, the rendering of the original text into English; and two, the practical interpretation of the text for its uses. In publishing this practical interpretation for use in the psychedelic drug session, we are in a sense breaking with the tradition of secrecy and thus contravening the teachings of the lamagurus.  However, this step is justified on the grounds that the manual will not be understood by anyone who has not had a consciousnessexpanding experience and that there are signs that the lamas themselves, after their recent diaspora, wish to make their teachings available to a wider public.        Joyful to have      Such a human birth,      Difficult to find,      Free and well-favored.        But death is real,      Comes without warning.      This body      Will be a corpse.       Unalterable      Are the laws of karma;      Cause and effect      Cannot be escaped.        Samsara      Is an ocean of suffering,      Unendurable,      Unbearably intense.   ____________________           ^ ^1974 ^Vidyadhara ^Chgyam ^Trungpa            **forgive**, ***v.***    **Pronunciation**:  */fv/*  **Forms**:  Pa. tense **forgave** /fev/ .

 A few of my friends look at me like they're thinking "what the hell are you here for?" when I show up at their place when they said to.   All my music in my computers and phone came from my CD collection. It's not that I disagree with pirating music, but I prefer both having a copy I can lend friends, and a physical backup if my harddrives decide to give out for whatever reason.   I feel like all the posts here are from non-Canadians. Here's a short summary of stereotyped Canadian culture from my experience living here all my life:  Yes we're usually nice. No we don't apologize for everything.  Tim Hortons makes the worst cup of coffee in the country.  Maple syrup is amazing. This is a fact.  We don't say "aboot" we just talk faster than Americans.  Our military is small because no one doesn't like us.  Tim Hortons coffee again. Seriously, they could burn iced cappuccinos.   I love the groups that still try to make it not a race, with both sides working towards a massive brawl. Unfortunately, my battlegroup has a win ratio of 99:1 for alliance, whereas I play Forsaken warlock.  Edit: Alterac and Isle are the only battlegrounds Alliance has a chance at winning in this battlegroup, so the other battlegrounds are fun.   Not to one-up you, but I'd rather read *Mein Kampf* than play *any* FF game.   Doesn't matter what demograph you fall under, if you perpetuate a negative stereotype, I have nothing but negative thoughts about you.  Not to pick on anyone in particular, but I used to see a guy in a wheelchair daily around my former place of work. Panhandled every single day, finally I got fed up with him. I asked why he can't work.  "I'm in a wheelchair!"  "How are your hands? Do they function?"  "Yeah, sure!"  There you go.   I think she did a fantastic job with Christian Bale in American Hustle. I got into her character so much I didn't realize who the actress was until credits.   But it's background noise to put on Netflix at 2am, so there's that.   One of my closest friends is maybe 150 pounds, and eats half his weight in a week.   Sorry ladies, but we can't live without you. Even gay guys need women in their lives   Not exactly intentional, but the nature of the culinary field I'm in, you will cut yourself in the early years of training, without fail. We chalk it up as "war wounds" and "battle scars."   Same thing goes for military and security jobs; you signed up for it, now shut up and do your job.   We don't need to, it's rap.  There's my unpopular opinion.   A lot of jurisdictions toss it because there is always a margin of error in every case. There have been documented cases of death penalties given out, only to find out it was the wrong person.  Im curious to what opinion you have to make this a regular sentencing again.   Thank you! Trying to remember was bothering me.   I like A W over all the other brands, except maybe a very close tie with the brand that has a crow on it. Every time I visit the States, I load up on that stuff for the week or so I'm there.  Last time I saw it, Mennards had it on a pallet.   How do you watch any Christopher Walkin movie?   I did not know that. Still cool, still south!   Stunlocked for daaaays   Guilty of this. So much stereotyping of the south makes it hard, especially when NASA basically lives in Texas and Florida.   Does a handle designed to be pulled on the push side count?   My ex always carries an egg shaped stone around to help her anxiety. She knows damn well its just a rock, but its more of a safety blanket concept than magic.   Sometimes I randomly get a bad taste in my mouth and reflexively spit, but I try to check if anyone is around first.   Lottery: for people bad at math!   That reminds me to recycle the coke bottle I drank on the bus   Same mentality, but if looks could kill, I'd be dead every other week.   Most people don't even understand gun control.   What the hell kinda metalhead were you? All the ones I knew were jeans and band shirt types.   Went to high school with a guy that seemed to pull it off. He was tall, skinny but obvious that he worked out, and it fit his classic/hard rock interests and personality. He got glasses and it made him look hipster Rastafarian, but not really in a bad way.   Tesla died poor, you can thank him for your home electricity.  Also would like to add, a life and a job are separate, a life and a career are one. A career should reflect who you are, not the bills you need to pay.   If success is an account balance, society already failed.   I've caught myself doing this on a couple occasions, and its involved in political debates around the concept of separating religion and politics on a legal level. Making religious influence on politics barred comes up a lot in my circles, especially around topics of civil liberties.  Recently in the news, there's a athiest military pilot who is losing his contract soon because he won't make an oath to god. He has been willing to omit just the 4 or 5 words involving religion, but the U.S. Air Force is not moving on their position, and now face a civil rights lawsuit.   His career is his biggest joke.  Edit: so this is my new, most downvoted comment. Good, finally getting a reaction out of you guys. Even if that reaction is supporting a terrible "comedian."   I'll be the one Canadian to say it:  Poutine is trash. Waste of good fries. When you drown golden, crispy awesomesticks in gravy, and cheese curds *shudders*, all you get is an overpriced, soggy, disappointing meal. Might be better if any place can actually melt the cheese, or not use cheese curds (I really hate curds), but until that day, I'll take my money to buy a good plate of food, for probably cheaper.   Luckily you are not one of the three types of customers that need a slow, painful eradication;  One, the customer that literally can't shut up and let you work.  Two, the customer that barely acknowledges your existence, making it impossible to serve them.  Three, the customer that thinks "the customer is always right" justifies being a spineless piece of shit.  Everyone in customer service-like roles loves you!   Last time I went snowboarding, half the hill had some construction going on, but no one was checking to make sure the workers were staying in their area. Turns out they weren't, kicked up big rocks and shit, to be snowed over in a thin layer of white. So I go down the hill, hit one of the rocks. It knocks me over, I roll down into more rocks, nearly busting up my knee caps. If my aunt who was there wasn't a nurse, I probably would have gone to a hospital to see if theres any damage. I refuse to go down a hill again.   Being a shaman that wasnt created until well after ICC was released, I feel like I missed out on this sorta thing.  On the bright side my affliction warlock was unstoppable.   Soon, the blood of a virgin and your firstborn will be required.   Best click of my life!   When I was 12 the first artist I liked was Billy Joel, that evolved into Queen, The Beatles, Van Halen, Def Leppard, Stones, Iron Maiden, etc...  Lately I listen to a lot of Dire Straits and The Cure, throw in some European rock/metal.  Edit: thought I'd mention I'm 19 now.   Someone insert Lenny face for me please   I feel ya bud. Been doing it for years. It's not always weird or nothing to say.   Theres a joke here, somewhere...   Im guilty of this sometimes, but only because fuck you Adobe and your new "update" every week.   This is my mother, which blows my mind becauses shes been an accountant for 20 years, can use a calculator at light speed but can't type with even half her fingers.   Running the same instances over and over to level cap is the reason I don't level tanks or healers anymore. I recently leveled a Forsaken rogue 1-90 in 74 playing hours exclusively with quests, give or take an hour or two farming what few low level (or any level) Alliance still play on Area 52. I try to visit areas I haven't been through in a long time, which dramatically improves the leveling experience.  As for endgame, Cataclysm, while having a few cool raid mechanics in some fights, was largely unchallenging; Pandaria is faceroll. Nearly cleared Mogushan Vaults in first week of raiding in 2012, which prompted me to take a year and half hiatus from the game, before returning for PvP this spring. Flexible raiding does improve the raid scene, while LFR is pure cancer (I haven't had a group that could clear any raid in months). Unfortunately, Blizzard doesn't know what the game needs anymore, and is leaving LFR while removing Flex.  If anyone decides to want to try WoW again, I would highly recommend avoiding any raids and switching to ranked PvP. Yes, most people are idiots and will throw games. Join a good guild, get some gear, and do some arenas and rated battlegrounds. At first it will likely be easy as you climb the rsting ladders, but around 2000 or higher rating, you'll get stuck. And that's where the challenged and the fun begins.  TL:DR; stop raiding, start beating up players, the PvE community is for filthy casuals.   WoW. Yeah, I don't play that anymore... *cough*   When you have 1tb hdd available, why wouldnt you dump junk files cluttering ssd onto it?  I hear it constantly, "mechanical is so great you should ge-" no, go away. The clicking alone is reason not to get it. Then you have to press at least twice as far per keystroke. Thats wasted time.  	48
 This was excellent information. Thanks for your replies. If an experimentalist happens to read this please tell us of your experiences.   I'm interested in research as well. Though I can't say I would know what to expect. Should I be able to fit some time in for research one semester I will certainly do it. What was research like for you as an undergraduate?  	2

 Yep.  Right in the article:  Heres my idea for a slogan:  Tax the Rich and Save Social Security! No Cuts in Medicare! Make it for Everyone!    Discouraging bullying for gender identity is great.  Eliminating all forms and reasons for bullying would be even better.     [**fixed link**](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/tax-rich-patriotic-millionares-speak/story?id=13355208)   I remember hearing Japanese pronouncing Sacramento as Sacrament. Your explanation seems right.  They know, for example, that the English word is not guide-o and that the appended *o* is due to following Japanese rules.  In the case of Tront they've omitted not only the final *o* but have over-corrected to achieve *tr*.   We would only be renting and have no children.  We would only be using public transportation.  Are there any places in the hill country where we could meet a fair number of English speakers?   Thanks again.  Varanasi was one of the places I visited many years ago.  Mostly what I remember is the Ganges and the ghats,both the bathing ghats and the burning ghats.  Good luck with your research.   Thanks for the advice.  So having them on call means paying for their services when you use them, right?   My months in India confirm what you say about no in-between.    We have no expectations of Western standards.  What places in the northeast do you like?  Does Lucknow qualify? How about Ranchi?  I really loved Darjeeling but I wouldn't expect many English speakers there.   Thanks so much for a full response.  We appreciate all your tips.  You may be *hungry* but don't seem *foolish*.   Thanks.  As we have friends in Bangalore, that sounds like the best choice.  And we could do without air conditioning since the climate is moderate.     Thanks.  Are there plenty of English speakers in all those cities?  What's your main reason for saying South or West?   I recently had a couple of visits to my VA medical center and was handled at least as well as at my previous HMO.  Even asked about getting a future appointment moved up and they said come in tomorrow around 10am.  I showed up at 8:30 and was quickly registered.  Sure I waited for the procedure but I got out of there about 2pm after a CT scan and was happy with the whole procedure.  They were actually more efficient than the HMO but the HMO experience was years ago.   so that they can defend **against** it...  Right?   I had been having increasing lower back pain for a couple of months.  My physician did nothing except give the okay for me to take nightly ibuprofen and acetaminophen.  Spent $25 for a brief session with a chiropractor at my local gym and he relieved most of the pain in that session.  Probably the best $25 I ever spent.   The table is not intended to represent the true tax burden to either the corporation or the individual in the listed country.     These pieces are all worth reading but I found the one by Roger Schank especially compelling:   To learn to predict well, one needs to be educated about how to predict and one needs to make predictions and to examine what went wrong when those predictions fail. Curiously the schools teach none of this.  The idea that kids can make predictions is not a really radical point. My point is that prediction has to be the curriculum and not be ancillary to the curriculum.     Kale and chard are good too.  Tasting the greens is something to relish, not avoid.  Just go at it gradually.   If we really believed that accountability works, wouldn't we have accountability for all public servants? Why do we not require our legislators to make "Adequate Yearly Progress"? We have the data from their congressional districts, do we not? There is crime data, health care data, poverty figures, and drug use statistics for every state and federal legislative district. Why, exactly, do we not establish annual targets for our legislators to meet?   Excellent interview.    Thanks for the advice.   No offense taken.  Thanks for your perspective from the repair side.   Where in the world is killing a giraffe not like shooting fish in a barrel?   Yeah, I hadn't understood a triple entendre correctly.  Three-word pun it is.   A really old triple I enjoyed was the suggestion of what to call a cattle ranch that a man is setting up for his boys:  Focus.  (Where the sons raise meat.)   President Obama tells us that he's asked the Pentagon whether the conditions of confinement of Bradley Manning, the soldier charged with leaking state secrets, "are appropriate and are meeting our basic standards. They assure me that they are."   If Obama believes that, he'll believe anything. I would hope he would know better than to ask the perpetrators whether they've been behaving appropriately.  Even if you believe Manning deserves punishment, this is unconscionable.

Yeah, the yellow pins on your world map look like they're near AU/NZ but they don't indicate actual distances or travel time.  We had 3 months each in AU and NZ in 2007.  Well worth the time.  Especially NZ.  Their maps had scenic roads marked but I told them I would be better to mark unscenic roads since they only had a couple in the entire country.   Did you mean to skip New Zealand and Australia when  you were so close?   Not at all persuasive for me.  I found it superficial.   As far as I'm concerned it Ith'nt kuil.  Reminds me of the programming language APL -- so dense a person can't figure out their code an hour after they wrote it.   Put a half-gallon pitcher of water in the fridge with 3 or 4 herbal teabags in it.  (My favorites are licorice and spice.)  Just enough flavor and the cost is low.   I downloaded 5 in an unusable format, then corrected it for 6 and 7.  That's was a few months ago and now the site that worked before doesn't any longer.

Whether correct or not, both expressions are ambiguous, culturally if not linguistically.  Don't rely on either one.    Using these forms is as dangerous as saying 12 am or 12 pm.  People will misconstrue that -- say 12 noon or 12 midnight.   This is a poignant essay on acting, social roles, empathy and unbearable heaviness.  Recommended.   I found the emphasis to be more on the time it takes to arrive at forgiveness than whether to forgive at all.  Reminds me of hearing one of the South African members of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission saying that Americans are much too quick to offer what amounts to a shallow forgiveness.   Wow, we're all over the place with our comments here.  Connoisseurs recommending fine Scotch, two-buck Chuck fans, Miller Lite as a worthy purchase.  (As a drinker of stout, something like Miller Lite ranks with Kool-Aid.)  I remember reading some wine reviewer who said box wines were perfectly okay, just depending on what's in them, as is the same with bottles.  I asked my local Grocery Outlet to stock 5-liter Merlot or Cabernet Sauvignon.  Some while later I found a pallet of Almaden Shiraz for $5.99 a box.  Sorry to say I only bought 4 boxes because there hasn't been any more.  I should have bought the whole pallet.   How can you think critical thinking skills are exempt from genetic influence?   But while fertility is determined by culture, an individuals predisposition toward religion is likely to be influenced by genetics, in addition to their upbringing.  If there's a religiosity gene, maybe there's a gene that influences the desire for more children.   You've got some extra unnecessary redundancy there.   There are some issues that cross political boundaries -- accountability, transparency and oversight.  Even moderate Republicans can support some version of these.  The devil is in the details though, so they can be twisted into their evil twins -- bureaucracy, loss of control, nanny-state regulations.  We need to use framing and repetition to promote our version of those issues.  The right wing has mastered framing and repetition.  We should take a note from their play book.   who score high (5 out of 5**)** and low **(**1 out of 5)   You didn't read the article, did you?

It makes a case for your not giving up.  I hope you'll at least vote to keep it from being gutted.     Wondering whether it's in the US.  Can't imagine such a low salary for an 80-hour week here, even in North Dakota.   $1,000/mo. salary?!  Where is that?   It also works to just use Google -- "recipe ingredient-1 ingredient-2 ingredient-3."  We told a friend about a chard-fig smoothie and when she replied that she was more of a beef and chocolate person, I actually Googled "recipe beef chocolate" and got lots of hits.

Better put, I'm an adequatist.   The headline isn't the OP's, it's from the original article.   The real Dominant Paradigm -- the one held by the overwhelming majority of people on the planet -- is more decentralized and amorphous, yet is grounded in shared values that merit enunciation. These include: a belief in the virtues of community; a desire to be part of something greater than oneself; a reciprocal relationship with nature and life's essential resources; an aversion to open hostilities and devastating warfare; an interest in the wellbeing of others as a precondition of personal prosperity; an adherence to culturally-transcendent principles such as the Golden Rule; and a willingness to work hard in return for an equitable existence.   1. On the first legislative day of a new Congress, the Senate may, by majority vote, end a filibuster on a rules change and adopt new rules.  2. There should only be one opportunity to filibuster any given measure or nomination, so motions to proceed and motions to refer to conference should not be subject to filibuster.  3. Secret "holds" should be eliminated.  4. The amount of delay time after cloture is invoked on a bill should be reduced.  5. There should be no post-cloture debate on nominations.  6. Instead of requiring that those seeking to break a filibuster muster a specified number of votes, the burden should be shifted to require those filibustering to produce a specified number of votes to continue the filibuster.  7. Those waging a filibuster should be required to continuously hold the floor and debate.  8. Once all Senators have had a reasonable opportunity to express their views, every measure or nomination should be brought to a yes or no vote in a timely manner.   Thanks.

I'm hopeful that successes at lower levels could spread upwards.  Some years ago I read/heard an interview with a guy, I think Kalle Lasn of Adbusters, who had worked with anti-tobacco advertising that was successful in reducing the incidence of young people taking up smoking.  You may remember the ads with a cigarette that looked glamorous until it drooped in a display of impotence.  He wanted to do similar things with social issues but was prevented by the media's ability to deny advocacy advertising.  When the interviewer pointed out that even if he were allowed to create such ads, the money backing them would be a pittance against what the monied powers could amass.  Kalle (or whoever) replied that they didn't need to blanket the airways -- with just a foot in the door they could do serious damage to the conventional wisdom.   Myth 1: There are too many people  Myth 2: The poor are to blame  Myth 3: Slums are places of crime, violence and social degradation  Myth 4: Slums are an inevitable stage of development  Myth 5: The free market can end slums  Myth 6: International aid is the answer  Myth 7: There will always be slums   Myth 1: There are too many people  Myth 2: The poor are to blame  Myth 3: Slums are places of crime, violence and social degradation  Myth 4: Slums are an inevitable stage of development  Myth 5: The free market can end slums  Myth 6: International aid is the answer  Myth 7: There will always be slums   Many years ago I heard of a man who single-handedly killed a leopard.  I don't remember if there was any explanation of how he did it but the 'fact' of it was common knowledge among his coworkers.  Seems like a wolf would be easier because of lacking the raking ability of the hind claws.   Nope, California.   All I know is from spending 3 months there in 2007.  We paid way too much for internet time (5-10 NZ$ per hour).  But if you were there permanently you wouldn't have to pay by the hour.   A lot of you youngsters aren't nearly radical enough for me.  Quite a few of us senior citizens in my community are progressive.   I'm nave enough to think there are some cross-partisan issues that promise a broad appeal.  **Transparency, accountability, oversight.**  I realize the far right doesn't like these but they line up with notions we learned in Civics class about how democracy is supposed to work.    Voting reform is important and would increase the percentage of voters if they thought their vote made a difference.  [Range Voting](http://rangevoting.org/) has impressed me the best but almost any alternative to winner-take-all would be an improvement.  Changing the ability of media to deny advocacy advertising would open a wedge for some creative [culture jamming](http://www.adbusters.org/).  There would be plenty of opposition to these kinds of issues but at least they ought not to splinter any movement of ours internally.   Thanks for the mention of /r/neoprogs/.  I'm in.   a new country to fall in love with.  Easy to do in New Zealand.    Hear, hear!  I may be an old fart but I'm not in charge.  And don't forget that Sanders is no youngster, nor is Chomsky and even Kucinich just turned 64.  If we were in charge there would be a very different game.   In all the comments about moving, nobody has mentioned New Zealand.  Too far away?   Rationality, the idea that individual's purchase decisions are based on value or perceived value in a product, and that firms are motivated by profit-seeking is rarely far from the truth.   What do you think of behavioral economics?  I've only read Dan Ariely, Barry Schwartz, Richard Thaler and Cass Sunstein.  But they leave me persuaded that there's a lot more irrationality than you seem to think.   Nothing in the headline was just my opinion.  It's all from the article.   Robert Reich is a **political economist** and his article is titled **The Big Economic Story**.  So maybe there's some overlap between politics and economics.    We knew that, politically, once you get it into law, it becomes almost impossible to remove it. Thats not a bad legacy. The fact that we were able to lay the trap does feel pretty good, to tell you the truth.   Disgusting.    Unifying and simple, yes.  How about transparency, accountability and oversight?  These should have appeal across the spectrum.   On math as an art form, check out this [25-pg critique of traditional math instruction](http://www.maa.org/devlin/LockhartsLament.pdf).   Yeah, but I love that one anyway.   Including Swahili (actually **ananasi** since all Swahili syllables are open).   Chutney.   Anyone who thinks there is something beneficial in this vast disconnect between the fortunes of the American elite and those of the struggling masses is just silly. Its not even good for the elite.    This guy should be let loose on other subject areas.  Stultifying curricula are not confined to math instruction.

Maybe now would be a good time to pause and ask a straightforward question: are Americans O.K. with this?    Do these fit in here? -- months of the year in the modern calendar, days of the week.   About some doctors in the Nazi death camps:  They would do what they could to help, except for the most important thing of all, which is they wouldnt question the existence of the entire death camp itself. So they would find themselves working within the rules, however they could, to try to improve conditions marginally. And in retrospect, of course, thats just not sufficient. And as a longtime activist, I see myself and other activists doing the same thing, that what we do is we do everything that is allowed by those in power to attempt to stop their destruction. But the problem is, whenever we figure out a way to use their rules to actually stop them, they change the rules.    Hey, in 1968 I voted for Eldridge Cleaver.  And in 2008, Cynthia McKinney.  No turn to the right for me.   I'm one of those who thought so.  I also thought the country was too smart to elect Reagan president.  So now I'm one of the old generation.  Not all of us are in your way.   This is unconscionable:  Now they are using their political power and control over the media to attack Social Security.   This effort is being led by billionaire investment banker Peter Peterson. Mr. Peterson has personally profited to the tune of tens of millions of dollars from the "fund managers' tax subsidy," an obscure provision of the tax code that allows billionaires to pay a lower tax rate than schoolteachers and firefighters. However, Peterson believes in giving back. He has committed $1 billion to an effort that is intended to take away the Social Security benefits that people have worked and paid for.    It's worth reading all 20 of his points, not just #16 that all the comments mention so far.   You know this how?   I doubt xourtney meant **all** ladies.  I was reading what I assumed was her intent, rather than picking on her locution.   Absolutely we need broader cultural change, a paradigm shift. I wasn't looking for a magical solution.  Anyway, you don't think introducing it in middle school is a bad idea, do you?   The OP said *sometimes* so your fix didn't correct much.   Start introducing it in middle school.   One automaton, two automata, three automata, four...   My generation has devised a system in which one man can make enough money in a year to pay the salaries of every police officer, firefighter, and public school teacher in the city of Chicago, while paying a lower percentage in taxes than the people cleaning his offices. That's why many of you young people don't have a job.   No need to disdain the girl for saying no.     "some idea" != "exactly"   The Republicans have done their best to make this election about fear and hate. That is their brand of sand.  Democrats are cooperating nicely, by refusing to engage in a values debate.  The only question is, why?  For many people the answer is simple: voters don't really have a choice; the political process is nothing more than a Kabuki dance in which both sides represent corporate America and the uber-rich, while playing their respective roles in public.  That answer is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Believing it makes it so.  But even if it's true, we, the people are the only power capable of changing that reality. We can start by refusing to drink the sand.   Advanced internet for smartasses.   I'm in a hurry but thanks for fixing if.   Some of those dick flicks give me testosterone poisoning.

One of her traits was that she was extremely jealous.  She would scold anyone she thought was getting too much of my attention and even bite them if she could.  Since then I've thought that monkeys aren't very good pets.  Was Abu jealous?   For a religion that is pretty much free of greedy, powermad leaders, look at [Unitarianism](http://uua.org/).

Even if what you think is in no way under your control, I'm determined to be interested.   Man, what a lot of great advice here.  Follow even half of it and you'll be in good shape.  About starting young:  I once heard a comparison between someone who saves a fixed amount over a period of 30 years from the age of 35 until 65 vs someone who saves the same amount over an 11-year period from 19 to 35, and then keeps the money in investments.  At age 65 the early saver has about **twice** the amount as the late starter.  The distinction between needs and wants is critical.  Keep a list and when you see something you want, make it a point not to buy it right away but add it to the list and review and prioritize the whole list before buying anything big.  Make sure the list includes all the responsible stuff such as the 6-month or 12-month emergency fund.  When you're in a store being tempted by some shiny toy, take of picture of it.  You'll find an even more tempting toy soon -- take a picture of that too.  Soon you'll have a photo collection of ephemeral wants that will make you smile embarrassedly like reading your diary from third grade.    No one mentioned giving up A/C.  Even without reading the article you can see it's talking about "lavish use" and "reducing our dependence."   What's with the apostrophe in *'ya*?  It's in the poster caption too, but what's its purpose?  Is that the way Palinites spell it?   **semi**-monthly   and in r/business   More than my trimmed-down selection. :)   After decades of hyper-militant consumerism and its attending alienation, and a national consciousness spun from pure capitalist bullshit and mirrors, it is testimony to the American people that they can still see to piss straight, much less recognize any sort of truth whatsoever. Yet, a portion of Americans are beginning to grasp the truth about what has happened to their country -- that it has been bought and paid for by an elite class in a nation that is supposed to be classless.   The ruling class holds all the money, not to mention the media that informs the populace as to what is going on in our country. It controls our health care, our banking and retirement funds. It controls our education or lack of education, and it controls the price, quantity and quality of the food we eat. It controls the quality of the air we breathe, and soon, through pollution credits, even the price they will pay for that air. Most importantly, it holds concentrated legal and governmental authority, not to mention the machinery of both parties to grant itself more authority.   We no longer take effective action, because it has become impossible to identify what we might do to change anything. Instead, we react to events. That is what the ruling class wants, because if we are reactive, then outcomes can be controlled by controlling the stimuli.   You never hear them say it, but neo-conservatives understand that they have a mean streak down inside. They also know if they want to share in the national plunder, they must win hearts and minds. They must look pious and sound right while lying through their teeth and picking our pockets. In other words, they have an astute grasp of American politics and business -- which are the same thing, of course.   I have seldom met an American who understood how the ruling class got so rich. Simply put, it was through constant cultivation of bigger and more labyrinthine government, creating legal and technical complexities to sluice money nationally and globally in their direction, and to cover their asses in the process.   America has always had a ruling class, and it has always bullshitted the world that it doesn't. But at least the ruling class of the past was interesting and varied, because diverse sorts of Americans were getting rich.   Nobody in Washington disputed the ruling class's right to dictate policy. After all, the political class agreed with the ruling class's major premise: The public does not know shit, never has, never will.   Both parties forced banks to make high rate home loans to people who people who did not qualify, because the inflated home values during the expanding bubble would make billions for big investors who knew when to get out. Should they stay too long at the fair and go bust, they would set up the howl of "too big to fail."   This political class stands between all of us down here and the tiny minority in the ruling class waaaaaay up there, wherever the hell up there is. No use to squint. You can't see it from where we are. That comes in mighty handy in denying the existence of a ruling class.   Reaching out to independents or "moderate" Republicans couldn't hurt though, huh?   Thanks, I'll check it out.   All I've read so far is the talk by Jonathan Haidt.  I found it to be outstanding and it makes me want to read all the others.   Redditculous.   If war were undisguisedly as nasty and brutish as it truly is, it might also tend to be short.  Soldiers freed from illusions might mutiny, as many did in Vietnam, or desert and go home.  But this modern, cushier kind of pseudo-war is different.     The odd thing is that no one seems to question the relative cushiness of this life at war (nor the inequity of the hardscrabble civilian life left behind) -- least of all those best able to observe firsthand the contrast between our garrisons and the humble equipment and living conditions of Afghans, both friend and foe.  Rather, the contrast seems to inspire many soldiers with renewed appreciation of "our American way of life" and a determination to "do good things" for the Afghan people, just as many feel they did for the people of Iraq.     Most infantry missions are "presence patrols," described by one officer as "walking around in places where we won't get shot at just to show the Afs [Afghans] that we're keeping them safe."     In a typical mess-up on the actual terrain of Afghanistan, Army experts previously in charge of this base had already had a million-dollar suspension bridge built over a river some distance away, but hadn't thought to secure land rights, so no road leads to it.  Now the local American agriculture specialist wants to introduce alfalfa to these waterless, rocky mountains to feed herds of cattle principally pastured in his mind.   This is a wonderful blend of personal insight and a survey of some of the psychological and neurological issues.   Let's see your rote but right answer.   Over and over again, no?   Babette's Feast   Jean de Florette   Manon of the Spring   La gloire de mon pre (My Father's Glory)   Le chteau de ma mere (My Mother's Castle)   "...look **good** on a small screen."  See [Good vs. Well](http://data.grammarbook.com/blog/adjectives-adverbs/good-v-well/). );   That's one theory but not the likeliest one.  There are [others](http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=20000913).   It would appear that this applies to politicians pretty much all the time.   I don't care if you went into a stall just to spread disinfectant on your hands -- when you come out of a stall, ffs wash your hands.  The symbolism of the thing is as important as the real health aspect.  I wouldn't want your shoe on my dining table even if it's brand new out of the box and has been disinfected.   time appears to be running out on monoculture and many other standard practices of agribusiness, just as it is on so many of the thoughtless ways the civilized world does business. One clue to this: When a problem arises, we fight back with more of the same, except in higher - more lethal - doses. Indeed, that impulse, to *fight back*, to turn everything into a war, rather than to study, ponder and revere our obstacles, is the ultimate manifestation of our unawareness.   How about making all error messages selectable so the user can do a cut-and-past with them?   You appreciate being able to help others -- wouldn't some of your friends appreciate hearing about your dark thoughts?  Could you try it with one of them who is most likely to listen without trying to fix anything?    Maybe it doesn't help to remind yourself that you're denying others the very thing you like to provide for them.  But a two-way would likely be more deeply satisfying than a one-way.  	149
 I know a couple games that we have done before.   The first is beer dodgeball, which could be it's own event all together. It's played like regular dodgeball but when you get hit, you have to chug a beer in order to get back in. Once you've finished the beer you are allowed to continue playing. Once you throw up, you're out. Great way to get really drunk.   The second game isn't so much a game but it could be made into one, Dunk-a-Roos. You fill a trash can with water and ice. Next you get a beer ready to shotgun. Then you dunk you're head in the water for 10-20 seconds. Then you shotgun you're beer. Like I said not really a game but it's an awesome thing to do especially on a hot day when your fraternity is having a day party. For an added thrill, have some brother hold your feet up when you dunk your head in like a keg stand.   	1
 Best: Lighting JR on fire during their interview  https://juicemakesugar.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/kanejrfire.gif   But reasoning changes and they can very well change their minds on certain talents that they have previously said no to.  They can also bring in older guys like they have with Rhyno or Kendrick to give a little boost to the star power there and give these up and comers established wrestlers to work with.   "It's time to clean the plates!"   What am I supposed to be looking for?  Every match listed [was announced last night](/spoiler)   By bringing in more big named indie talents to have those names as well as the normal development guys.  They have people like Uhaa Nation, Samoa Joe, etc coming in   True... the right mix of main roster and NXT women's wrestlers will make for an amazing match.     Actually Naomi, Nikki, and Alicia Fox are all good in the ring.  They just get put with others that aren't as good which holds them back.   It is meant to be that they are going to go for a back body drop    I care   I get why they let him go,  but ken Anderson   Because they stopped him wrestling   Like the hhh trunks or the scsa ones   It's not a myth but it's not super common knowledge   Yup Patterson put it right in that son of a plumber's pooper   But it's THE MOST ELECTRIFYING MOVE IN AAAAAAALLLLLLL OF ENTERTAINMENT!   Vince and Pat Patterson used to spit roast Dusty Rhodes   Wow! Dick much?   Except for Cena if I'm not mistaken   Some say Puppet H is hitting it on Road Dogg to this day   That's not what I meant by protected.  I meant it's protected in that it is rarely kicked out of, with the exception of big matches (i.e. Taker at Wrestlemania matches)   Tombstone, Stone Cold Stunner, Rock Bottom.  Pretty much moves that only get kicked out of in big time matches   That is all this guy does when he posts and comments   You're an idiot... they are putting these guys in competitive matches with cena that showcase them and that they can hang with the top guy in the company.  You don't have to lose to someone to put them over.  Yes it can be done that way but it's not the only way.  But I don't expect you to take anything anyone says as legit unless they 100% agree with what you are saying so I guess I am wasting my time on a lost cause that is you.   Cum on Nicki!   Lobster Head!   Replace Sheamus with Neville   http://i.qkme.me/2she.jpg   I like how I get downvoted for enjoying a joke.  Sorry I'm not a puppet like y'all   Nice.. you get my upvote good sir   Yeah Jarret started fucking Angle's wife (well ex I believe at the time) and then they turned it into a storyline in TNA and they got married irl   This is legit the one thing that I had missed last night that I wanted to see... thank you   aka a "Gassy Canadian"   Because it's TNA and they are a sinking ship.  They are just falling hard.  And now there is GFW which has grabbed guys like Sanada and they are on the fast track to being better than TNA in terms of a company that is run well and in having a better product.   RIP you fat greasy mustard tiger   I knew, when this happened, that it wouldn't be long till someone did a Brazzers meme/gif/picture of it.

The set up is never believable in that his opponents would never irl just sit in that position long enough for him to set up and hit it.    I like how you just make up some bs about him being put in a comic tag team.   You have no clue what will happen with his character so stop jumping to conclusions   I was a fan before that... a Rosebud Hipster so to speak lol   "WHAT THE FUCK IS A HI-DIDDLY-DO!"  "NED FLANDERS IS YOUR HOOKUP, HOLLAR IF YA HEAR ME!"   Between injuries and being at times too outspoken I think they feel they may not be able to rely on him.  And I wouldn't say he is excellent in the ring.  He is good, but not excellent.  He can sell very well which he has going for him.   I never said anything about wwe being better or tna's being better.   Tna women's wrestlers could be the best in the world,  but if they aren't given the chance to go out there and give it their all then it doesn't matter if they are there.    It's supposed to be a play on tna changing people's names when they come in.   so William pumpkin smasher is Billy Corgan of the smashing pumpkins who is now doing creative   [This](http://tinyurl.com/le6hatd)   And God said unto Abraham, you shalt kill your son Isaac.

That is thriving.  Reigns won the Rumble and faced Lesnar for the title at Mania and is still in the title picture.  That is thriving.  Rusev had an extremely long undefeated streak and held the US title and is having matches with the top dog of the company.  That is thriving.   It was intended to be because he was bad mouthing the authority and so they were cutting his microphone to stifle him   So the fact that we have so many talents from NXT thriving on the main roster means nothing?    	102
 R/news banned me for what was supposed to be a 1 month suspension but has since become a perpetual suspension,  without any notification or reason,  other than only the mod that banned you can unban you. This ban came suddenly after I complained about Bipolarbear0's censorship directly to the mods of r/news.  I complained about Bipolarbear0 to the mods of r/news and the next time I posted an article about Israel/Palestine I was banned for posting opinion/analysis pieces. Pretty fucked up, you can't complain about the mods without being banned.   This post is complete bullshit.  How the fuck is this at the top of the page ? I see a lot of people complaining about the decline of this sub over the last few months but this post really underlines it. How the fuck can this guy liken a Jewish banking conspiracy to aliens or reptilians ? Its as if the Rothschild dynasty never occurred,  look at the Board of Governors for the Federal Reserve for Christ's sake. This has to be the shittiest meme I've ever seen on here, and it's completely antithetical to what this sub stands for,  it completely disparages us Free Thinkers,  and yet there it is at the top of the page, mocking us. This post is above the 1 about Michael Hastings,  a real life conspiracy involving government assassination programs. I think this sub has been too badly compromised, its a shell of what it once was. Aliens, what nonsense.  I like my conspiracy theories how I like my data storage,  terrestrial,  fuck the cloud and fuck this meme.    Thank you, and yes I do feel like an idiot right now.    The whole time Rick was tussling with that guy in the bathroom I couldn't help but think think:  'How do the other guys not here them up there breaking things and what not ? '    So you just directly contradicted yourself, 1st you said:  "They would have to already be monopolies in their current areas for your claim to be true."  Then you said:  "So then my point stands, they are already currently in a monopoly in your area."  WTF ?  Cognitive dissonance much ?    See, if you look at the drug war from a purely economic point of view, the role of the government is to protect the drug cartel. That's literally true.    Milton Friedman   I believe it, it's obscene how much clout Comcast has, I'm typing this from Center City Philadelphia, so I'm literally in the shadow of the Comcast Building/Comcast HQ. No one knows better than Philadelphians how badly Comcast fucks you every month, leaving you butthurt well into the next billing cycle.   I pay $170/month for Internet, Cable and phone, and in return get the worst customer service ever and zero choice in subscribers. I've been talking about getting all of my entertainment from the internet for a long time but I haven't been able to effectively cut the cord. This merger has provided me the impetus to strike a symbolic blow against Comcast and sever the cord that has bound me to this monopolistic industry for far to long.   What is so wrong about choice in a supposed free market ? What Comcast is doing is comparable to a corporation like Google, stopping Yahoo from allowing their service to be provided to entire regions, imagine that for a moment. Imagine if you lived in California you could choose between a Google or Yahoo search, but your friend in Seattle having to use Bing, because Bill Gates has got it like that in Washington state.   TL?DR? Fuck Comcast. They are the Rockefeller, Standard Oil of the 21st century.    He came it out of fucking nowhere and said that I, and Salon should be banned from r/conspiracy, with his fucking 2 day old, shill account. He just hijacked/derailed a thread of mine on r/politics, like literally within minutes of having commented on this article. I normally don't feed the trolls like that, but when a 2 day old account is calling for bans and censorship on r/conspiracy, who among us as an un-indoctrinated, free thinker can resist exposing them ?     Do what you want, take it up with the mods, IDK, more importantly you're a terrible Reddit commentator, please stop commenting on my submissions, you've totally hijacked/derailed this thread. Congratufuckinglations.    The mods.   They will ban you if you flood new posts queue.    I'm allowed to post twice an hour, what the fuck is YOUR problem. This is the second time you've commented on 1 of my posts in 5 minutes and the 1st one was about how I, and Salon should both be banned from r/conspiracy. Looking for it now to copy   paste ... and you've deleted that comment because I exposed you as only having an account for 2 days. Thanks for your contribution to Reddit, u/-moose, "redditor for 2 days" /s.    "redditor for 2 days"  Really ? Thanks for the censorship suggestion Newbie. This is an important issue. Also I've posted more prescient content on r/conspiracy than your average free thinker, and anyone who's been on r/conspiracy longer than 2 days can confirm this.    NOOICE!    Alright, I'll just delete it then.     Gee, I don't know ?  Maybe because Obama didn't condone or endorse slavery, the article isn't about slavery and it has nothing to do with the subject.   So the fact that they are both Presidents isn't a factor at all ? Because it seems like most people would see the correlation immediately, but it appears to be lost on you.   Yes, he owned slaves, is that the first thing you go to whenever someone brings up any of the Founders ?   Seems like a pretty lazy observation to me, and one that completely misses the point of the comment.   Why don't you go point out the fact that George Washington owned slaves to more people on Reddit, I'm sure no one knows about it, /s. I'm through feeding the trolls for one evening.    How is that relevant ?    Ok, apparently he didn't say that. George Washington did say this though:  Make the most of the Indian hemp seed, and sow it everywhere!   George Washington  Both of them did grow hemp as well. It's disappointing that Jefferson didn't say that though, I've cited that quite a lot over the years.   http://blog.constitutioncenter.org/2012/11/busting-some-myths-about-the-founding-fathers-and-marijuana/   Some of my finest hours have been spent on my back veranda, smoking hemp and observing as far as my eye can see.    Thomas Jefferson   One of the saddest lessons of history is this: If weve been bamboozled long enough, we tend to reject any evidence of the bamboozle. Were no longer interested in finding out the truth. The bamboozle has captured us. Its simply too painful to acknowledge, even to ourselves, that weve been taken. Once you give a charlatan power over you, you almost never get it back.    Carl Sagan, The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark   Herb is the healing of a nation, alcohol is the destruction.    Bob Marley   Okay, I deleted my post   used the link you provided. Thank you for linking to it.    Its called intelligence.   Dolphins have a huge cerebral cortex and a complex language.   I also don't eat pork,not for any sort of weird religious reason, but because pigs are much more intelligent than other livestock.    Any one of the Too Big To Fail Banks. JpMorganChase, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Wells Fargo etc., pick your poison America, and drink deeply. Taste that ? Its called capitalism.    James Corbett, of the Corbett Report and CorbettReport.com   I consider James Corbett to be the antidote to Alex Jones.   In these crazy times, it would appear that the only person we can trust as a news source is a Canadian, English professor,  living in the sunny climbs of Western Japan, who distributes his alternative news for very little,  if any profit.    You hear that ?   That was the sound of you nailing it.   When I sold weed in high school it was exactly for this reason. I would spend approximately $60 a week on bud on average and by selling weed I simply opted to smoke my profit. I would literally burn the potential 3 or 4 grams of profitable of buds. I basically looked at it like a slice saved is a slice earned, and then immediately thereafter burned.    So it's all out in the open now ...    I can't believe there isn't more of an effort in Japan to stop these atrocities. There's no doubt that watching the documentary film, The Cove, will make you form some opinions about the Japanese. I can't imagine why the Japanese government wouldn't want to improve Japan's image with respect to whaling and dolphin hunting. The way I see it, the Japanese and Chinese are driving all of Earth's most stunning and intelligent creatures to extinction; purely to satiate their own savage barbarism. There isn't anything racist about it, it's a fact. It used to be the Europeans, then it was briefly America and for the last 30 or 40 years China and Japan are providing the largest markets for endangered species. Prove me wrong Japanese and Chinese users of Reddit.    Indian here, can confirm blatant racism from US military and the families of US military. It's not appreciated. Those idiots in the comedy club only condone that meat-head vet's behavior. Yes, I understand that the comedian and the vet made up afterwards and I'm sure they had a touching, interracial interaction that warms the heart. However, it does nothing for people that have had to deal with institutionalized racism coming from the US military and it being widely condoned throughout American culture.   You could take the most liberal, white guy from California and if a US soldier was being racist to an Indian guy at a gas station calling him Osama or some of the other favorites, sandnigger or camel-jockey and the liberal white guy would go:  "HA HA HA ! FUCK THAT GUY ! RIGHT ? YEA ! 'MERICA !"  Just to appease some sort of societal expectation of patriotism. My generation is so brainwashed in this pro-war mindset, it's really sad. I was thinking about it this past weekend watching the pre-game military ritual's before kickoff in the NFL. The overt militarism, the blind loyalty. Also, not for nothing there are more than 1.3 billion Indian people on Earth, we literally comprise 1/6 of humans. So you come as pretty fucking ignorant when you just come out and accuse all brown people of  being terrorists. Again, yes I'm aware that the vet was joking, but just imagine if someone in the audience who was white made a similar joke about a black comedian with respect to lynching ?   BTW, I welcome the downvotes, butthurt military members and family of military members. Don't take your overt hypocrisy in condoning racism against Indian people and blasting racism in any other situation, out on me.    This is a very interesting story. The FBI certainly appears to be keen to tie up what could be perceived as any loose ends in relation to the Tsarnaev brothers. I wonder what it is this man knew that made the FBI torture him like that. Also how fucked is it for the parents to have to make the world view these painful, private photos; just to find out the truth.   "redditor for 16 minutes"  JIDF,  please go away. Has posted two comments,  both perpetuating pro-Israel propaganda and Hasbara talking points.    Rubber Bullet fired from gun  Rock thrown by hand   Just for the record.   Unless this is now up for debate as well.     He said without a hint of irony.    "redditor for 3 days"  JIDF, please go away.    Headline:  Israeli students to get $2,000 to spread state propaganda on Facebook  http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/israeli-students-get-2000-spread-state-propaganda-facebook  That was easy.   http://www.thejidf.org/2010/06/volunteer-get-involved-help-support.html  http://www.hasbarafellowships.org/about-us/employment-opportunities  Try Google searching JIDF or Hasbara, but in your defense it did take me almost 30 seconds to find those sign-up/recruitment pages.    The US exposes AMERICANS to AMERICAN propaganda, the ISRAELI'S expose AMERICANS to ISRAELI PROPAGANDA, see the difference ? Or are you being paid to see the difference, and simply ignore it ?    Because the US exposes its own American citizens to American propaganda, Israel exposes American citizens to propaganda to get Americans to dislike countries in the Middle East; with the end result being the US sending Americans into the Middle East to fight and die in wars for Israel's interests. Israel is manipulating America into fighting its wars, and now they want to America to go into Syria and Iran for them. If Israel is so hellbent on restoring Greater Israel, then they should do their own dirty work. It's as simple as that, there's no Palestinian or Iranian equivalent of JIDF or Hasbara.    Maybe it's because there's no Arab equivalent of JIDF, there's just human beings out there that are sympathetic to the plight of the Palestinian people. The Palestinians are poor and impoverished, they are more focused on getting fuel,food and medical supplies past the Israeli blockade; they don't have the luxury of a paid Internet army of shills to astroturf, lie, shill and inundate the Internet with their propaganda. No country exposes another nations citizenry to such subversive propaganda.    So do you have to use a time-card to punch in for your JIDF job, or are you salary ? Does Israel give you health benefits to shill for them too ? Or are you just getting college credit to post your pro-Israel propaganda here ? People peruse the pages of Reddit as a recreational activity, not to be indoctrinated with pro-Israel propaganda. How many of these JIDF shills are there on this sub ? Keep on using your pro-Israel propaganda to justify your land grab. I try not to get in the habit of feeding the JIDF trolls, so I'm going to stop engaging with you seeing as how you're probably benefiting from the replies in some sort of bizarre JIDF, propaganda troll quota system. Here's some more links on Israel's Hasbara/JIDF propaganda program, and how it's used to manipulate American users of websites like Reddit:   http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/01/23/293836/-Israeli-Hasbara-Information-or-Propaganda-w-poll  http://972mag.com/israeli-universities-becoming-hasbara-mills/38929/  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Internet_Defense_Force  Wake up from your slumber Reddit, you are being barraged with propaganda courtesy of the Israeli Hasbara/JIDF program.   So far this thread is entirely comprised of JIDF trolls engaging in a pro-Israel circlejerk. I think Hasbara might be laying it on a little to heavy-handed, the propaganda is palpable to even the most casual of observers.    JIDF, please go away, get a real job. Do an honest day's work instead of subverting online political discourse with your shilling and lies. A quick scroll through your post history shows all you do is post pro-Israel propaganda on behalf of the Israeli government. This blatant propaganda being plastered all over Reddit is sickening. Here are some links proving how Israel is using JIDF trolls like /u/GeneralMunro to manipulate Americans into thinking other Americans have strong pro-Israel views:  http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/  http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/14/israel-pay-students-propaganda_n_3755782.html  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/students-offered-grants-if-they-tweet-proisraeli-propaganda-8760142.html  Don't fall for these JIDF shills. /u/generalmunro is at work right now for the Israeli government or some Israeli special interest group, and if you fall for his propaganda you are being worked. I'm sure /u/rosinthebow will be along shortly to defend his JIDF brethren, him and a bunch of other JIDF, pro-Israel propaganda agents. They could all be the same person for all we know, logging in and out of different accounts, it's pretty messed up. No other country subjects another country's citizens to internet propaganda via shills and astroturfing the way that Israel manipulates Americans.    I'm in, please mods, ban these trolls, a lot of these accounts strike me as JIDF at a casual glance. Anyone who unduly accuses someone of antisemitism to stifle conversation, critical of Israel should be banned. It's such an obvious subversion of the 1st rule of /r/conspiracy. All of a sudden you go from discussing the plight of the Palestinian people, to defending your credibility as an objective interpreter of events is Israel.    Why did we wait this long to make /u/axolotl_peyotl a moderator ? This should be at the top of the page of this sub and /r/politics, assuming counterpunch.com is even a domain that is allowed to be posted there.    Meanwhile, I was found ineligible for the ARD program which means that my 2012 misdemeanor marijuana possession conviction can never be expunged, and will remain on record in perpetuity.    Human error,  my bad.     Yea they do it to their own countries population,  they don't get on popular US forums for political discourse online to manipulate US foreign policy. China and America use propaganda to pacify their own citizenry,  Israel uses propaganda on Americans to sway public opinion on nations in the Middle East unfriendly to Israel.  AIPAC for instance lobbied Congress to go to war in Iraq, because it fits into a larger Israeli plan to destabilize the region. There's a big difference,  Israel is and has been attempting to control US foreign policy in the Middle East since its creation. If Israel has such a problem with Iran then they should handle that situation themselves,  instead they want Americans to go to Iran to die,  and murder innocent Iranian people. Israel should fight their own wars, or simply STFU.    You should change the part about the Federal Reserve to being aware that it is a privately owned banking cartel, operating for a profit for the same 7 families that have owned a stake in it these last 100 years.     Anything and everything Israel related gets met with an organized group of JIDF agents, acting in concert across /r/news, /r/politics, /r/worldnews, /r/conspiracy and of course the infamous /r/conspiratard trolls.  I started my Reddit career on /r/conspiracy this past February and have since moved on to posting in the larger subs, only to be met with an incredibly organized downvote brigade immediately after each Israel/zionism related post goes up. I'll literally have my lone upvote and 2 or 3 downvotes In a matter of seconds, its very frustrating. I can't get anywhere on those subs and am thinking about giving this sub the majority of my attention again. Also there's the fact that /r/news and /r/politics moderators hassle me daily, I've been banned and unbanned from /r/politics twice in the last month and am getting pretty tired of explaining to them how the AMERICAN Studies Association academic boycott of Israel is in fact US politics my eyes are going to pop out of my head,  the willing cognitive dissonance on behalf of those moderators is really unbelievable.    The JIDF is strong in this one.     JIDF ACTIVATE : FORM OF: AN ICE MENORAH !    It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.   - Henry Ford   ok, I'll change it.    Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs... Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home    Mahatma Gandhi   Ah yes the familiar ad hominem attack,  so we've reached this point in the dance.    Its referred to as a labor of love here in America,  keep your unnecessary u's in Israel you JIDF shill.     /m/todayIlearned83 told me that more than half of the article is pulled from other articles so despite being from a reputable website like BusinessInsider and being atop the page and having over 150 comment my post has been deemed Rehosted Content and will remain removed from /r/politics,  oh well back to the anarchy board.     What the fuck.   This article makes my brown skin hurt.    UPDATE: /m/ todayIlearned83 told me that he made an error amd actually he meant to remove my post because it was Rehosted Content.  Apparently it pulled quotes from to many sources for 1 article.  WUT ? I also smell bullshit,  it was on the top of the fucking page,  let it stay up there, it was killing,  I appealed and I'll keep you guys posted,  I'm waiting on a response I was pretty diplomatic so IDK we'll see ?    This is the problem with Reddit, this is not a conspiracy,  this is a well known tragedy,  not a conspiracy.  Yes Jewish people turned the Palestinians into refugees and 2nd class citizens on their own land. If Jewish people have a problem with this they should stop being the most racist group of people on Earth and learn to live amongst the Palestinians peacefully. What kills me is that in America,  England and Canada Jewish people aren't even openly acknowledged as some of the most racist people, and somehow if you bring up their racism and how systemic apartheid is in Israel you are accused of being an antisemitic, racist, without a hint of irony.    I feel bad for you.     Yea, or at the top at the page. Can we have MORE picture plus 1 sentence political or social statement circle-jerks on this sub ? /s     I wasn't warned,  you're supposed to be given a warning,  I was just banned,  WTF ?!    Well Canada isn't doing it's best to send Canadian dual citizens to England to influence British foreign policy, there is no "Canadian lobby" in England; there to vote for increased Western intervention in the Middle East. America happens to have a great deal of politicians that are Jewish and therefore sympathetic to Israeli interests, coincidentally those same Jewish politicians always tend to vote in favor of bombing the hell out of other countries in the Middle East that doesn't approve of Israel. There is no Canadian equivalent of AIPAC, which tries to do its best to send young Americans off to the Middle East to fight for Israel's interests,  and at every opportunity they used their influence to put the United States on an inexorable path towards war with Iran. AIPAC, just recently put pressure on Congress and Obama to invade Syria of all places, Israel and these Israel 1st politicians just want America to do their dirty work. So now we want to put a self-admitted Zionist, Israeli dual-citizen in the 2nd most important position in terms of US finance ? That is absolutely ridiculous, it's to much of a conflict of interests. Moreover, this appointment would mean that they could not find an able economist throughout the United States to fill this position, which is something that is also ludicrous, and we need this financial wizard from Israel to come here and fix all of our monetary issues is preposterous. Also, how can you possibly compare a Canadian dual citizen, coming from Canada, a nation that isn't known for its controversial foreign policy, and also hasn't been overseeing an ongoing humanitarian disaster for the last 60+ years the way Israel has. I can't think of anytime Canada lobbied America and England to begin bombing a country in the Middle East because they didn't want to do their own dirty work. Israel is infiltrating US foreign policy at every level to ensure their own dominance in the Middle East. A quick look at the Bush Administration cabinet reveals how many of them were Israeli dual citizens, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Pearl etc., and sure enough they had a hostile foreign policy towards nations in the Middle East. In addition really, how the fuck can anyone compare Canada and Israel, Canadians are peaceful, and Israelis, are well, from what I can tell for the most part some of the most racist people on Earth. In Israel, racism is institutional, its taught to  Israeli children in their apartheid education system, children are taught from a young age that Palestinians are subhuman. Canadians hate American warmongering in the Middle East, Israeli's encourage it at every opportunity, and Zionist American politicians quite literally bankroll politicians that they know will vote in favor of US military intervention in the Middle East to strengthen Israel's interests in the region, which consist mostly of destabilizing the region. Also not for nothing, Jewish people make up just 2% of the United States population and 10% of the US Senate, an over representation in the Senate compared to their percentage of US population, a ratio that hasn't been replicated by any other minority in America.   http://www.politico.com/politico44/2013/11/aipac-urges-new-iran-sanctions-178352.html  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/14/aipac-syria_n_3923483.html  http://972mag.com/blame-israel-and-aipac-for-a-u-s-war-in-iran/48652/  http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.546315  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews_and_politics_in_the_United_States  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jewish_American_politicians  http://www.ronpaulforums.com/showthread.php?377478-List-of-Politicians-with-Israeli-Dual-Citizenship   /u/nesckthe44 and /u/rosinthebow are paid JIDF shills by the Israeli government, a quick glance at their post history proves as such. Palestine has no such organization as they absolutely do not have the resources and are more worried trying to get building supplies, food, water, and vital medicine into Gaza through the Israeli blockade.   http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/08/14/israel-students-social-media/2651715/  http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/08/14/israel-pay-students-propaganda_n_3755782.html  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/students-offered-grants-if-they-tweet-proisraeli-propaganda-8760142.html   Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs... Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home    Mahatma Gandhi   Ad hominem attack much ?    Why don't you go have a circlejerk about my account in /r/conspiratard then, you do regularly comment there after all. /r/conspiratard is infested with JIDF scum, which I suppose is the reason you're so at home there.   Say what you want to about my account, but at least I am not being given college credit or paid by some shady Pro-Israel PR firm to espouse my beliefs on the occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza. I am doing this 100% free, someone has to give the impoverished Palestinians some Internet representation. Besides I don't like to make it to easy for you JIDF shills to collect your collegiate credit or shekels or whatever the hell they pay you guys with.   As always, Free Palestine. That is all.    You jest, but those types of comments are exactly what cause posts like mine to be removed. If you were being sarcastic then you should have marked /s after your comment. How is anyone supposed to know you're joking, but then the entire post gets removed because of your complacency. The majority of the time that Jewish people make racist jokes on Reddit about themselves they don't identify themselves as being part of the tribe, and the entire post subsequently is removed. In addition, judging by the content that I post about Israel, one could easily understand how a sympathizer of Israel is pleased with the end result my post critical of Israel being removed. Every time you make a racist joke about Jewish without self identifying as a Jewish person I will report your comment, because by not commenting sarcastically you're painting all critics of Israel and the people that have upvoted my post as racist, anti-semites. Please try to pay attention or I will report your post for racism, indicate your sarcasm with an /s or identify as Jewish person, if you don't you make us look bad, which I imagine would align with your interests quite nicely.    I did not post this article to promote anti-semitic tropes sir. I'd encourage you not to engage in any racism on this thread as I do not condone racism in any way shape or form and shame on you for so blatantly lowering the level of discourse on this thread. I don't comment often, I'm more of a poster but I will not tolerate my posts becoming a forum for minority bashing. I am Indian, and there are as many Indian people in New York City and comparable numbers of Indian people in New York state as there are Jewish people, are you going to make some sort of taxi driver/curry joke about New York now ? What nonsense. I am reporting your comment, and will continue to do so in the future where I see fit. Take your hatred to a more close-minded sub.   No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin, or his background, or his religion. People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.   Nelson Mandela, Long Walk to Freedom   He said without a hint or irony.    James Corbett is an incomparable source of information, he is truly the antidote for Alex Jones.   If Corbett had as many listeners as Jones and effectively became the representative for all things conspiracy, a position currently held by controlled opposition Jones, we would actually be taken seriously by people. Alex Jones has done an immeasurable amount of damage to conspiracy theorists with his ranting and raving. The mainstream media is comfortable with this paradigm, because juxtaposed to Jones they look like sane arbiters of information. What they don't want is Corbett sitting there with Anderson Cooper, professionally citing his claims in calm reasonable fashion, because that might lend us some credence.   TL;DR ?   If everyone who listened to Alex Jones apocalyptic sermons of gloom and doom stopped listening to Alex "never mention Zionism" Jones would subscribe to the Corbett Report, the world would be a better place.    Geez this guy sounds like he's the red cloak wearing ritual master in the party scene from Eyes Wide Shut too.   A history of false flag attacks used to manipulate the minds of the people! In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule.    Friedrich Nietzsche   Unfuckingquestionably.   What the fuck has anyone on this sub done to actually take a stand against their government ? None of us can even imagine being tried and found guilty of High Treason and swiftly handed a life sentence fighting simply for some semblance of an egalitarian society. I bet the majority of the people on this sub have never even attended a protest before and probably couldn't wait to shit on the Occupy protesters on websites like Reddit during those protests cause I mean fuck them right for actually doing something.   Honestly this a serious question, how white is OP ?   I've heard people accuse this sub of White Pride b4, but this is a seriously fucking piece of shit post. At least let the man's corpse get cold before u begin inevitably tearing him down.    He spent 27 years in prison for the possibility that what he was doing would end the apartheid and oppression he watched his parents endure,  sorry if that doesn't impress the keyboard warriors of /r/conspiracy.  Clearly we are the real heroes /s.   Something about the struggle of breaking free from apartheid and oppression stemming from colonial occupation must not resonate with OP. Probably difficult for most /r/conspiracy subscribers to empathize with an African, former political prisoner turned politician.  I'm not someone who comes here to accuse this sub of racism or anti semitism,  those are usually all bullshit cheap shots taken by shills and trolls.  This post however wreaks of racial undertones,  I'm neither white, black, nor African, I'm Indian living in America so Inc completely neutral here and this post does not sit right with me it just doesn't.    TL;DR ?   Yes Mandela is a hero, deal with it. He was no saint, his 2nd wife was a corrupt,  violent woman that would have ultimately tarnished his legacy had he not controversially divorced her and remarried a 3rd time. He kept close ties with controversial African dictators,  and I'm sure he had some skeletons in his closet as well, but a hero he remains none the less.    Just when you think Cheney couldn't find a way to be more of a dick.    Overcoming poverty is not a task of charity, it is an act of justice. Like Slavery and Apartheid, poverty is not natural. It is man-made and it can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings. Sometimes it falls on a generation to be great. YOU can be that great generation. Let your greatness blossom.    Nelson Mandela   It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.    Henry Ford   Who made this meme ? Jesse Pinkman ?    Meet Noam Chomsky:Academic Gatekeeper.    Noam Chomsky is on the forefront of an establishment co-opted academia. Chomsky for all his seemingly benevolent bespectacled insights about the state of politics in America propagates the 9/11 official story word for word when asked, and is also a proponent of the Federal Reserve System. Websites like Resdit and Democraticunderground prop him up as some sort of Dumbledore of the Internet, but don't be fooled by his faux establishment outrage. Chomsky is an academic gatekeeper and is a powerful form of controlled opposition for the elite.  James Corbett did a podcast about Mr. Chomsky exposing him as the mouthpiece for the elite that he truly is which I have linked to at the end of this comment.   http://www.corbettreport.com/meet-noam-chomsky-academic-gatekeeper-video/   James Corbett just did an amazing podcast of the Corbett Report about this very man called, Meet Noam Chomsky: Academic Gatekeeper. In the podcast Corbett asserts that Chomsky is on the forefront of an establishment co-opted academia that increasingly espouses the beliefs and talking points of a government moving in greater lock step with the military industrial, big oil, central banker operated oligopoly. The podcast analyzes how academia has gradually shifted to become more conservative in the wake of the Vietnam war, and the public relations disaster that ensued on college campuses across the United States in protest of US intervention, which was partially organized by academics that had moral codes. If you don't have time to listen to the podcast which I am linking to at the bottom  this comment, it goes into several other establishment-friendly opinions that Chomsky has supported in the past. Spoiler alert, it turns out that Mr. Chomsky has previously stated that he has no opinion about the Federal Reserve either, he also manages to do some good shill work for fiat currency, he's a real piece of work. I wish so many otherwise rational people wouldn't be so easily hooked in by has anti-Bush rhetoric and soft-spoken, bespectacled persona he has carved out for himself on websites like Reddit or Democraticunderground. At the end of the day Chomsky has nothing truly controversial or groundbreaking to offer the world political discourse, he is a co-opted academic gatekeeper, who does his best to reinforce the false right-left paradigm that plagues this nation so. In addition, I can't recommend the Corbett Report podcast enough to the subscribers of /r/conspiracy.   http://www.corbettreport.com/episode-285-meet-noam-chomsky-academic-gatekeeper/    The JIDF is strong in /r/bestof.    What a piece of shit comment, go fuck yourself you Zionist troll.     It's never quite enough for the Chosen People, is it ?   Please take your phony right-left paradigm to /r/politics. Who's upvoting this shit ? Honestly it makes me feel bad about the state of this subreddit.    The moderators of this subreddit are reprehensible,  by limiting the variety of political analysis they, in 1 fell swoop increased the echo chamber effect in /r/politics exponentially and in effect irreparably damaged this subreddit.     All censorships exist to prevent anyone from challenging current conceptions and existing institutions. All progress is initiated by challenging current conceptions, and executed by supplanting existing institutions. Consequently, the first condition of progress is the removal of censorship.

Except  " The hawkish legislation, which essentially hands the president the full-force of the U.S. military if negotiations fail, comes just one week before Tehran sits down with six major powers in Geneva to discuss its nuclear program. For some foreign policy observers on the Hill, it threatens to spoil the already-delicate negotiations."    Thanks OP, no doubt this will be a TL;DR for many people thereby making your title that much more poignant. This post and like minded ones should be plastered across the top of /r/conspiracy in perpetuity.    Quite possibly the most powerful tweet ever.    Hello Mr. Greenwald, I wanted to know your opinion on the Guardian newspapers recent interview with legendary, muckraking journalist Seymour Hersh, and Mr. Hersh's offhandedly mentioning that in his opinion the Osama Bin Laden raid was, in his words "one big lie". What are your thoughts on the Osama Bin Laden raid, do you agree with Mr. Hersh ?    Hello Mr. Greenwald, first and foremost thank you for all of the incredible journalism over the last few months and over the course of your career. My question is in reference to the MARINA revelations, do you believe that the US government is actively using data gathered via the MARINA program to create a list of Americans considered, for lack of a better term as "undesirables", and based on that classification thereby likely to be targeted by the US government's various agencies for a higher level of scrutiny, such as the  IRS or the Department of Homeland Security ? I know it's quite a leap, and a journalist such as yourself doesn't make claims he isn't prepared to immediately back up with evidence, but I'm asking for purely your opinion and I would like to make that clear, any answer I receive from you will be regarded purely as speculation, unless you say otherwise at the beginning of your response.     The JIDF is strong in this one.    Keanu Reeves will forever be the One, Neo.    Just keep shoveling that shit shill.    u/BlackSwanX and this post serve as a testament to what is wrong with this subreddit.    October 1st is the end of the Fiscal Year, by the way, so the military rushes to expend whatever it has left on its budget before October 1st 2014 or the remaining balance may be deducted from next year's military budget, which is something that the Pentagon and the military industrial complex can not allow to happen. This is the reason that you see a lot of military drills and military activity in September, and the reason that you keep seeing the date October 1st over and over again is because it is the end of the Fiscal year, god this is such a stupid post, I honestly can't recall the last time I saw such transparent bullshit atop /r/conspiracy. This post is so stupid it makes my head hurt.    This was either posted by an idiot or a shill to discredit this sub, either way this is a terrible post and as someone who is India I wish we didn't gravitate towards the whole ancient alien/vimanas shit. The entire ancient alien theory is reprehensible for so many reasons, and it really drags down this subreddit. I mean, in this day and age with quantitative easing from the Federal Reserve, billion dollar bailouts for broke banks that are "Too big to fail", and an American war machine on overdrive looking for any possible reason to bomb a country with brown people and their own ideas on the banking system and this is what is getting to the top of the page, a bullshit post about ancient aliens with ZERO evidence. Why don't you try something more tangible, more realistic, MORE TERRESTRIAL. Seriously go fuck yourself if you upvoted this, because you sully the term "conspiracy theorist".    Freedom of the Press, if it means anything at all, means the freedom to criticize and oppose    George Orwell   A history of false flag attacks used to manipulate the minds of the people!

Noam Chomsky, Imperial Ambitions: Conversations on the Post-9/11 World   I want to learn how to play the theme song from Breaking Bad on an acoustic guitar so bad.   How is it that you hear a theme song for a television show, think nothing of it and 5 years later it's used in such an amazing fashion that you really can't get it out of your head at all ?   I'm gonna have that twang stuck in my head all week and think of Walt's empty chair and what's to come next week.    "redditor for 9 days"  Well there is that, and the fact that Israel pays college students to tweet pro Israel propaganda   wage online comment thread battles for Israel.  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/students-offered-grants-if-they-tweet-proisraeli-propaganda-8760142.html  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23695896  Based on that, my JIDF detector is going through the roof, so I suppose the answer to your question is Yes, I think it's possible that you could work for the JIDF.    Listen 869689698 as an /r/Judaism subscriber, Jewish person and ardent supporter of Israel I think any comments submitted on this topic on your behalf should be taken with a gigantic chunk of rock salt. You'll excuse me for not suspecting you of being JIDF, y'know based on your comment history, less than 2% of the US is Jewish, and yet all of you seem to be on Reddit, and very opinionated on Reddit at that.    "redditor for 4 days"  Substantial amount of overall comments are on articles about Israel and posting comments favorable for Zionism, must be JIDF then    "redditor for 4 days"  The JIDF is strong in this one.    Yea but they are in the minority and even then they do nothing to illuminate other Jewish people as to the problems caused by Zionism, passive or aggressive. It's just to much of an inconvenience for them because they become Black sheep in the Jewish community, personally I can't recall an instance of a Jewish person in the public arena calling Israel out on their apartheid and ethnic cleansing. With all of the famous liberal Jewish actors, comedians and television personalities you'd think at least 1 would come out against Israel.   Thanks for the insight JIDF shill, every other comment in your comment history is about how Zionists are amazing, and should just take over the entire Middle East, so you'll  excuse me for not readily believing the propaganda you're being paid to disseminate.  I do have a couple of questions for you, how much are they paying you ?   What's the average worthless shill of a human being whoring themselves out for these days ?   Do you get paid by AIPAC directly ?     "His car was found the next day at an antiques mall next to the Susquehanna River, and his county-issued laptop and hard drive were found months later in the river."   Reasonably prepared, I always have at least 7 days worth of chronic on me to ride out the initial storm.    It's never enough for Israel, is it ? Defend your own fucking military occupation ! I don't want the apartheid and ethnic cleansing in Palestine to be an Uncle Sam joint. BTW you'd think 65 years of substantial foreign aid and military aid would be enough for the Chosen People, but NOOO !!!! It's never enough for Israel.    This is 1 of the most fucked up statistics in politics, 1.7% of the population and 13% of the Senate, unbefuckinglievable. ZOG (Zionist Owned Government) is in full effect.    We had to struggle with the old enemies of peacebusiness and financial monopoly, speculation, reckless banking, class antagonism, sectionalism, war profiteering.  They had begun to consider the Government of the United States as a mere appendage to their own affairs. We know now that Government by organized money is just as dangerous as Government by organized mob.  Never before in all our history have these forces been so united against one candidate as they stand today. They are unanimous in their hate for meand I welcome their hatred.     Franklin D. Roosevelt  (Obama has yet to make a speech declaring the equivalent, I'm no fan of FDR but the man nudged us in the right direction, Banking Act of 1933, Glass-Steagall, where's the financial reform you promised Mr. President ? Dodd-Frank ? Gimme a fucking break.)    Fascism should more appropriately be called Corporatism because it is a merger of state and corporate power       Benito Mussolini   BTW I'm pretty sure that the real reason ole' Woodrow is on the $1,000 bill is because when the engineered collapse of the Petrodollar takes place we'll be using stacks of $1,000 bills to buy bread like post WW1 Germany and the Rothschilds want us to remember who fucked us over a century ago.    FUCK Woodrow Wilson, peace of shit  ruined the entire country, BTW everyone, he was talking about the handful of Jewish families that own the Federal Reserve, the Rothschilds, the Warburgs, the Lazards etc. when he was referring to the power you can't criticize, good luck trying to convince everyone a small group of Jewish people control the entire monetary system.    I'm just sorry it took this near miss with Syria for people on this sub to realize who the real enemy is.    I know, worst yet I posted this to /r/news and it was predictably buried and ignored amid other news articles that all appeared to beating the war drums, and loudly.    It would be my greatest sadness to see Zionists (Jews) do to Palestinian Arabs much of what Nazis did to Jews.     Albert Einstein   Palestine belongs to the Arabs in the same sense that England belongs to the English or France to the French. It is wrong and inhuman to impose the Jews on the Arabs... Surely it would be a crime against humanity to reduce the proud Arabs so that Palestine can be restored to the Jews partly or wholly as their national home    Mahatma Gandhi   Poverty is the worst form of violence.     Mahatma Gandhi   No matter how big the lie; repeat it often enough and the masses will regard it as the truth.     John F. Kennedy   Jeez, no wonder they won't just go back to Poland, Hungary, Russia and Germany, as Helen Thomas implied in her now controversial video, Hungary expelled them in 1349   then again in 1360 and 4 times in total. The other countries of Eastern Europe are all featured here as well, this is what I've always contended about the Jewish people, either entire regions of Earth are hateful bigots, or Jewish people have a problem taking advantage of society. How could this many people be bigots in this many instances over the course of nearly 1800 years ? It's a completely ridiculous notion. There's no way that many groups of people over the course of nearly 1800 years have come together as a society and decided that the best course of action for the future of that society would be to expel a segment of the population that tends to find employment in the finance sector, and soon without fail become the wealthiest members of that society and use their new found wealth to subvert that societies laws by making the ruling class, nobility or government indebted to them. It's called a cycle and cycles repeat themselves, in 1939 Hitler sent 937 Jewish refugees to America on the MS St. Louis and America did not except them so there's that as well.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_St._Louis#Voyage_of_the_Damned   The tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self denial.    Oscar Wilde   The term "Jewish Human Rights Group" is ironic if not an oxymoron entirely.    I know, it's tragic, especially when you consider what a model human being Roger Waters is in almost every aspect of life. If these Jewish people who are professional victims successfully change the public opinion, whatever the hell that is, of Roger Waters it'll prove that up is down, black is white, and that Jewish people are able to hijack the narrative of any discussion to reduce to its semantics, like calling Roger Waters a racist, anti-Semite for calling them out on their engineered humanitarian disaster in old Palestine.    It really doesn't take a genius to figure out why, just google The New York Times Company and you'll see it's owned by the Sulzbergers and its so no secret the Sulzbergers have donated more than a few shekels to AIPAC   Israel over the years.   It's called a link.    Not to mention Lloyd Blankfein at Goldman Sachs, I'm pretty much certain Goldman Sachs of all financial firms is only allowed to hire Jewish people to top positions, it's so explicit in the name that only Jewish people can make it there to positions of power.    All I'm going to say is that I've never even heard of a poor Jewish person, they are all rich, in the Philadelphia area where I reside, the most affluent townships and neighborhoods in Philadelphia are entirely Jewish. I really have never heard of a Jewish person being even lower middle-class, it just doesn't happen. There are to many other Jewish people in high places, especially Ashkenazi Jewish people to allow a fellow tribe member to struggle in any way. It's pretty much racism to the umpteenth degree, Jewish people only hire and promote other Jewish people. Perfect example David Stern is the NBA commissioner and his replacement, whom he handpicked is the Deputy NBA commissioner Adam Silver, Adam Silver will be the 5th NBA commissioner in the NBA's history and the 3rd Jewish person to hold the position. Mind you there have only ever been approximately 40 Jewish people to ever play in the NBA in it's history.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jews_in_sports#Basketball  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Silver   Who's upvoting this shit ?  It can't all be shills and trolls, how many idiots are on r/conspiracy ?   Is the spike in subscribers manifesting itself in these nonsensical posts making it to the top of the page and then remaining there suspended in mediocrity ?    The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.     Edward L. Bernays, Propaganda   I will be satisfied if the federation of secret law, unequal pardon and irresistible executive powers that rule the world that I love are revealed even for an instant.   - Edward Snowden, from the original interview he gave to Glenn Greenwald    Honest to god nothing makes me lose as much respect for this sub as anything alien/reptilian related, it humiliates to me see this nearly at the top of the page and know that I am so heavily entrenched in and associated with this subreddit. With so much shit happening TERRESTRIALLY that we are aware of such as false flags and privately owned banking cartels operating as central banks for nations, dubious r/conspiracy users try to derail that very real discussion by flooding this sub with the paranormal, why not post ghost videos while we're at it. Now I'm not saying that my theories are better than your theories, but my theories are better than your theories and the alien topic drags down the level of discourse on this sub to the level of a teenager with an active YouTube account and a subscription to the Coast to Coast channel.    The worlds largest gold mining company Barrick Gold is also owned by a Jewish person, Peter Munk, a Hungarian born billionaire so it's not just the mass media, banking and Hollywood.    Fine, Newhouse owns Advanced Publication which owns Reddit, there are you happy now anymore attacks you wanna throw at me ?     People shouldn't expect the mass media to do investigative stories. That job belongs to the 'fringe' media.   - Ted Koppel     How funny would it be if it was just Bill Burr driving people back to the Boston area and swinging by and like seeing his family or something cause he was back in the area ?    Zionists own the biggest media corporations, Sumner Redstone   Les Moonves own CBS. The Roberts family owns Comcast which owns 51% of NBC and they are also Jewish. The Sulzbergers own The New York Times Company, Bob Iger owns the Walt Disney Corporation. Then you have the Newhouses who own Conde Nast which owns Reddit, The New Yorker and Vanity Fair just to name a few. Look I'm on my phone so I'm not digging up the links and those are just the Zionists who own media corporations that I can think of just off the top of my head, good luck getting any of them to report it. Alex Jones is even terrified to mention Israel, he blames all of the turmoil in the Syria squarely on powerful Shiite Muslims in Saudi Arabia, Quatar, and Turkey, it's pathetic. Oh yea and there's Sirius XM which is also an entirely Jewish operation founded by someone named Rothblatt and the current President   CCO is Scott Greenstein, it goes so deep its blatantly obvious that Americas mass media is owned by Zionist Jewish people, even Reddit.    Gonna get downvoted for saying this but here goes, the alien stuff is bullshit. The alien/reptilian stuff is a gigantic circle jerk and its a powerful tool to discredit more serious minded conspiracy theorists by proxy. The government, the banks, the mainstream media, the military industrial complex and academia love it that someone like Peter Joseph is on par with David Icke or other well known conspiracy theorists that are nothing more than well publicized crackpots. I'm not sure if David Icke is a complicit troll, engaging in the most elaborate PsyOp in recent memory or he's unwittingly done the most damage to the conspiracy theor movement. Either way David Icke or aliens in general shouldn't be the immediate response in peoples minds to conspiracy theories.    Israel is the only other foreign government they are sharing American citizens data with. While the NSA is sharing this information with other defense agencies most notably the DEA, Israel is the only foreign government with unfettered access to US citizens data.    I agree this is 1 of the best articles I've read analyzing the situation in the Middle East over the last dozen years from a semi well known media establishment. I don't even know how it was allowed to be published; it seems loaded with language rife for Larry Summers' attorneys to be able to lay waste to in court. I imagine there is no shortage of judges licking at the chops to rule in favor of Summers' in a libel case; it's a shame, he's a powerful man.

Friedrich Nietzsche   India would not be on the side of the US Allies, it would either be on Russia's side or most likely neutral. Delhi is a long time ally of Moscow, and Russia has a history of selling India weapons. During the Sino-Indian war in 1962 between India and China, Russia supported India and America remained neutral just to give 1 example of many. Trust me, India would remain neutral until Russia and China had their backs against the wall and then when the time comes they would have to throw in with Russia and China. This map is incredibly lopsided towards favoring America, even Venezuela is listed as a US ally, I don't think OP has ever heard of Hugo Chavez. America already has a technological advantage, that we're sure of, so why skew the map unnecessarily in the US' favor ?   Source : Indian person living in America   The use of depleted uranium by the United States, Israel and the UK is without a doubt a crime against humanity and it doesn't get nearly enough attention. No one else uses it, just those 3 countries. Say what you want to about Russia and Syria, they don't use depleted uranium rounds, which BTW were only ever justified by the US to the UN in the 1st place specifically to pierce Soviet tanks to spray Iraqi   Afghan civilians with 50 caliber rounds who BTW are not in Soviet tanks.    Why not just go ahead and rename the sub /r/ZionistOwnedNews ?    This guy is a Mod, THIS GUY !   For shame /r/conspiracy. For shame !   I don't comment often, but when I do its to point out the bullshit on /r/conspiracy.    He who joyfully marches to music rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would surely suffice.   Albert Einstein   It has to be on /r/conspiracy because for some reason everything Israel-related ends up getting taken down by /r/news and /r/worldnews because the comment threads get overrun by JIDF shills commenting antisemitic rhetoric to paint all critics of Israel as ravenous antisemitic, racists and nothing else. Also /r/news mods have shown a pretty transparent pro Israel bias in the past, even though its a fact it has to be relegated to /r/conspiracy to make sure it will remain posted, it's sad that JIDF's disinfo is so well implemented on Reddit. By being on /r/conspiracy this issue will be disregarded by most as something to the effect of an old rock star off his rocker. Waters stance will be twisted, misrepresented and mislabeled until this whole brave boycott is rendered to a footnote on his otherwise decorated Wikipedia page, under the "Late Career Controversies" section.    " I spent 33 years and four months in active military service and during that period I spent most of my time as a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism. I helped make Mexico and especially Tampico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to collect revenues in. I helped in the raping of half a dozen Central American republics for the benefit of Wall Street. I helped purify Nicaragua for the International Banking House of Brown Brothers in 1902-1912. I brought light to the Dominican Republic for the American sugar interests in 1916. I helped make Honduras right for the American fruit companies in 1903. In China in 1927 I helped see to it that Standard Oil went on its way unmolested. Looking back on it, I might have given Al Capone a few hints. The best he could do was to operate his racket in three districts. I operated on three continents.   Smedley D. Butler, War is a Racket: The Antiwar Classic by America's Most Decorated Soldier   See this comment, that I am replying to r/conspiracy, hope it's not a shill account, but THAT is the problem.    Explain to me again, what freedoms did I gain from the gigantic clusterfuck that is the War on Terror ?   The freedom to pay $3.60 a gallon for regular and spend $55 filling my fucking golf cart.   One of the hardest parts of my job is to connect Iraq to the war on terror.     George W. Bush   "The only security of all is in a free press.   Thomas Jefferson   "The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. ...We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. ...In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons...who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.   Edward L. Bernays, Propaganda   Hmm, everytime I look up someone with Stein in their last name in Congress is attacking constitutional rights, Sunstein, Feinstein, etc.    Wag the Dog, considering the fact that it came out just a few years before 9/11.    Throw in a Star of David in light blue alongside the stars and stripes and then you'd have something there.     Click on the link and read it, dickhead.     I wouldn't be surprised by that. The same statistic is probably true for Egypt and Iraq and elsewhere we contribute massively to.    Do me a favor. Find the statistics for Egypt and Iraq also. Or other high end donation locations. Let's compare. Because I am seriously doubting is the only place for such things.    Or maybe it would be better not to call people children for thinking differently. Yea, that seems like the more commendable thing to do.  1. Afghanistan 2. Israel 3. Iraq 4. Egypt  So there goes your "serious doubt". Israel received more aid than anyone from 1976-2002, and Afghanistan and Iraq only entered in 2002, when we began making in your words "massive contributions" to Iraq and Afghanistan in the form of aerial assaults and carpet bombing cities. The only countries that get more than Israel are ones with ongoing wars with the US, last year the average Afghan earned approximately $430 in US Foreign aid and the average Israeli earned $405 in US Foreign aid, so its still pretty close.    Also bravo for taking such a courageous militant pro Israel stance I bet that must've been really hard for you to do being a white, Christian man in America. Tell me did you face any harassment or career issues being staunchly pro Israel. It must've been really controversial I mean.    Or maybe it would be better not to call people children for thinking differently.  Gimme a fucking break kid this is r/conspiracy if that's the brave insight you arrived at is that Israel is great and all Arabs are crazy then you just failed, unsubscribe and spend more time on r/Christianity, you'll find all the Palestine bashers there queued up for  you.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_foreign_aid#Recipients     Fuck that kid, if I didn't have work in 6 hours I'd really have debated him down to self admitted defeat. I kept checking on my post on my phone on the RedditisFun app. They should change the name of that app to RedditisAllConsuming.    Here child, cry about the following damning statistic from this article:  "US taxpayers contributed more to the Israeli Defense Forces last year than Israeli citizens have cumulatively in the last 3 year."  So as you can see it is no understatement to say that Israel's army is bought and paid for by the US taxpayer. This article is from Business Insider so I hope it passes your Zionist approved news establishment criteria.  http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-how-much-america-really-spends-on-israels-defense-2012-9   Are you stupid ?  Or are you honestly implying that the Israeli  government spends 100% of its Gross Domestic Product on defense and nothing else They don't have roads or hospitals or schools there to manage ?  Or do you just not understand these acronyms, I knew I made the mistake of engaging a know-it-all, Jesus freak kid but had I known you were just an idiot this whole time I would've ignored you, oh well lesson learnes.  Largest recipient yes. What does that have to do with the fact that it's gdp far exceeds US aid.  Yes 1 number is larger than the other 1, good insight kid.    Illegal occupation? That's a made up term.   Unlike you, I don't give a fuck. I don't have preferences.   1. I'll admit that illegal occupation is a made up term when you admit "Jewish" is a made up ethnicity, they are rich white people with big noses, who exploit laws against discrimination and turned themselves into a new group of people post               Holocaust.  The Palestinians are a hell of a lot more Semitic than all of the Ashkenazi Jews running Israel, and an Israeli population geneticist from Johns Hopkins came to that conclusion. Jewish people are Khazars or Asiatics, and the fact that they get treated like they are an oppressed minority in America is laughable. It's amazing before World War II it was considered racist to refer to Jewish as an ethnicity instead of a religion which had been it's designation for millennia. All of a sudden in the early 1950's America discovers a new ethnic group, the mysterious Jewish people, absolute bullshit, now it's considered racist to refer to Jewish people as Caucasian.  2. For someone who purportedly doesn't give a fuck you've been doing a lot of shilling and distribution of disinformation on this thread. So then why the angry fingers there keyboard warrior ? What is the JIDF giving the most annoying shill an Applebees giftcard as a bonus this month or something ?       You're a religious person, so in the words of Voltaire if we believe in absurdities we will commit atrocities. You are the 1 who brought up the Torah's justification for the state of Israel and it's no secret that there are enough crazy, Bible thumping Christians in America who support Israel specifically because it is believed Jesus will be resurrected in Jerusalem. So you're allowing your own religious beliefs and you are an ardent Christian and subscriber to r/Christianity, to influence your opinion on the illegal occupation of Palestine, which is foolish to say the least or dare I say it even asshatish to use your term. So like just how crazy religious are you ? I mean you believe in a 2nd coming of Christ so you're definete at least a little impartial and thereby less credible, if everyone is aware that you are really only supporting Israel out of fear and self interest that you won't meet your Space Jesus than it sort of makes your support illegitimate or at least disingenuous. So are you going to deny your level of religiosity now too right here in front of r/conspiracy, and remember, GOD IS WATCHING !    Why don't you use more ancient scriptures that were written in a language you can't even speak yourself to decide more pressing geopolitical issues, tell me what does the Torah say about Rwanda, what does the Bible say we should to address rising sea levels ? You see how much of an idiot you sound like when you use the Torah, a book written thousands of years ago by desert dwelling nomads to justify a modern day apartheid and ethnic cleansing. Hey by the way while you are at it what does the Bible say we should do about nuclear Pakistan ? This is r/conspiracy leave your bullshit Christian ideology where it belongs, in r/Christianity.    How many more lies will you spout on this thread for Israel ?  " Israel is the largest cumulative recipient of military assistance from the United States since World War II, followed by Afghanistan, Iraq, Egypt, and Pakistan.[22] Since 1987, the U.S. has provided an average of $1.8 billion annually in the form of Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign Military Financing (FMF) and funds to support research and development.[2]A bilateral memorandum of understanding was signed in January 2001, at the end of the Clinton administration, under which defense aid was increased to $2.4 billion annually from $1.8 billion, while the $1.2 billion of economic aid would be eliminated. This was predicated on the basis of the defense aid being increased by $60 million per year until the full amount was reached in 2008, while the economic aid is decreased by $120 million per year until eliminated.[3][23] In 2007, the United States increased its military aid to Israel by over 25%, to an average of $3 billion per year for the following ten-year period (starting at $2.550 billion for 2008, growing by $150 million each year).[24] The package started in October 2008, when regular economic aid to Israel's economy ended.[25] Officials have insisted the aid is not tied, or meant to balance, simultaneous American plans to sell $20 billion worth of sophisticated arms to its Arab allies in the region, including Egypt and Saudi Arabia.[25] Former U.S. President George W. Bush assured Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert that the U.S. would help keep a "qualitative advantage" to Israel over other nations in the region.[24] The United States is the largest single supplier of military equipment to Israel. According to the U.S. Congressional Research Service, between 1998-2005 the U.S. accounted for the vast majority of Israel's arms transfer agreements, accounting for $9.1 billion out of $9.5 billion worth of agreements.[26]Israel deals directly with U.S. companies for the vast majority of its military purchases from the United States, though it requires permission from the U.S. government for specific purchases. Permission is not always automatic; for instance, in March 2000 it became known that the Israeli government had been refused permission to purchase BGM-109 Tomahawk missiles.[3] Israel has the world's largest F-16 fleet outside the United States Air Force. With the delivery of 102 F-16Is, scheduled through 2008, the Israeli Air Force will have a total F-16 inventory of 362, in addition to 106 F-15s.[27]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel%E2%80%93United_States_military_relations#Military_aid_and_procurement  240 billion is Israel's GDP, you knew I was talking about defense aid from the US specifically but you intentionally took me out of context, classic shill move.  I'm going to sleep now shill, I'm sure I'll return to an Inbox of lies and propaganda in the morning.   Why are you bringing in irrelevant points?  Easy there God boy.     All of Israel's technology exists solely because of the American taxpayer, and all of it will be rendered useless in the event of a prolonged mass ground warfare, Israel simply doesn't have the bodies for a prolonged, bloody ground war with Iran and its 75 million united Shia Muslims who are salivating at the notion of war with Israel. Israel is so tiny and densely populated that their civilian casualties would skyrocket in no time, Iran still has enough large swaths of land and friendly neighbors to constantly be staging new strategies and moving large amounts of troops around comfortably and quickly, Israel on the other hand barely has enough space to engage in large military drills without entering Palestine. In a 1 on 1 prolonged war with Iran, Israel always loses. Israel really couldn't hang for a long ground war with many nations, they would end up dragging the United States in, which in turn would  bring in Russia on the other end, so basically we're risking nuclear war for greedy Israel, which you've made abundantly clear that you are all right with, anything for your Space Jesus.    YOU are the problem, it's called an ultimatum, 1 side is right and 1 side is wrong, get informed before spouting your nonsensical "We're all 1 species on 1 planet and we have to come together" shit, please spare me. Why don't you go to the Gaza strip and tell those refugees living in destitution and squalor because of Israel's blockades and security, that they all have to come together and to be nicer or something. Go to the Golan Heights where thousands of Bedouin people are living in tents and are about to be further displaced so Israel can build 1200 luxurious settlements and condominiums and tell them to try smiling. Maybe while you're there you can recommend The Secret, oh yeah and definitely be vague, positive, judgmental, ignorant, opinionated and ultimate unhelpful like you were in your last comment on this thread, that was perfect.   So what you're saying is that Israel is going to make the United States fight Iran for them, because everyone knows Israel doesn't have it in them to throw down with Iran alone, they lack the manpower, will and national identity and would crumble amidst the 1st real damage to their safe, walled, enclosure-nation, away from the world. AIPAC also lobbied aggressively for the US invasion of Iraq as well as a complicit Zionist owned media misleading  the sheep-like American public along the way. So if it wasn't for Israel getting America to do all of their dirty work for them, that delusional map you linked to really wouldn't be possible now would it ? BTW don't count on a war hungry American public to fight another 1 of Israel's wars for them. Also I take it from your username that you were born in 1991,   yet you speak so casually of mass casualties across the Middle East just so the Israelis can have their blood drenched, biblical land of Israel in all their greedy glory. I bet the toughest thing you've ever done is snipe some Middle Eastern characters on Call of Duty or some other video game, you know nothing of the world. Big talk you've got there, but what's the end game for Israel, what if somehow against all odds Israel managed to achieve the atrocity that is that map, then what, does your space Jesus come back in Jerusalem or something ? No he doesn't. He never does cause it's a fucking fairy tale, how come religious people are unable to comprehend the notion of ALLEGORIES. I'll tell you what will happen though, greedy Israel will continue to expand East into they run into either nuclear Pakistan or nuclear India, take your fucking pick because I bet you in your infinite wisdom which you've accumulated over the course of 22 years as a religious Christian, are also ready to nuke the world so Israel can have a little more land and you increase your likelihood of meeting space Jesus from your fairy tale a little bit more.   	180
 Driverless cars are more dangerous that cars with drivers. These cars will not be able to react like humans can to certain events, and there will be traffic jams, and fatal accidents.

God made every person, and he made us all flawed. No one has the authority to judge people who are straight/gay. I don't see why a lot of you care, it doesn't affect you whatsoever.   Our education system is a joke. No one cares about classes, they are all boring lectures of stupid where some prick refered to as a teacher, tells you to do shit.... We learn to complete tests, little of that knowledge is used in our careers.  Now I bet since we are so behind, they might give us more work which will lead to less giving a shit, and lower grades.   Unfortunately, unless we go about uhh, round 500x the speed of light, that shit ain't close.   That isn't racist at all... Imagine the outrage if it was not about being white, but being black...

I do not like to look at things from one side, so i am just going to ask you some questions, hopefully you won't take offense.  Let's start like this, I was raised as a Christian. We went to church every Sunday, I mindlessly prayed, went to Sunday school. I began to despise going to church. It was just boring, all that was discussed was the same concepts of love, respect.  I began to question the bible, gods, and their existence. I began to see a lot of contradictions, and when I asked my parents, they either changed the subject, or told me I should talk to the padtor.  I did just that, yet I still kept getting strange answers, that contradicted what was said by others in the past.  Out of curiosity, I read the bible, word by word. That too was full of contradictions, and passages that could be interpreted both ways.   Why have you started believing?  Have you read the bible word for word and seeked an unbiased meaning?  What are your personal opinions about athiests?  Do you think that it is right for God to send athiests to hell for eternity, because they didn't let him save them from him?  What are your opinions on heaven/hell?   I am confused. Why would age have anything to do with this?  More importantly, why didn't she use the parachute?   How about someone full the government of idiots.   The government doesn't make up the whole country. Anyone who thinks snowden is a traitor is either a politician or a complete idiot   No federal jobs are good... They do not boost our economy, and nothing productive comes from them.

I believe what can be proved to me. There is evidence to prove existence for everything around us, but there hasn't been any evidence of a god. I can believe that there is a god, it is possible, but there is no evidene that suggests there is a god. 2. I believe there was a man who is refered to as Jesus. 3. The only problem I have with religion is that it is being used as a way to gain wealth, and religion has an impact on critical thinking.   Yup, praise The Lord for wrecking the car.... Fuckin morons.   Don't tell them?   Sorry to hear that. It is sad when stuff like this happens. That is why I hate the brainwashing done by religious persons.   Free speach? Profanity isn't protected by freedom of speach either. This shouldn't be a big deal at all. Go hand out your fliers somewhere else.   Maybe their god will get them out.

I concur with what you're saying, but one point of correction:   Many particles, such as electrons, are considered "point particles" in that they have zero dimension and take up exactly zero space. They have zero mass as well, and as such, travel at the speed of light.  That is not correct. You may be thinking of a photon. An electron does have mass and does not travel at the speed of light, maybe close but not equal to c.    Agreed.  A great many of the empirical tests they ran in '59 would now be run through simulation on a computer.   Not sure, but I'd like to know.   No, the headline is correct - the first thief reports the (implied second) theft to the police.  Reread the story.   I have them an use their color options on occasion.  I agree with Algorab.

Good question.  I would guess the overall mass of the proton is the determined by the quarks' direct interactions with the Higgs field plus the mass equivalent of the interaction energy between the quarks interacting with the Higgs field.  Otherwise the proton's mass would just reflect the measly sum of the three quarks' mass.     Note the comment "all **eligible** Apple products are back on EPEAT."

Happened when as an 8 year old I was climbing a tree with a friend.  He was out on the end of a branch and i was near the trunk on the same branch.  He climbed out a bit too far and branch gave way. We both fell.  He fell into a mud puddle and I fell onto a wire fence which impaled me in my side.  Luckily no internal organs were damaged but I received 32 stitches in the shape of a V.  I'm amazed I don't have a fear of heights and still like to climb.   Ah, I see it is but from another paper (NY Times vs CNN). I checked for the same link before I posted but didn't check for other similar links. My bad.     Yes it does, but it didn't here. Some people who check the LosAngeles sub reddit may not have visited the other sub reddits that contain this link.    Please and fucking don't go together. It's one or the other.    Isn't there a K in that?   Let's hope he doesn't inadvertently initiate a Facetime session. Would give new meaning to the term.   Here's a much less expensive (free) summary. http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-07/cosmology-breakthrough-astronomers-measure-dark-matter-bridge-between-galaxy-clusters   I know, the name is misleading.  They are actually a fairly reputable and unbiased source of information. Their reporters have been awarded 7 Pulitzer Prizes over the years and they are known "for avoiding sensationalism, producing a "distinctive brand of nonhysterical journalism".   Normally I wouldn't post this, but the WSJ is generally accurate with Apple rumors.   I like his delivery style.  Like a big kid who can't quite contain his excitement.   Yeah, not much of a surprise.   Yes, we're buying them.   its not it's  It's confusing because you'd think that you should use the apostrophe for the possessive, but in the case of "it" you shouldn't.  The apostrophe is reserved for the contraction of it is.   Check out the D8 interview. My wife attended and during the Q A at 1:26:35 she asked Jobs a good question about DHCP.     Good answer - thanks.   That would make much more sense.   That was a request, not a demand.   Camera settings were: 200 mm, f/40 1.6 sec, ISO 6400.  I used three layers of 5% visible light transmission window tinting film.  I think that means there was only 0.05 * 0.05 * 0.05 = 0.000125 (0.0125%) transmission.  That would explain why I needed such a high ISO setting and exposure time.   The Milky Way looks WAY to small relative to the Earth.   Come on people, the clue that he WASN'T talking about L.A. was the term "Midwest".  How often do you hear people refer of the Midwest area of L.A.?   Western Canada is in the path of the partial eclipse so at least you get to see something (see animation above).   Interesting.  I've tried this with other color balloons and red seems to work best.  Some other colors don't pop at all.  That would imply red absorbs this laser light better than other colors.   Electronista has more info on this http://www.electronista.com/articles/12/05/11/domestic.shipments.ups.fedex.unaffected/.  You could be referring to this statement in the article:  "Other countries have less stringent rules allowing cellphone, iPod, and Kindle batteries to be shipped to other countries, yet prohibiting laptop batteries with their larger weight and higher amp-hour ratings."   UPDATE: RIM Australia issued a statement this morning May 1 9:20 AM AEST, with Richelle Gillett, Account Director from Spectrum Communications for Blackberry confirming:  We can confirm that the Australian Wake Up campaign, which involves a series of experiential activities taking place across Sydney and Melbourne, was created by RIM Australia. A reveal will take place on May 7th that will aim to provoke conversation on what being in business means to Australians.   My wife noticed it while we were catching up on season 6.  She had just interviewed Robert and he showed us the products he's invented.  I wouldn't be surprised if there are other TV commercials of his products on Dexter episodes.   Good point, I should've posted that.  Robert was very careful about spoilers.   She clearly is a non technical person who should not attempt to convey technical concepts.   They have to shut down the LHC every winter because its high energy requirements are not compatible with the sourrounding population's higher energy needs during the winter (i.e. not enough power to do both).   Some people don't like Physorg in general.   Gotta be an April fools thing.   Update: Apple offers refund over Australian 4G iPad confusion   http://www.engadget.com/2012/03/28/apple-offers-refund-over-australian-4g-ipad-confusion/   It's kind of like asking why Meg Whitman isn't more like Steve Jobs.

Woody Harrelson turned into meme after spectacular social media fail      http://news.techeye.net/internet/woody-harrelson-turned-into-meme-after-spectacular-social-media-fail#utm_source=thetecheye utm_medium=twitter utm_campaign=default    spAnser: You were picked up at CNET:   http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-57359241-71/google-blurs-womans-street-view-pratfall/?tag=mncol   Freaking weirdest funeral procession I have ever seen, probably due to North Korean editing. Commentators are over the top with emotion. The background moaning is a bit much and clearly looped.   yep   The light source in the middle of the Einstein ring is a luminous red galaxy (LRG) as stated in the text, not just a single star.  It looks like a star since it's so far away and all of the stars in the galaxy appear to be collapsed to a single blob. Sniperchild is correct that the galaxy has a black hole in the middle, as almost all galaxies do.     ditto   A single atom does not have sufficient density to form a black hole because an atom is mostly empty space - very small nucleus surrounded by a relatively large cloud of light electrons. You have to get rid of the electron cloud and compress the nuclei of multiple atoms to get a sufficiently high density.   The point of the article is that a mass of 3x the sun is sufficient, but just barely, to form a black hole.  This does not mean that all stars with a mass of 3x that of our sun are or become black holes.  It requires special conditions for a black hole of such a low mass to develop from gravitational collapse of a star.  Also, black holes with a mass much less than our sun are postulated to exist.  These primordial black holes do not form from the gravitational collapse of a star but are remnants from the big bang.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primordial_black_hole   These are pretty cool, but Day 25 with the dual deer heads looks like a law suit waiting to happen.   Title should have read "sadly, its 1 of just 11 states to have done so"    The videographer shows himself at 2:11   http://vimeo.com/30167914   ~25 sec into this Youtube video  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyjuoM4pQa4 Two car thieves led Los Angeles police on a bizarre high speed chase that at times was reminiscent of the Keystone Cops.

You mean about his Myspace reference?   One word: Cajones!   Not clear why he would need to be arrested for the investigation, unless he isn't cooperating with the authorities.   I believe Vegas is starting to take bets on this one. You could really score big time with this precise knowledge!   Well stated.    I'm convinced that in addition to science   technology influencing scifi, the converse is true as well.  I'd like to think people who make decisions that affect society in significant ways are influenced by the type of messages Star Trek delivers.  But even if not, positive change can come in small ways by people like us.   Yeah, I noticed that.  I think his/her thought was in the right place even if the words were not.   I hear you.   And the white one is still to be released.   Had to be said.   It's the Lady Gaga iPhone edition.   Agreed, and is that a button I see in the upper right?   Yes he is - no fluff on what he says.   Oh, that's a softball.  Batter up!...   Found the resolution  - only 500 x 500.  You can get an enlarged version at 665 x 665 but still poor.     Still looking for it.  Will post when I can find it.   You're right - we know of no planets within a 100 light years that could support life capable of receiving our broadcasts.  However, SETI isn't about someone else receiving our broadcasts - it's about us receiving someone else's broadcasts.  If some day they are received, those transmissions will likely have been traveling much longer than 100 years.   I see that it has been posted elsewhere in reddit, but I don't see it repeated in TechNewsToday.  Did I miss another post?   Reminds me of how M-theory is described, but in only 2 dimensions rather than 11.   Why would anyone want to do this?

Tell him to imagine himself poised precariously on a ledge 20 stories above the street. Then tell him he has the potential to release a lot of energy by simply jumping and plummeting to his death. Lots of blood, broken bones and a high probability of losing his life. Where did it all come from? Potential energy that was turned into kinetic energy then impact. Then  ask if he believes in potential energy.   Yes, the Very Long Baseline Array is impressive, but it is an interferometer with lots of spatial ambiguity.  This array would yield more of a focused main beam with very low sidelobes.  That is one of the reasons the individual arrays are somewhat randomly rather than periodically placed.    The toy comparison was a bit charged.  I am completely enthralled by the LHC and can't wait for full power operation.  I was only indicating it is small in size compared to this array.   That's like saying "The pixel on a CCD would fit comfortably in this period."  But that's not the entire sensor.  Sure the central region would fit in the LHC, but the entire collection of arrays spans over 3000 km (see the end of the video).  The LHC at about 9 km in diameter is tiny compared to the entire array.  This array would derive its very fine spatial resolution from its large dimension.  That is what makes it impressive, not the central region by itself.    Admittedly, this array may never be built.  But the scope would be impressive and the performance unprecedented if it were.   Our Sun is quite a dynamic star.   Yeah, that's annoying.  SAI seems to enjoy spreading these things over many pages, probably to get more hits.   Yes, but in addition the odd shaped earth shows the strength of gravity varying around the globe with the yellow and red areas being the strongest and the blue areas being the weakest.    ... and it happens to be April 1st in Europe.  	159
 I was at Z-Man VIP Table Top Day. I have two extremes of feedback.    First, I absolutely loved Pandemic: The Cure. It was fun, quick and super engaging. All around great time. Will be an insta-buy in the coming weeks of availability.   Secondly, Contagion was possibly the worst game I've ever played. It's not Pandemic. They branded it as such for marketing. It was dull, repetitive, slow and I couldn't wait to be done playing it.   Did Rampage get pulled back or have to be re-branded due to copyright? I thought I had heard something about that   My collection is chalk full of pretty heavy euros. I'd like to start adding some more 'fun' games into the collection, along the lines of King of Tokyo or 1st   Goal etc. I'd like an emphasis on more luck based, silly games just to get some laughs going. And I'm not looking for party games like Wits   Wagers or Cards against humanity   I think it's a must own for that very reason. It's not a must own because it's the best game ever. It's a must own because it's an easy game to teach people, get non-gamers in the door and experience the hobby a little.    I have 5 different Dominions and Trains. If you don't have Dominion in your collection, it needs to be. It's an essential game for board gamers. If it's definitely one or the other at this moment, go with Trains. There's more player interaction and some additional depth/more paths to victory due to the board.    Rising Sun is an expandalone. Similar to Dominion: Intrigue, it fits in with the base game as an expansion, or can be played as it's own as it comes with all the components.   tl;dr You can and should have both. If you can't, I'd say Trains.   I thought the same thing exact thing. Either he copied that idea or this is some kind of repost      Can't believe I didn't think to check to see if that exists. Wow. Everything is on reddit!   oops, autocorrect I didn't notice. should be 'from a macbook purchase'   Sorry?   You bought all that in 4 months?? Holy crap dude. Were you playing Monopoly with real money on those boards?    American is don't care about brown squirrels   That would also be an accurate assessment of my statement haha   I'm not a huge fan of co-op games, but this is really fun. I had the opportunity to go to Z-Man's VIP Event for Table Top day earlier this year and got to demo this. Definitely recommend it, especially if you like co-op games at all. Lots of fun!   I played Contagion at Z-Man's VIP TableTop event. It was probably the worst thing I've ever played.    ITT: Moist   Ha, not a problem. Can't go wrong either way!   That is just not reich.   I didn't draw any generalization from my comments. I just said that in this book, the characters were so horrible, they made the book cringe-worthy for me.    I don't think you should read Office Lover Boy to your daughter. Seems inappropriate.    I was on a huge kick, running through 20th century literature earlier this year and was loving reading and re-reading some classics. Then I got into **The Unbearable Lightness of Being by Milan Kundera.** Ugh. I couldn't stand anyone in the book. They all seemed some shamefully dramatic, trivial and annoying. I couldn't get with it. Cringed until the end.    A Few Acres of Snow   Memoir '44 is fantastic and often mentioned in these discussions.  I'm also a HUGE fan of A Few Acres of Snow [SU SD Review Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0YB9-yyke0).   1775: A Rebellion is also loads a fun, a great wargame. 2 players, but can scale up to 4 as well as pairs of 2 work together vs each other.

How do we score that? Is it actually a touchdown for the defense, or just a safety and offense punts?    No idea. I'm sure there's some reason. At some point I'm sure it came down to 'can we make more money by re-broadcasting this British show or re-creating it ourselves'   This will probably get buried, but can everyone stop getting butthurt about Americans remaking Utopia?? The issue is not if the original is good enough as is, the issue is ACCESS. The vast vast vast majority of Americans do not have access or aren't technologically savvy enough to find access to Utopia. My parents sure as shit aren't going to find torrents to download, but they'll watch the show when it's broadcast on HBO.    well it seems like the biggest difference is the extra shield people get at lvl 20. and the skip boost thing allows them to disappear/appear rapidly.

So I was excited when I logged in today and saw the 'CLASH' sector that says 'Level Advantages Disabled.' I entered a match, and it was the same exact thing. People were level 25-28, had over-armor and boost abilities that I didn't and I got rocked again. What's the deal with CLASH?

[Mississippi Queen, you know what I mean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFhM1XZsh6o)   Yea, unfortunately I started awhile ago on my iPad, and installed the game on my android phone last week in hopes to play there. Guess it's not to be.    Im sorry, but I dont want to be an emperor. Thats not my business. I dont want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each others happiness - not by each others misery. We dont want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.   Greed has poisoned mens souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost....    The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.   To those who can hear me, I say - do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed - the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.    Soldiers! dont give yourselves to brutes - men who despise you - enslave you - who regiment your lives - tell you what to do - what to think and what to feel! Who drill you - diet you - treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Dont give yourselves to these unnatural men - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You dont hate! Only the unloved hate - the unloved and the unnatural! Soldiers! Dont fight for slavery! Fight for liberty!   In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: the Kingdom of God is within man - not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power - the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.   Then - in the name of democracy - let us use that power - let us all unite. Let us fight for a new world - a decent world that will give men a chance to work - that will give youth a future and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfil that promise. They never will!   Dictators free themselves but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfil that promise! Let us fight to free the world - to do away with national barriers - to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all mens happiness. Soldiers! in the name of democracy, let us all unite!

I click the button in setting and absolutely nothing happens. Can't sync across devices without this step.    Do bases prevent your opponent from combatting your authority or do only outposts do that? The rules say "you may use combat to attack your opponent or their bases." does this mean you always have the choice of which to attack or just that combat is used against those two things when needed during the game?    Well, first of all, they were tied for 3rd best record. And I would argue they won 96 games in spite of Fredi.

Ha, this is my favorite. This should be on one of those unsuspecting signs/stitched patterns where it looks sweet, but is actually a sarcastic message.   Our group has a rule of no new games for anyone after 10pm. We've found that if we teach a new game late, there's a good chance whoever is learning the game isn't alert enough to fully pay attention, they get grumpy, disinterested and end up disliking the game. So no new games on late nights!      Yea, I think the ally powers work sooo much better in Star Realms. I just feel like in Ascension, I'm buying cards at random every time. Just grabbing whatever I can afford to buy/combat every turn. But Star Realms really escalates with the ally powers and it's much more advantageous to do your best to stack up a color. And the bases are much more influential than a mechana construct or others in Ascension   This game is great. It gets compared to Ascension a lot, but I enjoy it far more. The 'factions' chain together much much better in Star Realms and there's far more interaction due to combatting each other (and not just the attacking the cards in Ascension).       Q-Tipping my ears      No. The FBI (and other agencies) go at identity thieves in a big way.

Trains is super fun, can have a bunch of different ways to victory which is neat for a deck builder, and comes with a lot of cards in the base so it's always a unique experience. Get it!   Because it's your own stank. Sometimes it's less intense, sometimes it's more intense. Sometimes it's a little sweatier than other days. It's always an experience, and often an unpleasant surprise.

 You seem like a vindictive person if you are doing this partially out of spite. I am a little bit disappointed in you that you decided to play on that angle in your submission.       Can fathers also get this or does this only apply to mothers? It would only be fair for fathers to get the same treatment.          It would be even slower, what you have is the purgatory model. 56k modems are for heck, 28k modems are for hell.   	6
    Only the juciest survive       I DONT KNOW   I TOTALLY KNOW WHAT IM DOING    I DONT KNOW   I got nothin!   Fuck those periwinkle feet   Aww I just wanna lurk   I took a 4000 level intro to neuroscience class last semester and it blew my mind. What defines 'you', your personality, inhibitions, vocabulary and memory is in fact tangible and malleable. [Phineas Gage] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage) is a, perhaps THE example of this . I was just wondering what study or patient has surprised you the most?     Actually it's not all that hard anymore. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_pluripotent_stem_cells  Here's a slide from my cell and tissue engineering class that shows how we do this: http://i.imgur.com/qyJw0iD.jpg   Actually it is the only time I really ever get laid if I don't have a girlfriend at the time...   Alright I've seen summer heights high and it was fucking hilarious I'll check those out. I have so many shows to watch now soooo glad I found this subreddit y   Nope haven't seen it I'll have to check it out   Love archer, I'll have to check out the other two. Appreciate it   Already on season 3 haha loving this show thanks!   Nature already tries to kill you at every turn in Australia, the last thing we need are mutant drop bears gnawing your nuts off every time you walk underneath a tree man!      Yeah mental illness scares the fuck out of me, I read a story here from a paramedic send to a girls house by her mother because she was having an episode again.  He walked into the house and found the girl sitting by herself in the living room. Apparently as he walked in she stared at him for about 30 seconds and that stood up completely inhuman way that he said looked like something a human could never do. She then said something along the lines of I am the devil incarnate. She then held her hand up in way it seemed like she was holding something and said to him I Hold here the key to enter the gates of hell and walked up to him. He has absolutely no belief in the supernatural and he still said it was the scariest thing that has ever happened to him and it still freaks him the fuck out to this day.   So say the main character of this game is a paranoid schizophrenic. For example maybe he is the only person in this world to have telekinesis or something along these lines and despite his mental illness he has to overcome it to save the world. You would have to deal with that, all along dealing with things like hearing voices, hallucinations and other paranoid schizophrenic presents. You wouldn't be able to tell what was real and what wasn't although maybe there would be a subtle ability to recognize a pattern to get to the bottom of this. The game would be a total mind fuck but it would be really interesting to deal with problems and eye opening for people who don't know much about this disease   I think you should reread my post man. Dont think you fully understood it   Love workaholics I'll have to check the other two out. Appreciate it   So recently I've been on a huge comedy kick and I'm looking for more shows to keep this bender going. I love seinfeld and curb, WLIIA, scrubs, seasons 2-12 of the Simpsons, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Metalocalypse, squidbillies, superjail, venture bros, and a ton more there's no need to list. As you can see my tastes are really diverse and I'm open to anything, recommend me a hilarious new show and you won't regret it.   I also love british humor    Would that entertain you for eternity though or would you eventually get tired of it? I remember in the movie trainspotting they described the the feeling of shooting up heroin as far better than any orgasm you will ever have. This would be the exact same thing everyday and it just makes me wonder would you eventually get bored of pure bliss?   I always thought if I was groundhog dayed I would try a bunch of crazy drugs I would never try otherwise. I specifically thought of H, I've dabbled in opiates, even took OCs a couple times but never tried heroin. But in your predicament, you might as well make the best of it.   There are no downsides, you can't OD, you can't build up a tolerance, no money worries, etc. So I was wondering from people who have tried this, would doing heroin all day everyday make you feel good enough that you wouldn't mind being stuck in one day over and over again for an unimaginable amount of time? I think the writers of groundhog day said Bill Murray spent about 9000 years in his day.    Of course psychedelics would be really fucking interesting too and many other drugs would be a lot of fun but I have a feeling that it'd be kinda hard to find those in Puxatony.   10,000 trillion   Hmmm I wonder this every time I see you post and I need to get to the bottom of it. Any idea why I have you tagged as DOG FUCKER WOOF WOOF on RES?   Dammit it actually is ya monkey bastard   I agree I thought it was amazing, no clue why Snowtokia thought it was sloppy. Maybe he didn't realize when he hit the table it was intentional?   He's entitled to his opinion without beinga glass rubbing master ya know...   Yeah, maybe they are widely used I'd just never seen em before so I thought I'd help confused people like me out   I'll do my best to explain a 4D cube(hypercube). First we'll relate the 2nd and 3rd dimensions because it is much easier to comprehend. We begin with a 2D square, this is simple enough it exists in only the x and y planes. To get a 3D cube from a square, we draw another square with the same x and y coordinates but change the z coordinate. Now you have two squares, one above the other, and you can simply connect all the vertices to form a cube.  A cube exists in the x, y and z planes which intersect at 90 degree angles with each other. To get to the fourth dimension we need to add another plane which still intersects with the x, y and z plane at a 90 degree angle. I personally can't imagine what this looks like, I'm not sure if it's even possible for us to comprehend it, but mathematically it is possible. Lets call this fourth dimension w for simplicity's sake. A hypercube is simply two cubes with the same x, y and z coordinates, separated in the w direction, and connected at the vertices. Mathematically simple to describe, but a bitch to imagine.    I think common sense predicts that   It would probably be well before that actually...   DUH   Yeah I've thought about what a 4D object would be like quite a bit. The 4th dimension would be a direction that is perpendicular to the up and down, left and right, and away and towards directions(x, y, and z). A 4D creature observing us would be able to see all sides of us along with everything inside of us all at once.   If, say a 4D sphere were to pass through our world, to us it would look like a small sphere that appears out of nowhere and could even hang in midair, gradually gets bigger until it reaches a maximum size and then shrinks and disappears. The easiest way I've found to even kind of understand is to imagine us observing/interacting with a 2D world and kind extrapolate what it would be like to the interactions between a 4D world and a 3D world.   Carl Sagan has a great video I'm sure you can find on youtube where he explains the 4th dimensions with the poetic yet scientific style he was famous for.    I always thought those were called hyper-cubes... but yeah thats four spacial dimensions. I have no idea what the fuck three time demensions would be like.  One spacial dimension is easy enough to imagine however but it's hard to even think of time as a dimension, how the hell can you have 3D time? Such a mind fuck    Here's what NASA has to say about it. Still not much explaination though  http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/about/information/science_faq.html#36   One of the reasons I posted this is I was hoping someone could explain it. Although I doubt it's possible for our brains to comprehend three time dimensions, it's hard enough trying to imagine a fourth spacial dimension.   Yeah I know right, I definitely can comprehend this it's so simple and intuitive!      Here's a picture of these crabs:  http://i.imgur.com/8HMK76D.jpg      One good topic is how good at parallel parking I am. Always a great conversation starter   I'm about to be 23 years old and I've been depressed since about 14 or 15. At first I really had no reason to be depressed, I had a good group of friends, was part of the "popular" crowd, like that matters. I think what really kicked it off for me was getting pretty bad acne for most of high school. It hurt my self esteem and I don't think I've ever really recovered.  I am seeing a psychiatrist and am on lexapro and klonopin for anxiety. The depression is really just killing my work ethic which mean I'm struggling in school and lately I feel I've been even withdrawing from my friends here in college. I dread being awake and sleep way too much. Here is a little something I wrote while I was feeling really bad that I think outlines how I feel every day.    Suddenly, unexpectedly consciousness returned with a forceful jolt. Whatever he was dreaming, it was long gone to him now, it shattered like a glass dropping from a great height. He could feel a cold sweat encasing his body and threw off the blankets. It all quickly came back to him and, just like every morning, he wished it hadnt. The inanity, the despondence, the overwhelming feeling of dread accompanying each day, he could not imagine life without it. His only solace was that he could feel himself becoming more and more numb to it each morning. Maybe someday he would wake up and it wouldnt bother him anymore, maybe someday this would become normal for him, but today was not that day.  I was just wondering if you could give me any advice on how to get out of this tailspin. The only time I'm happy is when I am seeing a girl and I have been broken up with twice probably due to my depression. I just want to feel motivated and normal again.   But it would make your blood flow stronger because the blood vessels have less room to expand, lowering blood pressure.    Just wanted to let you know runny nose is the correct term   "Wir brauchen eier" -  Oliver Khan      7g's is a ton. I took 2 my first time and had a blast and have taken 4 before.

When you floss you're supposed to use a different part of the string for each tooth. You can't do that with these so you end up basically spreading more bacteria around your mouth than getting actual cleaning done.   That sounds shitty dude, your friends kind of seem like assholes... maybe you learned that from this experience?   It's _Taco duh   Der Spiegel?   The surface of the earth has no edge either if you think about it in only two dimensions. I picture the universe similar to that, but in three dimensions.

I agree our birth year is pretty great but the 2000 kids have it even easier. It's too bad a hell of a lot of them have fucked my mom according to xbox live, she's a nice lady!   Just tell your doctor about your fear of flying. He/she will give you enough xanax to curb your anxiety completely anytime you have to fly and you will not have a worry in the world.

Maybe, and this is a long shot, he was mad cause he wants to watch the show and doesn't know what it was called.   Hmmm food for thought   Happpened to me too man. Luckily mine was more of a hard graze of the balls so I was able to mask my pain while she kept riding me and I pretended nothing happened while crying and laughing on the inside at how retarded I am.   She never noticed anything was amiss but I think I may have told her the story afterwards at some point cause you gotta admit, it's pretty damn funny.   Just posting this to make sure I remember to do this. Fucking amazing idea and I'm suffering from pretty severe depression and I feel this could be beneficial.  I tend to self medicatee with drugs and alcohol so I've gotta make sure I dont right down "I got really fucked out on opiates" or something like that.   Possibly the most heart wrenching episode of the entire series, hope you didn't ruin it for anyone.   I agree with 1 100% but I think you are vastly generalizing the police based on a minority of shitty cops...   Enjoy your orangered I do this exact same thing as well... probably why I mostly lurk   Ahh the old days when the history channel wasnt all aliens and ax men   Maybe I'm a bit odd but honestly fake rape/hardcore bondage turn me on. Not too much so that its the only type of porn I watch, but I'll throw it in rotation every now and then.  No idea why I like it and it disgusts me in real life or if its real but I guess it's the whole domination/power thing. When im having sex with I'll get into dirty talk a bit like "you've been such a naughty girl" etc... Wow that sounds fucking lame typed out but I think the whole exchange is fairly normal. I may be just jaded by porn so someone please let me know if this is odd or I am fucked up freak.   ITS COMING SOON I CANT WAIT   I got your back big guy   I agree the fact that he grouped both acid and ecstasy with meth just makes absolutely no sense... I probably thought similarly when I was like 16 but that was 7 years and a few trips ago.  Don't get me wrong they're not healthy for you by any means, ecstasy more so than acid, but they're definitely not meth.   Sounds like you really don't know much about drugs at all. Anyone who has any sense would tell you coke is a much worse drug than acid... care to explain your reasoning?   I agree about time for me to take off if you know what I mean ;)   GIRL LOOK AT THAT BODY   We can only hope   Hope you had fun writing that cause I'm sure as hell not going to read it.   Good rule yourself buddy.   Also yes I realize the irony(probably not quite the right word but I can't think of anything better) of this post.   Get better friends   Congratulations! I can't really relate, I've been blessed with a really fast metabolism but I'm sure that will slow down as I get older(only 22 now).   Right now, I can basically eat anything I want, be completely sedentary and not gain any weight whatsoever. Add the fact that unless I'm eating one of the few foods I absolutely love, I see eating more as an inconvenience than anything and you get my 6' 135 lbs self.   Opposite ends of the spectrum I guess, I can definitely feel the physical effects of being slightly underweight but I still consider myself very lucky.  PS you speak English better than half of the native speakers here.       Well yeah, I wouldn't say it to someone I just met or am just acquaintances with but with my girlfriend or other girls I'm decent friends with I am sure I'm not offending anyone. Maybe it's just my personality but it's very obvious I'm joking as I'm usually a very nice and pleasant person.  Also it's not like I do this all the time or even very often at all.

 To also be boring; George R. R. Martin has actually disclosed the general plot points and ending of the series/characters to the producers/directors (can't remember which), in respect to their efforts with the show, his slow writing and advancing years.   Furbys. Back when they first came out, it seemed I was the only one in my school that didn't like them (and didn't talk in their ridiculous annoying voice in everyday life).   I agree with the duck face part, but the occasional selfie is acceptable (especially when done right with a group of friends/genuinely interesting situation (I.e. With a respected celebrity (I'd be happy with a selfie with Hugh Jackman, Emma Watson or Daniel Radcliffe myself)))   There's this one about a Jewish carpenter and his dad a few years back that always cracks me up...   Are the DS and 3DS consoles region-locked?  And secondly, can you play DS games on a 3DS (obviously I know the game wouldn't be in 3D)?   Either;  -Guy putting glass jar up his anus and it breaking (lots of blood)(ouch),  -Same guy putting a screwdriver down his urethra (even more blood)(double ouch)     It was the first fictional character that I ever created, and I almost always use him as my username now-a-days.      Thirteen.  I'm not upset nor proud of it, but there more than a couple that I regret.      Roller Coaster rides, Injections, Answering my first call as a Samaritans Volunteer.      [Request] Can anyone make one of these for me if I give them the pokemon list? I'd love to have one but I'm absolutely shocking with computers (not to mention that I'm backpacking at the moment so all I've got is a shitty little netbook that's about ten years old).  http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/2rqpg1/finally_found_a_template_that_is_specific_enough_d/cnjfexq   I didn't get a computer or internet access until (estimating here) 2002/3? So when I started playing Pokemon I didn't have that benefit. Not to mention I wasn't aware of a "walkthrough" or "guide" website that early on (obviously I may be wrong).   You have inspired my girlfriend (a doodler herself) and I, I'm just about to set it up to get her first number! :)   Any of my brethren that have been around from the beginning of the video game series, do you feel nostalgia for the times when all the answers weren't available instantly online (i.e. when we didn't have the internet)?  I miss the rush of discovering a new technique or finding out a new Pokemon in an area (or even going off to the Game store to buy the guide, which still never held ALL the answers).   THAT'S how repel works!? I never knew!   Having not played past Black and White, I'm getting this just from what I can glean from Serebii (can't find a definitive guide to it).  So you put up a Pokemon or a whole team?  And you get a random single Pokemon or a random whole team?   What is the repel trick?   Playing through White at the moment, only just reached the first set of doubles grass, and am staying there to grind up my Drillbur.  Wanted to know if anyone else grinds, and to what extent? (Or do you just rely on type advantages to see you through the gyms?)   Full time writer. I've got two short stories published and a third being published later this year, but I'd love to be churning out short stories all the time, writing comic and tv/movie scripts and writing a novel or two a year like some professional authors that I know (google Dan Abnett, for example).   I know I'd regret it as it progressed, but I'd give it a go, just for the experience. Plus if the comments so far are anything to go by, I'd be uncommon as a guy who had elected to have a child!   My childhood bedroom.  From since the youngest I can remember until the day my mum and I moved out, I would NEVER sleep facing my bedroom door. I knew, and not thought, KNEW that there was something in my doorway, and that if I turned over whenever I woke up in the night that it could come in and get me.  It always "felt" evil, or malicious if you prefer, and I'd always wake up to the sound of the hallway floorboards creaking (the hallway ran parallel to my bedroom). My I told my mum and dad (when he still lived with us) they both said it was next door walking up or down their own hallway (our house was semi-attached, and our hallways were parallel too). The only problem with that theory was that I'd played in that house all my life - I knew the difference between the floorboards creaking because of someone walking down our side or theirs. And it was most definitely our side (the two steps down halfway along the hall were loose on our side, they weren't on their side - I know because the neighbour on that side babysat me fairly often).  So, yeah, I was scared of whatever that was.   Our interests are very varied, but we also don't want to limit ourselves - we want to try new things and do odd tours and such. Anything weird and wonderful is a bonus, as is cheap!  We'll be starting in Sydney, heading slowly up to Cairns, we've planned for a month, though we don't have any ideas of how long we'll spend where.   What do you think is the least popular Pokemon?  Once upon a time I would have said Magikarp, but because of it's useless nature, and of course it's evolution, everyone seems to like the little guy now.  So there's the question, who do you think is the least liked/used Pokemon?   I'm that far behind that I've firmly decided to restart when I do get properly back into it.  I'll play Fire Red/Leaf Green and go from there (unless GameFreak reboot Gen I again to bring it onto the DS cartridge so that the entire series is on that format).   So, from another thread I created, I vented a little about this issues. TOO MANY LEGENDARY POKEMON!  I've no idea what GameFreak were thinking in generations 3/4/5 (10/13/10 legendary pokemon added respectively), but now there are a total of 46 "legendary" pokemon, most of which you can't actually get in-game without trading (or special items from events/downloads).  I'd like to see some of them downgraded from legendary status, to reduce the number (to thus make the title of legendary mean something once more), and maybe in the next generation have them all available to capture in one way or another without having to have special access to things. I know it's to increase interest and revenue in some cases, but it's so annoying.  I'd propose having a couple in the usual places, he iconic/game centered legendary in the main dungeon/dungeons (like Mewtwo, or Lugia, for example, in their respective games), and have the others available via different achievements or quests.  Like when we had to solve all the puzzles to make the unknowns appear, or complete similar puzzles to get at the Regis.  Keep the dogs (and the -ion pokemon from B/W) roaming, but make them appear only during certain months, or seasons, to make it more feasible.  Make a journey through a series of complicated and dangerous/challenging islands with Pokemon restrictions or something to access some of the legendary birds.  Just stop with the ridiculousness!      I'm going to go ahead and be the outcast - Bianca.  I like the fact that her character has some real-world issues revolving around her, with confidence and her Dad's over-protectiveness. It brings a more likable aspect to her, and gives her so much more depth than Cheren's character, who seems to be the same old mold rival aspect - wants to win against you all the time, thinks he's better than you at first etc etc.   DON'T TELL ME! lol As I said I haven't played anything past Black and White, so have no idea what Delta Episode is, and want to remain that way (I will play them all some day!) ;)  Glad there is some up points of them re-releasing 3rd gen then, aside from the graphics and mechanics update.   I hope they won't have a "final" game, as I hope Pokemon will never end (yes I understand that'd mean a hell of a lot more Pokemon to catch, even more than the crazy number there is currently), but I'd hope that they could do like a ongoing game?  Like you pay for the cartridge, and every year or two they release an update for it (with ongoing monthly patches to repair any bugs etc), that unlocks a new region and pokemon, and updates the older one/ones to keep them fresh too.   It's ridiculous, epecially when you look back at the numbers;  1st Gen - 4 (Total 4) 2nd Gen - 5 (Total 9) 3rd Gen - 10 (Total 19) 4th Gen - 13 (Total 32) 5th Gen - 10 (Total 42) 6th Gen - 4 (Total 46)  6th Gen looks like they've finally realised what they've been doing and reigned themselves in, but jeeze, what happened in 3rd/4th/5th!?   So I've seen some commenters with Pokemon avatars in their pokeball symbol when they comment...how do I get me one of these!?   I played them all up to B/W, didn't have the money to get the sequels and here I am, super behind on everything!   I'd love to play BW2/X/Y/ORAS, but alas I'm backpacking around Australia so don't have the money to spare (or a 3DS if I did get the games!).  I've heard a lot of good things about the newer gens, and the graphics look unreal.  I don't remember 4th gen as much as I remember 3rd, and what I remember about 3rd gen is a whole lot of faffing about (if I recall correctly).   I'm interested, how old are you? Also how do you feel when you hear about the older games, that you hadn't played prior to Y?   I love Gold and Silver best, adventure-wise. It boggles my mind that GameFreak haven't made a game since then that has two regions in it. It gave so much more depth to completing the elite four - instead of "oh, I've done the elite four, all that's left is to grind them repeatedly until my pokemon are completely high levels and I've caught every pokemon" it was "man, now I've got a whole new area to explore, new challenging gyms and a beefed up E4 to take on! I loved that about it.   Exactly! This is the kind of thing that makes me feel old! Legendary back then meant something...Mewtwo, the birds, hell even Dragonite was semi-legendary because of the appalling amount of work you had to put into getting it so late in the game (unless you cheated and game cornered it).  Nowadays (shakes broom/rake) there's so many "legendary" pokemon now the name is just a by-word for "end of game super-pokemon", "current game mascot/icon" and/or "downloadable content only".   Twice - first I moved across the country (UK) when I went to university; half of the decision to go to uni was to escape my old life and explore a different me. I was MUCH happier.  The second time was November last year - My girlfriend and I have flown to Sydney (where we still are) and are working on a Working Holiday Visa to travel around.  Both times have been really refreshing for me, especially meeting all the new people who don't know you, and don't have any preconceptions about who you are or what you're like. It's a great feeling of opportunity.   I'm 25, so I'm of the generation that has grown up with Pokemon since before it was made. Have been hovering around the Pokemon subreddit and some of the things I've seen have made me feelquite Poke-old, and I was wondering if there are any others in the same boat as me.  I first encountered Pokemon Red/Blue in the playground at primary school. A friend was playing it, and I traded just about half my trading card collection just to borrow it for a whole weekend, and wasn't allowed to overwrite his save game. I put in fresh batteries of my own, and started a new game, and played it pretty much the whole weekend without stopping (i borrowed his gameboy too, as I didn't own one then).  A year later Yellow came out over in Canada, and my god father sent me a copy over. My Mum bought me a gameboy pocket (red, if you wanted to know), and I played the hell out of that game.  Another year later, and I badgered my Dad into buying me a Gameboy Colour (Pikachu edition), and got Gold AND Silver. I can't remember when exactly I bought Crystal, but it must have been some time later.  I must have dropped out of the loop for a little while, as my next device was a Gameboy Advance SP and, of course, I got Ruby and Sapphire.  Now my progression from there is hazy, but the last game I owned and played was Black/White. I have played through from the beginning of the series, and as stated earlier, I feel old when I see some people's comments on here.  So there you are, any other Poke-riginals out there? What's your story?   Hi guys,  I'm wanting to start planning out a "favourites" team - a Pokemon team made up of six of my favourite Pokemon, that have a complimentary type set across the board.  So in this vein, I'd like to request a Microsoft Excel file with all the pokemon listed (preferably in National Pokedex Order), with their types next to them. Maybe;  Column 1 = National Pokedex # Column 2 = Name Column 3 = Type 1 Column 4 = Type 2  That way I can go through a visual list online and delete any that I don't like, then sort them accordingly.   [Request] Can anyone make one of these for me if I give them the pokemon list? I'd love to have one but I'm absolutely shocking with computers (not to mention that I'm backpacking at the moment so all I've got is a shitty little netbook that's about ten years old).   http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/2rqpg1/finally_found_a_template_that_is_specific_enough_d/cnjfexq  	42
 He cringes even more when he vapes it and I tell him that he's got my PENIS Juice in his mouth.   I can't remember his name on here, but if you see this, thank you for the naming idea!      Yep, if that's the risk you have to take, so be it.  The US does it all the time, they apologise for it, and the world forgets.  We live in a shit world, and that's the reality of it.   Thank you.. As someone who never has and never will bookface, you're a champ.   Thankfully the sound also failed on the video.   Peggy!, the boy.   I just googled up Zoe Quinn..   It would need to be a cold day in hell and about 40 bottles of JD before I would even consider seeing her naked.   So you're running a single coil and not dual?  I'm waiting for my first dripper to arrive and not sure if I should hit a dual coil or single coil setup.  I did a dual .8 coil setup in my Kayfun and it was horrible, but I'm guessing it will be different in a dripper.  I was planning a single 1.1 coil as I prefer the cooler Vape   I sold mine by word of mouth to a fellow vaper that was on an evod..  The SVD is a great unit, but it's too big and ugly    What's your setup mate?  Mod, tank, coils etc   You're being down voted for expressing your own personal opinion..   Post a cat video, that's what this place (Reddit) thrives off.  I'm with you, fuck ISIS and nuke the shit out of all of them.     Fat Bastard from Austin Powers - 'I'm sad cause I eat, and I eat cause I'm sad, its a vicious cycle'   That cop at the end had the same attitude, he was walking up like a curious bystander with his hands behind his back..    Yeah Nah, the professor Finks on here ruined that for me.   Thankfully I'm using Reddit on the mobile, each link comes up with the address instead of launching.   Its 11pm here and really didn't feel like making any of them purple if they were live leak vids :)   All was awesome in your post, until the last line.   Hmm.. Poor bastard suffered the whole way through, there goes my theory and hoping he had some sort of luck in the situation.   Sex, wife and condom.. One of the three don't fit in the equation.   It would be terrifying but probably not painful?, I need someone sciencey to back me up, but he would've knocked himself out with the lack of oxygen that he used up and the carbon dioxide that he was exhaling..  I reckon drowning would have to be the most terrifying way to die.   Not specifically for heating in the use you are after.  Where are you based? As you can buy the stuff for a dollar a meter at most vape places      Hats, t-shirts and kids parents telling stories about their kids saying Yolo and when they did it. I blame you America.   Haha, my background is eastern European, I can relate.   Australia is late to catch on to American fads.. Its here and its painful.   In your awesomeness, can you please kill off yolo as well?   Your post reminds me of that old meme where there is a smoking hot girl in the pic, sub titled 'she's someone else's headache' - so very true.      I gave you an upvote, a sympathy one..   Yup.. Only thing I change is the cotton when I'm switching flavours or if its starting to taste a little burnt.   A couple hits of the coil dry burns all the crap off it ready for a re-wicking.   What's their stance on abortion?   I read all of these articles and it still doesn't change the facts of our society and world we live in.  Breathing in vapour will always be safer than inhaling burning matter and smoke, but the amount of money governments will lose on tobacco tax won't help us get vaping mainstream.  All smokers have basically covered themselves and 2 others for medical bills when it comes to the amount of tax being paid per packet smoked.  The only way I see vaping getting anywhere is when it is taxed severely and vape companies start donating ludicrous amounts of money to government parties.  The tobacco industry has been a controlling asshole for many years, and will continue to be.  tl;dr - government will lose too much money if vaping takes over, tobacco industries will always stranglehold us.   Why don't you just remove the legs?   Mine is on its way as we speak :)   I did, I never said I realised it was only for AMA's did I?   Now fuck off back to your hole you crawled out of.   Installed  opened  love the design, hate that its only AMA  uninstalled   Thanks mate appreciate it    I remember watching the behind the scenes of that episode, the cast and crew actually didn't know what her name was going to be until the very end of the shoot..   One of the crowd members guessed it as Delores, and funny enough they only thought of the name a few moments before    I have a Nemesis clone which is now all battered and bruised.. Is the stingray clone any good?   I have a Chi You, but its too chunky.   I read your comment in Samuel L Jacksons voice from Pulp Fiction.. When he was discussing his knowledge of giving a foot massage.. "I'm the foot fucking master"   Check the post history.. The same tone of comments are littered all across Reddit.   The troll seems legit..  From the post history, I can make out that she's a fat black woman that was more than likely backhanded a few times.    Exactly my story, same as Seinfeld as well.   That's the one!!   Where are you flying from?  I was up there over the weekend and I don't know what it is with that place, my tank kept on leaking like a bitch of a thing! Must be the humidity or warmth etc.  Drove me insane.    Dale, why are you removing the bug from the Bugabago?     You're doing gods work there son,   There was a clip of the wedding where they were shaking hands in front of the cake..  Hank is so square and PG that it just makes his character funnier.   This one actually made me laugh out loud. Well done   I'm sorry, but on Reddit the majority come across just like he did   Settle down there Neck beard.  r/atheism wants you back over there.  Fucking atheists are worse than hardcore religious types.   Lol you know some of the words I said? :)  Mate, I'm happy to help you out with whatever you need to get started, PM me any questions you may have.. I started off on the evod and every single step between till I found my mech mod and tank that I love.     I literally just drove back from Qld, I spent the whole weekend Vaping, and not a word said by anyone.  The only thing I heard was someone whispering 'look at his ecig thing.. Its a bit big' - had my nemesis running an 18650 and a Kayfun.   My dad was using YouTube to Google search up until 6 months ago.. No matter how much explaining I do, it will all just be jargon.  He knows the 'Blue E' is how he gets to Google.    This is what I worry about on a daily basis   It might, but it works a lot cleaner and smoother than IE   Haha I did that with Chrome.   Its cut the 'what's wrong with the computer?' Phone calls by over 80%   Count me in as a PM target as well, happy to chat and with some experience behind me (personal)   Flick me a PM mate, I'm now 30, all was going well in life for me until s lot of crap came my way and sent me in a spiral. There is light on the other end and I'd be happy to chat with you whenever you feel. Anytime.   I was home for a week with a bad flu, did 1-13 in a row!   There is more to every story than what the media portrays to you.  There is always a LOT more.  In the case of Aborigines, unfortunately, the majority ruin it for the minority, and not the other way around.  There are a lot that genuinely try hard, are successful, and lead a great life.. Then there are the ones that take everything for granted, get given everything on a silver platter, get free housing, free schooling, free medical, free or heavily subsidised EVERYTHING, and still manage to ruin it and disrespect it.  I'm not racist towards any race in particular, I'm equally racist towards everyone.   Oh really?..   Don't worry about WA, go for a walk through redfern and then tell me how many 'Aboriginals' even deserve to see a doctor (paid for with my tax dollars)  This is a bait thread.     Because, too-tsunami must not use the phone!   Will this work at officeworks in Australia? :(  We rebadged your store.   The commercials here in Aus always state 'if you're a non smoker, the average price will be...' Technically I'm not a smoker.. Considering its not smoke I'm inhaling.   www.nicvape.com - buy the nicotine, then support your local vape shops and buy juice here.. It tastes awesome and you'll get it straight away.   The ironic part of it is, this table doesn't exist in Aus..    Fedora, Trilby, same-same.  Still tacky as hell.   Well... I guess you are!  Where's your falcon?   Shi SHAAAAAH!, Squirrel Tactics!   We are just backing up the internet in case it breaks one day....   No!, this is why his wife left him, and why he's fat, and Bald.   OBJECTURE!   I am Dale, shut up Bill.   I'm sorry, but I'm a stickler for finishes, and they way you have that installed looks absolutely horrible.  You could've at least used clear tape and not that bright blue painting masking tape.     Haha   I'm doing 3ml a day at the moment... In a Kayfun   I thought that was Dennis Leary   For the life of me, I've never heard of someone polishing off a 15ml bottle of juice in a day!  That used to last me 2 weeks in my Evod!   The only company that hasn't fucked me around yet is nicvape.   What's wrong with the button?  All I did was the magnet upgrade and it didn't even need that   Most reliable for me is my Nemesis clone and the Kayfun clone.   There isn't anything to really malfunction here.  Most reliable VV has been my SVD with a protank 2, and least reliable is my Sigelei Zmax v5.   Google it!   That's horrible.   Can vouch, watched a few docos on those guys.. Seriously evil bunch.   They MS13 for short?   Ohh nooo.. The card says Moops!   Moops   This video doesn't show a crazy girlfriend, it's just a video of a soft-cock that will always be treated like one if he keeps this up.   Never really knew remixes like this existed, some of the other tracks are even better    Because they're a bunch of fucks that were raised in a shitty family and were starved for attention.  Now that they're grown up, they'll do anything to get that attention, even if it means making others suffer.  I hold a special place for people like this piece of shit, and it's called 'I hope he gets hit by a car driven by that boys parents'.    No lie, everyone has their own beholder.   You may not be attractive to one person but you may be very attractive to another.   So, I_have_so_many_names - you're a beautiful person too.   Don't stress OP, I think you're pretty / handsome in your own little way.   Everyone is.     Anyone have a list of their own personal Dale Gribble episodes they recommend?  Shi Shaaaa!   The Amiga 500   He might've been checking if the grass really was greener on the other side?   All I need now is a portable Amiga 500   Hucci - Cashmere.  The best part of the track is in the video.. The rest of it is pretty ordinary   Hey bud, you've become my favourite reviewer. Keep up the good work and humour!!   Or that being too clever can make you look like an asshole.   I've so far seen a guy jam an elephant sized dildo up his ass, a hand blown off, a hole in someone's face, all whilst I've been in this sub..   This has been the most mentally disturbing one of all, it had me physically cringing as well.  Those kids will be mentally scarred for life    That is some interesting info and thank you.  I've seen the hardware get better and better, and with the new software and control it will bring, hopefully the 2 can  match.  The OS is where it needs to be from a look and feel perspective, its buttery smooth, its fast, and now can work on minimal hardware specs. Its about time they sort out the camera.   Boop   Really though? Isn't it just another interface lift? I haven't really seen much posted about camera improvements on the N5, hoping someone running L can verify the difference for me, if any..  	102
 Reasonable fuck-up here. Don't take it to heart, I'd be thinking the same thing if I were you.   All the cool kids do it.   Everyone has one. Is it waking up alongside your SO, shooting up, having the perfect breakfast, smoking a cig, taking the time to put on your face, creeping on the neighbors, or maybe just listening to the outside world?    I was really young when my grandma died, maybe 5 or 6. My memories of her are brief (her love of cheetah fashion, Sunday morning breakfast) and after she passed away my dad was able to grab her perfume bottle. Sixteen years later, I can't help but to unscrew the top and simply smell the perfume dispenser. Everything about her floods my senses for that brief moment.  I'm scared one day there will be nothing left, so I never spray it.    Cookie dough.     Wasabi-laced hot wings.   Definitely not sarcasm..   Wait. Guys don't find that attractive?!   Why do females always need a bathroom buddy? I'm pretty sure if one falls into the toilet the other isn't gonna do much to save her. Rapists don't appear in toilets, just peaceful creeps. And lastly, if it's just to talk about dumb stuff -like if he ACTUALLY meant to brush his hand against hers when reaching for their drink then neither if them should be dating anyway. Go get a hobby instead.   Shards of glass sounds more appealing.   Dreams and screams? Daddy Issues?   	11
 My wife and I love that so, here, have an upvote.    What motivated you to write the song Hesitate? Where were you at the time, psychologically speaking?     	2
 I agree with that but thats basically what i just said. There are going to sell more physical copies so it justifies a higher cost but that doesnt reflect the cost difference. They would only have to sell 2.2 million digital to reach the profit of 3.4 physival, but they might not sell as many total if it were only digital.    Im not asking you what you believe is true but how you came to that conclusion and what roles like upbringing and demographic played.    If your answer is i have questioned christianity but came to the conclusion i just know it to be true, thats an acceptable answer. Im just saying i feel you didnt touch on every question so im trying to dig a lil deeper But i respect your answers and appreciate your reply   It doesnt touch on if everything in your faith you see eye 2 eye with, why you connect with paul, your upbringing and demographic and their roles? Basically the 4 questions i posed   Thats hardly answering the questions i posed, maybe the title but not the ones im after. I do appreciate your replys    I understand you think its true. But specifically what about christianity settled these doubts? Did your upbrining play a part? Do you think where you were born played a part in your choice? Are there things inside your faith you dont see eye to eye with?   I understand your comments but it offers me no insight in how you have personally dealt with these questions which is what im after.   I disagree. One or two of those things maybe not a big contributor but all of them combined becomes a factor.    Lets say its only 2% difference in total cost between digital and tangible. That might not sound like alot but its probaly close to 100s of thousands dollar difference. Especially when your profit margin is higher with digital copies.     Also another reason games are not digitized is the market is higher for physical games. Gamers like the option to be able to trade in games when done and purchase old ones that digital copies cant offer. This is in some way justifies a higher cost to sell more games.   You are part of UU?   I know the bible well. I want to know how you personally answer these questions not paul.   The devil in the white city, erick larson.     Most people i talk to havent heard of it. Its the most entertaining non fiction work imo. A dual story about americas 1st serial killer and the 1st world fair's main architect. The amount of staples in american culture that came from the fair will astound you and the killers dark tale will shock you.   Your reasoning is very good. Although i disagree it isnt significantly cheaper. Theres no shipping cost, dont have to invest in boxes or discs, or designers of the two and without having a middle man your profit is higher.    What about the other questions?   But have you questioned your faith choice in the forms of the 4 questions posed?   Nba has a salary cap which means teams contract cost per year has to be under a certain amount. For ex, say the salary cap is 60million in 2016, that means Golden states player contracts total has to be under 60 million in 2016.  The cap changes based on the previous years leagues earning. The reasoning behind the cap is to control league cost and to keep teams competitive.      Nba has a "soft" salary cap. Which means there are circumstances in which a team is allowed over the cap. When a team unjustly goes over this cap the penalty is usually minor in the form of a "salary tax". This is different than in the Nfl.    Free agents. A unrestricted Fa is a player whose contract has run out and other teams can make an offer. A rescrited Fa is a player whose contract has run out but in order to sign him conditions apply. Like a team will place a draft pick on a restricted Fa if a team wants him enough and signs that Fa they forfeit a pick to players former team. This condition only last for part of the offseason and allows teams who can meet these conditions to have first dibbs.    Veterans minium is the lowest a team is allowed to pay a vet. The min is lower for those players for are not vets. This bar is usually set during collective bargaining agreements between the owners and players union.    The max is the highest a team can pay any one player. This can vary. Because of a soft salary cap, a team is allowed to go over the cap to keep a player on their roster. Say stephen curry is a Fa. Golden state will be allowed to offer him a higher max deal than clevland, because GS can exceed the cap to try and keep him. This is really to allow small market teams to retain stars by being able to offer them more money, as well as othe reasons.    I am a former christian, i still struggle with the idea of God and am curious about certain things ive had troubling answering and how those who still believe personally can/do. My point is not to offend but to understand So i might pry a little into responses with why's and how's. I had a similar post recently that had some enlighting results.     I will also add i dont think it immoral or wrong to question your faith choice, it is healthy and will only strengthen and enlighten personal truths, whatever that truth turns out to be for you.     Ive always wondered how you can be certain your religion is the right one, Gods intended religion. How much certainity comes from your upbringing and/or demographic and would it be different if some factors were even slightly changed. So i pose a few questions to seek some insight from those who are christians who have undoubtly had the same questions enter their mind and how they responded. And if you havent asked yourself these questions why not?     How can you be sure, out of the countless religions including the different forms of christianity, you have choosen right? And do you think, to those who it applies to, your upbringing and/or demographic has had influence on this choice?     Have you given any effort into looking at other religions and their teaching to confirm your choice? Why or why not?    Have you had moments where you question your choice? If so why or what settled these doubts?     And do you find everything in your religion agreeable, including certain events/passages in the bible? Why or why not?     I watch the combine very close every year. I remember the pass rush drills this guy with the crazy hair performing on another level than every one else. I followed up on him tapes stats etc, and b/c of his injury and slow 40 knew he would be a steal for someone.    I couldnt believe we drafted him and if he can stay healthy he will be the best pick of the draft.    Thats ok. If you cannot understand the question in terms of adam and eve's story i have no intention of trying anymore. Ive gotten a fair share of enlightening responses.   You imply I didn't offer you to make a new thread several times, but you seem to conveintly not bring that up.     Again you like to have discussions in threads that have nothing to do with OPs topic. Thanks for reminding me how fruitless and childish your exchanges are and I will not be responding to any more of them. Please stop sending me messages unsolicited for the third and hopefully final time.    You are still referring to having the debate in the wrong thread, what you cant grasp about that is the heart of your childish comments.    You never once directed me to one of your threads thats again more of your childish games.     And frankly the jokes on you this interview proves nothing about the prestige.   Thats not the truth, i repeatedly tried to move the debate to a more fitting thread, we were in a thread about best film endings not the prestige or its intrepertations, which you refused to do. You would also say i was trying to force you into a debate, followed by messages of you trying to rebute my points in an inapproiate thread. Very similar to what you are doing here.    I have never ducked your points but when you started making comments like the minority is always wrong and such it became apparent a reasonable debate would not be possible. So to continue on in a wrong thread was pointless.     Again, as ive told you 3-4 times now, if you want to debate the prestige make a thread, or lets continue in an existing one. But to forward me a thread where Nolan says nothing to swing the debate 1 way or the other as if it magically proves your right is the kind of thing i can expect from you but will no longer engage in.   There is no mention about his early movies nor does he say anything about the prestige. The way you just shrug off anything i have to say about the topic without given my views a chance was quite childish as is this message and i dont see us having any common ground to have a productive conversation.     On the other hand you find Nolan specifically talk about the prestige and the machine i would be interested in that.   If you account you being fired for not doing your job or not following the rules, then you refuse to leave this place of buiness(cant call it your job you have been fired), so secruity has to remove you because you refuse to leave this place you no longer have the right to be, and you consider this violence its not only ludacris its nonsensical, and i dont see how we will ever find common ground.   Well without complicating things the n word can do the most damage quickly    So if you agree im saying in a simplified way lets stop treating it as more nasty than the other slurs and curses. Not to say its ok to use or victims shouldnt be offended   My other big point here is the n word has no equal. So if its used a recipent might feel like violence is the only answer. He cant come back with cracker or spic etc it doesnt have the same power.    So im saying theres 3 options      1 continue to let the n word have no equal. Which im trying to offer an alternative     2 give the n word an equal. This would just seem immplausiable and encourage the behavior that should stop     3. Treat the n word like every other slur and curse. This is very simplified but the heart of my argument here in option 3   You can refuse to be humilated by returning the favor it in no ways suggest violence. If you constantly show up late and the boss threatens your job this in no way justifies violence. If you refuse to leave your job after being fired i would assume the police would be called.    It seems you are saying anything you perceive as disagreeable to your views like someone calls you a name in a non violent matter you can justify violence. If i understand this correctly You either have major anger problems or im not understanding your point.   Good point on my CMV ill have to rephrase that, as i can see that implying the wrong intention.    Let me start by this, by trying not to use power, would you agree the n word is widely considered the nastiest most looked down upon racist slur? Its more powerful(cant find another way to express) than cracker spic fag, etc.?   See we are not coming to a mutual understanding of what a threat is. So its impossible to say the source is a threat when we dont look at a threat the same way.    Your boss can threaten your job, it has no relation to violence.     A racist can say the n word with out the threat of violence with just the intention of trying to humilate you. If you percieve that as violent threat that is a problem.    Now a racist can say hey n ill kill you. Thats obviously a threat of violence that i could agree a physical reaction could be well with in reason. But for that matter in this instance you could replace n with any word and it would still be the same threat.       Its important to call out degarogtory language whenever its used against majority or minority i will first point out.     You imply that im saying the word should just be accepted and treated like someone saying good morning. If you cant see the clear distinction im making this conversation will not be productive. You dont have to agree but if you are drawing the wrong conclusion then the intended one, we are just clarifying previous points instead of making forward progress.     I would suggest reading my post and answers to not only you but others again to get a clear sense of where im coming from. I cant attempt to change my view if you dont understand them.   Word powered by a threat or a word powered by a threat of violence?   No you completely misunderstand my points.     Racist will always use the word. Its up to the recipent to decide what it means to them and how they respond but this in noway justifies its usage. This lessens the damage done and by no way downplays the words racism or condons people to use it more.    Yes in a way im putting responsibilty on the victim to change what damage is caused because by reacting a certain way you will establish it as a racist verbal nuke that will always be used as opposed to treating it as any other curse.     But again you keep going back to the possibilty of this, which Is Not the topic. Where the power comes from is. With that said the word is only viewed as racist in certain context, so that just proves the word can be treated as non offensive by the recipent.   Great points and one im kind of hinting to specifically. Let me elaborate by compressing the argument i make to 2 races white and black, although the argument is not mutually exclusive to these 2.     A black has no verbal nuke compared to a white having the verbal nuke of the n word. So the best situation is no one has verbal nukes. But by the first statement made in this paragraph the second best option of everyone having verbal nukes is impossible. So the best situation becomes the only one. The only way to suceed at this is to disarm those who have a verbal nuke. This is basically my point im trying to make.   By making an analogy you are comparing physical violence to spoken words. I concede that it is not saying they are the same but i strongly disagree with your comparing of the two.     I never stated it would be easy just that it is possible. Furthermore the topic is not about the possibilty anyway but about the source of the power.   we disagree that it's a threat of violence. The word has no power, ts nothing more than a word, but the reaction to it gives it power. I don't see how your knife comparison makes sense if the word is not a threat of violence.    That's like someone throwing a plastic knife at you, and you retaliate with a real knife.    I don't understand the your point feel free to elaborate.  But you are also saying the threat is one of violence meet with violence, I dont understand your distinction here.    Didn't you try to make the point that the power of the word comes from the threAt of violence, a bit contradictory of you wouldn't you say?    True, but kind of like Sam harris acting against the taboo of critizing religion, is similar to this post. If you don't bring awareness to taboos they will never change and be accepted.    Again where in the definition of worship does it sAy you have to believe in the thing you are expressing revere or adoration for. You are adding to the definition as you please to fit your argument here. It might not make sense to you that worship has to be followed with belief or it doesn't count but that's not how the word is defined, like your armament position on a verb that I disagree with but have conceded because my point is not clearly defined as so the same thing is happening here but you refuse to concede by adding to the definition.      Again comparing Greece to today is crazy. The war famine mistreatment of women were done to a bigger proportion than it is today by a impossible margin, the actions of such were more widely accepted.     I'm saying that as human intelligence has grown and societies evolve morality follows suit. I'm saying the ways to survive(morality defined) were not as clear as they are today, the choices are more black and white to what is right and wrong today then it was back then. Not saying there are black and white today but are more clearly defined.    I could be wrong, but it seems evident IMO you are applying your pre notion of what you think morality is and applying it to my statements as opposed to how I'm defining it(not the evolution of morality but how I define it). It might clear up your points to me if you look at my definition of morality I gave you days ago and apply that to my argument, and then come back with your counter. Might help.      Evolution absolutely goes forward though a process of natural selection. The species that are less fit for their enviroment don't survive, and evolution moves forward with the rest. Same thing in applying to primitive firms of morality. Sure some forms of morality had some good elements, some bad, some inbetween but though natural selection the less suitable ones die out while the more suitable ones survive and evolve with their surroundings, humans and society.    This is ludacris. Physically slapping a person is not the same as speaking hurtful words and if you cannot separate the two there in lies the heart of the problem.    I disagree with your comparison, a bully in most cases is using physical violence which is what I have A problem to begin with. And my other point is if thr n word was not as powerful bullies would cease to use it as much.    Good points. Emotion reaction is a tricky thing. Again I not saying this is entirely possible to sweep the world. I'm only stating my view is the power of the word is being given to by those who react in such an irrational way. That's where I'm trying to change my views, not the possibility of it.    Well then in that case morals do not come from religion.    I disagree speakng a word should spark any kind of violence. Someone whispers your address is an area for concern but not one that should be meet with violence.  I'm not saying all who hear the n word reataliate with violence but the ones that do are not justified and to lessen this reaction the sting of the word has to be.   Agreed, will also add it's also every animals instinct to reproduce and survive by following the path of least resistance,ie avoiding suffering.    Your insults are petty and your intentions made clear by such, I hope for your sake you can learn to interpret statements read in the context they are given. Your lack of interpretation has lead to this fruitless exchange and given no production to the topic at hand, but I assume this is a frequent problem for yourself. A shame you have clouded this thread with pointless banter, and I agree the end of our conversation is at hand.    I never claimed you are making it easy. Take it in context of the whole statement. Sure I could take any number of things you have said and break them in half and drive some wild conclusion from as you have been attempting to do. But I don't play those silly games, and you can easily see in the context of the statement it is not a personal attack, or even personally directed at you.    You claim my point on intellectually complex doesn't make sense, now you are saying its a wild claim, followed by one of your own, and im still unsure if you understand my point or are still atempting to.    As far as changing my views, our conversation hasn't gone passed me trying to defend statements you have taken out of context, and cleRing up points I'm trying to make because you either can't understand or have tAken the wrong conclusion. Also now with an accusation of an out of context statement where you are saying I personally directed a statement towards you, which is clearly not the cAse. For a productive conversation to occur these things would have to change.   You are ignoring my point I made in the description.  A reaction would still be made but the ones that are being made now are inmost cases are unacceptable. It is in fact a word, it is not racism in one word.     You act like the word is not constantly used and tolerated in entertainment. If you can hold your teeth in those instances you should be able to do the same when it's used in a different context.     My point about intellectually complex is quite simple. Most racist are not the most brilliant people in the world. So by giving them one word to describe all the pain hurt suffering oppression slavery racism, you are making it easy. They would never find a way to try to bring that kind of hurt on someone if they had to use more than just one word to do the same damAge.    You act like words cannot be harmful to others. Im not saying it wouldbe easy or entirely possible to do but the reaction it receives encourages its usage.   If a white just says, hey n, to a black guy, violence will be more likely come from the black who was simply called a word with no threat of violence.    Worship by your definition, revere and express adoration for something, could be done by a nonbeliever it doesn't say anything about being genuine or a believer. Again if something has to exist for worship as you keep trying to say, you have to prove God exists to prove your worship is a moral act, or you are simply not answering the question.     You are simply not seeing my point, you are hanging on your pre notions of morality. Ancient Greece might have had some forms of morals but women were not treated right, slavery,  war, famine, etc to epic proportions. To say Greece was a more intelligent, sophisticated society, with cleArer morals to today, just because of your view of homosexuals is ludacris. You are cherry picking here, and cherry picking there.     Also again, if you are saying Ancient Greece is more morally sound I would ask you to elaborate, it's quite obvious to me. Again can you show a source of evolution going backwards?    Yea im saying the reaction should be no different than someone calling you d1ck, bastard, etc   Sure but by that reasoning anything is impossible. The post is not really about the possibility anyway, its about the premise. But your points are well said and noted.   Not expecting someone racist to be intellectually capable is the point, you chop a leg out from under the incapable racist to express them selves. Did you read the sentence that followed?     Charleston shooting only furthers my point about trying to lessen the damage done by 1 word.   But the reaction of shithead is not in the same ball park. If it is treated the same its usage and hurt caused would dramatically reduce.     My point is by treating the word this way you strengthen the ways a racist can hurt you verballyy. In fact you make it easy. They can hurt you deeply by one word anyone with half a vocabulary can say, as opposed to having them do the same verbal damage by other more intellectually complex ways. You add intellectually complex and you take half the racist off the table right there ever finding a way to express there racism.   Good points. But when racist do use it, it is used to yeild its negative effects and get a reaction. Im saying if it stops receiving a reaction, gradually over time it would limit usage of the word by racist, and even when used it would cease to be anything more than your a d1ck, a bastard, etc    Sure racist will always find a way to be offensive but im trying to make the point by lessing the power of the word you lessen their racist aresnal and strip them of their most powerful verbal weapon. As opposed to loading the weapon for them and just awaiting the war.   I did in my description, the reaction.     White and black arguing, white calls black basterd, its offensive but doesnt get a over reaction, major mood change , or violent outburst consistently. Now that white uses the N word and those exact reaction avenues just explained go up dramtically, to where its one , or a combo of the three consistently almost inevitable   Of course a non believer can. I can walk into any church and take part in the mass, and worship with them. I can walk out still a non believer and have worshipped with believers. That can be seen by fellow believers and god as a moral act, might not be genuine but now your defining worship however you want. When did genuine mutually exist with moral?  So let's say god doesn't exist, then your worshipping a non existent god, that worship would cease to be a moral act in your way of thinking. So now you would have to prove god exist for your worship to be one a moral act.    No morals have not regressed. A universal morality is much better than it was 200 yeArs ago. The places where you refer to that make women inferior are religious based, and therefore are hanging there morals on books that were written in  a time of a primitive form of morals. It can also be assumed following immoral ways to survive. Morality evolving does not mean every one chooses to be moral. Morality can be light years evolved and there will still be people who choose immoral and who influence others.      Morality evolving, again, defines things more clearly. 300 years ago the inferior women you refer to would still be seen as morally ok. But as we evolve it's more universally held that what's going on there is wrong. Even though slavery has happened somewhat recently not everyone agreed with this. The fact it's not happening in the USA now is a sign of progress coupled with the fact that our country is run on evolved morals.    You could bring up sadaams recent regime, but nothing in his regime reflects evolved morals. I can't make this any clear just because morals evolve does not mean that everyone chooses the right path. Having a universal moral does not rid of evil or bad morals. It only makes clear what paths you take to survive are good and bad.     So your argument that morals haven't evolved because people are still acting immoral that's simply ludacris. Can you give an example of where evolution goes backward?    To your point about worship counting, is this, let's say god exist and even though as a non believer you are not sure about the existence of god but worship anyway this would of course be seen as a moral act by god, what would you define this as immoral? wBut again this is a slippery slope and we could both hang on technicalities and interpretations but once you start hanging on mental actions that could not be proven, it can't be proven for me to say the opposite and cancel your argument out. But I don't see a point in that direction, but again if you want to proceed with this in a proven, not directly canceling out, action I'm open to that direction.    You are confusing maturing with evolving. A person can lose their maturity at any given moment, see Donald's trump recent statements. I'm talking about evolving. A collective human evolution has taken place that doesn't go backwards, we are not turning back into apes, same thing with morality. It doesn't go backward it has evolved with time in the same way. As we grow and explore the options I have described and their consequences the good and bad are clearly defined.     I guess we will have to just disagree , you are walking a fine line in defining action. For that matter an even finer line when you consider the original question. The "action" you are referring to cannot be observed and happens internally, for that matter I could play the game of a non believer could worship, he doesn't have to believe to worship, and you can't prove he is not worshiping because it's not observable it's all internal. You could say a believer can think of god that's moral, that's an action, but without it being observable you are just playing games with the question, which should have multiple answers that aren't trying to play a fast one. Again I could easily say well a non believer thought of god. But I won't play that game, I'll leave it there.       The other half of our conversation is still open ended.    To imply all people who don't believe in religion are immoral is a bit disturbing, then to go and lump non religious people in with if you don't believe in god you can't be moral is very concerning.    We had a long conversation it's just a little unsatisfactory for it to end this way for me when we had a reasonable back and forth and now you won't acknowledge a verb is not always an action, or for that matter the points we left on evolution of morals not degressing. But if that's where you want to end, not being able to prove your points on verbs, or elaborate further, that's fine, but the progress we had at first tempted me to continue what at one time was a reasonable exchange.      Ok, well you are just wrong on worship not being a state of being. Worship happens in your head, it's not an action. But if your right you should be able to use worship as an action. That's the question can you use worship as an action(as opposed to the other meaning of Verb)in a sentence for me?       Thats the equivalent of saying a noun is a place, that's all there is to say about it, it can't be a person because it's a place.    You do understand a verb is not always defined as an action, right? Lol     No attempt on a sentence?   I'm not excited(I find your assumption of tone quite comical) simply trying to understand your confusion, which after 200 responses no one else as had.I'll try one more time, I'm asking Christians about the story of Adam and eve(as this post shows many consider the original sin, but again you are hanging on the title not the description) and how this relates to your belief. If you have no relation of the two whatever you define as original sin if it has nothing to do with Adam and Eve then it's not really what I'm asking.    Furthermore I'm asking about your beliefs, mine are irrelevant but you keep wanting me to define. I'm asking simply what you believe about this story and how it fits into your beliefs, not what I believe about the story and how it fits into your belief.   Did you even read the description or did you just read the title?    Fair enough   I don't agree with you. But the burden of proof is on those to prove morals come from religion I've already stated my case.     To name an action, I gave a coat to a homeless man yesterday.    You can believe in god and not believe morals come from religion.  These two can exist without the other.     I was religious for a long time but this is irrevelant to the point.    The burden of proof is not on me, I'm not trying to prove morals come from religion.    How does the story of Adam and Eve fit into those beliefs, what does it mean to those beliefs,and do you take it literally figuratively?     Usually the concept of original sin refers to mans first sin, ie the Adam and Eve part of my description   The first sin of man    I mean I'm speaking of original sin in context of Adam and Eve I don't know how else to explain that   The story of Adam and Eve   Adam and Eve being the story of original sin and how that fits into your beliefs?   Just the adam and eve story, are you an evolutionst or creatonist and how does the adam and eve story fit that choice and how do they both fit into your belief?   Fair enough   Except for the priest.....   For that matter i even thanked you for your replies as others. I have treated everyone respect who has treated me the same. Your accusations are quite comical   Who did i badger lol?   Lol seriously, where did i say it belongs to me. I was simply telling you what i was looking for as opposed to ignoring your responses. But i guess you prefer the latter dually noted   Lol, you are an idiot. You are saying jesus did write about mary now? You are saying the catholic church predates the old testament? You are saying the catholic church wrote the new testament but doesnt base its teachings off of it?    Your ignorance has reached comical proportions, thanks for the laughs. I feel bad for the church that you claim it but then again the catholic church has done more than its fair share of ignorance and evil.   There is no right or one answer i seek. I have received many enlighting answers btw, shed much light on the topic for me     As a person who use to have faith this was an issue for me, i wanted to see how people of faith deal with this     The only unnsatisfactory part i have had, is people who have given me legit answers, gotten a few knuckle heads who turn defensive and answered nothing, about how adam n eve fit into their beliefs refuse to answer if this is an issue that they think about   "Soon youll be jerking it thinking bout money" haa    I always wondered if he lost weight for that role or he was that skinny because of dallas buyers club   Well the fact your faith is shakeable like mine i dont find it revelant, im trying to get the other end of the spectrum but with thqt said i do appreciate your replies.   Im trying to imply if you have no belief in original sin this post isnt for you.  How do you even get that assumption?   You added something different, if it such a weird thread why do you continue to post in it.   Im looking for believers to answer this but if thats how adam and eve fit into your faith thats what im asking.   What do you mean by your post? Why is my age revelant?   You can still believe in God and not think morals come from religion, fyi.   Np, and your answer does shed some light no doubt. But your faith as mine is shakeable so to say, im trying to get the other side of the spectrum. But i do appreciate your replies.   Yes if your trying to explain how they fit into Your beliefs.   Nontrinitarism is a form where jesus divinty is in question.     Thats not a teaching thats an assumption, how could jesus teach that, he was dead before mary. I am former catholic of 19 years, been baptized, been to countless sunday schools and church, have also been confirmed, none of this is relevant. The whole catholic church and its teaching are based on the bible!  A fact, buddy. You are saying its not, explain??   I mean the point of the post isnt to make you feel less of anything. As a former person of faith it was something i struggled with and i wanted to see how others with faith deal with this.     As far as answering my question you no longer believe so no you cant answer my question, but i do appreciate your post.   Where are any of "his" teaching not found in the bible??    Once again do some research.   What part of earth have they been banished from?   Answer me this can you name a moral action a believer can do a non believer cant?    If morals come from religion, there should be an action a person who isnt taught religion(morals) cant do a religous can.    EDIT   Im not questioning your faith or the doctrine. Im simply asking do you believe in creationism or evolution and how does adam and eve (original sin) fit into those beliefs?   There are forms of christanity where jesus is not divine strictly speaking do some research.     If jesus is divine and his teachings are in the bible, what is christanity based off of if not the bible?   Fair enough or he was simply highlighting the negative first and making sure not to lump everyone together second. But to each his own intrepretation   Is the new testament not the bible? In some forms of christanity is jesus not God?   Why give whites that power? Why let them have that ultimate trump card? Slavery and oppression is not that long ago, true but why let all that hurt pain suffering be brought up with one word any ignorant being with half a vocabulary can say? Why not let it go and cease the racist yeilding its power by not given it any?     Not said to be offensive, or downplay its serious nature, Just an honest why?   He did say some are good people.   Is the bible not considered the word of God? Is christanity religion not based off the bible?   People who are oppressed for a long time feel the need to be open about who they are and want to use their freedom to say so. As people like them hadnt always had such freedom.     If being gay wasnt a crime or a thing that people look down for such a long time they might not feel the need to express their freedom.    Never been to the south? Parades for st8 people all the time.   Evolution doesnt go backwards.      Use worship in a sentence as a verb that shows action not a state of being  	105
    This is very sad considering that most mental illness can be cured with proper medication       Of course there's money    Wow thanks for sharing that I mean some architects are in it for the money. But I think you found your passion. Keep it up!       So what will happen ? Will you get back the amount that they charge you with?    How much did you get it for ?    This just tells us that life is more than what we learn in school. Giving up something you love and never regretting your decision is the most noble thing a person can do. Im pretty sure cameron lyle would make a great impact not only to the person he saved but also to alot of people going through the same thing    Ok thanks and im sorry             interesting cars     	15
 Thanks for that. I can't believe that happened.    Whatever, then. I'm not interested then.    Not one person here can tell me how tall or heavy they are in metric units, bro. Also people measure their dicksize in inches, bro.    What's that failed mission?   Do Americans even favour the imperial system or is it just too much of a pain to change?   I am sure nobody doubts this. Still the US and the UK use the imperial system.   Let's assume the moon is not going to be colonised by the US/China/Russia/etc... alone but as a joint effort by humanity as a whole.    Best feeling ever!   I would like to at least consider investing in my first home. However the 250k+ properties are out of my reach. I really only want a decent studio with kitchen or maybe 1 bedroom flat.   I would be interested to hear what you guys think.   Also has anybody tried to use help to buy scheme?   I have the month widget. Birthdays always show as actual birthday and also as event. I don't like that it's always shown twice. Any solution for that? (I sync my contacts with facebook and have them linked)   Hi guys, is there anything like the auto hibernation of greenify for non rooted phones? (z3c)   It is not only because there are other 5+ inch devices that are also good. It's because a big screen phone is nothing new. But a phone that you can use with one hand which has a great battery life and still is a flagship has not been seen so far    I am curious what rich people think poor (poorer) people are doing that is stupid or unreasonable. Why do you think they are poor or not as rich as you.  Anything goes.    Thanks   Cool. Thanks. That is what I was hoping for.    ah, ok. I started with a little under 84kg and now I am at 81. I read that losing 0.5kg per week is not healthy and realistic. I have been working out for more than 2 months now.   Actually, writing it down it seems perfectly fine progress.   I am not actually a beginner. I have worked out very irregularly the last 3 years. but I am not weak.   No idea about bf%. I don;t know where to measure that.  My TDEE with no excercise is 2100 and I eat 1600 a day. However I do work out 3 times a week.   I appreciate you taking the time.    He is right. But what got me started was this because it is easy to start with and does not require any effort to get started.   Some don't like bodyweightfitness but it is much better than doing nothing.  http://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/comments/1vupz1/rbodyweightfitness_it_has_taken_me_quite_a_while/   go on...   so, this site tells me (depending on how much exercise I do, light or moderate) that I should eat 2400kcal (light exercise) or 2700kcal (moderate exercise) to maintain my weight. I am currently working out 3 times a week and trying to eat 1600kcal per day. Should I eat more than that to maintain my muscle?  edit: 174cm, 81.5kg, 30 years old male.   and thank you btw.    Hey, thank you also for replying. I have also said this to somebody else. I would like to generally understand the workings of the body. I appreciate that some people are different. But I would like to know generally what eating at a deficit/surplus does to your body when you workout/don't workout.    Hey, thanks for replying. Basically, what I was aiming at was to gather knowledge. I just want to understand the principles of gaining/losing weight and gaining/losing muscle.   But I am 174cm tall, weight 81.5kg am 30 years old and currently eat 1650 kcal a day. I am working out 3 times per week (bodyweightfitness)   Hello,  I have tried to ask this in /r/bodyweightfitness but had little luck. I think it might be interesting for many people so I am trying here one more time.   Please could we collect information on what will happen in the following cases:  (Please assume the following just for the sake of an easy explanation: 2000kcal required for maintenance.)  Cases:  a) eating 1500kcal per day not working out  b) eating 1500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)  c) eating 2000kcal per day not working out  d) eating 2000kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)  e) eating 2500kcal per day not working out  f) eating 2500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)  In all of these cases, what will happen to fat and muscle, will it increase, decrease or stay the same?  __  What I am assuming is this, but I think I might be wrong:  a) eating 1500kcal per day not working out  Amount of muscle: will decrease  Amount of fat: will decrease  b) eating 1500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)  Amount of muscle: will increase slightly  Amount of fat: will decrease  c) eating 2000kcal per day not working out  Amount of muscle: will decrease slightly  Amount of fat: will not change / increase slightly  d) eating 2000kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)  Amount of muscle: will increase slightly  Amount of fat: will decrease slightly  e) eating 2500kcal per day not working out  Amount of muscle: will decrease slightly  Amount of fat: will increase  f) eating 2500kcal per day but working out (at least 3 times per week)  Amount of muscle: will increase  Amount of fat: will increase slightly  __  I would be really thankful if you guys could provide some information. Because at the moment I am not reaching my goals. I am eating -500kcal per day and doing bodyweightfitness 3 times a week . I am losing weight very slowly and hardly putting on any muscle. I am getting stronger though. However I would like to lose fat and gain muscle.  Many thanks in advance.  EDIT: 174cm, 81.5kg, 30yo male.    God, this sucks.   Why is that?      Free Internet porn. For sure. Have you seen family guy? Even 1st would people who find out about it can't believe it at first    Best gif ever. I wish I could use that as my wallpaper  Edit: I am sure i can somehow. I am not actually interested to do that...   Apparently it is a LINE feature. What a coincidence.    Oh, ok. What a twist   Sorry, does great not mean better than good anymore?   Ah, alright. My SO has a MOTO G and I saw that on her phone when she gets a message through LINE. I though it was a LINE feature.   Thank you.    Did you drug your dog to post him on the internet?   That is not correct either. It's just that Japanese idealize it. In the Japanese culture there are a few things everybody wants to do and Paris (or Mt Saint Michel for example) is one of them. It is being portrayed in a way that is completely unrealistic and people kind of expect a Disney Land like experience. Also it is not like this applies to the majority of Japanese. I think it is just a few idiots with no sense of reality who fall for the unrealistic image of Paris.      Yes, I agree. When you go to Paris with a Parisian and he shows you places where its not horrifically expensive it is amazing. French food and wine is worth the trip alone and in the Summer people in Paris sit by the river and drink all day long like students.     It's BS. I have been many times and whilst it has it's downsides (dirty, rude, dangerous at night near train stations or in the outer areas) it is amazing. Paris is absolutely worth going to, you just need to know its not all sunshine and gummy bears.    Don't forget the unbelievably rude Parisians.    I have that phone. The battery is great but it's not really 2 days. Seriously    I've got the z3c. Can I also do that? UK?   Sorry, what is active display?   And to commute to work?   Just by it from the UK.  Clove.Co.uk   Guess what: The blue lights are the only reason I think they look like Tron.    Fair enough. I think you have a point. But Sheldon is annoying as fuck and not entertaining.   He just becomes more and more ignorant to the fact he's annoying and that everything he says is rude. He has no periods where he is normal at all anymore    I feel like he is not saying single normal sentence anymore.      Cool thanks you. I'll do that    Thank you. Any good alternative to City Mapper for London? It eats battery    A little better than mine.   Personally I do not like blue flowers a lot, but the pictures are nice.   I have to admit that the focus is not good though.      I am surprised this doesn't get more love. I think it is awesome. Really nice colours!   This would be a good phone wallpaper.   Sweet.    I am jealous. I where is this?  Edit: God, I do not read. It says where it is in the title. Sorry.    You're in good company    Is my understanding correct, that all the stars I see around the galaxy are stars from the milky way that are between that Sombrero Galaxy and us?   You don't like that? Don't buy it. Jesus Christ   Get the HTC M7 then. Full HD 4.7" , premium material. Stil quick enough for all you want to do. I used to have that phone. I also love the sense UI. I only changed to the z3c because of the battery and camera. I don't regret my choice.   But keep in mind that the HTC One M7 only has a 0.1" bigger screen, but it also has the back and home button separate. The z3c has them on the screen. That means you get a screen with is 0.1" smaller and is also occupied by the navigation button at the bottom.    So, I also had the HTC M7 which is amazing in terms of looks and feel. I now have the black z3c and I love it. The plastic rim is nothing like the one of the HTC One M7 mini. It will nevrev bother me. I am sure about that. It is a bit see through so it does not look like cheap plastic at all.    Why do you recommend turning the X reality off?   I used to run 20 minutes before every workout. But I was a bit knackered afterwards for the workout. Now I run on different days and do 30-40 minutes. I HATE running but I feel so good after continously doing it   He means doing push ups one day and dips on the next. That's what start bodyweight recommends.   So, just to make it clear (because I am not seeing much progress):  Go all the way down until you just hang there with a straight arm?   What? I paid 10 for a pair. Shit  Edit: [Proof](http://www.tmlewin.co.uk/Metal-Collar-Bones-6.5cm/505097552699,en_GB,pd.html?prefn1=categoryCIMS start=0 cgid=Mens-Shirt-Accessories prefv1=Collar%20Bones). But of course this pair comes with a nice bag.       I thought that before. That should work.   I wanted 4 years of my life on this shit. No more   Exactly    True, but for me that does not justify being a dick  Edit: actually I just thought about it. Not necessarily. If everybody else would not tolerate that one asshole there would be no problem.     I do understand that very well, thank you. You are saying that people won't behave the way I suggest because it would only benefit them if everyone else also behaved that way. However it seems more likely to people that even if they behave correctly, everyone else won't thus putting themselves at a disadvantage. Therefore, they also behave incorrectly.  However, somebody needs to do the first step and bite the bullet. However it seems to me you won't be the one.   I disagree. People have high expectations for EVERYTHING. The way they get talked to by waiters, how their boss should behave, how their children should respect them, how they deserve this and should not be treated in this way... the list is endless.   And that's all fine, if they are willing to treat people in the same way in return.    No, just "give what you expect to get".   Says everybody who is not willing to do the first step.   Sounds interesting.  Might actually give it a try    Just tried a few times. It's pretty much instantly if you use the touch screen. The hardware button is much slower though.  Edit: just realised, instantly is not specific. I think honestly, you can press the camera button, focus and take the pic in a second    Haha, you dick.  :)   Not sure if you are asking if I have regrets. But if you are, then:  I always think that every wrong decision is fine as long as at the time I made it, it seemed like the right decision considering what I knew then. I don't regret these decisions.   Every time I was warned and did it anyway, those are the moments I regret.    Sort it out maybe?   Everybody should stop fucking people over for money.   The problem is that even though you are in a position where you can get rich by:  - using inferior ingredients in the food you sell - charging too much for your shitting product - spying on people and then selling the data - bla  - bla  - bla  The same thing is happening to you all the time because there are others out there who do the same. If everybody stopped doing it we could all live better lives.   Please make my life better.   I feel like everybody could end up being mentioned in here. People always think everybody else is stupid.    So white!   Sorry, that's not what I meant.   Cool. I'll give it a shot.  Thanks   Sorry to hear that. Maybe I was lucky then, I honestly dropped it more than 10 times.   I agree with you 100%.   A person who has made a mistake should always have a second chance (hopefully they learn from it). I also believe that this forgetting thing only works after a long time anyway.   However a company should have to provide an address, just to make sure they are not doing any shady stuff. I mean if your apps are legit, then there is no problem with that anyway.    I totally understand that. But my fingers are too short for the big screen.    why have you got duplicates? I don't understand.    I bought if for 350. The compact, but I don't think that is expensive for a good phone.    Z3 compact has a burst mode. You click once, it take about 20 pictures and you select the best one. I have only tried it without actually wanting to take a picture but seems to be working fine.    I had a HTC One M7, dropped it a million time. I few bends, but the phone does not break even without a case. I loved the phone, because of Sense. Best UI in my eyes. But the battery life was terrible. I now got a Z3 compact and I think I will love it. No case either. Battery seems good, but I don't see it as being as amazing as everybody says.    How do you know?    Cool thanks    It's BS. Use street view and you will see that a lot of the outer areas of "greater Tokyo" are just farmland.   It is not a good comparison because there are no "rules" for calling an area greater XXX. If they wanted they could call the whole of South West England greater London.

I really think it is too tight at the bottom, no?      Ok. Did not realise that. Thanks for sharing    First of all: amazing work. It looks brilliant and I love the idea.  Can I ask what you are planning to integrate apart from Fb (which I don't really read) and twitter (which I don't really use?). Are you going to I crude an RSS reader? Or reddit? If that would be the case I'd be super interested in using it.   However I also think it would be better if it was an launcher with a dedicated home screen where I can add my widgets.   Or maybe slide left to a screen where you can only add widgets which can also be scrolled down just like the app drawer? Then it would be everything I need.    You are right, but I think it's fair to assume that by hold he means use. Why would you just hold a phone? I can also hold a 10 inch tablet in one hand but that information is pretty useless...    So, just accept nothing is ever going to change?    Does make a difference though. I always thought "Why is everything so cheap in Amercia?" But it seems it isn't.  Thanks   Pretty sure that was the plan.   	120

 Out of the night that covers me,  Black as the pit from pole to pole,  I thank whatever gods may be  For my unconquerable soul.  -  In the fell clutch of circumstance  I have not winced nor cried aloud.  Under the bludgeonings of chance  My head is bloody, but unbowed.  -  Beyond this place of wrath and tears  Looms but the Horror of the shade,  And yet the menace of the years  Finds and shall find me unafraid.  -  It matters not how strait the gate,  How charged with punishments the scroll,  I am the master of my fate,  I am the captain of my soul.  -  William Ernest Henley, at age 26               Romans, Greeks Persians, and so on Eastward. I would expect only urbanized peoples to have this social ritual due to the increased expediency of human interaction in close quarters, as opposed to most days in rural life.

I was just rolling down looking around, adding tabs to go read them and I muttered out loud... I love this sub. My eye had caught how many had lots of comments and I knew most would be productive to the participants.  My wife was walking to the kitchen for a glass of OJ and was like, "hmm?"

The page isn't clear whether they mean support or legal eligibility, but its just a facebook meme so I don't expect much. Legal eligibility is ludicrous in my opinion. Restricting the field of candidates like that is asking for trouble.  More and more, I'm thinking a president just needs to have the priorities, principles, and political support. The first two make him a candidate, the third gets him in. Service in the armed forces supports the third part. Military service definitely puts people in a hotbed social environment where many will decide who they are and what they believe - galvanizing them to stick to what they discover for life. This, the ingrained posture, vocal respect, and personal grooming habits are what draw civilian voters to military candidates.  Obviously, none of these are specially reserved to candidates from our armed services.  What seems to set them apart is first-hand knowledge of the place where so much of our tax money goes, where people say our freedoms have been won, and where many of our American heroes come from. The mainstream calls every soldier a hero - but this isn't the case. [You know it isn't.](http://www.theatlantic.com/features/archive/2014/12/the-tragedy-of-the-american-military/383516/) Military culture is filled with rascals and fools, pompous jerks and outright destructive personalities. Civilians have a problem relating to what they see, and do not spend enough time reading about or talking with service members to understand the full picture. Assuming the people who rise tot the top and then put in a lot for president know the financial and internal political situation is unreasonable, but you never see them tested publicly.  Many have not served, but why can't they prove to voters that being inside the armed services isn't the same as *knowing* the armed services?                  [Matterport](http://matterport.com/) is a new product and related service which enables the rapid scanning of a building's interior, [viewable online in browser.](https://matterport.com/try/)  This [blog post](http://www.valueoc.com/2015/01/05/2015-year-matterport/) sings some pretty high praises, so I thought I'd ask here.  The website for OC Matterport, mentioned in the blog, works ok in IE. Doesn't work in Chrome, so I found [their Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/ocmatterport/timeline).  I have been following Matterport for a while. They use Microsoft Kinect sensors and custom software. Packages for scanning from the company start at $299. The device costs $4,500 and Matterport controls their own hosting services with year plans valued at increments of $500 (three tiers).  That means the company has to scan at least 130 homes of minimal size per year with one full time employee. I wonder how fast the price of OC Matterport increases.  **EDIT: There is integration with Zillow, [Check out this listing](http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/31356-Isle-Vis-Laguna-Niguel-CA-92677/25575500_zpid/).

So how are their rights being crossed if they are not legislated, yet? How can they conceive of asking for a right before it is voted on?  [This started bugging me after I watched this clip of Monty Python's Life of Brian.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFBOQzSk14c) Their intent may be to joke at the whole situation or just one perspective, I don't know for sure.  Of course I'm not talking about illegal stuff happening which are obvious offenses against people's objective rights as humans.   If a company is to form to manage and adjudicate contracts, it must verify the language, assets, and persons in each case. The person traditionally given this responsibility is the lawyer - or a notary. Notaries usually have all the powers of a lawyer except the ability to try a case before a court of law.   Do you think a law company will employ notaries directly [as the French government does](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notaire), or should they be hired directly by private citizens to review contracts [as Americans do.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary)  Seeing as a company would have to review the contract before agreeing to it anyway, I see companies putting out standard contracts forms like Legalzoom but keeping notaries on hand for custom work. This then enables them to let customers use either self-reporting or freelance notaries for basic and rote contracts.         I do not have children, yet, but my coworker and I had a discussion about his teenage son who is grasping internet security more slowly than hoped. The father's approach has been largely hands-off, but he realizes this isn't working. The child has a small gaming addiction, has lost money on scam trades, and has riddled his laptop with viruses to the point when it was brought into a specialist he commented it was the worst he'd ever seen.  Most of us grew up alongside the early internet. We can tell a sketchy website from a respectable one. We know the premise of scams enough to weed out most offensive encounters. Most importantly, we know to ask questions of communities and be generally cautious. Some of us even know to RTFM.  A brief search yielded to me only product pages and advice against revealing personal information. Nothing about not clicking the flashing "10,000th VISITOR" buttons (and their devious descendants) or giving out gaming account info.  Are there any subs or resources on Reddit for this? Are there any very good books on the topic?      A lot of black scribbles, red eyes, and fearsomeness.       ...we need a way to ensure that scientists publicly announce which studies they are going to run, what methods they will use, and how they will analyze the data, before running their studies.

A big thing with organic gardening is living where you work. What do you think of having a live-in gardener/ homesteader?   I am just west of Baltimore, Md and am leaving my apartment in the middle of the lease. The lease dictates I pay rent for two months after I leave or until the apartment is occupied, whichever comes first and the rent will be pro-rated until occupied. I have one full months rent as security, but would like to make sure I escape the second. I can harp on my specific apartment, but the office can't push it due to fair housing laws.  I was in a junior apt. You get a wall between living/dining and the bedroom, but not an actual door.  One issue is that the area is close to areas of ill repute, but we don't have these problems in the apartment complex.

["As a Republican, Johnson was twice elected governor of New Mexico. As a Libertarian, success is defined as getting 1 percent of the vote... There are also plenty of Republicans in competitive races who deserve to have a Libertarian candidate running against them. Rand Paul isnt one of them."](http://rare.us/story/gary-johnsons-foolish-rand-stand/)  The point of this article is that running a strong Libertarian Party candidate would spoil Rand Paul on the issues. It would undermine his support just enough for Rand to lose. Rand is certainly going to be the most sensible person on the stage if no LP candidate runs. If we want better now instead of best never, then the LP should just butt out this year - or at least high profile candidates should not run.  If libertarians want best now rather than better, then I'd love to hear your plan and where you are going to get a billion dollar war chest from. Also how will you get your candidate to shake the hand of every eligible voter in the US - that is what it would take for them to even consider an LP candidate *right now*. No LP candidate will have the media coverage, name recognition, or party machinery to make a dent in the (I am being quite honest) wasteland of American intelligence on politics. You need those multipliers as a matter of fact.  The point is not for Rand to win using the %1.76 of the vote he might get, that is obviously not the case. **The point is to support him. Give him the volunteers. Give him the money. That is how he can win in 2016.**  All the volunteers and money going to the LP doesn't have the multipliers Rand has going for him - meaning the media coverage, the hype, and the support of the Republican Party.  _________________________________________________  I don't expect everyone supports Rand Paul in this sub. I am not taking for granted that this is a Republican sub and not a libertarian one. As a matter of discussing political strategy that should not matter.

[The video has been seen previously on this sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarcho_Capitalism/comments/1mgs6h/silvio_gesell_currency_and_the_economics_of_money/). The phenomena is generally known as [The Wrgl Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W%C3%B6rgl#The_W.C3.B6rgl_Experiment).  Silvio Gesell's amazing shrinking money was like fruit.  Humans can trade in whatever means they wish. Most articles are traded today to indirectly gain goods and services later. We don't trade baskets for sheep, we trade baskets for dollars and then go trade dollars for sheep.  In a world of competing currencies, some are better stores of value than others. In a world of competing tradeable articles, most currencies fluctuate in value more than goods.  But fruit is not one of these goods. Fruit is only useful once it has reached a certain maturity, has certain provisions for care and preparation, and reduces in value over time - just like Gesell's currency.  There is a time and place for every money, but I think it is very funny to think of a whole town trading in fruit and would love for someone to show me who - if anyone or everyone - got the thin end of the pear in this case. Take us to the core of the issue. Explain how this currant-cy was actually a detriment; or maybe that this is a case of the right recipe at the right lime.

Some of the comments are quite good, but I am sad they are wasting time in a Slate comment section.   I think Microsoft has been moving to hardware for some time - or at least hardware technology licensing - but only came to develop the Surface device with the hopes that public schools would use them in coming years.  Most of us remember taking plenty of state-run tests in grade school. Gaining information on students and schools has been a top-level topic for public school advocates and large publishers for about a decade. These groups got together recently to attempt to bring their vision of a 21st century school to fruition. All the ["future classroom"](http://youtu.be/mPUfwX4Nqy8) videos made by Microsoft, Pearson, HP, or non-profits have tablets and large interactive screens. Microsoft has [their vision](http://youtu.be/aJu6GvA7jN8) in heavy research, as seen in this [lab visit](http://youtu.be/rJ1p5SD3sOM)... well... part of it.  The other part is already in your hands.  Top publishers and education non-profits came together to create the Common Core standards for the United States. The Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation is the largest among the non-profits associated with the standards. These were created and then passed to the states via grant competitions. [The standards are picking up flak,](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peter-greene/how-the-common-core-lost-_b_5694139.html) but not only for how unworkable they are in the classroom. The standards also required legalizing and creating a series of databases for each state in which every school and child is tracked. They call it infant to workforce data tracking.  Some people out there have plans to put a tablet in every schoolchild's hands for the whole day.  As we have seen with the NSA, big data is a big topic and gets a lot of funding - yet officials there say they have no good ways of finding those needles of notable info once they collect the haystack of chatter. The education industry didn't get that message before anteing in but they can just go back to creating the old style books. Microsoft is close to turning a profit and has created an competitive piece of hardware which has not turned a profit yet (that I know of) and the company has no graceful way to slide out of the hardware market right now.  And those grant competitions? Billions of dollars were handed out which baited state and county school boards into spending increasing amounts of their budgets to keep up with the change in curriculum. Reports of boards being advised to buy stacks of books, only to have them go unused, can be found in every state which decided to chase the new standards. Many local school boards have been pretty sleepy, and some have been sleep-building expensive (and usually unnecessary) new school complexes. Their budgets are tight and teachers have been denied cost of living increases in a great many places.  That said, many parents are buying their children tablets, anyway, so if the state says each child needs a school tablet then who do you think would be made to buy them when the infrastructure to make schools able to use them is shriveling coffers?  With Common Core lying on the chopping block and all the other funding problems public and private education has, we can look at the picture with some more insight and try to figure out where Nadella will take the Surface - even if gradeschool education was not a goal in the first place.  -----------------------------    So what do I take from this? What compromises or design choices did MS make in the first models that are no longer there, now? RT is gone, for one. Such a constricted OS doesn't make much sense for an adult, but for a child...  ------  P.S. Yes, I don't like the standards, myself. I tried to give information here, and not any more opinion than that I think the Common Core standards are going to be discarded.   Here is another interesting case to use in discussion.

[A recent Reason TV video](http://youtu.be/n-zESacteu4?t=7m54s) broadly describes why a rendering plant would not open up in a residential area.

Is there a way to address a developer for a change in insurance premiums? Where can I find more information about this?                           HEMA, Historical European Martial Arts, is the study and practice of the ways of war and duels from Western culture.  Free for spectators, Longpoint is a HEMA tournament taking place at Turf Valley Resort near Ellicott City, MD. The pools of competitors have been whittled at for two days already - come and see the best of the best.  Watch talented men and women compete with synthetic and steel longswords, messers (a single-handed sword), single-stick (literally a rattan stick - fun and people wear little armor), and do cuttings (technique display with sharp swords).  I'm helping staff tables, but have trained in longsword. This is an amazing activity. We get into padded armor (not like sumo suits, think fencing) and the scoring system benefits those who can make a hit without getting hit back and those who completely control the exchange. You will see fast sword work, suspenseful moments, and skilled throws. You will also see tanks whose blows are terrifying and ladies who can take on any challengers.  **Events begin at 9am in the grand ballroom. Finals start at 5pm and run to 8pm.

Responsible children welcome. There are swords sticking out of gear bags everywhere on the floor and this is a pretty small crowd so please do not bring wildlings or screamers. Bring some water and snacks. I'd suggest sixth grade as the youngest spectator. The rings are roped off and you are in good company, there are engineers and policemen and veterans doing this.                     Why bother with flags of convenience? The information and assurances ports want guaranteed by a nation can be guaranteed in other ways.  I searched to see if this has been talked about here, and didn't see anything. Just had a thought and busted this out to talk about is and share.  TL;DR Steps   1. Fly the black and gold to represent a ship as not registered with a nation.   2. Use the internet or private resources to .   3. ???? (Make trades and produce to enrich yourself through the market)   4. Profit!  Is there a *need* for this? Maybe not a dire current need, but there is certainly a desire to remove one's property from the liability of registering to a state. Flags of convenience may not always be available so planning them away is prudent, profitable, and interesting.  ##[Excerpt: *A GUIDE TO SHIP REGISTRATION* by the Government of New Zealand](http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Publications-and-forms/Commercial-operations/Ship-registration/A-guide-to-Ship-Registration.pdf)   The registration of ships is a time-honoured practice. It began principally as a means of controlling ships entitled to carry  cargoes within the seaborne empires of Europe. In more recent times, however, **it has proved a convenient means of  establishing title to the property in a vessel** - in other words, who owns it. At the same time, **registration has served to  determine which country's law governs the operation of a ship and the behaviour of those onboard** - key concepts which  today play an important part in the international law of the sea.     Basically, **registration confers nationality on a ship and brings it within the jurisdiction of the law of the flag state**. Thus, a New  Zealand registered ship is bound by New Zealand law - both its shipping and other applicable provisions - though the vessel  may venture well outside the territorial limits of New Zealand. **A New Zealand ship abroad is accorded the protection of the  Government of New Zealand**, much as a New Zealand citizen is while travelling overseas. **A vessel's bona fides are established  by its registration papers** just as a passport establishes them for a person. **Registration may also determine criminal jurisdiction  in the event of any incident or accident in international waters.**    Further, registration facilitates financial dealings in ships - their sale and purchase and the raising of mortgages - and **brings  back to the owner responsibility for any liabilities incurred**. It does so by evidencing title to a ship and thus declaring to all the  world who owns a particular vessel.   Emphasis mine.  Flying a flag of Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Cambodia, the Cayman Islands, North Korea, Georgia, Honduras, Lebanon, Malta, Mongolia, Panama, and Saint Vincent or the Grenadines is not going to afford the ship much protection in fact, flying these [makes you a target for inspection.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience#Port_state_targeting)   * We live in the age of information. Independent ships can list themselves openly on the internet through a self-hosted internet site (which companies can glean and aggregate information from) or use a beacon to broadcast the relevant information locally.  * If states [want to impose regulations on ships](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience#Environmental_effects), there are solutions. Ships can be registered into standards associations and companies.  * The ancap flag does not resemble any of the [International maritime signal flags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_maritime_signal_flags), but I have not checked all of admiralty.

Nearly 2/3 of all recent education graduates in Ontario are unemployed or underemployed the following year. British Columbia certifies nearly 3 times the number of teachers it needs each year. Even fast growing Alberta has seen many of its school boards laying off teachers in recent years.    The question of what is a fair salary and remuneration package for public school teachers is a difficult one. I dont have an answer for it either. I do know that the masses of unemployed recent teaching graduates implies that the total remuneration package for teachers is above the market-clearing level. Schools do not want to hire more teachers because they cannot afford them. Incidentally this is one reason why the teachers union and school administrators cannot meet eye-to-eye on the issue of class sizes. Teachers want smaller classes, but administrators cannot afford to hire the number of teachers necessary for this at the current remuneration packages.   These fresh graduates  bright eyed and bushy tailed  want to make a difference in a childs life. They cannot find work because of a union that has negotiated wages above the market clearing level.    Let unemployed teachers replace unionized ones during a strike at a wage rate they negotiate with school administrators. If the teachers on strike are worth the money and conditions they demand, the school administration will be all too happy to reach a settlement with them to get them back in their class. And if not?

Both system uses an outlet positioned to enable a vortex.  * The differences in systems come from how the water is coerced into forming a vortex and how power is generated. I will use "paddle" to refer to the exposed turbine of the Zotloeterer design and "turbine" for the submerged turbine of the original Kouris design. It seems "impeller" is a misnomer for a turbine in-line with the flow of water and filling the cross-section of a pipe.  ##The Point  The installation called the Marysville Pilot Power Plant in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwqwLoc93ZI) and [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPIWSVhVHL0) is *not* the Kouris patented design. It does not primarily utilize the power generation feature detailed in the patent documents. Nothing you can see but the pipes and dam resemble the patented work. It uses a paddle and generator resembling the Zotloeterer design. Kouris says there is an impeller in the outlet pipe, as well, but obfuscates the matter. He concedes the impeller is a failed idea, but **I conclude** he keeps it to maintain a semblance of patent control.  Kouris also has a [two-episode feature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxxHdOmHEes list=PLD3902BBECFFF27CF) on Youtube. If you look at the patent and press release dates from Zotloeterer and then watch this, you can see a little problem. I don't know the guy, but I'd say Kouris is a liar. He uses poor terminology and doesn't have a scientific explanation that makes sense. All his language evades resembling the Zotloeterer system. That's sad, because the technology is good and admitting he doesn't have a patent isn't the worst thing in the world (unless he has a big ego that doesn't let him). Because Kouris has an inspirational origin story for the turbine design, but not the paddle design, I think it is safe to say he discovered Zotloeterer designs and copied the core concept.  Kouris says in the video his vortex uses the power of centripetal force but evades saying "gravity" and his brochure says ["operated using the kinetic energy created by the earth's rotation"](http://www.kourispower.com/wp-content/uploads/brochure20.jpg). The Zotloeterer Turbine is marketed as using "gravitational force," which it does (both do). Water falls because of gravity, a vortex just makes it also move horizontally on the way down. Unless Kouris thinks that the earth's spin pushes water out of springs and makes rain fall (both wrong), it sounds like he thinks vortexes form because the earth spins (very wrong).  Look at [this mock up of Kouris' original, patented, design](http://youtu.be/QZSq3alBS_o?t=9m45s) versus [this Zotloeterer concept](http://www.zotloeterer.com/attachments/Image/Fliessgewaesserstrukturen-2011.jpg?1391875144099). I saw the in-line concept in 2003 in high school - about when Kouris modified his plans. In that clip, Kouris is talking about the new design *with the old, discarded one onscreen.*  In the rest of this post, we can see all the reasons why Kouris left the old design behind.  ##Structures  The *patented* Kourispower system exists freestanding in the middle of any standing water - generally a dam. A pipe outlet runs from a few feet under the surface of the water, straight down, and then out the bottom of the dam. A vortex forms as water is able to approach the outlet from every surface direction. [image](http://imgur.com/8tPZs7c)  The Zotloeterer system basin is located to the side of a stream with weirs. Water enters through an off-center inlet and exits by falling out the bottom through a central hole outlet. A vortex forms above the outlet through the assistance of the off-center inlet; this enables the basin to be placed out of the immediate path of the flowing water. [image](http://www.zotloeterer.com/attachments/Image/ground-map-GWVPP-2012_1.jpg?1391874738397) / [image](http://www.zotloeterer.com/attachments/Image/bio-reactor-GWVPP-2012.jpg?1391875380890)  I realize the distinction may not be clear. Consider the placement and benefits of each system. Zotloeterer turbines are *to the side* of a *flowing water*. They are part of a living stream or river. Kourispower turbines are placed *in the middle* of *standing, dammed water*. They are scantly different from the internals of the Hoover Dam... except now there is a cool (and kinda dangerous) vortex! WOO STRAYA!  ##Power Generation  Zotloeterer systems normally use a paddle on a shaft hanging below a generator as the power generation feature. Since there is only one axle, there is less to break and less to make. The generator is suspended above the basin with the paddle over the outlet, so it is spun by the vortex. Recent patent documents describe a feature which places the generator *in the paddle*. This makes it so that it is not an axle, but a pipe with a wire, that is lowered into the vortex. The paddle-generator appears small and fit for third-world applications where simplicity and being self-contained is traded for power production.  The Kourispower system patent details placing a turbine into the outlet pipe. The vortex does not drive the feature; the vortex was thought to increase the flow past the turbine compared to simply having a submerged pipe. This is similar to a traditional hydroelectric dam operation, but was intended to increase the flow enough that the system can generate relevant amount of power at smaller scales. The flow is not faster, and the turbine experiences less efficiency.  ##Watts   GWVPPs are hydro power plants for low head from 0,7 up to 2m and for a flow rate from 0,05 up to 20m/s and for a power range from 0,5 up to 160kW.   -[Zotloeterer](http://www.zotloeterer.com/welcome/gravitation-water-vortex-power-plants/)  [Graph of expected kW/hr attainable from various heads and flows](http://www.zotloeterer.com/attachments/Image/Application-of-the-GWVPP-2012.jpg?1391874277830)   2m deep... with a 40cm inlet/outlet, expected to produce 5kw with 300-500 L/sec.   -[Kourispower](http://www.kourispower.com/wp-content/uploads/valp.pdf)  [Largest expected power 40kW/hr](http://www.kourispower.com/wp-content/uploads/valp.pdf)  ##Pros and Cons  |Kourispower|Zotloeterer| |:-----------|:----------| |Creates open vortex on surface of standing water|Vortex is contained in concrete basin| |Requires fish ladders/ minces fish that go through turbine|Fish are proven to be safe to traverse basin and weirs| |Requires dam to create still water for stable vortex in addition to head|Requires only head, usually from weirs| |Problematic to screen from debris without interrupting vortex|Vortex can take small debris, large debris screen is before inlet| |Susceptible to debris clogging|Flush gate can be operated to clear screen for large debris| |Maintenance requires draining dam to below outlet|Inlet can be closed for work, moving parts above water|  ##Patents  Both groups list where they are patented [K](http://www.kourispower.com/about/) / [Z](http://www.zotloeterer.com/welcome/gravitation-water-vortex-power-plants/patents/), but Zotloeterer goes a step above and has most of what you need to recreate their design posted, published, or in the patents. This is always useful for dreaming, scheming, or if they don't return your emails. I think patents are a little frivolous and prevent people from freely improving on other's work, but I don't think that is a discussion for this sub.

 Your birthday!   I'm polite, and they usually are too. If they are rude I do not let them into my environment.   I know Satanist who work with animal rights groups, child protective services, and who do various fundraising events for their favorite causes. They can decide if being open as a Satanist would serve their goals and do the best for their selected cause. Here's one Satanic tattoo artist who holds regular fundraising events to fight animal cruelty. http://blog.artonyou.com/inkathon-2013-fundraiser-is-for-the-humane-society-of-utah-complete-details/   Do fans of Darth Vader believe he existed in the real world? Can you be a fan of Star Wars and accept that it was a made up story? Man will always have religions, whether they are spiritual or material (most soccer fans I know are way more religious than Christians). We accept that religions are made-up, but they serve sociological, psychological and cultural roles. Satanism as an above ground, open religion is a relatively new phenomenon, and it won't be the last religion to disregard spirituality.   Since my religion  just mandates that I live my life naturally, I would say it has no "impact", it just is. In public I'm polite, in private I expect respect and will not tolerate rude behavior. The music and art I enjoy and collect tends to have a darker aspect to it, but also a sense of fun and adventure. Most misconceptions don't impact me in anyway because I do not openly declare myself as a Satanist. If I were to openly declare myself as a Satanist it may impact my career, so I choose not to do that. I want a comfortable, productive life, and I have a healthy enough ego to work around that.   I identified myself as a Satanist when I was about 15 years old. I was raised in a non-practicing Catholic family, but my father is an atheist. When the issue came up they were worried that I was getting involved in something dangerous, like any parents would. But I got good grades at school, graduated from college, moved out immediately, started a successful career, and take care of my own needs and help them in return. Nothing drove me to become a Satanist, I just accepted the identity naturally. I don't have any favorite leader, but I most closely align with the Libertarian Party.    Aleister Crowley has more to do with magical Christianity and Buddahism than Satanism, so I don't get that reference. If you don't like Satanism and don't want to be a Satanist and continue to believe in Christianity and salvation, that's fine by me! I'm not trying to trick you into believing anything.   No, see the work of Jung to see how you can have symbols without spirituality.    I don't carry it around, I had to dig it up for offering proof for this AMA.   Every Satanist I know carries on just fine among Christians. Otherwise you're just being an asshole.   There's a difference between yearning for acceptance and dispelling misconceptions.    There are no considerations to change the name or symbols used. This is who we are and what we represent. We do not expect our philosophy to be the majority. We respect other people's freedom to choose their religion, we only advocate keeping it out of the government.   We need some olfaction technology hooked up the the Occultus Rift and you're almost there!   I could use a good Hukilau party right now, actually!   In the late 90's I worked with a number of Black/Death metal bands in the NYC area, organizing and promoting shows, reviewing albums, etc. Satan and the Devil is low hanging fruit, easy material to piss people off and get attention. Which is fine, but they rarely go beyond that and actually accomplish anything with that. King Diamond actually does a great job of creating a whole performance and mythology out of his use of Satanism, as well as GHOST BC. I wish more bands would do the same.     I would also check out the work of ULVER to see how a band can evolve and grow out.   Because we did the wedding on Walpurgis Night and there's a moment in Faust that describes overcoming your fears and superstitions. Have some imagination, come on!   I have an annual pass to Disneyland I go at least once a month!   I personally do not believe in magic beyond psychological mediation.   There are plenty of ways to destroy a person, especially their egos, that don't involve physical violence. Don't be a moron and do yourself more harm than it's worth.   Atheism means you don't believe in god. That's it. Can you have paranormal experiences without god? That's an important question and there are some Satanists who are interested in this. But this is not required. That IF is a big IF. There are plenty of Satanists who have no interest in magic.   That's absolutely correct, there's an overlap, but there are distinct differences. I agree with Ayn Rand's championing of the individual and with her bombastic spirit, but I disagree that all all humans are rational, or that there is no place for altruism. Here's an article that goes into this in much more detail http://churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php   Hierarchies are used for administrative and communicative purposes. If someone is a Warlock, Priest, or Magister, and Satanism is something you're interested in, then it communicates a level of understanding and application of the philosophy. Make sense?   I considered myself a Satanist since I was teenager, but I didn't join the COS until much later. I was organizing a concert that had many Satanists in attendance. I introduced myself to High Priest Gilmore who was at the bar and we had a talk about music, art, and comic books. This confirmed my belief that these are the kind of people I want to work with and I joined. Since then I've met a number of other Satanists, some of which I collaborated with, others I respect but don't have much in common with.    There certainly is a satirical nature to it, sure. I don't believe I'm better than everyone else, there are plenty of people I respect and go to for advice or assistance if needed. I strive to be the best ME I can be, and at times that means working with others who share my goals.    http://churchofsatan.com/nine-satanic-statements.php    In essence, life your life to the fullest, spend it with those who appreciate you and don't waste your limited time on others. Don't be an asshole in public, and don't invite people into your life who would harm you. Use symbols and mythologies to drive your creativity and imagination. Don't take your resources for granted, use the tools available to you to build a better environment for yourself and your loves ones.    Satanic Priests don't hold any actual functions, it's an honorary title that says you have the respect and authority from the Church of Satan to represent the religion in public *if you choose to do so*. It's more of an acknowledgement from people you agree with and respect.   Upvote and I'll get to them.    Thus is the nature of a democracy.   I've never had a home with a basement, and I just paid off her mortgage, so I think she's alright with whatever I do. I prefer pop surreal art and Polynesian decor.   A priest is an honorary title, it does not have any responsibilities associated with it. It just means I have been recognized and authorized by the Church of Satan to represent Satanism *if I choose to do so*.   I can't comment on the Temple of Set as I'm not familiar with their religion other than their history with the Church of Satan. Believe in the power of magic beyond psychology is up to each member to decide, the Church of Satan does not push this on the membership. I know many high ranking members of the Church of Satan who do not practice ritual magic at all. There's no secret, no grand reveal.    Big fan of Ghost and wish more metal bands had a sense of humor about Satan!   Lacking a limb could be a powerful aesthetic! Have you seen Captain Hook? It means using your appearance as means of influencing the world around you. Don't be a drab, boring person, unless being a drab boring person serves your needs in a given situation.   Symbolic, it drives the imagination. Why do sports teams have mascots and logos?   Here I am, did you have something?   There are no "churches", it's a symbolic term. Several Satanists have gatherings at their homes, but this looks like any regular party with close friends. There have not been any threats against me in real life.   I've met him on several occasions but we're not in touch.   I lack the full goatee, but maybe the devil has good taste? I don't always keep the mustache though. https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/t1/377055_328634853814752_98944796_n.jpg   It went well! How about you?   Glad to have amused you!   Who worships Satan? Not I.   I do not believe in a soul that exists outside the body, but I think much of what's call "a soul" can be the mind.   I have never owned a fedora! I prefer well trimmed hair or a cap if I'm in a rush!   Dirt Devil, of course!   I haven't. I'm not a fan of Maher, actually. I think he's incredibly obnoxious, but that's just me.   Life, ambition, fun.   Being a priest is just an honorary title, not a job. I'm a consultant in the wine and spirits industry and spend a lot of time sitting in an airplane, gate or traveling, so here I am.   You keep in touch with the Church of Satan and let them know what you've been up to in the real world.   Being myself always worked for me.   I have not, and I don't think it's important to have done so. I first contacted the COS when I was in college. I was organizing a concert who's headliner was a member of the Church of Satan and many other members were in attendance. That's when I first met High Priest Gilmore. From there we've become close friends.   Satanism was certain influenced by Ayn Rand, mostly for the championing of the individual and iconoclasm. Here's an article on how Satanism relates to and differs from Objectivism. http://churchofsatan.com/satanism-and-objectivism.php   The last "mass" that was done featured only ambient music, but I like some metal here and there!   Atheism as one of the core principles of Satanism.   Time will tell. Christianity as a religion may go away, but I'm sure other forms of herd mentality will continue in one form or another.   In that I believe that evil is anything I don't like, then yes.    They're probably more in line with their natural instincts than Christians but often find other ways to make themselves feel guilty. I have several friends who are involved in Asatru and I respect our differences.    They are despicable.   Do you believe him? Did he report this to the police? I doubt it. As for a Satanic Mass, see for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1zsIk6WcNM    Ulver    http://ulver.bandcamp.com/album/messe-i-x-vi-x  I listen to mostly ambient and experimental music, much of which if featured on my Chaos Sedated podcast: http://www.radiofreesatan.com/category/chaossedated/   There's a lot one can learn from a MILF.   We had on a cliff overlooking the sunset on Walpurgisnacht. I modified the Satanic Wedding ritual that can be found in the Satanic Scriptures to make our families comfortable (no mentions of Satan, etc.), but the basic idea was there. We are two individuals joined by our love for each other, together we will accomplish our goals and share this wonderful existence. I included an excerpt from Goethe's Faust.   Working on it.   The only public rituals performed by the Church of Satan are for performance only, they are meant to stimulate the attendees. There's nothing creepy about it, at least not in my opinion.   After Columbine I was brought into the school office because there were rumors that I was a Satanists. They brought my parents in and threatened to suspend me. My parents gave them our lawyer's business card and said if they do anything of the sort they'd be hearing from them. They don't agree with me but they've always been proud of me. I'm lucky in that regard.   I agree, seems pretty lame to me.   I haven't seen it, but I hear it's a good time!   Priests don't have any actual responsibilities, I was just given that title because the Church of Satan has acknowledged my real world accomplishments and they know I have a complete understanding and representation of Satanism. Whatever I do with that title is my own decision, I'm never ordered to do anything.   I'm rarely bored. I'm surrounded by books, movies, music, and good friends.   We agree on certain principles but most of them can't seem to wrap their minds around the idea that one can accept symbolism in their life without spirituality.   I recently went camping with about a dozen Satanists, and go to multiple Tiki themed conventions around the year.   I'm a technology consultant in the wine and spirits industry.   I actually went to one of their brainwashing centers in Los Angeles (https://scontent-b-sjc.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/t1/190195_210792065599032_7590540_n.jpg). The thing I found most disturbing is the family with five kids purchasing a stack of dvd's and books on the way out, mother writing a check.   If the High Priest of the Church of Satan came out and said he supports child abuse I would drop Satanism in a quick second. There are many Satanists I don't agree with on various things, from politics to art.     There's nothing about Satanism, to me, that's anymore difficult to apply than common decency. If I'm walking out of a bar and some random asshole cracks a joke at me, well it's "difficult" to not break his jaw. But what good would that do? I'm not interested in going to jail. There are other ways to handle it, just takes a bit of imagination or a healthy ego to walk away and know it's not worth it.   That we believe in the Devil.    Because being a priest sounds fun and it's archetype that won't go away any time soon.   The best parts of being in the Church of Satan are the close friends I've made.   Ass, for sure! Search for Old Nick Magazine for some Satanic T A.   There is no "satanic community", Satanists have such a wide range of interests and personalities that I've often found that they do not agree on many things beyond the basic principles of the philosophy. That doesn't mean that there aren't close friendships and bonds made with small groups of people, it's just that there's no one unified "community".   I don't really pay attention to the religion of other people, as long as they don't try to push it on me. Most people have no idea that I'm Satanist so it doesn't come up, but if they do that means they know me well enough to see that I'm not an "evil" person.   The Church of Satan is not an initiatory organization, there's no ritual or anything you can do to "move up", and it's not required. If you're doing something you're proud of, you let people in the organization know, they'll promote it, give you advice and assistance if asked, and eventually people will take notice. The administration at the Church of Satan gives titles to those members they feel are successfully applying the Satanic philosophy to the real world.   I do not worship anything. I use my best judgement to guide my various business decisions, most of which apply the idea that I should not waste my time and energy on people and things which would harm me and my interests.   I have an excellent relationship with my family, friends, and professional associates. Some know my beliefs, others don't, by name at least.    The last "satanic ritual" I was involved in involved hula dancers, tropical drinks, and a Dean Martin cover band.   Sure thing!   Most 5 year olds are natural Satanists, they are in-line with their natural instincts, so there's not much to explain. If pressed I would say it means that life is to be cherished, find the things that interest you and make you happy and enjoy them without guilt. But be respectful of your neighbors and don't push your ideas on to others. Let them decide for themselves.   Certain groups claim to be a variation of Satanism but they often just copy the doctrines of the Church of Satan and add "but we believe in the Devil!" To my knowledge there is no other competing school of Satanism. I am not including groups who actually worship the devil, as that's an entirely different thing and would akin to calling Jewish groups a variation of Christianity.   Maintaining the philosophy created by Anton LaVey, which accepts the importance of religion and symbols but does away with spirituality. Satan is symbol of the natural instincts of man and enjoying life.   It's recommended to wait a while before responding to questions to let the voting system work out. I think 45 minutes is fair.   False. http://churchofsatan.com/faq-lavey-and-family.php   Right now it's Pacific Rim. Just good old fashioned fun with modern special effects. As I kid I watched King Kong vs. Godzilla so much that it ruined the VHS tape! Really looking forward to the new Godzilla film.   I've spent time with a number of Black/Death Metal bands in the late 90's and for the most part they're angry kids looking to piss off their parents and look cool to their friends. Unfortunately a handful of them are deranged and violent and the "evil" stuff that's feed to them by mainstream culture serves as easy justification for their actions.   They claim to be Satanists but they are not related to the Church of Satan. I do not agree with their approach, as I don't think ANY religion should have monuments on government grounds.   The The Lindbergh Baby is a folk band with Satanic themes from Vermont, recently played to a packed audience in NYC.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDw6k0OllI  Here's a Satanic electronic musician, The BU: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhCMAqQSf44  Maybe!   "What fucking the". Nice.   I don't really like satin actually, makes me itchy.   Because Satanism is about life, experiences, and having fun.    I'm sure someone has a copy of Twilight, which is pretty damn evil to me!   http://churchofsatan.com/ seems to come up for me.   I'm assuming you mean Greater Magic. That's left up to the individual to decide. Some only see it as psychological drama, others feel they've experienced something more than that. But this is not supernatural, it would be called supernormal. Those Satanists that believe there something more to magic would believe it to be part of our natural world that we do not yet understand. Nothing divine or spiritual. It is not mandatory to believe this to be a Satanist.   We do not believe in a being called Satan. It's a symbol, an abstract representation of a carnal, materialistic philosophy.   Atheism means you do not believe in the existence of god. But we don't throw the baby out with the bath water. Religion serves various social and psychological purposes, and we acknowledge this. But that doesn't mean you need any spiritual or divine aspect to it, just enough imagination to recognize the power of symbols and abstractions.   The most angsty thing in my life right now is this latest episode of WTFPod. Life is pretty mellow right now.   No.   There is no spirituality involved. Many Satanists do not open call themselves out as Satanists but apply the philosophy to their careers, interests, and art. We do not advocate martyrdom of any kind.   I don't agree that morals should be tied to religion. See the Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth for the closet thing to Satanic morals.    http://churchofsatan.com/eleven-rules-of-earth.php     In the Church of Satan I've met artists, photographers, computer technicians, stand-up comedians, graphic designers, corporate executives, doctors, law students, hackers... and on and on. Depends on your definition of "normal". They are well adjusted members of society, yes. But I wouldn't say they're "normal", there is always something exceptional about them, in one way or another.   We don't believe in Hell, so the upside is we enjoy this one and only life we have with those we care for.   I answered this in the OP. All religions are man-made, all symbols and stories used to explain our existence and the unknown. Religion and abstractions are important to the human mind and we choose Satan as the symbol that most accurately represents our values and worldview.   That would imply that Jesus of Nazareth was real in first place, which is questionable. But a crossbow seems to work well for Daryl Dixon, so I'll go with that.   No, otherwise I wouldn't identify myself as a Satanist. And that's OK. Life is too short to try to be something you're not.   Over the past several weeks Satanism, directly and indirectly, has caught the attention of the media. Lunatics are blaming the Devil for their deranged acts of violence, rumors of "Satanic" cults are spreading among the tabloids and fans of True Detective are searching for the Yellow Sign in satanic rituals. Peter H. Gilmore, the current High Priest of the Church of Satan, has been [a guest on CNN](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2014/02/17/satanist-church-accused-craigslist-killer-not-one-of-us/), [interviewed by the CBC](http://www.cbc.ca/day6/popupaudio.html?clipIds=2438899671) and numerous other outlets (published and unpublished) in an effort to defuse a revival of the Satanic Panic from 80's and 90's. It's a shame that for many people the only exposure to Satanism is in reaction to such grim, pointless insanity; when by and large the Satanists I know are some the most life-loving individuals I've ever encountered.   Due to the recent media exposure I'm not surprised to see several threads hitting the front page of Reddit mentioning Satanism, attempted AMA's from questionable sources, and a genuine interest in what Satanism and the Church of Satan is actually about. Obviously one can go to the Church of Satan's website and [check out the basic texts](http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php) and [FAQ](http://churchofsatan.com/frequently-asked-questions.php), but we recognize that humans are social creatures and a certain level of interaction can help drive points home.    That said, my name is Raul A. and I'm an officially ordained Priest in the Church of Satan, and have been an active Satanist for over 10 years. In my time with the Church of Satan, and well before that, I've interacted with Satanists with a wide range of interests, personalities, and backgrounds. I've organized concerts with Satanic folk bands to experimental electronic musicians. I am the technical director of [Radio Free Satan](http://www.radiofreesatan.com/). My wedding was officiated by a Satanic Priest, I enjoyed Tiki drinks and 50's music with High Priestess Peggy Nadramia, and watched Kaiju films and talked Pacific Rim with High Priest Gilmore. I've also known many nonpublic Satanists who, for various reasons, cannot openly proclaim their worldviews.     Why am I doing this AMA? For one, I think the Reddit community is interested in the topic and has been mostly given a poor representation of what Satanism is about, in theory and practice. I've seen some fairly interesting questions go without responses, and mostly a lot of talk from people who "read Crowley in high school" (FYI, Crowley never identified himself as a Satanist, and has very little to with Satanism) or "knew a guy once". Responses are often such a bore and miss the point entirely.    So here's your chance, ask me anything! And, like any decent Satanist, let's make this fun! Let's try things other than the usual "Why call it Satanism if you don't believe in Satan" (*), let's talk about life, experiences, and the pleasures of the material world! Let the games begin!    Proof: http://imgur.com/a/wAPvz?gallery  * The "Satan" in "Satanism" refers to the Hebrew word for "the adversary", and that is the context in which we use it. We understand that the human animal has an innate need for religion, symbolism, and dogma so we Satanists willfully choose the one we most identify with.  Edit: I have a business call to attend to for an hour or so, I'll be back shortly!  Edit: Seems that many of my responses have been downvoted to Hell (ba dum). Here's a handy Q A table http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/1zgfeg/table_i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan/    Edit: Time to roll up the tent. Overall I had a fairly good time, answered a few good questions, made some new friends, and ran into some old ones. If you haven't seen my responses, especially in the first few hours of this AMA, it's because my comments were immediately being downvoted and hidden from the default views([I didn't realize Reddit were such big fans of the Westboro Baptist Church](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/cfte5pu)). See the table above or my comment history to see my responses, [which apparently is more than most celebrity AMA's combined](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1zg23j/i_am_a_priest_in_the_church_of_satan_nevermind/?sort=confidence#cftg9u9). Special thanks to the moderators who've attempted to inject some rationality and to /u/Milagre for the help with the Q A Table.   Many great points have been made. High Priest Gilmore's interview response answers the death penalty question clearly. As for stratification, there are Church of Satan members actively advocating for political and economic reforms that would reduce government interference. See this piece from Blanche Barton:     "Number one is stratification and is emphasized by our founding High Priest as, the point on which the other four goals ultimately rest. It advocates allowing people to sink or swim according to their own talents and abilities, instead of being protected from the consequences of their own incompetence. If a person is ethical, productive, sensitive and knows how to conduct himself among human beings, fine; if hes a destructive, amoral parasite, he should be dealt with quickly and cruelly. We havent achieved this yet. Because of the continuing cult of victimization, many incompetent, malefic beings are contentedly sucking enormous resources from our munificent government, sending us all into obscene debt, threatening the financial and social stability of our nation. As we keep working to enlighten, the compulsion to care for the PC appointed undeserving victims will dissipate like a cloud of unreason, leeches will be recognized for what they are and eradicated."    http://churchofsatan.com/five-point-plan-revisited.php.       Thank you for pointing that out. It's been fixed.   Going deep into Satanic epistemology and metaphysics is something I'm personally interested in but would be out of the scope of this thread.   Belief in Greater Magic beyond self-medication and psychodrama is up to each individual. Some members of the Church of Satan, including Magister Nemo, are interested in the research done to explain their own experiences. There are also many other members, including Magisters, who have little to no interest in rituals beyond emotional release. The Church of Satan does not have a hardline stance on the matter, because like most researchers and scientists, we accept "we don't know" as an answer. Did LaVey express great interest and belief in the power of magic? Yes, but he did not impose this belief on others. *If* one was interested in magic, he laid down the groundwork and system for practical use.        "We emphasize that the philosophy of the Church of Satan does not require that our members believe that ritual is more than an emotional experience, nor is there a mandate even to ritualize at all. We simply offer it as a tool for experimentation. Some folks have found results that they feel are beyond coincidence or statistical parameters. Others simply enjoy the release of emotions otherwise hindering their pursuit of personal happiness."   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycat_crime   A healthy ego can easily respect, acknowledge, and learn from others. Otherwise you're an uneducated, pretentious asshole.   The Enochian Keys were included because they were *forbidden* in the occult community and this amused LaVey. He makes it very clear that Enochian is included for emotional stimulation. That's it. No occult or supernatural reason for it. He even recommends skipping Enochian if it doesn't work for you and instead reciting your favorite poetry. We call upon the demonic archetypes for emotional and aesthetic stimulation, and at the highest levels the projection of our own egos.    How were you drawn to Satanism if you haven't even read the most basic, simple texts? You can read through the Satanic Bible in about 2 hours, and if you're really that short in time you can go to the Church of Satan website and read the summarized texts there.     http://churchofsatan.com/theory-practice.php   1. Individualism does not equal being in complete isolation. Individualism emphasizes (keyword here) the individual over the group, thus putting ones own self-interests first. This does **not** mean you completely disregard society or the interests of other people.     If being in a group increases your stimulation and thus increases the chances of your magical working succeeding, then it is in your individual interest to work with other like minded individuals. The other people involved in your ritual should share your goals, and if they are people who care about you then it is in their interest to help you succeed and be happy, giving them happiness and satisfaction in return. If you read the Satanic Bible you'll see that private rituals are the preferable method of ritualizing. Group rituals should *only* be done with close, trusted associates, not random people who just want to hang out and play along.       2. First of all, in Satanism all magic is black magic. The distinction between black and white magic comes from guilt-ridden occultists who think any magic which benefits you is black magic. Since we believe that all magic benefits you in some way, directly or indirectly, the distinction is merely pretentious. Second of all, practicing greater magic does not mean you believe in external deities, demons, angels, etc. See this entry in the FAQ:    http://churchofsatan.com/faq-ritual-and-ceremony.php    "However, some Satanists also consider the possibility that, through the raising of emotions focused towards a specific achievable goal in ritual, ideas/concepts/images might be transmitted to the minds of other people at a distance, thus perhaps influencing them to make future decisions favorable to the outcome of the situation desired by the magician (transmitter). It then seems to us plausible that there would be a means that is part of nature through which this works. It is not attained through the intervention of supernatural beings, as we do not believe such things exist. The desired goal, what we call an Is-To-Be, would vary based on peoples' ability to transmit as well as receive such images as well as the likelihood of the situation towards which the magician is working."     We *never* worship or acknowledge higher powers.    I was of the idea that if I wanted metal I would listen to actual extreme metal, not an Electronic Rock band. I don't necessarily agree with that nowadays, but I still don't really care for Ministry for various reasons.   All the references to Cold Meat Industry in the various interviews in [DESCENT magazine](http://www.ideologic.org/news/view/3241). I was into Black/Death Metal and got interested in what other forms of extreme music was out there. I started picking up releases from Deutsch Nepal, In Slaughter Natives, and Brighter Death Now. When I would tell metalheads that I was getting into Industrial they would refer me to Ministry or Skinny Puppy, so I looked in them as well. I was incredibly disappointed. I would later grow to appreciate SP but never got into the former.

Despite this, the book inspired copy-cat accusations throughout the world,[6][20][21] against in many cases members of the Church of Satan, non-satanic occultists, and others with no connection to the occult."

 After playing a real obscene number of hours in Kerbal Space Program, I got into Simple Rockets pretty well, even landed on the Smoon and Smars - it is a bit easier thanks to being 2D - but I can't seem to be able to match velocity with rendezvoused-with ships. Docking was one of my favourite activities in KSP and I was quite good at it, but afaik there is nothing like relative velocity nullifying marker in SR. I managed to dock only once, and it was not very graceful, which is displeasing. I don't know how to use that grey thing.   It was on Reddit some months ago, it was a project of a group of students of Spanish language. I need it quickl, thanks.      a) Every so often I experience a bug where the ship starts to rotate (using reaction wheels, it consumes power) by itself and only SAS keeps it in check and I can't get rid of it (not even by reloading). I suspect it has something to do with using physical/time warp or SAS toggling while rotating. Does anyone else experience this? How to get rid of it?  b) Is it possible to jettison an engine without having it set as an action group?   The beginning of the conversation is lost (it began at Omegle, it was basically that he is a Messianic Jew and he believes in the creation by Yahweh). This is copy paste of our email conversation (without names, emails and greetings); I would like to know what do you think of my reasoning, if I should improve something. Thanks.  http://sharetext.org/yG6f  He hasn't responded since that last email a week or two ago.         E.g. if I was dreaming about riding a rollercoaster which was about to smash into a wall, a cat jumping on me in the real world would project itself into the dream as the impact.  My brain doesn't have any way to predict the future, does it?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVkDrIacHJM feature=youtu.be  I don't think that the message needs to be spelled out. In this form it is quite obvious.  Aside from the message, it is extremely well done.   Hello! I am quite fond of KSP, and this caught my eye as something I would surely enjoy (building bases/ships/...). It is on sale, however, I can't spend money on it this month. I would be very thankful to whoever would be so generous as to gift me,  and I make sure to pay it forward in the future. :)  [Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)   It was an issue we came upon today in school while discussing animal mistreatment.      This question occured me today - do the turning radars at KSP point at some specific point or trajectory in space? Is is possible that there are some undiscovered easter eggs?                        Fellow froods and froodesses! Every Earth year on May the 25th, we hold a tradition of visibly carrying towels around with us, because on this date, there is a regular increase in flying saucers fly-bys, though we can't see them easily due to SEP field, and we have to be prepared for sudden untold adventures, Earth demolitions or serendipitious petunia materalizations.  In every case, this act also serves as a homage to Douglas Noel Adams, who ~~wrote~~ received from extraterrestrial beings this utterly extraordinary trilogy in five parts, and decided to share it with us.  Whatever happens this day, don't panic. Or every other day, for that matter...      http://viiphoto.com/articles/terror-car-bleasdale/  Just reading this makes me sick. They use religion as an excuse to slaughter each another. It is surreal.   I am interested in reading Krauss's book Universe from Nothing, and I'd like to know if the recent discovery of gravity waves affect that hypothesis in any way, and how?  If this question makes no sense, I am sorry, I am no scientist.                     Ever since 0.23.5, I am often experiencing a weird time warp/gravity physics bug, where all parts of my vessel except the main part (capsule or whatever) go limp (as if in a freefall without horizontal speed), it becomes fixed (meaning it doesn't move and it is not affected by neither pressing keys or burning) and the trajectory changes rapidly even when not burning. When I try to time warp again it says that the time warp cannot be used under acceleration, or it disassembles rapidly.   It happens in orbit around Kerbin.   I've seen a mod that adds giant asteroids (FSAA or something like that) as parts, but no mods that make them appear like vanilla asteroids. I understand that they would be virtually unmovable, but cool bases could be built on them. Is there any engine constraint preventing this?         I have passed both levels in practice tests, but I have a dilemma. I was almost bored when doing B2, but I am not very sure I can pass C1 again, though I did good in the practice test.   I run it on an old notebook (to process one chunk of data lasts several hours) and I don't know if I actually contribute to anything. And I heard some skepticims about whether one should run it.                                                      It seems to make the game a lot more realistic, if harder. Or there could be an option to toggle KSP/realistic gameplay.  What is the reason for not having incorporated it in the game yet?      Today I decided to play Ace of Spades Classic once again, so I go to a server and join the blue team. After changing several maps, one turns up where blue team is having its ass kicked really hard, when a message suddenly appear in the chat:   We may not be winning in the game, but we are winning in our hearts.  Thank you, random stranger, for encouraging me a little.      http://i.imgur.com/iz3FWBK.png   Come on sucker, lick my battery!   Do you think it had some connection to THE box or to Rainbow Power? Surely if she was studying somethingunrelated, they could just make her sitting and reading silently?                     She's an indoor cat, and we don't plan her to have kittens anyway, so we're going to get her spayed. I googled about it and what are the benefits, but I still feel bad about how drastic it seems and that she won't be able to reproduce. It is just sad :(      I sometimes go there to see what retarded things people say there, and it never fails me laugh. But it also enrages me a little, when I what turds can people spew of their mouths, and how ignorant some of them are - religion serves them as an excuse to not seek reason, to abandon critical thinking, to embarras themselves. Cattle do not see the stars and think they are special in the universe. In comparsion with immersity of the universe, we are uncomparably less than nothing.  I hope there won't be a shortage of people who publicly present reason, science, atheism etc. to people, because I have a grave feeling that it might actually be possible for the world to become a place where non-believers would be put ot death, if there would be no vocal opposition.  Just wanted to get this off my chest, carry on, or discuss it, if you wish.         I am watching Frozen right now (had heard that it is a nice progressive fairy tale) and it is well known that Disney movies work for majority of people, they can make people smile and cry at every age. Why exactly is that?      What if all those things with right arm are just a running joke to tease us, just like with the snail? Are there some solid pieces of evidence implying that he is really going to lsoe his arm?  I just watch the series, I haven't read comics or anything other yet.         [In the newest infostorm](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/content/265-Kerbal-Space-Program-Asteroid-Redirect-Mission-The-FAQ) there was this passage.   **What is this Claw thing?**  The Advanced Grappling Device, or claw, is your primary means of capturing an asteroid. The Claw works very much like a docking port, however, it doesnt require a mate node to dock to. That means it can grab on to almost any object. Once grabbed on, you can even transfer fuel from the grabbed objects (provided they have any).   Does this mean that regular docking ports become less useful? This wording implies that I can just launch a fuel tank tank with a probe on it into orbit and suck from it with this claw thingy.         I posted some shops to /r/photoshopbattles a few times, but I actually enjoy more cutting people/things out than think what witty should I do with it.                  A few weeks ago I have read an article about possible human colonies floating in Venusian atmoshere, and a question occured to me whether something like that would be possible to build in atmosphere of some Kerbol system planets?  I read on the wiki that lighter probes don't even need a parachute on Jool, so I don't think it would be completely impossible. What do you Kerbal rocket scientist think?  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonization_of_Venus#Aerostat_habitats_and_floating_cities                     I do it just as a hobby, don't get any money.               Life would have been much easier.  **Edit:**  Utterly meaningless coincidence:   Bartledanian books are 100 000 words long. According to the [Words to Pages](http://www.wordstopages.com/) converter, a book with 100 000 words written in Arial font size 12 with double spacing would have 365.3 pages. That is almost exactly the same number as number of days in a year.      Whoever posts best inspirational quote wins and I'll send them the key.   Just because it is so nice and quiet here      I get that you can carry 1000 books in a reader everywhere, but paper books are flexible, have "personality", last potentially a very long time and frankly, do you really need to read 15 books at a time?   No posts. I am not longer interested in it, so anyone else can take care of it.                     I know there is no point to it without mods beside satisfying feel, but i would like to ask you what do you think should be there, how big it should be and so on.  EDIT: Without mods of any kind         [Steam ID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)  I will make sure to pay it forward :)      I will make sure to pay it forward.  [SteamID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)   I loved original Octodad, yet when the sequel finally releases, i have no money. :/  I'd make sure to pay it forward. :)  [SteamID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)   I think we should get a bot which would after typing something like "BibleVerse: Part XX:XX" respond with corresponind verse from standard King James Bible.  Commenters on this sub often adress some verses, so this could be useful. I wonder whether this idea have been proposed before, if it was, i am sorry.  Same could be done for other holy books too.    It's because of authority of the person who said them? Or because the quotee formulated the idea so well that a quoter feel they don't need to add anything?  And why some people hate quotes so much?              I was on Minmus with Bill and Bob. On the top of a lander there was a rolling probe, so i rolled it about 1,5 km away, did some measurements and flew with Jeb to collect data (well, more slid than flew).  When i was a few tens of meters from it, i switched to probe to slightly angle it for convenience. When i wanted to switch back, there was no Jeb.  He disappeared.  I was confused at first and looked for him all over, but he simply vanished. I went to Astronaut Complex and he is listed as MIA.  What the hell?  BTW when i planted the flag i named it Jebediah's Vision after that creepypasta; coincidence much?   [SteamID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)  It released yesterday, but i don't have any money. It is on sale now. I would be very grateful and make sure to pay it forward later.   I play on lowest setting due to my old PC, but i was thinking if i could afford to make my game a bit prettier without losing performance.      After almost 300 hours of playtime i found out how to rotate parts in 5 steps and how to clone. I feel stupid. I was thinking how people make Death Stars and bowling balls and lithobraking stuff and it never occured to me to google it. If i did not watch some Manley's video i wouldn't know it... I thought i figured the game by myself. Well, i have a lot to learn yet.  Edit: And of course the rest of controls too, i forget to mention it.   I am browsing interwebs and what i don't see like announcement that the Octodad sequel finally came out! I am extremely happy, but i remember i ran out of my allowance for this month and will have to wait and buy it when it will be not on sale anymore.  So please, if someone could give it to me, i would be very grateful and make sure to pay it forward later.  [My SteamID](http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997373039)               I am pleased. I love oatmeal. I think i am going to make myself a cup.   The question of money would be put aside, because people would realize the utmost importance of expanding into space, so all materials and workforce would be for "free" (people could even volunteer for working on some tasks like manufacturing parts, which would then be send to ~~World Space Center~~ Starfleet from all over the world; those who participate in programme would get all they need from governments)                     Note: I am a fan of 2005's Doctor Who. I am not planning on watching older series, i am quite content with the new.  I must say it is one of the best series i've seen. About a year ago i started to hear from my friends how good it is, they posted DW related things on Facebook and i am naturally quite open-minded, so i put it on my imaginary "To watch" list, but i did not rush in any way, actually, it was one of my new classmates who gave me needed push.  First episodes were feeling like it was a cheap TV production - it probably was, and i do not complain - and it got better with time. I love series which have consistent universe, and DW satisfied me in this way.  Not everyone may see it same, but i like how they put homosexuality in there every so often - i am not a homosexual or in LGBT community, but i am happy for those people, i support them (of course i like gay jokes and so on, but that is different). I also felt some atheist themes in the series, that was pleasant too. I also very like the Doctor's "no guns" policy, it's not something you can see very often today.  I sure am going to continue watching, though i call myself just a fan (don't really have urge to call myself whoovian yet; maybe this will be my backup fandom)          "Oh, you wicked, wicked little thing!" cried Alice, catching up the kitten, and giving it a little kiss to make it understand that it was in disgrace.

I flew to the Mun and collected high amount of scientific data, but i underestimated needed power to get back to Kerbin, and poor Kerbal must have EVAed (of course with data) and set himself on stable orbit. So i send first rescue - it was a probe with four solar panels, i don't know how, but i managed to position the way that no light could reach them, thus rendering probe dead. For my second try i attached two 1x6 automatic panels to it and i even managed to get rendezvous orbit - but in the wrong way! Now i am going for my third try. Wish me luck!  EDIT: Finally! That was insane, it took 4 tries before i managed to pick up poor Kerbal, and then i had to position vessel hanging on a parachute so he won't fall off his seat (another valuable lesson - always using capsules).      If i add an addon, will it render my vanilla profile save unusable in vanilla again, even if i don't use modded parts?   I have googled a bit, but i can't see nothing.         What is the point in rescuing Kerbals?  Have you ever collided with a piece of debris from your earlier launches?  Do you consider mods cheating?   I landed dozen or so manned modules on Mun, i learned to dock on orbit (i started to build a space station) and i got a few new upgrades.

 From the linked article:  S P, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc, has said statements about the integrity of its ratings are "puffery" that cannot be a basis for the fraud lawsuit, filed on February 4 by the U.S. Department of Justice.  "Puffery" is a legal term amounting to [promotional statements and claims that express subjective rather than objective views, which no "reasonable person" would take literally.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffery)  That has to be one of the most fatuous statements I have heard in a long time.  They SOLD their ratings not on the basis of "puffery" but clearly as intended to be factual assessments of the given securities they were rating.  Seems a court got this right this time.       The main purpose of the One Ring was to dominate the will of the users of the other nine rings.  Men succumbed almost instantly to this.  The Elves figured out what was up with their rings and took them off before they could be used against them and I forget what the Dwarves did with their rings.  That said only Sauron could wield that power.  If others used the ring it came to dominate them and would have them seek out Sauron to return the ring to Sauron (the ring was imbued with Sauron's spirit to an extent).    Richard Feynman (great scientist) explains this well: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tuxLY94LXw  Short version is it gets front/back reversed and not right/left.   There is no limit to the amount of data they could collect in principle.  The problem lies in cost and how big the unit is to be able to hold all that additional information and still remain as resilient as they are.  Over the years more and more data has been added to the black box so they record more than they once did.  Whether there are still some things they'd like to record that they don't or they feel this is enough to determine what happened I do not know.    You should do something to make your your first sentence that is a quote more obvious it is a quote.  I suspect a lot of your downvotes are because people think you are the one espousing that notion (on a first quick read I almost hit the downvote button till a second check I realized you were quoting the article).  *Italicize it* or use the quote function:  E.G. this thing  Or not as you like.  Just saying.  Carry on.        Battlepaws Galacticat   John McCain [voted against a bill he himself had originally sponsored](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2010/12/when-john-mccain-was-a-democrat-almost/68291/).     483 comments and only one original comment (all the rest are responses to that one top comment as of this writing).    Must be some kind of record.    I guess barring accidental ass bleaching which is apparently rare no one wants to admit to doing it on purpose.  That or Redditors are not a target market for ass bleaching.    This a hundred times.  The ending and the [look on their faces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage v=3JTH5VPAT4Y#t=166) is some of the best move making ever.    Germany had two fronts. Their ability to manufacture was easily bombed.  Actually German production [increased year-to-year](http://chris-intel-corner.blogspot.com/2013/05/wwii-myths-german-war-economy-was.html) throughout WWII despite the bombings.    Amen brother (or sister as the case may be).  You can eat a hundred steaks from a local supermarket and they'll be fine...good even.  Then you have a steak that is top notch.  The cow was raised well, the butcher knew their stuff and the chef knew how to make the best of that and you have something truly remarkable.  I've only had a few like that in my life (tends to be very expensive) but seriously...WOW!  Put it this way...I have had hundreds of steaks in my life.  I still remember those few distinctly many years later.    There are three grades of beef:  - Prime - Choice - Select  Prime is of course best and also expensive.  Choice is still very good and reasonably priced.  Select is cheapest and it shows.  For the most part steer clear of "Select" cuts.  By eye you can generally distinguish the cuts by the [amount of marbling](http://www.kansascitymamas.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/beef-grades.png) they have (more marbling = good).  ----  Try to understand the main parts of the cow and where a given cut comes from.  There is a lot of fiddly detail that can be learned but that would be class 301 and 401.  For 201 just try and remember this image: http://0.tqn.com/d/culinaryarts/1/0/i/Y/-/-/US_Beef_cuts.jpg  Note that in general the further away you are from the horn and the hoof the more tender the meat is (muscles that work more like leg muscles are tougher).  As such the tenderloin is the most tender cut.  This is not to say tougher cuts are bad...far from it.  They just need to be cooked a bit differently and/or longer for a desirable result.  That said in general the more tender cuts tend to be more expensive (doubtless there are exceptions).  ---- Avoid the Round part of the cow.  I am sure there are some recipes that make good use of it but I cannot think of one off the top of my head and would have to look it up.  That said the round is cheap...probably the cheapest part of the cow so if you are on a serious budget it can be a consideration.  You'll just have to work harder to make something good of it.  ----  When buying meat make sure the specific part is listed.  If you buy "stew meat" and other generic sounding bits it is usually from the round and other undesirable cuts they are hard pressed to sell otherwise.    So, for instance, when buying hamburger get ground chuck and not just "hamburger" which will probably be the round (ground sirloin works too but ground chuck is more usual).  ----  Understand how different cuts cook.  A NY Strip is great for grilling.  A brisket needs a long, slow cook. Bigger cuts may need to be braised.  The more connective tissue and what not the longer you need to cook it.  ----  Cheaper cuts are not necessarily "worse".  The tenderloin is probably the most expensive cut but it has little flavor (very lean...it is prized for being tender...the chef needs to add flavor).  A brisket is a cheaper cut but can be freaking awesome when cooked properly.  Again, just stay away from the round (in most cases). ;)    Must be an age thing.  I recognized all of it.  Thing is you rarely see a chateaubriand or even a t-bone on a menu anymore (restaurants figured there is more money in selling a filet and a NY Strip than a t-bone I think).  It was only a couple weeks ago at a specialized butcher that I saw the first tomahawk cut in ages...I was a kid last time I saw that in the meat case.  Hangar steak is indeed making a comeback.  Had not seen it in ages and am now seeing more of it very recently.  I think that is because beef prices are way up and it is a relatively cheap cut so they can offer a steak on the menu and retain a profit margin and not scare customers.  Ribeyes and the rest have been around forever.             I bought a Samsung 840 Pro 512GB SSD.  My current system has two drives running in Raid-0 for a total of 250GB (I know but it has served me very well for years).  My question is when I install the new SSD should I leave the current drives in and migrate or unplug the old drives, setup the new drive and do a fresh install of windows and all that?  Either is doable.  Of course migrating would be simpler overall.  I do not know if there are issues getting trim to run via this method though.  Opinions?                                                Where is everyone?  I figured the Wrigleyville area to be a hotbed of Reddit activity!                                           You can see a description of the recent uproar [here](https://tv.yahoo.com/news/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-vogue-cover-backlash-anna-193400697.html).  While I, personally, am no fan of West or Kardashian and view them both as symbols of what is (at least partly) wrong with this country I am not understanding why there is an uproar over their appearance on the cover of Vogue.  It is my understanding Vogue is a fashion magazine.  West and Kardashian are certainly fashionable and attractive (physically).  Since when is Vogue meant to be socially minded or politically active?  Even if readers think they should be how can these two be so controversial *especially* considering their success?  I thought the sorts of people who read Vogue are the sorts of people who are [Keeping up with the Kardashians](http://www.eonline.com/shows/kardashians).  I do not get it.                                                                                                                I have been looking to buy a [Sony KDL-55W900A](http://www.amazon.com/Sony-KDL-55W900A-55-Inch-240Hz-Internet/dp/B00AWKBZ0M/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics ie=UTF8 qid=1377791638 sr=1-1 keywords=kdl-55w900a).  Unfortunately it really is a bit big for the space I want it in.  Doable but would rather have a 46" set.  Unfortunately Sony does not sell the same model in the US in a 46" version.  Their 46" one is a step down in terms of the technology inside.  I was surprised to find that Sony does actually make a 46" version of that set and sell it in [Asia](http://www.sony-asia.com/product/kdl-46w900a) and [Australia](http://www.sony.com.au/product/kdl-46w900a).   I would MUCH rather have the 46" set and am puzzled why Sony would not sell it in the US but that seems to be the case.  So my question to those here is are there any reasons to *not* buy the TV from overseas and have it shipped?  Things like the menus are in a foreign language and can't be changed (not really a problem from Australia though) or the TV has some kind of regional locking or stuff like NTSC vs PAL from the old days or anything else?  Or do HDTVs work the same everywhere?                                                 Follow-up:  If the allies were aware the holocaust was happening why did they keep it a secret? (At least I cannot recall seeing any propaganda by the allies about it and the soldiers, at least, certainly seemed surprised when they liberated the first camps.)                                                    So...looking to revisit Borderlands 2 and maybe get some DLC Steam tells me there is [$110 dollars](http://i.imgur.com/LSpGzoc.png) worth to be had.  Pretty sure there is overlap here and seems kinda shitty Steam would lay out a $110 pricetag but maybe I am wrong.  So...what is the deal with this?

Are there enough people to play FIFA 14 on PC, online and stuff like that?      I think I'm almost done with the game, and I'm packed up with potions ( full of everything ) have 300+ gold left, and I came to the point where I had to check if my difficulty didn't lower it self while I was playing.   The game is really great, I love it so far, but I feel that it could've been more challenging.   What do you think about it?   pls, I'm very confused   My current specs are following:   CPU; AMD ATHLON II X4 640 @ 3.00GHz QuadCore  Memory; 8GB RAM DDR3 1333MHz "Kingston"PC10666 CL9  Harddrive; 500GB Sata  Graphic card; ATi RADEON Sapphire HD7850 1GB GDDR5  Motherboard: FOXCONN A78AX 3.0  I want to upgrade my processor ( + motherboard since this one doesn't support AM3+ ) so, what do you think I should get with this configuration with around 300$?   I'm playing on 1920x1080.  Should I get an SSD too?     What's the Length of the game with and without side-quests?   Is there any video to show how good this game is and why is it actually good game?   I mean how to make someone love the game if you know what I mean.

This is my currently build, and I'm afraid to buy Dayz thinking it wouldn't perform properly due to bad optimisations.   Should this be enough to run the game without a hitch?  And I kinda want the game so leaving for a bit until they potentionally fix the optimisation is kinda not an option, since they may up the price a little bit then and stuff like that ...  	165
 If we were all defined by our extremists, I reckon we would be in quite a pickle. KKK members and white supremacists certainly aren't the norm in our faith, just like extremists aren't the norm in yours.  I was in Afghanistan. I have seen firsthand the difference between radicals, and everyday Muslims. I still do not understand why so many are so willing to propogate some kind of "new crusades".   I found conviction in my beliefs by finding conviction in His word. I have never had any experience of God. No feelings, no eerie emotions. I do believe his word because he has, by grace, enabled me to believe it.    Hello, Afghanistan veteran here.  I am curious to know whether you think the war/military intervention has made Iraq better or worse, from personal experience?  1. How has the country changed since Saddam's regime fell, in your personal experience?  2. How has U.S. intervention affected you personally?  3. What are your opinions about the war and the soldiers who fought it?   I think they are basically the same thing as Tacoma's in the U.S       Ah, toyota hilux's. I haven't seen one of those since Afghanistan.   As a Reformed Presbyterian I would answer the question by saying we do not have free will. Our will is limited in scope and ability.   Yes, I believe in predestination.   Reason is not a conservative publication.      I am in the Army. I spend varying lengths of time away from my wife, from days at a time to over a year. Sometimes we can skype, sometimes call, we have written letters, sometimes we cannot talk for weeks at a time.       Maybe you missed the news breaking that our government has been actively spying on us...      1984 is amazing. Be prepared to realize you are living right in the middle of it.   Good night.. I love how they always justify it with "every other developed country has hate speech laws". If our neighbors hate liberty, so must we!   It puts the fragility of life into perspective. Though I am only in my twenties, the attitude of bullettproof youth is all gone. Experiences like that tend to make you grow up quickly too. I think I am more mature than many of my civilian peers because I have come to realize the things most of them think are important, are not important at all.    "You give them credibility when you silence yourself,"  Now that is what I am talking about.      *To Kill A Mockingbird* taught me what true masculinity should look like, what meekness was, and how courageous it was to stand up for lost causes. It taught me that justice is not dependent on what our peers think it is. Atticus Finch is still my role model. One day, if we have a son, my wife and I have agreed to name him Atticus.      I was in Afghanistan at 22. Watched a friend die up close.   I would say that whole experience has shaped and defined me in a way not much else could.   Bring them a gift. Donuts or coffee.  BTW, I wish I could meet them. I am a soldier. I would love to give them a cup of coffee and tell them I recognize and respect their humanity, even if they do not respect mine.   **Countries I have felt safe in**   * U.S.   * Romania  * Canada  * Turkey  **Countries I have felt unsafe in**  * Afghanistan     Adidas and Puma were started by rival brothers. Both brothers were diehard nazis. Both companies contributed to clothing the nazis.   I am a soldier. Yes, absolutely fulfilling. I get sent to crapholes all around the world, work retarded hours, gripe and complain about every minute of it. But I would not trade it for the world.    I love MC Lars's stuff. He is a English geek who became a hip hop artist, using hip-hop to teach literature.  [Here](http://youtu.be/1ucYtOk_8Qo) is his TEDx talk entitled *The hip-hop of Shakespeare*  And [here](http://youtu.be/lR7NmXdEMCg) is one of my favorite songs by him, an adaptation of Poe's *Annabel Lee* into hip-hop.  Be forewarned, he is quirky as hell.   [This interview](http://youtu.be/qzKzu86Agg0) by ReasonTV with Mike Rowe on the high cost of college.   And [this poem by Jesse Parent](http://youtu.be/KcIwZ1Dth0c) entitled "To The Boys Who May One Day Date My Daughter"   [*FRESH*](http://www.freshthemovie.com) really made me think about where my food is coming from. As a result, I try to be more conscious about how my food was made.   Plus it introduced me to Joel Salatin and his ideas, who is now one of my heroes.   There really is not a quick way to earn money. The best bet is to pick up an extra job and pay it off chunk by chunk. It may take awhile, but it is the only stable solution.   And the statists call our economics "magical".      Nobody at your unit can help you. You have to talk to your branch manager.    They pay the service provider to air their ads because that exposes their product to a large group of consumers.  Paying the consumers directly to watch an ad to convince them to buy the product is an incredibly roundabout and expensive way of doing it. It would cost a huge sum of money to reach the amount of people just one ad on a regular television program reaches.    Some of it has to do with the fact that places like Thailand have extremely unregulated sex workers. If you were looking for things that were frowned upon by developed society (age) you would obviously go somewhere where there is not a ton of regulation of that market.   Some denominations continued using wine, and the producers of sacramental wine were able to get exemptions.  Other denominations who were at the head of the prohibitionist movement switched to using grape juice. One of the fellows who started Welch's grape juice company was a vehement advocate for teetotaling, and tried to advocate for grape juice being used at the communion table.   That divide still exists today. Many of the more fundamentalist Christian denominations who advocate teetotalism use grape juice instead of wine at the Table.   Tom Cruise or Steve Carell. Both classy and hilarious guys.   I hate late night shows like Letterman, but anytime either of those gentlemen are guests I have to tune in.   Left Hand Brewing's Nitro Milk Stout.   There is nothing wrong with this. Joining the military is an act of voluntary association. You agree to their rules.   I agree with ending the drug war, but if an employer includes restricting drug use in an employment contract, and you agree to that contract, you are held to that contract.   Awesome! Our library staff here on Fort Drum is incredible.   That is the point of stand up comedy. If they got up there and gave accurate, totally unexaggerated representations of the people in their lives, it would not be funny at all. So they exaggerate, make stereotypes, and *make jokes*.   Not a librarian, but I just wanted to say I have a tremendous amount of respect for y'all. No matter where I have lived (literally all over as a military servicemember) the local library has always welcomed me with open arms. I think data and information management is such a ncessity in a developed society. Folks do not know how important y'all are.   So thank you!   With steak.  Because I am a man.   Because you are a gigolo who takes working lunches?   Ah, I see. Is it British slang?   Fine. I joined the Army. I am originally from South Alabama, they moved me to Northern New York. I have learned to like it though. Been here three years, became very active in the community, have friends, still miss boiled peanuts.   Tobacco pipe smoking.   Could you explain what a sarnie is?   **OP**  1. I am in the Army. I work in a motorpool helping maintain trucks.   2. I bring an old green stanley lunchbox with me to work everyday. It is usually filled with a bar of lava soap, moonpies or little debbie cakes, two sandwiches (usually bologna or salami on white bread), chips or a small green thermos of soup, and a can of coca-cola. I also bring a gallon jug of sweet tea that I consume throughout the work day and whatever book I am currently reading.  I get about an hour lunch break. I scrub my hands, sit down in my office, and eat at a back desk, taking my time.  3. I usually use my lunchbreak to either listen to a podcast (either *This American Life*, *How Stuff Works*, or *Planet Money*), or reading a bit of whatever book I am currently working on. After my break I am usually energized to finish the rest of the day (which tends to be long).   1. What is your vocation?  2. Describe a typical workday lunch ritual for you.  3. Do you use your lunch break for anything other than quickly scarfing down substinence?   She paints, makes crafts, volunteers at our local USO, volunteers for the military family readiness group, and teaches classes to new Army wives.   A Maglite.   A large bag of marshmallows.  A thermos of coffee.  Emma Stone.     Because I do not go to parties. And if I did, they would not be parties with dancing. They would probably be scrabble parties. Or maybe jeapordy parties. Perhaps I would even get crazy and attend one of my book club's parties. But never *ever* a dancing party.   Does humanity have a good track record when it comes to reacting peacefully to people who are different than them?   It depends on how quickly the state were dismantled.   The first step is to stop forcing people to pay into Social Security in the first place.         Samwise sounded more like Spock.   You listed many pros, but I think you forgot a con.  There is the possibility you would see Hillary naked one day. Think about that for a minute.      Emma Stone.   [Obvious reasons](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/gPc3h)   Most religious people have absolutely no problem talking about sex.  .   Firefly.   I am not with it at all. I don't really like pop culture, so I just kind of ignore it.   Not exactly. Ukraine is a totally seperate country. Ukraine was a part of the USSR, but when the USSR dissolved Ukraine won independence.  Now Crimea, which was a small state within Ukraine, has voted to leave Ukraine and annex to Russia. Ukraine is still a totally seperate nation though.   Yeah, I still have no clue either. It seems totally bogus to me, whatever it was.   Welding. If you get certified, you can bring in some serious side hustle.    Nothing unbelievably. All of my skills are quite believable.     Are you asking for Australians to comment on their favorite American foods, or are you an Australian who wishes for Americans to comment on their favorite American foods?   Afghanistan has to be on the list.   I was there. The mountains are breathtaking. They have a rich and multifaceted culture that has been hijacked by religious extremism. Their economy, liberty, human rights etc are awful.   Basically I am asking how important you think it is to work a vocation that is totally your dream, as opposed to learning a skill you love some parts of and dislike other parts of.   Weigh in, how do you approach the idea of vocational fulfillment?   I just finished the episode, and I was floored by how sucked into this stuff people get.. Normal people leaving their jobs for a get rich scheme.. I dunno, it really surprised me.   What are some examples of market economies in which individuals were close to totally free markets, and those markets worked?  I am just looking for tangible examples of laissez faire working. Can y'all help?   There is not one value. Mature and responsible manhood is a combination of various attributes.   My workshop. I have a minifridge stocked with craft beer. The walls are decorated with various tin signs, beer neons, gun and ammuniton ads. My tools are laid around, but not in a disorganized way. Unfinished projects, currently a bookshelf, lie on the other half. I have a lived in recliner I picked up from a garage sale over by the minifridge.    Bootcamp will be the easiest part of your military career. Do not be an individual. Blend in, be quiet, do not stand out and you will be fine.  Remember, when you get to your first unit, nobody will give a shit how good you were in boot camp. So just get through it.    Probably a pavlovian effect created by years of advertising.  In other words, you have been programmed to react that way by years of watching someone drink coke on televison and making that sound.   If you are unfamiliar with classical conditioning [this Wikipedia article](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning) explains it.   It is hard to explain. Each department has a lot of independence. They are not exactly in the same chain of command. More like several cooperating entities with their own chains of command.   Kind of. They have different roles. If a crime happens within the city, and is confined to the city, it is usually the local PD who takes care of it. If it is a county wide thing, a crime involving several cities, or outside of city limits, the Sheriff will usually handle it. If it js a statewide thing, or something on state land, the troopers get it.   That being said, there is a ton of cooperation between departments. There is also conflict. Sometimes Sheriff's and Deputies overstep their bounds in city limits, and vice versa. It is a more organic relationship.    Sheriff's Dept. is the *county* police forcr, local PD's are the *city's* police force, and State Troopers are the *state's* police force.    What if there were a travel show in which the host visited notable libraries around the world? The Vatican Library,The Library of Congress, The Admont Library etc. There could even be episodes where famous authors take the host to their favorite libraries. Along the way the host could comment on notable rare books, library histories, ways in which libraries have contributed to their local communities, and other things.   I mean c'mon people, we have a travel show called *Booze Traveller*, but we cannot make a good travel show about books?   *Das Kapital* is on my reading list, I have been a little intimidated by it though, it is quite the beast.   Well they would if they were communists. But they are not.    China is communist in the same way the U.S. is capitalist, i.e. not at all. Do you believe the U.S. is an actual capitalist country? No. We are a mixed economy. We are a hybrid of semi-free markets and government intervention. China, N. Korea etc are the same way. They started out totally communist. Now they are hybrid states, centralized totalitarian authority states mixed with some form of limited market economy.   This makes literally zero sense. Marx and Engels's *Communist Manifesto* is the founding document of Communism.   Dry ice. Nitrogen cooling. Both would cool your items very quickly.   Yes I am aware. But obviously other nations have nuclear weapons. If we were a stateless society, how could we protect ourselves from other nations with nuclear weapons.   I am a pretty staunch libertarian, strong advocate for decentralization, and near ancap. I have a few reservations though. Perhaps y'all could help me.  1. What happens to nukes in Ancapistan? Obviously worldwide anarchism is not going to happen overnight, so even if the U.S. becomes a voluntary society, Russia, China etc will still have powerful weapons, and might seek to take advantage of what they see as a vulnerable situation. How do we as a society of individuals protect ourselves against these weapons? Also, what happens to the nukes the U.S government owns once it disbands?  2. Along those lines, how does a voluntary society protect itself from a sadistic individual obtaining a WMD? Say someone gets the money and ability to buy a powerful weapon. How do we stop him from killing thousands?  3. If the U.S. government disbanded, do you not see it as likely that another nation would try to use coercive force to take over? How could we possibly arm ourselves well enough to prevent that without a professional military.   These are just a few of my reservations. I definitely think liberty wins, and that ancap ideals can be implemented over a small scale, but I have a really hard time seeing it as a large scale option...   Gerbils, hamsters, ferrets, guinea pigs... all domesticated rodents.   I agree with what you are saying. Leftist descriptors are mostly slurs nowadays. Some libertarians do not understand the ideas behind leftist philosophy. This coming from a diehard capitalist.    I obviously disagree with them on fundamental issues, but the ignorance of many Americans about Socialism and Communism really bugs me.          Can someone recommend some libertarian debate videos? Anything liberty-related.      Can someone give me an easy explanation of the differences between socialist anarchism and anarcho-syndicalism?   Hey y'all.   I am an active duty soldier nearing the end of my enlistment. I am seriously considering the railroad as a post-military career. Maybe y'all can help me with some questions.  1. I am currently a shop supply specialist. I oversee the order of parts for the motorpool, schedule services, keep track of inventory etc. A lot of supply and maintenance management. How do these skills translate into railroading?  2. Are the hours as bad as I hear? Being in the military has gotten me used to long hours, being away from my family, but I have heard many horror stories about railroading.   3. How are the benefits?     I know y'all probably get a lot of these posts. I am sorry!   I am interested in podcasts about   Libertarianism  Art and literature  History  Social issues  Travel  Science fiction and fantasy       As the title says I am an avowed laissez faire capitalist libertarian looking to engage some socialists respectfully. I have some honest questions, I am not trying to argue or pick a fight, just looking for a civil conversation.  1. What do you think the biggest misconceptions are about socialism?  2. What is your opinion as a full socialist about mixed economies (like the U.S) where the market is neither totally free or totally socialist?  3. Do you see any difference between laissez faire capitalism and crony capitalism?  4. What books or media would you recommend to me so I can honestly understand the socialist perspective?  5. What would change in the U.S if it became a fully socialist country?  6. What things do people think would change in the U.S. if it were a socialist country, but would actually remain the same.    Sorry to lump my questions all together, I did not know of a better way.   Thanks!   1. How long have you been a Wobbly/how did you become a Wobbly?  2. What has the IWW done to improve your life?  3. How do IWW members view other consolodated unions? It seems there are many who want "one big union" but they are all fragmented.  4. How has the IWW changed to fit modern workers needs in your opinion?  5. Do you think the IWW is on the decline?   **My 5 Questions:**  1. How long have you been a Wobbly/how did you become a Wobbly?  2. What has the IWW done to improve your life?   3. How do IWW members view other consolodated unions? It seems there are many who want "one big union" but they are all fragmented.  4. How has the IWW changed to fit modern workers needs in your opinion?  5. Do you thibk the IWW is on the decline?    I am super obsessed with wanting to try [this](http://buy.rogue.com/rogue-sriracha-hot-stout-beer/). Has anyone here tried it? What is it like?   I get the basic idea, I know what Socialism is about, and I know that "libertarian" originally refered to socialists. I still don't get it.  1. Is libertarian socialism any different than regular socialism? How?  2. What the heck is anarcho-socialism about? Isn't the state a fundamental piece in the socialist theory?   Any other info would be great.      Hey y'all. I am going to be making a venison roast as the centerpiece for Christmas dinner this year. I am currently thinking about marinating it in red wine and black pepper then roasting it, but I thought I would ask Reddit for tips. Should I go in a different direction?   Do you see yourselves as counterculture or antiestablishment in realms of your life other than politics?      How much of an effect did the Treaty of Versailles have on the rise of Hitler? If the Treaty were more fair to Germany would the Nazi Party have still been able to take control?      Anything related to the labor movement, labor strikes, unionization etc. Books on these topics are pretty hard to find...   Worka that deal with political campaigns, political intrigue, fiction geared around politicians etc.    Can y'all recommend good fiction set during the Bolshevik Revolution/rise of Soviet Empire?   Basically self-explanatory. How much does readership factor into dateability for you?   I am looking to broaden my horizons. Please recommend rap/hip-hop for me?   Something educated. Proper wordsmiths speaking about social issues/important issues.   Nothing about partying, drugs, sex, etc. None of those things interest me.  I am not tryong to come off abrasive, I am genuinely looking to expand my horizons, but I need substance.   If you were to start dating a man who had PTSD How soon should he tell you? It becomes a core part of the victim's identity. How big of a factor would PTSD be when deciding whether to continue dating that person? Do you personally feel that you would be able to date someone you knew from the beginning had PTSD? There are no wrong answers, I am just curious as to opinions on this issue. Again, this is geared to be about someone you just recently started seeing/barely know yet.   If you were to start dating a man who had PTSD How soon should he tell you?

Again, this is geared to be about someone you just recently started seeing/barely know yet.   Do any of y'all keep a regular journal? If so, what kind?   I am an Anglican leaning Presbyterian who wants to implement a greater Advent awareness in my familiy's devotions. We are going to start using the BCP lectionary and Collects. What other things can we implement to deepen our Advent experience?   Which beer do you think goes well with Christmas? It does not have to be a seasonal beer necessarily, but any beer that tastes Christmasy to you.  For me it is actually Ommegang Witte. I know many see it as a refreshing summer beer (which it can be) but the spices and fruity overtones fit the holidays for me.   I am really into technical artwork, mechanical blueprints and cutaway art of machinery. Is there anywhere on the web I can gorge on scifi pics of imagined machines?         I think most of us feel the Army has made our lives better in some way. I am curious what life skills y'all would say the Army/deployment have given you? What specific ways have the Army made you a better person?   Putting together a playlist for a long ride, and I am curious what are some of y'alls favorite road trip songs?   For example, parents who leave children in hot cars, feeding kids horrible food and contributing to major health problems etc.  If so, is there a solution?   Honestly I was disappointed.. It was not content. I loved the idea, background, and setting. I think it was style. It was too short, too quick.. I barely had interaction with the setting, characters, or background. The "hook" was done poorly I thought. Things like that have to be done with subtlety, especially in short stories. It needed more buildup, more subtle shifting towards the two possible outside worlds..   **TL;DR** - Great idea, great setting, would have been better reworked as a novel with more time and depth. Barely three stars.   New guy here trying to get into GP. Please inform me?  Also, where does AMA Road racing and flat track racing fit into the picture? Is the AMA Road racing series completely unrelated to GP?    Does anyone know how I can find detailed technical manuals/drawings of various models of bikes? Is there a consolidated resource like this?   Just curious if any of y'all keep a journal for tobacco? I have been smoking pipes for a few years now, and I love trying new blends. I usually annotate the characteristics of new things I try, along with what kind of pipe I used, if I paired it with a beer or bourbon etc..  If you do keep a pipe/tobacco journal what layout do you use?   Can y'all give me some suggestions? I love vintage sound, I love pedal steel and old school sound engineering. I also like some more cowpunkish stuff.   I love Nikki Lane, Justin Townes Earle, Willie Nelson, Haggard, Hank III's traditional stuff, and Jamey Johnson among others.      I am curious to learn more about liberty mindfulness in the Democratic Party.  1. Who were some liberty minded Democrats of the past?  2. Are there any liberty minded Democrats today?  3. What were some historic stands that Democrats took for liberty?   I am in a rented apartment, and rather than pay the exorbitant repair fee to the landlord, I figured I would just spackle it up and paint it myself. The issue is that my walls have textured paint, something like orange peel, and I do not know how to replicate the texture. Can someone offer advice? The scratches are not huge, and I just need to blend them in to the rest of the wall.   1. What is the general opinion amongst Marxists regarding Lenin?  2. Were the RSFSR and subsequent USSR successful communist systems? Are they good examples of what most modern day communists would like to see Capitalist countries imitate?   Do communist refute self ownership? How do communists view the relationship between an individual and his own self?   1. Did the TechnoCore remind anyone else of Asimov's MultiVac?  2. Did anyone else think Brawne Lamia came off sounding annoyingky similar to a 50's noir pulp-fiction detective character?  All in all it was a great book.   This sub is full of recommendations for *The Name of The Wind*. It's been on my TR list for a long time, but after hearing all the hype I moved it to the top of my list. I was very disappointed. Kvothe was really unbelievable for me. He was just too flawless. The magic system seemed heavily borrowed from Earth sea. I didn't hate it, I'm actually really interested to read the new book about Auri (the underthing was my favorite part) but the book only got three stars from me.
