 This has to be made into a Wasted .gif!   "Those fuckin' hobbit movies were boring as hell. All it was, was a bunch of people walking, three movies of people walking to a fucking volcano." Fucking love Clerks II! That random opening with the store burning down.    Oh, nice! Thank you! Gonna go get myself a copy   What month and year is this from?   Pooping, nothing special. Will resume holiday activities after this brief intermission   The Amazoness, yea haha. The pictures aren't alike in that way but, the way the Korra one looks in terms of style reminds me a bit of that game.   I really like the art style for this, reminds me a lot of Dragon's Crown.  http://images.eurogamer.net/2013/usgamer/DragonsCrownHeroines.jpg   	7
  To call it a terrorist flag is a bit of a stretch.  Not really. The KKK has always been quite fond of it, and remains so along with most other "White Power" groups.      As well they should. It's the flag of traitors and domestic terrorists.      I's say what is "entirely stupid" is running around waving Confederate/KKK flags as if it's something of which to be proud, rather than ashamed.   It will be fun watching these various Republican candidates (who so frequently and proudly dub themselves as members of "the Party of Lincoln") navigate this one.      They were sent to die to protect the interests of the permanent leisure class of their day: the Plantation Owners.  Most of them were poor sharecroppers living on the Plantation Owners' land, and didn't have a choice. They were conscripted to preserve the economic interests of their Masters, who owned these poor whites nearly as completely as they did their African-descended slaves.  The "Southern Pride" meme that has taken root has helped these poor white sharecroppers and their descendants psychologically deal with their exploitation by their own white Masters who used them as cannon fodder to protect their cotton profits.  These poor whites have been angry at precisely the wrong people for over 150 years.   That the United States still has a huge Confederate problem.   Why do so many Americans cling to the flag of sedition, treason, and human bondage?      Being a member of America's Permanent Leisure Class has its perks.   Good. It's the flag of traitors to the United States.   from Rand's offer letter:  "My Dad taught me how to grift from poor, ignorant people. Will you teach me how to grift from rich, ignorant people?"   I'm sure the County Sheriff would have been right on that.   Bluntly, anti-intellectualism is in many American political circles *celebrated as a virtue.*   Rank ignorance used to be seen as something to be ashamed of; now it's often promoted as a badge of honor.   It's quite clear who this anti-intellectual trend is designed to benefit, financially and politically.    de-humanizing people by denying they have any validity as human beings at all  Well, that's what the traitor's flag of the Confederacy stands for, after all.     "Southern Pride" in what?   There's a reason it's called the war of Northern Aggression in the south.  It's because the Confederacy got their asses kicked, and still can't get over it.   They're more likely to shoot themselves. Another problem solved!   Oh, "the North invaded"?  Tell us more, traitor.   A bunch of toothless, illiterate assholes will wave their guns around?   Shut up, traitor.    that flag is affixed to the pole and cannot be lowered.  Then how did it get up there? It can be taken down. Hopefully SC will recognize right and take that traitor's flag down before it's taken down with a flamethrower.    I like the Confederate flag as a symbol of the state's past.  How about as a symbol of sedition and treason against the United States, resulting in the death of 740,000 Americans?      Maybe the federal government should tell South Carolina to "fuck off" when they're sucking on that sweet, sweet federal money tit.  That might get South Carolina's priorities in order.    damn it, it's a cool looking flag.   To whom?     Well, Charleston is "the Cradle of the Confederacy."   Because the Confederate assholes just moved it to a new pole.   It's not *just* a racist flag. It also represents treason against the United States, cowardice, and poor illiterate sharecroppers being forced to lick the boots of the Plantation Owners.   I don't think you understood what I meant by "secret assholes."   The killer had a "Confederate States of America" front license plate on his Hyundai.   Then why require a supermajority to override the seditious display?  It's because the lousy sons-of-traitors know that their treasonous flag would be gone if put to a fair vote.   Confederate-Baggers gotta Bag, I guess.   Can it be reached with a flamethrower?   It seems there are always lots of "secret assholes" running around among the American Right.  Ted Haggard, Larry Craig, and Dennis Hastert are three that come to mind.   Or gets their history from Neo-Confederate revisionists like Ron Paul   Co.  Behold: here's [Ron Paul's *The South Was Right!* speech.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEC68vTQwP8)   It wasn't flown there before 1962, so there goes the "heritage" canard.     The American South should have been de-Confederatized, just as the Germans had to be de-Nazified after their similar fool's errand.  Seriously. Rename the streets, take down the Confederate statues. There's no "honor" or "pride" in being traitors to the United States, especially considering that the Confederates started the bloodiest war in American history to protect slavery and the Plantation Owners' Leisure Class.   Good. It's the flag of cowards, traitors, slavers, and dirt-poor sharecroppers sent to die for the Plantation Owners' "Lost Cause."  How strange and ironic that so many of the descendants of those very same poor sharecroppers who were sent to die (purely to preserve the Plantation Owners' fortunes) still today wave the Stars-and-Bars as sign of "Honor" and "Pride" rather than of their great-great grandfathers' forced military servitude to the Masters of the Old South.   Absolutely, because it is.   Why give those swine more money?   the murdered minister was a state senator. is that not political enough for you all, or did some reactionary complain?   He read it in the *Ron Paul Newsletters.*    If anyone is willing to find a way to make these cuts, it's going to be Rand Paul.  Good God, the "LIBERTY!" cranks are still every bit as deluded now as they were with Saint Ron.     Can you name a single leftist idea that has worked as promised in reality?  Vaccinations. Or is catching polio and being confined to an iron lung now defined as "LIBERTY!!1!" ?   *This is what Foxtards actually believe*   Absolut Paultard. Should we buy gold, too?   I wonder if Jesse Ventura will beat Johnson for the Libertarian nod?  Or will the Libertarians go to their "deep bench" of candidates, like 2008 candidate Bob Barr? Or 1988 candidate Ron Paul?    Do you seriously believe all of us libertarians are conspiring against the world to raise inequality and enriching 1%? That this is our primary goal? We simply want to screw over the poor?  I believe that middle/lower-caste Libertarians are so goddamned starry-eyed over their greed-driven, bankrupt ideology that they they can't see how they'll be crushed under the wheels of the 0.001% leisure class they live to fellate.  And so we come to the central delusion of Libertarianism: most all Libertarians are so fucking gullible they believe they'll *be* among that 0.001% that calls the shots.  As satisfying as it would be to see all of these "Liberty-Lovers" working on chain gangs at the whim of their newly-installed Masters of Capital, prudence and a love of this nation prevents me from wishing they get a chance to find out how truly, deeply, and disastrously wrong they are.  Beware, Libertarians: *the "poor" you screw will be yourselves.*     And why would anyone want to eliminate all such institutions, leaving only entities that pursue only profit-driven motives?  That's what Libertarians call "LIBERTY!!1!"^TM     A slingshot?   I hope you enjoy your life as a serf constantly licking the Kochs' boots!   "Well, no *true* flat tax..."   You can always tell a Libertarian, Republitarian, or Republican by the way they misuse "bias."    I'm not giving credit to Rand here; from what I've read he surrounds himself with some impressive economists and technocrats.  Like "Austrian Economics" loon Lew Rockwell?     This is a well thought out plan to redistribute wealth from the working class to the capitalists. It's what all libertarians want in the end.  And these gullible middle/lower-caste Libertarians never seem to realize that they'll be the first ones thrown under the bus, even after they've worked so hard to give over our the nation to their honored and revered Feudal Lords of Capital.   There's a holiday novella by Charles Dickens that you really should read. I think you'd identify quite closely with the protagonist.    Why should anyone feel entitled to success? The old saying the world needs ditch diggers rings true.  The hilarious thing is how many Libertarians who think they'll rule the roost "in a *truly* Free Market" will wind up scrubbing toilets to earn enough bread to survive for one more day of toilet-scrubbing.  Libertarians/Republitarians: if we ever get to your fantasized "RandWorld," be sure to wash you hands VERY well before scarfing down the Daily Bread ration your Masters have so graciously afforded you!    As an example who would come out of college in a better position, someone whos parents paid full ride and got wasted 5 nights a week, or someone who worked 40 hours or more and paid for their own school and board while building a resume and work ethic? Id vote for the latter.  Are you including inheritance from Daddy?    People patting themselves on the back because they're so smart and talented.  It's a very frequent delusion among Libertarians/Republitarians.    Just maybe they're smarter than you, more talented than you or they just flat out worked harder than you.  Or maybe "they" screwed their workers by systematically exploiting their labor to reap egregious personal profit, all while dodging societal responsibilities.    And many of them assume they'll be counted among the "haves" after their glorious revolution, or at least their obedient lapdogs, rather than the miserable masses.  That's what's makes it so funny: so many Libertarian clones with the social skills of Adam Lanza fantasizing that they will be hailed as the natural and rightful leaders and commanders of "GaltWorld."  These maladjusted, self-fantasized "Captains of Industry" would be lucky to get jobs shoveling shit for their new "LIBERTY!!!1"^TM Masters.   in the Quicksand   Maybe the right-wing apologists are going with the Santorum strategy and pretending he said "I'm here to kill all the blah people."   The funny thing about the "Obama didn't call Benghazi a terrorist attack!!1!" Fox-AM meme-lie is that the President ***DID*** identify it as an "act of terror" at a press conference in the Rose Garden *the very morning following the attack.*  That's how Romney got his ass handed to him in the debate: he asserted his Fox News meme-lie on a non-Fox controlled medium. Romney got called out on it, and just stood there like a fool with his ass waving in the breeze.  To this day you'll ***still*** find right-wing mouth-breathers who regurgitate the *"But... but... he never called them terrorists!!!1one!"* lie.   [Help help, I'm bein' repressed!](http://25.media.tumblr.com/49c35091e4d9d2716c7d32d7f0328f7a/tumblr_mj88inc4aw1rnzcl1o1_500.gif)   Like an "Oops!" kind of "accident," Rick?   Why do Confederates always resort to such violent imagery?   The flag of cowards, traitors, and slavers "works here"?  I don't think so.   Man I really wish we could give them a second shot at the whole seceding from the union thing.  Even if so, they'd be on their knees in Washington DC begging for re-admission within a decade. It might give them the much-needed dose of humility that they failed to learn the first time around.    It's the flag of cowards, traitors, slavers, and sharecroppers sent to die for the Plantation Owners' "Lost Cause."  How strange and ironic that so many of the descendants of those very same poor sharecroppers who were sent to die to preserve the Plantation Owners' fortunes today wave the Stars-and-Bars as sign of "Honor" and "Pride" rather than of their great-great grandfathers' forced military servitude to the Masters of the Old South.    And he's absolutely right.  Let's start calling the perpetrators of such violence what they really are: domestic terrorists.      The NRA and its affiliates are now not so much "gun rights" organizations as they are "domestic terrorist" organizations.  Any American with a sense of honor or decency resigned from the NRA a long time ago. If you're still allowing yourself to be a victim of LaPierre and his fellow scamsters, though, it's never too late to repent and resign. Do it today.   And the American Right just keeps on trying to make excuses for another of the products of their own propaganda...   Rick Perry doesn't just drink the Tea  he gargles it first.    There's a good chance that this person is both a racist and a Republican.  I say (in sorrow) that the line dividing the two grows more faint daily.   Because the Republican base is full of Dylan Roof's kind, and the Republicans are sure as hell not going to call out their own supporters.   Keep on apologizing for right-wing domestic terrorists. You'll go far in life, no doubt.   How about Ted Nugent (also an NRA Board Member) who has repeatedly threatened the life of the President and repeatedly called him a "subhuman mongrel"?  You lie down with dogs, you get fleas.  I (along with most other Americans) am sick of right-wing dimwits, domestic terrorists, and their apologists being cut a free pass because of the widespread "they's a-comin' to git mah gunnzzzzz!!1!" delusion.   Given all the race-baiting horseshit that Fox and AM radio broadcast daily, quite probably.    Who brainwashed this kid and turned him into this monster?  Traitorous Neo-Confederates who still can't get over their ass-whooping, even 150 years later.     The Minister killed was a SC State Senator, for one.  Also, read what the killer shouted while he was perpetrating the crimes. But somehow I think you won't, or will find some way to explain it away if you do.    Please give me an example of when a sane person committed a mass murder.  Timothy McVeigh.     Don't forget his "Confederate States of America" front license plate.   the extreme left who at every chance rambles incoherently about banning guns  Oh, please. There is no left in America, let alone an "extreme left," and no one want to "ban yer gunzz."  This sham idea is a product of NRA mass mailings designed to separate the gullible and paranoid from their money. It's a shame it continues to work so well for LaPierre and Co.     If there are any honorable members of the NRA left, this is your cue to resign from that fetid organization.     Usually you'll save more lives by engaging the shooter anyway.  Oh look! It's the "I'MMA HERO PATRIOT!!1!" delusional murder-masturbation-fantasy again.     The White Wing of the Right Wing in America is growing ever more dangerous and violent.  Their domestic terrorism must end.   Does Jeb Bush feel the same way about Evangelical Protestants?   The Gunbertarian Downvote Militia has arrived. Surprised it took them this long.   Why would you want to return to the Age of Confederate Traitors?   We can't ignore the of White Wing of the Right Wing anymore.  Domestic terrorists.     Why did Ben Carson retire as a brain surgeon?   We can't afford to ignore the White Wing of the Right Wing any longer.   If you're an NRA member, the only honorable thing to do is resign.  Do it today.      If you're an NRA member, the only honorable thing to do is resign.  Do it today.   Because he is a terrorist.   Right-wing domestic terrorism can't be explained away anymore. We continue to do so at our great peril.   See above.   *A reading from the Newsletters of St. Ron Paul*  Blast 'em?  "If you live in a major city, youve probably already heard about the newest threat to your life and limb, and your family: carjacking.  "It is the hip-hop thing to do among the urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos. The youth simply walk up to a car they like, pull a gun, tell the family to get out, steal their jewelry and wallets, and take the car to wreck. Such actions have ballooned in the recent months.  "In the old days, average people could avoid such youth by staying out of bad neighborhoods. Empowered by media, police, and political complicity, however, the youth now roam everywhere looking for cars to steal and people to rob.  "What can you do? More and more Americans are carrying a gun in the car. An ex-cop I know advises that if you have to use a gun on a youth, you should leave the scene immediately, disposing of the wiped off gun as soon as possible. Such a gun cannot, of course, be registered to you, but one bought privately (through the classifieds, for example).  "I frankly dont know what to make of such advice, but even in my little town of Lake Jackson, Texas, Ive urged everyone in my family to know how to use a gun in self defense. **For the animals are coming.**"  Bold added. View original at https://i.imgur.com/OqxwBaM.jpg   or /r/progun   Right-wing domestic extremists are the terrorists we need to worry about, especially since so many of them call themselves "Patriots."   2-day-old account, -65 karma.   Your citations are from all of Europe *over a period of ten years.*  That decade-long list looks about the same as any given two-month period in the United States.   Is he kidding?  Paranoia about "gunz and 'bortions" is just about the only reason people vote Republican/Libertarian these days.  This won't play well with his dad Ron's White Nationalist/Neo-Confederate base.   So "wnd.com" is allowed in this subreddit, but "salon.com" suffers under  *de facto* censorship?  Must be all that "liberal bias" we keep hearing about.   The White Wing of the Right Wing is increasingly dangerous to our nation.   Fucking delusional, they are.  I fear that these "Patriot"/tacticool/Militia assholes will soon act out again in a big way, such as Timothy McVeigh did in Oklahoma City.   Maybe Sean Hannity could be waterboarded with Kool-Aid (for the troops, of course.)  How many days has it been now?   That may not be accurate. For all we know he could have riffed off Rick Santorum and announced "I'm here to shoot blah people."   TIL Count Dooku was on drugs.   "and minimum wage."  You have this fantasy that eliminating payroll taxes would suddenly motivate the busboy's boss to give said busboy a 15% raise out of the goodness of his heart.  That's a self-evidently nave scenario, but sadly typical of most Libertarians and the economic Fantasyland which they inhabit.   Nope, sorry. His boss will keep that for himself.   It always intrigues me how Libertarians detest the government, yet blindly and navely trust the Ownership Class that treats them ten times worse.  I guess Libertarians don't mind licking boots as long as they are worn by those they worship as "Job Creators."  This is one of many reasons why no one can or should take Libertarians seriously.   White Nationalists have long fantasized about a "coming Race War."  There's a RWNJ decades-old race-war novel out there ("The Turner Diaries") that many extremists of the American Right view as a blueprint  (Timothy McVeigh among them.)  Ron Paul's racist 1990s newsletters addressed the  "Race War" topic often.  I fear right-wing domestic terrorists and their sympathizers are growing restless again. Given their self-gratifying "Hero Patriot" fantasies in which they "restore America," we should all be aware of the dangers they may pose. We've seen it boil over before, as in Oklahoma City.     Redrum Springa   Surprised it wasn't Doc Martens with red laces.   Clearly it's violent video games   Eleanor Roosevelt comes to mind.   The Kochs have more money than they could ever spend in 10,000 lifetimes of the greatest opulence.  It's control of the entire system they're after, and the power which accompanies it.     what would have been implemented under a McCain administration.  Or a Palin Administration.      these people don't care about it because they can afford to: hire their own police/fire dept, pay medical bills, and protect their assets.  See also the rise of gated communities.     Because "LIBERTY!"^TM dies when they can't fly their private jets, anywhere, anytime, and for any reason (up to and including into things/one another.)     David Koch: "I am the Captain now."   ["IT'S HAPPENING!"](http://i.imgur.com/7drHiqr.gif)   TL;DR:  "I HATES TEH GUB'MINT!!1!"   There's a subreddit for people like you.  /r/libertyworldproblems    doesn't this brand of libertarianism inevitably lead to some form of feudalism?   Absolutely, yes. However, most libertarians delude themselves that they will be among the Lords of this new a Monarchy of Capital.  May they never get their wish, and learn how truly, truly wrong they are.    Please tell us all how, as a busboy who "live[s] off tips and make[s] minimum wage," the Kochs' agenda will benefit you.  It would make a great AMA.   As it is for most Libertarians, the Age of the Robber Barons is the Kochs' fantasy era.   Their father was a founding member of the John Birch Society.   TL;DR: even 150 years later, Ron Paul still can't get over it.    ~~In~~ Ron Paul [is] ~~'s case, his religious beliefs are~~ irrelevant. ~~because he's firmly against government being used to push any religious ideology.~~  FTFY.    [Ron Paul is a Neo-Confederate, to boot.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xEC68vTQwP8)  And don't even get me started on Ron Paul's racist, paranoid newsletters.   May God spare us all that horror.  Libertarians are largely paranoid goldbugs who think Reaganomics was weak sauce.   The Wal-Marts of today are the FEMA camps of tomorrow!  Think how many helicopters can fit in the parking lot, or on the roof.  *IT'S HAPPENING*   Texans must feel very conflicted on this.   COLBY, *NOOOOOO!*   I hope it's Eleanor Roosevelt.   They really are pigs. I don't know how any woman (or any man in his right mind) can vote for them.  The Party of Forced Birth  then complete neglect.   [David Koch even minted a gold coin of himself to commemorate his 1980 run on the Libertarian Party's ticket.](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/david-kochs-got-dime-you)  See the images here.

It is ***astounding*** that the story of this [Koch coin](http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/david-kochs-got-dime-you) hasn't received more attention.    What do the Koch Brothers want?

 "Ruining cinema" is never valid.   Apart from Jurassic World (and maybe Pacific Rim), you'll appreciate all of the films you just listed a lot more by paying attention as they're all quite rewarding, well thought out and one or are open to complex analysis (The Raid 2, Mad Max).   You're overanalysing. No, I'm not, I'm just explaining to you why I don't like this movie.    * High Noon * The Good, The Bad and the Ugly * The Outlaw Josey Wales * Unforgiven * True Grit (remake) * Django Unchained  I like revisionist Westerns. What can I say? I also like posts in chronological order.   East of West   For me CinemaSins is different because they shit all over movies they really like and I find that better IMO.   Which guide are you using?   The real losers were the readers.   Spider-Woman, She-Hulk, White Tiger, Moondragon, Quasar, Mantis, Hawkeye and The Runaways are my picks.   Die Hard.   Cheesy is really stylised dialogue. Bad dialogue is a pretty major compliant as it can ruin immersion and characterisation and sometimes it's not enjoyable to watch. If you're watching an 80s action movie and complaining about one-liners being bad dialogue, then that's not a legitimate complaint as it's a stylistic choice.   It's annoying because films are an audio/visual medium. Style is substance.   It's as valid as saying Spielberg or Marvel are ruining cinema.   Storywise, I think there are more interesting interpretations, but in storytelling method (visuals in the instance) there is none better.   They're funny when you agree with them. If you don't it feels like their either shitting all over a film or unjustly praising it.    Dimestore philosophy.  A) this is normally applied to blockbusters so give thwm the benefit of the doubt B) the philosophy shouldn't be judged on its complexity, rather how well in keeping with the themes of the film it was C) there are always going to be people who find it interesting if you don't. Maybe it'll inspire them to look into some of the deeper stuff.   His son is Spider-Man + edge.   Why?   The aim of the deck is to gift the enemy as much health as possible and use Hope for Escape to draw as many cards as possible in the hopes of drawing Exodia. I'd appreciate   Monsters [18]  * Battle Fader x2 - Protection * Emissary of the Afterlife x3 - Search for Pieces of the Forbidden One * Exodia the Forbidden Life x1 - Win condition * Kuribon x3 - Increase opponent health * Kuriphoton x2 - Protection and health decrease for Hope for Escape * Left Arm of the Forbidden One x1 - Win condition * Left Leg of the Forbidden One x1 - Win condition * Mask of Darkness x2 - Return Hope for Escape, Gift Card or Dark Cure * Right Arm of the Forbidden One x1 - Win condition * Right Leg of the Forbidden One x1 - Win condition * Swift Scarecrow - Protection  Spells [8]  * Different Dimension Capsule x2 - Search for Hope for Escape, Gift Card or Dark Cure * Mystical Space Typhoon - Counter to Royal Decree * One Day of Peace - Protection and drawing * Pot of Duality - Drawing * Upstart Goblin x3 - Opponent health increase and drawing  Trap [14]  * Call of the Haunted - Special Summon Kuribon to have two of them * Dark Cure x2 - Opponent health increase * Defense Draw - Protection and drawing * Gift Card x3 - Opponent health increase * Hope for Escape x3 - Drawing Forbidden One cards * Reckless Greed - Drawing * Solemn Warning - Decreasing my health and easily removes monsters * Wall of Revealing Light - Protection and can decrease my health so that I can draw more cards with Hope for Escape   I think Bendis is just speaking from the experiences of his multiracial children, but isn't aware it doesn't matter too much to everybody. To me, it makes a big difference - I always notice when a film is all white people and it takes me out of it.   The Dark Knight Returns   It builds to the action really well. Like it takes forever to get to, but when you get there, it feels more than worth it.   95% artistic control. If a writer/artist wants to do something really stupid their editors will try and stop them and also the editors advise quite a bit.   Probably because a large chunk of DC heroes are actual Gods.   Resurrection. :'(   Oh absolutely. Video games are much more *capable* then movies, yet aside from blockbuster games, most games lack a decent storyteller on board and don't utilise the medium full potential.   Honestly, movies are the third most capable medium after video games and comic books.      With early Spielberg films, they're completely dependent on whether or not you accept that sense of awe. If you don't feel that, you're not going to enjoy the movie. Yhat's how I feel about Jaws and Jurassic Park.   Thank God, there are two of us. I thought I was alone in this sea of downvotes, but now I've found a companion. Gee, how shitty are the Lord of the Rings films?   I don't like Lord of the Rings. I actually think they're abysmal.    Yet most video games fail to use the medium to its strengths to tell stories.   Batgirl: Year One? Batman is only in about 20% of it, but their shared screentime is a highlight. I've enjoyed all of Batgirl's fleeting appearances in Tomasi and Gleason's Batman and Robin. Volume 4 and 6 mainly.   It implies Wolverine tried to have sex with her, but he didn't because MJ said no. The guy is an absolute scumbag and probably a rapist (seeing as he was created by Mark Millar), but he didn't rape MJ.   No Black Widow?   [Here's some good Batman](https://www.reddit.com/r/DCcomics/comments/39sz97/i_just_spent_the_past_few_months_reading_a_lot_of/cs6fbwk)   I'm not to fond of her wearing the Jewel outfit. Almost all fansites have pictures of Her in that outfit and I think it's a complete misrepresentation of her character.   I don't recall Daryl saying anything racist. I thought people just assumed because his brother did.   Season Seven was decent.   Isn't there an animated film?   Maybe he thought it was less controversial then telling the truth - he isn't a fan of Chris Pratt.   Made by someone who understood the novel.   That completely makes sense. Characters change over time. None of the Friends were as two-dimensional as they were in Season 1 in Season 6. But, take the Simpsons, the characters slowly improved over the first decade or so, but then they devolved into stupid charictures of themselves and worst of all, it wasn't as entertaining.   That's how I feel about Community, except by Season 6 and it has retained the same writers. Yes, these characters are expected to grow and change, but I think the way they've grown is pure shit.   And I don't like Lord of the Rings. [There isn't a place for us here.](https://38.media.tumblr.com/548808390d76dd057811cc2d9f3f8942/tumblr_nc6y8lJXWF1tkl30lo8_500.gif)   This may be the worst place to discuss this, but I'm watching Season 6 and it's really pissing me off. At the start Britta seemed kind of clever and likable, but slowly devolves into a dumb, pot-smoking, hippie. Then she switches back and forth every other episode. Abed used to be the cute kid with Asperger's, but by Season 3, he is just a vehicle for meta-jokes and an excuse to cannibalise other shows. Pierce started off really funny, but by the end his racism was no longer endearing and just cringe-worth (probably collateral damage from Season 4 though). Chang is just an excuse for a few one-liners here and there. Frankie-as-Yahoo was interesting for one mediocre episode, but it left her very bland later on in the season. More often then not, the show is too Jeff-centric to give the other characters anything meaningful to do in the A-Plot and I'm still not sure where I stand on his daddy-issues, narcissism, Jeff's need for his friends and his leadership skills. All of those things seem contradictory to me.  What's worse is Harmon seems to be aware of all of this and not give a damn. His self-aware brand of humour is consistently pointing out his awareness for these things and he doesn't do a damn thing to change it. It's worse when Harmon is just using characters as mouthpieces for things he doesn't like (Avengers, The Sting, Big Budget movies). It isn't subtle and the characters all suffer for it. I find the fact he only every does this to critise stuff really disheartening as well. Personally, I think it's kind of nihilistic how he never praises films through this. Sure, occasionally you'll get a Die Hard homage or what-have-you, but it feels more like a passing reference and more of a directorial decision.  The AV Club's review of Advanced Safety Features inadvertently highlights why this is such a problem for me. I certainly wouldnt call Features one of the best episodes of Community, but its the first one of the season to completely reveal the shows core of sadness and sentimentality. Without that core, Community would be an alienating, smarter-than-thou, up-its-own-ass single-camera sitcom, and the world needs another one of those like it needs another Madea movie.   For me, this sentiment all is sourced from the characters, but I feel the show is lacking it because it's characters suck and as a result it is an alienating, smarter-than-thou, up-its-own-ass single-camera sitcom.  So, anyone up for Madea? Madea? Madea? Madea?   I have a few puppets in my garage. Want me to put on a show?   Super.   Fast and Furious and Mission Impossible. They're both big, tense action movies where the characters do physics defying stunts and banter among themselves. I feel Mission Impossible would also focus on highlighting the tight friendship of the group like The Fast and The Furious demonstrates. You could probably throw in The Avengers as well.    Funny you say that as all of the comics he's written have been pretty shitty.   What matters is that it was a good real.   Comics are an art form. Art - not all, but some - should be able to contribute to discussion and provoke thoughts.   Marvel Unlimited. It's cheap, accessible and has such a wide range.   Is Pak's run good? I wanna pick it up.   The writing still has a little ways to go. I wish they would stop spelling everything out for us. Once they start doing that, it'll be a prestige drama.  My favourite example. They open the boot of a car to find a walker with her legs and arms bound together. Maggie looks into the boot and begins contemplating what it means in silence. Carol comes over and says "She was trapped..."  That's fine and is still kind of subtle, but Carol's next line kills me. "Like us."  However there is a lot of ambiguous symbolism in the show nowadays, certain in the episodes directed by Greg Nictero (easily the show's best director).  I think Daredevil will be prestige television come next season as the worst episodes were written by Steven DeKnight - which was a shame as I really like the man - and now he's left the show should improve. DeKnight did the same thing as The Walking Dead writers where he'd explain the hidden meanings behind everything and it bugged me. Also he directed the last episode which had some of the worst action in the series. It turned really superhero-y with a dependence on cinematic music and larger than life fight moves. It wasn't interesting to watch and wasn't helped by all of the jump cuts. Now that he's out of the picture, Daredevil will certainly be prestige drama.  I don't now whether many people like Agents of Shield on this sub, but I feel that having 22 episodes helped the plotting quite a bit. They divided the series into three distinct chunks - Search for the City, Skye Dealing with Power/Real Shield and the Inhumans - this meant there was room for some pretty complex plot webs and character work. People who were previously kinda boring became interesting thanks to having episodes dedicated to expanding on their character (looking at you Ward). The cast is also too big to deal with the 15-odd characters in 13 episodes. Coulson, Fitz-Simmons, Skye, Ward, Mack, Hunter, Mockingbird and May all got pretty decent arcs in Season Two and most of them would've been forgotten about if there was a 13 episode season.  Managing to tell three stories actually makes it similar to three four-issue comic book arcs which I guess is quite faithful to modern comics where everything is quite decompressed and it takes a while for things to pay off. This is kind of the opposite of the Flash which had a Silver-Age meets Claremont plotting; one wacky conflict every week with some soapy elements and foreshadowing future episodes. Agents of Shield tried this in Season One and it didn't really work, but come Season Two's more serialised plotting, it was a vastly improved show (helped that they got some decent directors and fight choreographers too). Also, [the dialogue is superb and constantly funny](http://imgur.com/a/VhB00). The last episode provided my [new favourite line in the MCU.](http://i.imgur.com/H6wz2Qq.gif)  Because of all of this really interesting character work and really complex plotting, I could make the case that would be prestige television with a few revisions. Namely the direction and the action. The directors need to get the actors to do more physically. They spend too much of the episode standing still with their arms crossed. They really need to be more active to present a similar energy to the rest of the MCU. The colouring is far too bland and reminds me too much of a crappy 90s Batman. I'd love to see much more colour on the show. Light blues and greens would really work in my opinion. Lastly, the action needs a lot of work. The slow-mo in the finale was timed dreadfully and had no weight to it. There are a few really great action moments - [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hReYNlIoIWE) and Face My Enemy come to mind, but often it's not really clear what's going on or Clark Gregg feels too much like a middle-aged guy playing pretend. I'd love to actually see Coulson get tired after a fight or get really out of breath. If this can be achieved, I think it'll be in the same league.   http://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/39vj3m/comics_to_read_before_upcoming_marvel_movies/cs6wbec   Personally, I'd recommend getting [Marvel Unlimited](https://marvel.com/comics/unlimited/home? options%5Boffset%5D=0 totalcount=12) to read it all digitally as it's cheaper and more easily accessible, but if you don't have a device for it or have an aversion to reading digitally, I've added Amazon links.

Would you mind if I gave you some Daredevil recommendations?   True and I did love Daredevil. I hope it goes into more of the crazy shit from the comics later. I need Typhoid Mary, Bullseye, Elektra, Stone, White Tiger and the Out storyline all to happen eventually.   I'd love for Balder and Bill to show up out of nowhere and everyone act like they've been there the whole time.   Free Bird. Right guys?   It's important to pay respects to both Greek and Roman interpretations equa- no, this is bullshit. I misspelt it.   Iron Lad? As in the guy from the 30th century who discovers he'll become a supervillain and kill his friends if he returns, but the world will be destroyed anyway if he doesn't? That *lame* Iron Lad?   Ehh. He's not my tempo.   Wait. It's not OK to own black people or castrate gays? Well shit...  Edit: Is it still OK to jail gay people if they've committed a crime? Need to know ASAP.   So something like 24: Live Another Day is comparable to another episode of the original series? I think there is a notable enough difference there.   Isn't the X-Files a sequel show whereas AD is the same show continued?   But the Marvel universe contains men in robot suits on roller skates, a 95 y/o super soldier and mother fucking Heracules.   Isn't AD just between seasons?   I don't think so. It's still got the highest rating on IMDb and - despite this being a relatively finite number of people - most people I've talked to agree it's the best.   The Sandman is pretty much responsible for comics being a medium I can get behind. Vertigo and modern Image can all be traced back to his work.   I've read Gotham Central if that helps.    The we'd lose Kate Mara who is a very entertaining actress.    Did anyone else really enjoy his Deadpool?   Surprised this hadn't already been mentioned. For me it's the Ultimate Fallout issue with Peter's funeral.   When I hear beautiful movie, I immediately think about movies with great visuals and I love the animated movie 5 Centimetres Per Second. A great series of coming of age stories.   They hired Michael B Jordan to play Johnny Storm because that's the actor Josh Trank wanted for the part. They haven't been exploitive in their marketing IMO. Frankly, MBJ is an excellent choice and will really blow people away if they could see past his race.   I mean... Shit... We just got Morgan back.   Shit. They're introducing Heath from the comics next season. We just fucking got Morgan back.   Someone should recheck Arrested Development.   Saga.   I love this story, but I still don't really et what's sad about it.   Don't take away my hope for Vin Diesel ad Black Bolt.   Bradley Cooper.   Not even The Hoff?   I've read it and love it, but nothing there is particularly heart-wrenching. What do you think is?   Rucka returning to the Big 2? Star Wars truly is miraculous.   Like ten. They have a small department for it.      Too old.   I'm curious what your friends' problem with Brienne was.       When you write a film, do you have a paticular voice actor in mind?   Mike Carey's masterpiece turned into a crime procedural...   Hannibal - the main character is reinterpreted as such.    It's not a great book (The Walking Dead that is), but it's fun, great for beginners and has pretty good female characters.   [If you're into Marvel movies, I recently posted a recommendation for someone else about all the upcoming MCU characters.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Marvel/comments/39vj3m/comics_to_read_before_upcoming_marvel_movies/cs6wbec)   I'd include Sex Criminals and (maybe) The Walking Dead.   I agree, that twist was handled so poorly, but I think that most of those flaws would have been overlooked had it been made in the 80s - on reflection - like I do for most of Spielberg's work.   Sugar   High Noon   No, but it averages at 7s-8s out of ten, and I feel if it was made 20 years prior, it'd be considered a classic.   Pierce Brosnan as Old Man Cyclops. I just want to hear Brosnan's beautiful singing voice again.   That's because his character was identical to his usual big-screen persona.   I don't know how much of a difference it makes, but it is a very CGI heavy film.   I don't know how much of a difference it makes, but it is a very CGI heavy film.   Now try John Bishop's.   Do you have a schematic or a world save? I'd love to check it out.   It's high on my list of comics to buy and from what I've seen, it looks very good.   There's worse, but the question was worst/uninteresting and I just find them very uninteresting as a big fan of both characters.   Captain America: The First Avenger and Super 8. I'm not sure how much more of an impact they'd have, but I think they'd be better received. They are the most Spielbergian films I've seen not directed by him or Robert Zemeckis.   Also, if the Avengers had been released 3 decades ago, we would have had a myriad of shared universes in the 90s and they probably would have been done so poorly that the concept would have died off in the 00s.   If you're into comics, you might want to check [this](http://www.imgur.com/gallery/0cC6o) out.   I'm not sure whether we can consider a setting a clich. I love Westerns, but I wouldn't call the American Frontier a clich I love.   Other than the fact it is dreadful, it misrepresents almost every character involved. Because of its dreadful characterisation, it will give a really poor representation of characters in the MCU.   I don't think people become psychopaths.   I know it's really immature, but Rider's name cracks me up every time I read it.   Exactly, it's so stupidly inaccurate I can't believe that quite a few critics stated it.  	116

THE END FACES FORWARD, MARTA   [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/3bckcf/at_a_church_on_se_92nd_when_i_inquired_i_was_told/)         This right here is why I fucking love this site.   ellipseseses*   DOOT DOOT      "Those who say a thing can't be done are quite apt to be interrupted by some idiot doing it."   You were dead serious about that corgi puppy eh?   I actually posted a while in the Bernie Sanders sub asking why more Americans don't just fund candidates online like kickstarter campaigns. Got downvoted to hell and told a million different ways it wouldn't work.  And now I see that's exactly what's gone and been done.  I like Bernie, but some of his supporters are goddamn morons.    Some people have life goals, I just want a god damned puppy.  Well I just found the quote that's going on my tombstone.    Sorry I couldn't provide more detail. I have a book by the photographer who tells that story, just cant be bothered to go find the proper quote.   What IS the goal? Or are you one of those "it's not the destination, it's the adventure" guys...   Is your goal to get the most karma on reddit or something?   You forgot to mention that they're all on fire   The Station fire shook me to my core. It's so hard not to imagine yourself being in that position...   WOW that's dumb. I've been using corn starch to "breath fire" since I was 12. How do people not know that it's flammable as fuck????   From what I can tell this is basically just rugby, soccer, and MMA all rolled into one.  Booking my trip NOW   See the guy between Ali's legs? He was Sports Illustrated's top photographer at the time. The man who took this picture was new on the job, and would have been in the same spot, which was considered the best angle. He was told to go find his own spot on the ring. He did, and he got this picture.   No, it was totally because of his weight. Sleep apnea I think?   Not sure if there's a word for it, but my family does this all the time. My mom has started telling some of my stories like she was actually there.   Not in the slightest. There are far more extreme wings of the conservative party. That's not bias, that's a simple observation.    Compare it to the NYT, America's paper of record and a proven government mouthpiece... At least their bias is obvious.   Deadly groove: check.  Soulful white guy: check.  Hand spasms: check.  Joe Cocker 2 confirmed.    Except their morons are conservative morons, which are just like liberal morons but with an added dash of insanity.    I'm well aware of what they do and how they do it. I've been a journalist for ten years and have worked with them and CNN affiliates. My point is that their "news" is no different to other tv news channels in America. They're all inherently biased because they are all privately owned.    Exactly what I was thinking. What I hate about racing sims is not being able to quickly glance around. Oculus would do that perfectly    Did... did you ask him to read you a bedtime story? Because I would've asked for a bedtime story.   That's precisely what I mean.   Which is why I said they're no different to any other TV news station in America. MSNBC and CNN are just as guilty of that as Fox is.   Al Jazeera is one of the most respected news organizations in the world   That's exactly what I was saying. They give airtime to morons. Their actual reporters are sound.   Every time this comes up I defend Fox News and get downvoted to oblivion. It's their TALKING HEADS that are fucking retarded. Their news coverage is no different from any other TV news station in America.   TBH he probably stole it from another writer (I want to say Stephen King?) who used it as an example on how to create interesting short stories. The only difference to the short story example and the Purge is that in the short story idea, people were allowed to commit any crime as long as they compensated those who they committed the crime against.   Real life Cooper reporting in. My mom's friends called me Cooper Cooper, because her maiden name was Cooper, which then became my middle name.   I had a character with the exact same name in one of my AP English short stories. C'mon Nolan.   I think it might just come down to driver preference.    *oooooooo - eeeeeeeeeeeee  - hehehehehehehehe - oooo^O^^O^^^O^^^^oooooooooooooooooooo*   I literally just slapped my knee.   Doot doot   what's this from?   Went to school with his nephew actually. He got HEATED whenever you brought that video up hahaha   I work with one other full time employee publishing a magazine I can barely get out four times a year, and running a website. So not exactly six figures, although our office IS air conditioned. We run sponsored stories on that website because our audience demands they have free access to our content and advertisers have gotten wise to the fact that slapping a banner ad on a website isn't good business. And yet we get criticized for "duping" the customer.  I certainly don't like Bungie's model either, but I'm not going to criticize it just because they're making money in different ways to their competitors. If the market is willing to purchase those kinds of games, more power to Bungie. Consumers are morons. But I won't be buying it. Nor will you. Hopefully that sentiment is shared across the market and we can disincentivise game dev's from this brand of business. And if it all goes tits up, you can sit calmly on your high horse and say "I told you so."    The best product on the lowest possible budget. This is basic business.  You're not including deadlines, which play probably the most critical role. An indie dev team with a small budget and no deadline can spend as long as they want on a game. But if something goes wrong for a team working on a deadline, you have to sink more money into fixing that problem in order to meet the mark, putting you over budget.   ...the rest of the industry has been able to finance their games without selling missions bundled with soft drinks, Bungie should be no exception.  Sounds pretty communist to me. A company finding an alternate source of revenue untapped by their competitors is unfair????  The bottom line of Bungie is not at hand here, the budget allocated to the game is. You don't know what that budget was, nor whether they were able to deliver the product within that given budget. If shit hit the fan, as I mentioned above, that could force the budget to skyrocket in order for them to meet their deadline. Bungie creates value for itself by creating video games, but they can't do that at a loss.   This is not advertising.  You're definition of advertising is incredibly narrow. Perhaps the best word is "marketing". This is Red Bull. The way they go about marketing is radically different to everyone else. Other energy drinks would slap a COD logo on the can, certainly, but that is not and has never been Red Bull's strategy. Instead of slapping their logo on an F1 car, they created an F1 team. Instead of slapping Destiny's logo on their cans, they have exclusive content. It's pretty genius IMO.   That's greedy  Is this communist Russia? This isn't communist Russia, is it?    So because other developers have done really cool stuff with a tiny budget, other developers should do that too? That doesn't make much sense, but ok. And how do you know it's not about funding the game? Can you provide a source for that, or are you just guessing because it looks like they're money grubbing whores?  If it wasn't for advertising, my industry would be dead because the money we make selling our product is JUST enough for us to make a new product every four months. That pain is shared by a LOT of others.   yeah, fuck those guys for finding additional funding for their game   You're a champ   Bada-buh-ba-bah....   Take your filthy upvote and get out   You should try pronouncing Southwark, or Gloucester correctly. The British pronounce things different to Americans, strange as it might seem    I'm sure more clever people than I have already figured this out. But it was satisfying as hell when I put two and two together.    Inb4 people get their knickers in a twist. I have nothing against karmawhoring, reposting, x-posting, etc. Just thought I should say...         Have you sought counseling? My ex was a rape victim and had the opposite reaction to you, she felt disgusting during sex, like she was debasing herself. We went to therapy together and that helped her discuss and synthesize her feelings, which lead to a much more fulfilling sex life. More than anything the therapy just allowed her to talk about what she was feeling, and hear herself saying it, rather than bottling it all up in her head.    Thank you for your service    The small sail at the front of a sailboat    Best one yet.   It is. You can judge age pretty well by the dorsal and this one is very small    Still got dick  I like the cut of your jib   Come on down to Bermuda. Our wood is fantastic   I've tried this at least a dozen times. Never worked. You're like an anal loving unicorn...    So... how much damage was there?   Recently learned my ex first slept with me because I had the balls to tell her I didn't think child support should be mandatory. The thing is, I don't even really believe that. Neither does she. I think I just said it to be cool and contradictory, and it totally worked.      Jolly good, old horse.  ***blows***  I say! This could knock out a caribou! CARIBOUUUUUU. Lovely woody word, wouldn't you say old beast?   So, is the headline being intentionally dumb by calling rioters "peaceful protesters"? Literally the first line of the story calls them violent protesters. Aka rioters.   Youuuuu lucky ducks you   Come visit Bermuda. Luscious man-calf abound!   One of my best friends is Christian. I can never argue about the negatives of religion with him because he's grown up in a house that embodies every positive aspect. His mother is a goddamn saint. Church every Sunday, constant community outreach, food drives etc. Grew up with him and his mom my entire life and she's never once mentioned God besides when they have grace at dinner.   Point being, for many, religion is just a vessel in which valuable, noble traits can be delivered and instilled. If living a life like my friend's mom has lived is done in order to get into heaven, why worry?   Wow this sub is such a circle jerk.   I think Zouma is a captain in waiting. He's been referred to as France's future captain, so I see no reason why he can't eventually be ours. I fucking love the kid.  On another note, I'll be sad to see Mikel go but he could really lock down another team's midfield, and his talents are wasted on the bench. If Schneiderlin leaves Soton, I think he'd make for a great replacement. Obviously not in terms of playmaking, but I've always rated him for his ability to shut down a midfield. He's a beast, and I'd love to see him do well on another team with regular starts.   It goes to show you how fickle Hollywood can be though. Here's a girl that has been stunning in every film she's been in since Leon, and yet three shitty but high grossing films nearly derailed her career.   Yeah, I misremembered the article I read. It was Cold Mountain that gave her career new life. Linked to the article in my original comment.      The films nearly ruined Portman's career, lest we forget. She had faded into obscurity until ~~Black Swan~~ Cold Mountain, and the only reason she got that role was through a lot of connections going to bat for her. Everyone in Hollywood had written her off directly because of Star Wars.  EDIT: Cold Mountain, not Black Swan.

'Hahaha', he giggled."   No, that's correct. I was 16 when I first started smoking. *High* school.   Being a journalist is basically just having good Google-fu and knowing how proper sentence structure works... and interviews... and the stomach to transcribe hour long interviews. But mostly Google-fu.   DING DING ^^^shame   Let's play Spot The Reason OP Is An Idiot!  Fuck my life.      You'd have to be a pretty shitty seamstress not to account for movement...    As a journalist, this interviewer is fucking slobbering all over Pao and it's making me sick. Don't hide your bias or anything...   You have to agree to share, first off. I live in Bermuda and have a dock. There's a couple that lives on a houseboat in the bay and they use it without permission all the time. I was actually on it flying my friend's drone around and they just walked past me and loaded up their dinghy like it was nothing. I told them it was a private dock, and that they could use it this one time. They've since teared the ass out of it and are using it all the time, disrupting the guests that pay $600 per night for our vacation rental cottage. I've spoken to them at least a dozen times about it and yet they continue to use it, leaving bags of doritos, beer bottles, etc floating in the mangroves by my slip. I've since called the police, had them charged for mooring without a license and trespassing.  In other words, don't use people's shit without their permission. And if you give a moose a muffin, he'll ask you for some milk. Far better to lay down the law and not let people use your shit.   This could pretty much apply to everything I do in life.   Bro. I'm so fucking altitudinous right now.   I KNEW THAT! One of the few things I remember from science class. No idea why the name Bernoulli stuck, but it did.   I... I dont remember installing the cloud to butt extension...   I think Dos Equis has its new spokesman.    *midly   My thoughts exactly  	105
    "If I did not love America, I would not have moved here from Kenya." Classic!         We will see if he can stay healthy for once and live up to the hype.    An incredible 99% of all Americans agree: ice cream tastes great.   Don't forget your sunglasses.   Is there anyone left in the Padres farm system?   Must be Spring Training for singers too.   Andreas would mop the floor with that guy. The only thing Preston Byrne cares about is a ledger system of some sort. The rest of crypto, he is glad to write about, but his articles show that he understands it quite poorly or even erroneously. Every time he opens his mouth or publishes something, he pretty much self-identifies himself as a first class moron.   Princess Leia, please defrost me!   Not sure I want these clowns devoting their full attention.   This is great to see.   There's no free lunch. These must slow down the water flow somewhat. If there's no issue with low water pressure or with using more energy to pump the water, then this sounds great.    I sure hope he introduced himself to that kid afterwards. Total moron if he didn't make that kid's day.    There's always one oddball position on every team: the kicker, the goalie, etc. I thought it was the catcher in baseball, but centerman may take the cake!   Some of them come to the US after a successful (half or part) career in Japan or Korea, so by the time they get here, they're older than your average rookie. Maintaining that quality at such a high level is tough for more than a few years for any pitcher. And in general, the quality of those Asian leagues is still AA or AAA at best, so there still aren't many who rise to major league quality level. There are some that have lasted a while, such as Hideo Nomo or Chan Ho Park.   Take advantage of early voting. Don't leave it all until one day.       Or if somebody's mired in a deep slump and he really needs the guy behind him to get a shot.    Does it come with sparkly Rainbow Brite icons?   They just fixed the issue. Should go back up soon, unless market forces hold it low. Lots of positive news on the way.    Ah, that explains a lot actually.    He'd better not use "Rafael" on the ballots. GOP primary voters will think he swam the Rio Grande.    That's pretty funny.   It doesn't seem to matter. Cruz had an American parent. McCain was born in the Panama Canal Zone and that didn't really become a big issue. Now if either one had been born in Mexico, they'd be labelled an illegal, but Canada? That's white enough for anyone in the GOP.   The only question in my mind: Is Ted Cruz's candidacy worse for Democrats or for Republicans? Probably the latter, since he's going to make some ugly headlines and say some nasty things at debates that characterize the extreme wing. Then again, it makes the moderates look like saints if they manage not to be tarred with his brush.    Yes, I've seen your posts before. I like Peercoin also. Not all members there are wild about NuBots, though it has some fans.   I agree with xeroc. And do your own research. If you're relying on forum posters to win you over with the best argument, that's an inferior way to inform yourself about important subjects. My answer: one relies on big wigs and bots; the other uses the free market to hold its peg in a decentralized exchange. To be fair, both are useful innovations.   Trolls, there's hope for you yet.    I actually agree. But one could make the argument that having him involved at Reds camps and throwing out the first pitch at a game, etc., would be less serious than giving him HOF consideration.    You are correct. Or theoretically, they could do the opposite: Keep the hall rule but let him back in the "game". I'm in favor of leaving the hall part up to voters, though, because those voters have shown discretion about the steroid-era candidates already. No chance Pete gets in now.    Is that the Fouke Monster?   Griffey must have been driven pretty hard. He was a 'can't miss' prospect from the time he was a kid; that's a lot of expectation for a young person. As warranted as the hype was in his case, it's never fair to do this to young people.    We're all holding our breath still on Bter. THe good news is that they've enabled some withdrawals and they're doing things they probably wouldn't have to be doing if they were simply closing and running away with everyone's money. But no telling what this has cost them and what impact that will have. Hopefully, the snapshots are honored, even if they have to include a bit of a discount.    Hold on; I've got a guy on the other line asking about some whitewalls.    Point well taken. But at least it means no official oil and gas exploration.    Wonderful news!   Satoshi discussed it with Dan Larimer, who later founded BitShares. This is one of their conversations.  https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=532.msg6269#msg6269   Hate to say it, but you just described BitShares pretty well. I'm a big fan of Bitcoin; Satoshi himself admitted it wasn't designed to be used for instant transactions, etc. If you use Bitcoin in combination with BitUSD through the BitShares decentralized exchange, as Roger Ver indicated in a recent video, you can have scalability, instant transactions, zero volatility, and keep your Bitcoin.    Desalinate some ocean water. I know it has some ecological impacts, which must be addressed, and that it uses energy, but cost and the energy impact are both a lot less than a pipeline from Canada or towing icebergs.    And perhaps a setting for Conan Doyle's Lost World, which in turn helped inspire Jurassic Park and countless others.   	42
                That is why I prefer to vote for Bernie Sanders over him any day of the week.   Yeah. Right now, we need not to improve relations with Israel until Isreali voters get frustrated with Bibi and run him out of office.  We did not need an Isreali neocon in that country running the show.     This guys needs visit the county jail for putting animals in a cruel living environment.   Whistleblowers are important to call abuses by both parties.  Just because one party is a liberal and agrees with your political views does not mean it has fair share or corruption and graft.    I like Harry Reid, but this is a one comment that I disagree with him on.                         It is sad to see ISIS using child fighters to their dirty work.  Use of child soldiers can be in itself considered to be a war crime.                                                                Reminds me of the music that I danced to at the junior high dance.                                             Somebody has to deal justice to those guys.  They are like the Nazi; absolute scum of humanity.   The answer is why is somebody life worth killing over a $300 dollars pair of headphones.  I guess the real reason is envy and this shows how envy destroys a soul.               Please hope the supreme court dumps these laws.       I hope that they spend the rest of their lives and prison and never get out.                                                                                       Life sentence is better.    No, because I got two drunk drivings in 2012 and lost my job, I cannot go. I will be lucky to have full-time employment by then.   Going to Burning Man again is a dream, but I just do not see it happen.  Plus the progressive in me does not like the change in Burning Man because of the plug and play camps.            It is a mess believe me.      Americans are too strongly individualistic and competitive in nature.  For socialism to work in the US, you need to have a market-based system, but one based on spirit of cooperation and egalitarianism that rewards workers for individual efforts and teamwork efforts.  However, it has to be competive as well because that in the American DNA.   I prefer a market-based capitalistic system.  However, I have a very high distrust of corporations and wealthy because they do not act in the best interest of the country.  Therefore, I prefer the government to heavily regulate industry, have the power to break monopolies, and allow for unions as internal control against management abuse of the worker.  I also believe that workers should have the ability to form their collective businesses and find  a way to share a profit from it.  However, I do not prefer top-down command economy because we have many, many examples  of thosein world-history and most of them result in an authoritarian governments and inequitable distribution of resources. (which include the USSR, Cuba, Venezuela, and other countries)  The proper system is to have a market-based system where the government acts a referee to prevent industrial abuses, massive inequality, and allows workers to control the resources on their own.  However, the government should not have the ability to bail out inefficient firms or pick winners/losers in industry.  It should be a competitive, workers-based market socialism.                                                                                                                                    He was good guy.  Remember listening to him on sports radio for years on ESPN 710 and other networks.                                                                                                                                                      But maybe there will be no history books remaining because humans will go extinct due to climate change.   Edward Snowden leaks about the invasion of privacy.     	194

 Kerry Mullis is all about that PCR   Moved here a few years ago from NH and love it. I've lived three different Portland neighborhoods and honestly the only real drawbacks are: Tax, especially being from NH. Our lovely Governor is bat shit crazy... And just got re elected.  I love the cultural diversity, the food, the sports, the events... Wouldn't want to be anywhere else   Oh I get that. Remember the days of AOL Chat Room play-by-post games? ... what ever happened to those any way?   I've never played on those sites, just looked at some games. What beurocracy is there?   They are a notoriously terrible telecom company that is  consistently in hot water for shady business practices and horrendous customer interactions... And they have a monopoly in several areas of the US (like my city)      Would I be able to consolidate having several different servicers? Is it possible to consolidate the loan that's in my parents name?  Good luck with the pay as you earn! I did Income based for a couple of years until I finally landed a decent FT job in my field and it was a huge help.    Luckily no. My buddy was moving and I've always driven his truck in the past. Made him drive it this time and taught him how - How sick he got (nerves) made me wonder what would happen if he did hit something.   Hi PF (Insert obligatory "Long time lurker/first time poster comment here).  I have been paying back student loans for a while and I got to thinking that I must be doing something inefficiently. They are as follows:  Loans I've been paying: Vermont Student Assistance Corp - Subsidised Stafford at 6.8% with a $2,133 balance down from $3,500 Sallie Mae private at 9.25% with a $2,868 balance down from $3,500 Sallie Mae private at 8.75% with a $983 balance down from $2,000  Loans just entering repayment: NelNet - Subsidised at 5.6% with a balance of $3,500 NelNet - Subsidised at 4.5$ with a balance of $4,500 NelNet - Subsidised at 3.4% with a balance of $11,000 NelNet - Unsibsidised at 6.8% with a balance of $25,500  Granite State Management and Resources - Parent Plus loan - Some where in the $10,000 range down from $20,000 (Monthly payment of $217; I've been paying this one for a few years)   My income: $50,000 a year or $1,156 bi-weekly after tax, deductions, and savings (10% auto transferred into savings account each check). My (Non-loan) expenses are about $1,100 a month including rent, groceries, car insurance, phone, etc. I have no debts other than my student loans (I own my car and rent an apartment).  My Loan payments total up in the ballpark of $750 a month and there has to be a way to lower that number. I do pay at least double the minimum payments on the Sallie Mae and first subsidized loan. The Parent loan I don't have any information on as it is technically my fathers loan I am only an authorized payer on the account and cannot view any information; my dad has yet to send me the information.   TL;DR - 50K in student loans, 50K in income. Read through the sidebar but need the ELI5. What's the most efficient way to pay them down?  I read through the sidebar but could use something more watered down. I know next to nothing about loan consolidation or finance in general. Would anyone mind giving me some advice? Thanks!    I got to thinking - they seem incredibly aggressive when it comes to their insurance policies. What's the deal? What was your experience like?   Danger!   That's the site!   No but I think Jennie McCarthy said the cause autism   Well I guess stealing Christmas counts as burglary    I would certainly be interested in this as well. Let me know if anything comes of this. I know it exists - I stumbled across a site once but can't remember what the hell it was.   His does it stack up to Taco Escobar? Granted TE is a bitch to get to and park during tourist season, but those nachos...   Check out his short story Willa. It was the perfect ending to that story. Other excellent endings are Nona and Typewriter of the Gods. All short stories and quick reads. Check them out, especially willa   I might just make this an adventure any way... Great idea!   But what if they're third-eye blind? Heh... I'll see myself out.   Try having them find something off of the corpse an explorer who never made it out. Maybe there is something that grows there of interest. Could be that there is a lonely traveler who is lost and driven to insanity... Maybe helping him out alive is worth their time  	20
 Very recently I had to pay $2 to park somewhere and only had a $5 so I put that in the machine. When it spit out three dollar coins I thought I got ripped off for a good 4 seconds before I realized what they were. It was the first time I saw one in at least 10 years   My shower ritual is weirdly on point every single day. First I get a towel, then I get the clothes I'll be wearing the rest of the day and throw them on my bed. Go to the bathroom and throw the towel hanging on the shower rod in front of the shower. Turn my shower on and make sure the head isn't facing the curtain. Then I straighten it out so it's like a carpet in front of the shower (even though there is a bathroom carpet underneath). Then I toss my towel on top of that. Get undressed and toss my clothes in the corner. Then I stick my hand in and test the water, and get in regardless because it's usually close enough. Once I'm in I fine tune the temperature to where I like it. Grab my tooth brush and toothpaste and brush my teeth. Next j stick my face under the water to open up my pores and grab my face wash. Once that's on my hand I stick my face under the water again, and then proceed to wash my face. Rinse that nonsense off and then make sure my hair is totally wet. I proceed by putting shampoo/conditioner on my hand, rub my hands together, and lather up. Scrubby dub dub that shit for a while and rinse. For my last wet act, I squeeze some body wash on my axe loofah thing and wash my left arm, then my left pit, then my chest, right pit, and right arm. Work my way down to my left thigh, dick and balls, right thigh, right calf, left calf, left foot, and right foot. Next I wash my back, and finally my cheeks, taint, and crack/hole. After I thoroughly rinse off I turn the water off.   Now here is the most important step;  I squeegee my body with my hands. I'm talking rub my hair, then face, arms, chest, and down to my ankles. This assures that I'm not dripping wet and makes drying a breeze and mess free. Once I towel dry I wrap that shit around my lower body and head back to the bedroom to get dressed.   I start with my boxers, then put on my deo and face lotion. Then I put on my socks, followed by my pants/shorts, and finally I carefully put my shirt on, so as to not get deodorant on the outside at all. Finish off with a spritz of cologne on the wrist, rub them together, dab my neck and inside of my elbows.   And that's it. Every day. Exactly like that. And if you read all of that, you may have too much free time. Then again, I just typed that shit out, so who am I to say shit.   Tl;Dr  I shower, and get dressed. Magic.    Good luck with that. I've tried lsa several times and have only gotten a noticeable trip twice. My first few attempts were using heavenly blue morning glory seeds, and it wasn't great. Basically got slight nausea and insane cramping.   That said, I then bought hbwr and it was a game changer. Now these seeds taste like you're chewing Satan's dirty asshole, but the effects are undeniable. Still got a tiny bit nauseated, but barely any cramping. First trip I had wasn't very visual but I had weird thought patterns and could hear my thoughts as if someone else were in the room speaking loudly at me. Second time I was insanely euphoric. I was outside in a foot of snow wearing flip flops and sweat pants with nothing else, and it felt wonderful. I could see every snowflake individually. I called several friends to tell them how great they are. It was amazing.  So in my opinion, lsa is unpredictable in both dosage required and how the trip turns out. I've never tried an extraction on them, but from doing a little research that'll probably be your best bet. I always came across the cold water extraction as being easy and very effective. Good luck!   Edit: I should also mention that if you have chlorinated tap water, do not mix it with the seeds. Don't drink it before for a while, or after you take them, and don't use this for the extraction. I guess the chlorine breaks the chemical down and kills it entirely. Made this mistake a few times.    I've had the same happen to me with higher doses than that, most recently a dosage of 760. The first time it happened I stupidly drank a protein shake not long before I downed the pills and got no effects at all, however after about two or so hours of waiting I went from a 0 to peaking. The most recent time I ate lightly around 2 hours beforehand and got nothing. Dxm can be very unpredictable at times. I'd say that it most likely has something to do with how full you were at the time, as I've noticed that not fasting for several hours does impact the trip.   As for trying again so soon, just go for it. I went through a period over the summer where me and four friends tripped at least 3, usually 5 days a week. Often back to back. Granted, we always took doses around 700-900, but the trips were always great. That said, I doubt taking it back to back when you don't do it often at all will make any difference. If anything, just increase your dose by like 200-300mgs.    I usually just close one eye and it kinda helps a tiny bit. Crazy that the trips are so similar though, I always read other reports and wonder how everyone else's are so different    God, typing on it is impossible. That and dxm.    Oh yeah, the texting thing happens to me almost every time. Usually to random people and it's either entirely illegible, or it looks like I sent it to the wrong person because it's just a fraction of a seemingly normal conversation. And after I wrote that long one out I remembered that a few times I would look between my bed and the wall and see glowing salamanders in the crack. That didn't happen too often though.    Definitely agree on dxm, haven't tried the others. Whenever I'm on a high third plateau I like to do this crazy awesome thing. I just get in my bed, prop to pillows against the wall and wrap myself up in a blanket so I'm all comfy. Then I close my eyes. I feel myself falling, and see it in third person, through the floor, and down into this black abyss. Once im surrounded by only this abyss I feel myself begin to accelerate upward. Through the void, through the floor, through the ceiling, and  then I launch off. Sometimes I fly around my town, sometimes through space. And I can do it as long as I want, all I have to do is open my eyes when I feel like it and I'm back in my comfy cocoon. It's the greatest feeling ever and I've "trained" myself to be able to do it every time.    Ya know, I always read about people seeing things like you mentioned, such as crazy animals or giant mushrooms growing out of the floor. I've tripped on benadryl at least 25 times and every time I see the same thing.   First the walls get "wavy", which I can only describe as a translucent jelly flowing all over the walls. Then things start falling down the walls, such as door knobs or fire alarms. This is my favorite part of the visuals of my trip. However, if I take a higher than usual dose I start getting the hallucinations of regular shit, such as talking to friends, only to look down and back up and notice that they aren't there. And for some reason whenever I try to sleep once I get bored, I close my eyes and I'm at work. Eventually I realize I'm not at work and get mindfucked because it's all in my head like a super vivid dream.   Never have I had a cool hallucination like seeing a mother fucking komodo dragon. Every time I read about stuff like that I get so jealous. However I have to agree with you on it making music sound great. Which reminds me of another common audio hallucination I have. Basically when I'm listening to music with head phones on I'll hear what sounds like people talking in the room, but when I take the headphones off it just stops. Creeps me out.   As for colors, never noticed any change. Seems like the drug has really different effects for everyone. In my opinion it's a fun drug, one that I've never had a "bad trip"  on. Worst I've seen is a little girl run past my door, and that only creeped me out for a few seconds because I knew it was just the drug. I hope someone actually read this whole thing.    When I was in basic training (army, ft Benning) one of my drill sgts told us a story about working the gate at his fob. Same thing almost, car was coming, they told th to stop, firing the warning shot, followed all of the steps of escalation of force. Once they realized they weren't planning on stopping the opened fire. They found out afterwards that it was a family of three, and there were no weapons or ied in the vehicle. He said the baby was hit in the head by the 240 and it blew up like a watermelon.    Have you taken it in any other dosage before this attempt? I usually take 760 mg for a decent 3rd plateau trip and I'm only around 145 lbs, so you may want to try a higher dose   I've combined the two multiple times, and it's pretty great. Normal come up, never had issues with nausea. Find a good album, turn the lights off, and strap yourself in for a unique night!    Is this site up to date? I'm probably wrong, but I thought PA scheduled salvia as well.    Haven't heard that one in a while.. And I'm wishing it stayed that way   That is definitely my favorite part of a dxm trip   That's why I'm worried. Three days and they couldn't figure out what happened,  so now I have to see a neurologist until they find out for sure what happened.    I really hope someone provides a good answer, because I recently fell down two flights of steps and basically had a period of amnesia following where I didn't remember the fall, or even waking up on the ground. I came to back at the top of the steps, and didn't realize how fucked up my body was until it was pointed out.  Went to the hospital for a concussion and ended up staying three days because they said I had a seizure which probably caused me to fall down the steps, explaining the amnesia.   Now that I see this question I'm wondering if I was knocked unconscious after I fell and had the seizure then because of that.   Edit: I should also note that this was something that had never happened to me before, which is why they kept me in the hospital for so long.    Ahh I actually didn't know that. Thanks for the heads up!   Trust me, I know how awful it is for me, which is why I don't do it often. But its a trip like no other    Yeah I know about the risks of em. I honestly put a ton of research into any drug before I do them and I always start low with my doses. I don't use ccc's all that often, but gel caps tend to get me nausea when I'm dosing around 1000mgs  Also at this point I've done high doses of them well over 70 times and never notice any bad effects beyond two days. At the most I get shakey hands, but by the next day my heart rate is almost always back to normal.   Oh man that was a long ass time ago so I can't give a very detailed report, but I remember the gist of it. I was with a few other friends that were tripping and they were having a great time but for some reason I was just feeling kinda down. Sat alone for a bit and started just remembering all these things that I forgot I even remembered from my past. It actually ended up making me realize that my life wasn't all that bad and since then Ive been a way happier person.  It was just insane how vivid the memories were at the time, I could remember the layouts of random ass buildings I had gone into very few times when I was just a kid. Overall it was a great trip.   I've tried low doses of dxm a few times but it really doesn't do it for me below third plateau. As for dph, I also heard a lot about it having no recreational value, but in my opinion it's fun as hell for something you can but at the drug store. Usually for my higher solo dph trips I end up listening to music for a bit, staring at walls to see if they're shifting yet, and waiting for the shit to hit the fan. I hardly hallucinate on it like I did my first few trips.   On May 2nd, I took a nice dose of dxm/dph together and tried to write down my thoughts or what was going on. All the pills were ingested at 6:48 PM, and I stayed lucid enough to record the events until around 9:11. At that point I would forget what I wanted to write by the time I picked up my pencil. I'll be writing everything word for word with little notes if i need to  explain  6:45- pills ready: 16 ccc's, 8 CVS ccc's, 10 50mg dph gel caps  6:48- all pills ingested, ~~heading to store for drink~~ -scratch that, found red bull   6:59-start album: Pink Floyd - The Final Cut, playing Oblivion  7:08- computer crashed- FUCK!, this album is emotional as hell  7:13- really digging this album, more so than usual  7:16- The Gunner's Dream solo... intense  7:17- Cotton Mouth + shakey hands, still totally lucid, no visuals, music sounds intense  7:21- feeling body load, heavy eyes, weird chest feeling  7:23- so heavy feeling  7:26- head space activate - body load gone? itchy spot on head  7:32- about to hunt some painted trolls (note:  Oblivion quest, not tripping that hard)  7:35- time going so slow, feeling spacy, short term memory shot  7:39- insane cotton mouth, time is going so fucking slow  7:45- end album (hearing whispering voices with headphones on)  7:48- body load is back, door knobs being pushed into wall, clear audio hallucinations (note: whispering voices in head)  7:51- robo itch is so annoying, door knobs sliding down wall, whole room shifted left  7:53- wavy walls start, losing focus, staring into space, slight closed eye visuals similar to wall melt  7:57- really feeling the music, going out for a cig  8:04- Back inside  8:08- zoning hard, ~~sciuis~~ same visuals  8:11- bored  8:16- walls twitching  8:17- walls have pink tint  8:22- visuals on fleek, cloth  (note: i have no idea)  8:26- peaking for sure (note: handwriting getting bad)  8:28- eye pressure mixed with  8:30- ceilinng  ~~8:3~~ (note: awful handwriting scratched out)  10:35  (note: on a seperate piece of paper, ripped out)  9:11  M         P       C  (scirbbly circles)    confu (terrible writing)  Buddha is evil (note: I have a small buddha statue in my room for some reason, it appeared to be turning its head and staring at me)  MAY     At this point i couldn't remember anything long enough to write it down so I turned on some music and layed down. And that's all I remember. I'll add pictures of the actual notes and the buddha statue if anyone is interested. Other than what I wrote down, I can't remember much. I do recall having felt bad for killing the goblins in oblivion because they had lived their entire life up to that point, just like I had, and then I just ended it. I felt bad for them and their family. Weird, I know. Also, looking back at my recent albums played on Spotify I listened to The Final Cut, Animals,  The Piper at the Gate of Dawn, and Wish You Were Here. No idea why I chose straight Pink Floyd that night, but I did.  Pretty much stayed slightly fucked up until around 8:00PM the next day, at which point I was just physically tired and my hands were still somewhat shakey. Thanks for reading!  tl;dr- took lots of dxm and dph, tripped hard, short term memory went to shit, thought buddha was evil, and listened to some tunes.  Quick edit- I should also note that I have taken various amounts of this combo over 10 times and have taken each seperately many many times, with DXM probably over 100 times and dph somewhere around 30 times. Highest dxm dose was around 1800mg, highest dph probably close to 1100 mg. I try not to trip to often, so usually once or twice a month, but sometimes up to 2 times a week.    Hmm maybe it's just a West PA word then. I'm from the north east, and currently live South East, but still haven't ever heard it.   	24

                      Thank you for the correction in spelling and the funny pun.      McConnell is married to the daughter of a Chinese shipping magnet. I believe McConnell is playing both China and the US for personal gain. He has a foot in each country, and his Chinese father-in-law has financed McConnell's past elections. I don't trust the putz one bit.                                       A golden retriever is artificial selection; a tiger is natural selection.   Believing one book holds all of life's answers is like shutting your mind to the entire universe.   Ecstasy is the romance novel. Take it with acid and you're now "candy tripping", at least that's what we called in the past.    The answers to this have a truthiness quality that reflect the cuteness of a polar bear while ignoring it will gladly eat you.                           Dire Straights - *Love Over Gold*   I completely agree that most people don't understand a god that asked Abraham to kill his kids just for kicks. You know, the religion that says it's okay for their followers to consider themselves morally superior to unbelievers. If Islam takes over the US, we'll be ready for sharia law because it's been forced on us by "christians."   Watching morbidly obese people try to act dainty while eating a really fattening desert. You just know that at home the person vacuums that desert right up.                  How is this different from the sharia law that conservatives are always screaming in fear about?                                                                                                   It's hard to argue against willful ignorance so I won't make any further attempts on that part.                  Here's one from the [General Accounting Office](http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/665966.pdf) that provides the relevant numbers. Again, conservative ideology runs away from empirical evidence, so put on your running shoes.      The number is literally in the millions, but conservative ideology largely ignores evidence based arguments. Faced with empirical evidence, conservative ideology falls apart in relation to voter fraud so they fight back by making disingenuous arguments that appeal to fear mongers.         Over the US's political lifetime the numbers are in the millions. The reports from the justice department on the number of illegal voters, however, said their numbers are minute. For a democracy to work, it requires the participation of the entire population. It still pains me that people believe the US is a democracy when for most of its existence it kept African Americans from voting.               Driven by conservative ideology that relies on nonexistent fears, in this case over voter fraud, to mask the true goal of limiting voter turnout.      As long as the SC is dominated by conservative ideology American voters will continue to lose access to voting rights.         I'd watch the "masturbators", "balls", and "backdoor" movies. I could just see bilbo stabbing an enemy.   *Intergalactic Knitting*      *Knitting Guardians of the Galaxy*      *Taken 3: Knitting*      See what I did there? Add knitting to any movie title and it's instantly boring.                  Wow...I didn't know the bible was so explicit describing the rape of j.      I agree...religion has no place in politics. J freaks need to keep their ignorance in relation to science and morality to themselves. Where does the religious interference end? Do we allow islam and jewish law the right to formulate policy?         Let's see how many religious nuts I can offend by providing evidenced based proof about J's marital status:      When the Romans crucified an individual, it was usually done by the book. However, since J's crucifixion was politically motivated, the Roman soldiers tasked with overseeing his execution would be far more attentive to the rules. A major rule the Romans wouldn't have bent for anyone was that only family was allowed to view the body while it remained in their custody. One of those allowed to see j's body was Mary Magdalene. This means that she was either related to j or she was his wife.     Looking at the whole ordeal from the contemporary Roman POV, j was just another jewish idiot claiming to be important, and there were a lot of those during the period. A good example is j. the bapt., who claimed to be a prophet and healer sanctioned by g to dunk people in water. It is only time that has provided the event with any importance, especially for the Romans.                                    Most of the people I know who dislike Bibi say it's because he doesn't keep his word, and is very sneaky. They point to a television show that visited Bibi's home to highlight that the PM lived in a modest home, but were shown instead the servants' quarters. I believe that if he were assassinated, the peace process would make greater progress.               In the course of my day I visit a number of Star Bucks and in some areas of Seattle people routinely refuse to flush the toilet in the coffee shops. It seems like a cultural thing.                        Japan refused to surrender in WWII, forcing the U.S. to drop the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Declassified records revealed that Japan repeatedly attempted to surrender eight days prior to bombs being dropped.                                                   Abraham from the bible. That prick tried to kill his kid and blamed it on the voices. He also kept slaves and probably raped one. Noah was a pretty big asshole, too, as his daughters were killed by bears because he fucked them.      Edit: Bring it on god-squad.   When I watched Katie Holmes in *The Giver* I wondered if she drew on her times with Tom Cruise.   If you worked for Edison, he got to keep all your research. This included any experimental processes the worker did during the home hours.   For the kids, an upside-down christ on a cross.   Why stop at dead bodies when zombies are so much more fun?      I can just imagine her spitting out some folksy "double-speak" that defends Iran's right to "drill-baby-drill" while demanding it be wiped off the earth's face for its nuclear policy.      Just think, McCain could have been our president and this is the level of intelligence he would have brought to our foreign affairs.                  Justice in the U.S. is distributed unfairly.            What's that sound you hear? It's the door to the presidency slamming loudly shut in Christie's face.                              Bankers, politicians, executive management, police, movie stars, Kanye, are good examples of this phenomenon.    I immediately signed the petition because I consider these 47 senators cowards whose irrational dislike of the president lead them to sabotage the negotiation process. Republicans literally fear just about everything: gun control, the FCC, banking regulations, the minimum wage, non-existent voter fraud, immigrants, unions, taxes, paucity of religion in government, the EPA, American history, birth control, abortion, health care, and....well, you get the idea.                                          I know and understand the long history of the united states, but I don't believe a past political party has shown such contempt for a president. It's sad.                 	199

Chop the kale well, meaning into small bits that have less than an inch of stem. In a skillet, heat olive oil (peanut or canola or vegetable oil will do as well, it doesn't matter). When it's hot, add kale and garlic and saute until fragrant and the kale is bright green. When done, place into a large bowl with chickpeas and diced tomatoes and mix.  I cook quinoa with a chicken bouillon cube, but you could just as easily use two cups of stock or just water (again, it doesn't matter). When the quinoa is nearly done, drain away half of the liquid. Pour the rest into the bowl with the kale, chickpeas, and tomatoes. Mix it well, then pour into a casserole dish (mine is 7 x 11) and even it out.  Put into oven and bake for 30 minutes. After about thirty minutes, remove from oven and sprinkle the feta over the top. Place back into the oven for at least 15 more minutes.

Saute for 5-10 minutes.  Add tomatoes, chicken broth, basil, and oregano. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer.  While mixture is simmering, melt butter in a separate pot. Once the butter has melted slowly whisk in flaxseed flour. Add some of the liquid from the soup (a cup or so) and whisk until smooth. Then pour mixture into the soup. Stir until the soup thickens. Add Parmesan mixing it in well. Stir in warmed half and half, salt. and pepper.  Let soup simmer on low heat, covered, for 15-20 minutes. Keep an eye on the soup to avoid letting the Parmesan stick to the bottom of the pot. When the carrots are soft, the soup is done.

Coat a skillet with cooking spray and set over high heat. Add the well beaten eggs, turning the pan to coat it with a thin layer of eggs. Cook 30 seconds, loosening the inside edges of the eggs with a spatula. What youre looking to do is create a thin scramble. Once done set aside.  Place a large skillet over medium heat (you can use the same skillet as you did for the eggs but make sure its large). Add half the oil. Once hot, add the mushrooms, bell pepper, broccoli, and kale. Cook 5-10 minutes, turning often, until the vegetables soften. Add the garlic and ginger and cook until fragrant.  Increase the heat. Push the vegetables to one side of the skillet and add a little more oil and the rice. Cook 1 to 2 minutes, turning the rice over with a metal spatula and scraping up bits that stick to the pan. Add the edamame and soy sauce. Stir well to mix in the soy sauce for 5-10 minutes. Turn off the heat but continue to stir until well mixed, then add eggs.   this is my Players to Watch Starting XI.

[Moroccan Crockpot Chicken with Chickpeas](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/02/18/foodiesphere-moroccan-crockpot-chicken-with-chickpeas-edamame-fired-rice/)  Ingredients  1 pounds chicken breast tenders 1 onion, well chopped can tomato paste 1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes 1 medium to large zucchini, sliced 10 baby carrots, sliced 2 teaspoons ground tumeric 1 teaspoon ground cumin 1 teaspoon ground coriander 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1/2 teaspoon salt and freshly ground black pepper cup chicken stock 1 can chickpeas 1 bell pepper, sliced 1/2 cup raisins (unsweetened, meaning no added sugar) 1/2 cup green olives Directions  Add chicken stock, spices, onions, peppers, olives, tomatoes, zucchini, tomato paste, and carrots to the slow cooker and stir. Then add chickpeas, dried fruit, chicken, and salt and pepper. Cook on high for 3 to 4 hours or on low for 6 to 8 hours.

Once the mixture is a good thickness, scrape it into a bowl. In the bowl, add breadcrumbs and the diced onions. The mixture needs to chill for at least 10 minutes. Form however many patties youd like but try to keep them uniform in thickness and width.  I use peanut oil to fry with these days because it has a high smoke point (meaning its damn difficult to burn peanut oil, Im not skilled enough to fry with olive oil and not make a mess). Pour at least a tablespoon of oil in a frying pan and let it get hot (every oven will vary, I dont have an oven with a proper flame so I tend to use Medium-to-Low), which usually takes about two or three minutes. You dont want them to burn but you want them crisp on the outside. Fry them for about four minutes on each side.  Quinoa Sliders  Ingredients  1 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed 2 cups vegetable or chicken stock can of chickpeas 1/2 cup freshly grated cheese (provolone, mozzarella) 1/4 cup Panko/breadcrumbs 1/2 cup chopped carrots 2 green onions 2 garlic cloves, minced 1 large egg 3 tablespoons olive oil/peanut oil Directions  Cook the quinoa with the stock. Once cooked, remove from heat and set aside.  Chop green onions and carrots and mince the garlic, then place in a bowl with the shredded cheese and panko and mix the ingredients. I again used my mini-food processor to chop up the chickpeas. Once the chickpeas are thick, add it to the bowl. Add quinoa and and egg, mix well. I always place the mixture in the fridge for a bit (10 minutes).  I usually make my patties from flattening the ball Ive rolled around in my palm, but you can do whateverjust make sure they are uniform.  Heat your skillet with olive or peanut oil. Once hot, put the patties in and fry until crispy (between 3-5 minutes on each side). If youre a dolt like me, you may need to have more oil at hand and occasionally clean out the skillet of burnt debris between patties.  Twice-Baked Butternut Squash  Ingredients  1 butternut squash (medium or large) 2 shallots (small or medium) cup of quinoa 2 cups of water cup of gorgonzola Directions  Preheat oven to 400. Slice butternut squash in half length wise. Scoop out seeds. Place each half cut side down in a 913 pan (or whatever size you have, I used a 99) and pour a cup of water (water is important, make sure its in your pandont put the squash in the oven without it). Place in oven and bake until tender, about 45-60 minutes. Once done, remove and set aside.  Dice the shallots. In a skillet heat oil. Saute shallots until they give off a nice aroma or are translucent (in plainspeak this means 5-10 minutes). In the same skillet add quinoa and cup of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer at let cook until water is absorbed, 12-15 minutes. Essentially, just cook the quinoa and then add the sauted shallots.  With quinoa done, go back to squash and scoop out the inside. Leave some in but youre carving out space for the quinoa. Cut side up return the squash to the pan (chuck the water, you dont need it anymore).  The squash you scooped out you need to mix with the gorgonzola cheese. When the quinoa is done, mix it with the cheese and squash mixture. Take this mixture and fill in each half of the squash in the pan. If youd like sprinkle some gorgonzola over the top.  Return the stuffed squash to oven. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until cheese has melted and the tops begin to brown. Remove from oven, cut eat half in half, and serve.  [Here's my post with links to the recipe sites themselves](https://train_subject1405.wordpress.com/2015/02/17/foodiesphere-chickpea-coriander-burgers-quinoa-sliders-and-twice-baked-butternut-squash/)         always makes sense to actually read the article before you comment. just saying                  Definitely a legit issue   I thought about that, but I figured that a whole-cloth reinvention would be more alienating. So this way it's kind of anchored, at least, that's my thought.   I think that's a valid point. But I don't fancy the over-the-top covers usually employed in the genre. I've never believed that a fantasy or sci-fi couldn't have tasteful covers, so for my books I'm going kinda against the grain with the cover.                 	137
 It would look like an iPhone, and a computer, and an iPad. In the future will everything just be black rectangles?    You should record yourself talking and then watch it in a year and see if you piss yourself off.   On my head.   I don't think there is any real correlation.   Luckily we have the "gas leak" to explain that mess.    YOUUR WIIIIFE   Already did. It's doing better here.   I don't know, why?   You found her! Also didn't expect her to be that old by now.   It's actually my least favourite episode of the entire series, even though I love puppets.   That's definitely not the intended order though. You don't watch the finale where Jeff and Pierce leave as the third last episode. The rest of it seems pretty correct though. 4 is supposed to be episode 2 anyway. I remember that.   Community does it too in their puppet episode.   Season 4 was aired completely out of order. There is a correct order somewhere on this subreddit.   It doesn't help that he capitalised "Room."   I don't think I'd ever have the confidence to do something like that. Good job mate!   Yeah. I get to talk to myself even more.      Yes and.. the movie would be relevant to our times.   It's true though. My little cousins spend all of their time playing with apps rather than toys. They got itunes gift cards for christmas.   Comedies tend not to have podcasts like dramas do.   Not having a relationship in 3 years is weird?   I also missed the start. Top Gear?   That's actually what this comes from. The light bulb in my fridge is burnt out and I have yet to notice any difficulty without the light.    Is that an irish thing? Eh.. cupboards?   But we don't have lights in presses. It seems we would face the same problem.   I don't know that much about it, but the thing I do to change region is enter in different settings on my xbox.       Nope, on my xbox I used a different DNS setting.   The Day needs my saving expertise.   I don't think my interest in film helps. I'm constantly paying attention to sets, background extras and the like.   There's some pretty big problems with the widescreen version.       So I'm currently watching Buffy for the first time on UK Netflix and the first 3 season were in 4:3 which was all fine. Then with season 4 it changed to widescreen. However I'm now watching Angel alongside it and the stream I found online was in 4:3 which confused me considering they were both shot at the same time.    After some research and annoyance I found out both Angel and Buffy were on US Netflix so I used a DNS to switch to that and it saved me a lot of trouble trying to find streams. However on the US Netflix Buffy season 4 is in 4:3 and Angel is in widescreen! It's like they have both changed ratios with each other.    I've done some searching in this subreddit and it seems the consensus is Buffy was made for 4:3 and should be watched that way. My main question is "which way should Angel be watched, widescreen or 4:3?" And also why are they putting up different versions for different regions?   Do you have a link to the original thread? I'd like to find out what this is.   hitrecord.org is a great website for stuff like this. A subreddit would be cool is well though.   It doesn't take a minute to send a snap.   Will all food be dehydrated in the future?   Please, please do this for the whole stream.    I believe Funny Or Die invited them. They invited Johnny Bananas is well.   Rick and Morty is sort of a mash of all the shows Justin did for Channel 101. I really hope there is a reference to Cup at some point.   Woosh.

 Like some sort of Anime Instrumentality Project?  Also, OP, don't give Gawker sites ad money. They're a dreadful, awful company.   Is that what that is?    Life is never neat. Life is always bad.  That's poetic.   I'll have to watch this when I get home.  That was weird and not very on message. Why appeal to Soviet patriotism if you're going to ban Soviet symbols? Kiev have no idea what they're doing, do they?      Poroshenko using Soviet stuff? Got any direct links to that?   Oh, most definitely. If nothing else, his views on labor dynamics and class relations will form the basis of any worthwhile populist movement in this century.   Not for long. Not unless you liquidate the proletariat.   What the 21st century needs is some sort of transhumanist techno-communism. That would be the best fit for humanity, I think.    As an actually disabled person, I think you're a disgusting sack of pig shit. What a lowlife.   No, thank you for bringing it to my attention. I just print screened.   Let's see. I haven't got a really long list, as I've only lived here for about half a month, but I really enjoy the Lunchbox. Their coffee is great. Gemelli has some pretty good coffee, too. Neither of these places is about coffee, however. I still need to try Fennarios. Perhaps that will be my next stop.   As for what becomes of the old court annex, a park would be great. I'd also like to see it become another store - perhaps offering antiques or men's clothing.    It really isn't. One of the first things I noticed when I moved here is that there are so few chains in the pedestrian downtown. It's quite refreshing! The Starbucks stands as a big, ugly defiance of this and its prominence really adds to the insult. I'd be all for a campaign to ignore the West Chester Starbucks. There really are so many better places to have a cup of coffee that doesn't taste like burnt, leathery tar.    Oh, that's disappointing.   Maybe the dueling Starbucks could close each other down and we'll get more local coffee shops, instead.   That was awesome. Just in case anyone wants to use it, anywhere, [here's a high def grab of the ghouls part.](http://i.imgur.com/Zs62Lkq.jpg)   Plastic guns in general for me.   You're right! I meant the Dnepr.   Well, it would be a loose boundary. I was sort of vague about this, but of course much of the coast is staunchly Russian and they'd be left out of West Ukraine. Geologic boundaries are imperfect predictors of geopolitical loyalties, it's true.   That's ludicrous. The Ukraine should split - mostly along the course of the Dnepr - with the Eastern bank staying in the Russian sphere and the Western bank (minus, maybe, Odessa) pursuing a course for European integration. This seems like it would make everyone happy, minus imperialistic nationalists in Kiev.   I'd back that.   Star Wars: The Last Forcebender?   Thanks! Yeah, I know the Iron Cross doesn't quite belong but I don't really have a nice place to put it yet, so until I can organize a display for it with my other World War stuff, it's in the commie case.   Principally, the case is filled with Soviet Union materials from the VMF. However, I put a few Red Army pins and Lenin pins in there because it's my only shadow box and I really liked them. Additionally, I've got an East German Red Banner of Labor 2nd Class in there that was much too gorgeous to leave in a dark drawer.    Lyrics from the comments section:  Chorus:  Wide is my Motherland,  Of her many forests, fields, and rivers!  I know of no other such country  Where a man can breathe so freely.    From Moscow to the borders,  From the southern mountains to the northern sea  A man stands as a master  Over his vast Motherland.    Throughout life, and freely and widely,  Just like the Volga flows.  The youth are always dear to us,  The old are always honoured by us.    Chorus    Our fields are too wide for the eyes,  Our cities are too many to remember,  Our proud word - comrade -  To us is higher than all fine words.    With this word everywhere we feel at home.  For us there are no blacks or coloureds.  This word is familiar to everyone,  With it we always find friends.    Chorus    Over the country, the spring breeze is blowing.  Every day life becomes more joyful,  And no one on earth could know  Our great ways of laughter and love.    But our brows shall frown sternly  If an enemy attempts to break us.  As a bride, we love our Motherland,  We protect her, as a gentle mother.   Chorus    Ham fisted propaganda operating from a flawed premise. Not a fan.   And yes, I'm aware this isn't the best shadowboxing job ever. Still, let me know if you have any questions!      Sorry my voice isn't deep enough for you. I guess you aren't a fan of Billy West then, are you? Thanks for taking your precious time to let everybody know of your displeasure, kind sir. You're a saint and a tastemaker.   She really was the least likeable character. She worked well with Dale, though, so I tolerate her episodes    All the more reason to stay the fuck out of Mississippi.   Glad you enjoyed it.   [So I'm not Ron Perlman, but I felt like narrating this.](http://vocaroo.com/i/s1ZmdCoYSiqr) If anyone has a slideshow of derpy Fallout Scrolls pics to set this to, feel free to make an intro video because that's the collaborative power of the interbutts.   We just lost the counterbalance that we had in the Soviets. Without the narrative of us vs. the Communists, our dickery becomes much more evident.   You can use it without being spiteful. Not only is it just as grammatically correct, but to many aesthetic tastes it sounds better. It's just as valid, so if it's his preference let him use it. I use the article for much the same reason: the Ukraine just sounds better.   OP is half from the Ukraine. Did you not read his reasoning? It has to do with his distaste for nationalist nitpickers who first dropped the article from the name. Christ. Calling it 'the' Ukraine doesn't make it any less of a country in anybody's eyes.   The way the US wages war is counter to conventional military thought. The United States and its allies wage war not for victory or the elimination of threats but for the enforcement of global hegemony, the protection of business interests, and the collection of resources. Peace will not arrive because we intentionally drop just enough bombs to enforce our will while still leaving enough room to produce more bombs and keep the military-industrial complex chugging along.   I'm glad to see that song getting some much deserved love. It really is one of the best pieces of music in Star Wars.   I'd love to read that! Link me if you do!   How is this dark? We're going to get healthy, smarter human beings out of this tech. As a disabled person who was born with a congenital birth defect, I strongly encourage everybody reading this to consider the great gains our society and our species will make by shaping its own genetic destiny.  The only hazard is that we must ensure that this technology is widespread. Concentrating it in corporate or government hands will inevitably warp our species into something that is morally unwholesome. Allowing everybody access to these tools will force a level of oversight and fairness that will drive us into a new age of biological prosperity.    You're quite welcome! It was great practice for me, and I'm happy to do so.   Maybe "Republic of Abkhazia" was next to "Republic of China" in a menu somewhere and whoever was in charge of the graphics was terminally bored and careless? I dunno.   Never censor yourself. You're an American! Censorship doesn't apply in the land of the free!   Yep. They also used that song during the scene where the dictator is dancing with the globe. However, they cut it out mid way through during that scene as the globe bursts in his hands, just before the music swells to its climax. It is only allowed to finish during the Jewish peasant's speech at the end, providing a subtle thematic contrast that I missed the first few times I watched the movie.   Given the Nazis' fondness for Richard Wagner, I found everything about the way they used Lohengrin in the film to be absolutely perfect. When evil men co-opt beautiful things, the artistic community has a duty to take such things back from them. This, I think, was done exceptionally in that film.   I didn't think you were. I was just offering my (admittedly unasked for) opinion on the scene and the music used in it.    [I like to narrate things. Your story had me enthralled, so I simply had to take a crack at it.](http://vocaroo.com/i/s1cESuWHJHRr)   Hans Zimmer is okay, but no composer can match the emotional resonance of Wagner. The usage of the prelude for Lohengrin there was absolutely perfect, especially given how the Nazis were co-opting so much of the composer's music for their own purposes at the time. Everything about that scene is utterly perfect.   This is an idiotic comparison. Bombing for peace will, ultimately, eliminate your adversaries and establish peace. The means are ugly, but the end result is the same. Fucking for virginity will ensure that there are no virgins left. This is an awful analogy and the person who half baked it should feel bad.   I challenge you to find spare parts for slavshit anywhere but the internet outside of a gun show.   Gun shows, in my experience, are extremely reputable and everyone there is really nice - if a bit right of center politically. You can certainly find better prices, though.   Since Stolichnaya is now made in Latvia, Russian Standard is the best Russian vodka you can get in the states, in my experience. Since Russian vodka is the best vodka, it tends to be my preference. Scary or no, it's quite a cool looking label.    Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the war room!   I don't get what's so funny. The Transnistrians are, if anything, the aggrieved party. They've got nothing in common with the Nazis.   The highlight? He was good, but Ian McDiarmid would like a word with you.   Semi-related, but speaking of ripoffs, ever hear about how TAPPY ripped off the Metal Gear Solid theme music?   Your move, ecologists.   What, how he ripped off Mars for the Imperial March?   Well if we're talking "reals" then the Americans would have evaporated any British forts on American soil during the Revolutionary War. How is American secession from Britain more justified than Southern secession from the US?   Not sure why you're being downvoted. Lincoln recontextualized the war to be about ending slavery after it proved unpopular at home. Llincoln was perfectly content to let the South keep its slaves, he just didn't want the dread institution to spread beyond where it already was. It didn't hurt that he was also eager to keep a solid market for Northern agricultural equipment under his thumb and had a keen, overarching sense of patriotism that made the notion of Southern sovereignty unthinkable to him.   Seeing as how Sumter was on South Carolina's soil, they probably felt they had the right. They probably felt the Union troops were there unjustly.   Well, I'm eager to read it.   No, they have to blow it down.   Poignant and desolate. A bit short, but it certainly made for an intriguing read.   The hell is Trigger Warning? MI6 vs Tumblr?   This place is obnoxiously pro Kiev. I hardly even comment here anymore. They've made up their minds and won't listen to any reasoning from the separatist camp. You're spinning your wheels, mate.   And it was brilliant. Thanks aplenty!    This is quite entertaining. Can't wait for the next part!   I really like this a lot. I'm sure you'll have an audience if you feel inclined to keep writing it.   I rather liked that. Good work.   Provided the place hasn't succombed to structural collapse by now, what's going on? Maybe the place did implode and passing ships are affected by savagely evolved former humans? I have a hankering to hear people's wildest, most outlandish stories about what Rapture would possibly be like, given enough time.   Remarkable? Sadly, I suppose there isn't. But such things are certainly anti populist.   He's in favor of magazine capacity limits, increased waiting periods, and has been rated F on gun rights by the NRA. As an armed proletariat is essential to safeguarding civil liberty, I can't say his views are entirely populist.   His stance on guns is remarkably anti populist. Beyond that, he seems fine to me.    The American people just aren't buying gun control. Good on us, but I really wish we'd hold to income equality and campaign finance reform as fervently as we do gun freedoms.   I don't know. Any movement that holds Andrea Dworkin as a reputable academic has got to be sort of fishy.   You're my hero.  Also, what the hell? Mandalore System? Super Commandos? When did this come out and how in the royal fuck did they guess that much?   I was thinking that Sidious would be the Lord of Manipulation, seeing as how he's the king of all puppet masters.   In a way, a special and twisted way, one could imagine that Vader has assumed the mantle of Darth Traya. There must *always* be a Darth Traya, one that holds the knowledge of betrayal. Who has been betrayed in their heart, and will betray in turn.   Other suggestions:  Darth Krayt: Lord of Fury  Darth Bane: Lord of Shadows  Darth Plagueis: Lord of Ambition  Darth(?) Lumiya: Lady of Vengeance   Darth Malak: Lord of Destruction  Darth Revan: Lord of Change  Tulak Hord: Lord of Combat  Darth Andeddu: Lord of Decay  Darth Bandon: Lord of Envy   And yet there's still no Russian course.   I have *got* to find those.   Aldi is where it's at.   Handicapped person, here. Also, minor teir germophobe. I pretty much always wear gloves.   Are you a fan of pickled cucumbers? Or law enforcement?   At Dragoncon every year, the Mandalorian Mercs cosplay group figures quite prominently in the cosplay community. I've got to tell you, those are some of the fittest people I've ever seen. A few of them even lug around metal armor. Metal! On a parade route! Nerds can into fitness, for sure.   I'm pretty sure imbecile is in children's shows. I have a theory that slurs lose their bite if you don't set them aside from other words and act like a scared little shit about them. The best way to let cripple, nigger, fag, and other choice words lose their effectiveness is to use the hell out of them, I think. I mean, ever hear what scumbag used to mean?   Just golf club them in the the knees, then see how they feel about ramps.   C-c-crip for l-life. (I haven't seen that episode in forever.)   Never knew that. I always just listened to his music and knew he was Russian.    We have to keep going, though. Retarded is the new imbecile. Handicapped is the new crippled. Keep the euphemism treadmill going, this is not a sisyphean exercise in futility.   I was unaware of it, but it sounds like the most idiotic thing to come out of social justice since the fiftieth anime inspired gender they pulled out of their collective ass.   Dragunov? Uses just regular old 7.62x54R.    A 9mm will kill too, bud. Pretty much any caliber will kill. Many police departments use 9mms. I'm pretty sure a 9mm started all this bullshit.   Wait, I thought they called that "cis white hetero males existing literally anywhere doing literally anything."   Can't use Tchaikovsky, though. Guy was white and therefore privileged. Why not just use the soothing sounds of mother earth as your triumphal explosion soundtrack?   I'm in a fucking wheelchair and I cringe whenever people start in with this "disabled is not PC" shit. Bitch, you're not the cripple - I'm the cripple. Stop falling all over yourselves to outwhine each other and look more PC so we can actually fix things that matter for disabled folks. You're all idiots.  Also, what the fuck even is kyriarchy?   Well done, man. Well done.   As a guy in a wheelchair, I can never help but roll my eyes when fat people say *they* aren't being accommodated. It's quite annoying.   Reconstruction couldn't even fully fix the damage he wrought. Yet here are all these people in this thread calling him a badass and celebrating his legacy. It bewilders me.   What do you like about him?   That's the war, not the action in the context of the war. Not even going into the vast differences between the Nazis and the Confederacy, I'm pretty sure few would defend the firebombing of Dresden and Tokyo or any other large scale campaigns against civilian centers in World War II. Why do people seem so quick to glorify Sherman, then?     Killed and plundered from civilians? Burned down cities? Pretty sure that makes a terrorist in any context. Part of his doctrine in the March to the Sea was warfare by terror, breaking Georgia's will to fight.   Speaking as a Georgian, that man was a terrorist. If the Union had lost, Sherman would be spoken of as the monster he was. He burned down a city full of civilians, my hometown. 150 years ago or no, he's still a rat bastard. That he's remembered as a hero and tactician infuriates me to no end.   You're not wrong, I just felt that the CGI toylike art style they went with was a bad stylistic choice for capturing the Star Wars story and what it, to me, is all about. Art being subjective as it is, though, your opinion is just as right as mine. I hear they do a lot of cool stuff with the Mandalorian Death Watch and Darth Maul, later, so I do really wish I could enjoy it but the art style just keeps sucking me out of it. Maybe I'll just read scripts.   Maybe I'm the outlier, but I could never get past the art style. I hear the writing gets better, but it just hurts to look at.   Wasn't that Event Horizon, too?   Sure, but it's not on wikipedia. What people do and what the law says are totally different things.   It was used in the West for quite some time as a good luck symbol, rather similarly to four leaf clovers. It makes perfect sense as a symbol a political party would want to claim.    It's not by itself an unpleasant symbol. I wish we could take it, and many of the other things the Nazis ruined with their evil deeds, back for use by normal, upstanding people.   Sincerely, a guy who likes Richard Wagner music, neoclassical architecture, closed collar military uniforms and the aesthetic of the swastika.   Oh, PS, if we could have Hindus in the west use it without getting odd looks, that would be a nice start.   Good on them. I can never stand to see a foolish law being obeyed.      Isn't that thing subject to some bizarre rule governing photographs of it?   Because the Ukraine are supposed to be the "good guys." Nevermind that Poroshenko is the same shit as Yanukovych. He's pro West, so he's a good guy.   I seem to see a preponderance of sites from the Ukraine, but that could be because I go to /r/UkrainianConflict and they've got a rather pro-Kiev bent.    Limits? I wasn't aware this was Oceania. Hail BB, hail Ingsoc. *Fascist.*   Huh. Well that's uncomfortable.   Wait, where was that poem hidden?   Here's hoping we can quickly silence the harmful little diarrhea chugger.   This isn't free speech anymore than shouting fire in a crowded theater is free speech. Free speech is never a bad thing, and Australia's rather repressive system is not one I'd be keen to emulate.   My micronation (the Soviet Socialist Republic of Lindengau) declares war over this grievous human rights disaster.   What? Micronations can go to war. Molossia has been at war with East Germany for years. Years! Hell, I'm pretty sure Sealand is still pissy at non East German Germany after that coup they had.   Societies and civilizations tend to fall apart under such conditions.   Not 40k? Not interested.   I first heard this after it was used to amazing effect in [The Hidden People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt5lB-RoAi4). Great animation, high recommend.    Lots of white people in that protest against white people.   Hopefully the DPR will put a stop to the looting.   Super Cliff-racers.   Yeah. You're supposed to, though. Also, as a disabled guy, I found the handyman particularly resonant. I wish more games would explore such themes, as I found any information on the handyman to be quite fascinating.   Columbian biotech augmentations are certainly much less advanced. Granted, I feel like Suchong didn't do much better than Fink at making his abhuman creations, but he at least masked or sublimated their pain more effectively.  Then again, Fink being the ruthless, plagiarizing capitalist that he is, he probably just didn't care to copy anything but the essentials. There's the possibility that he couldn't get it working with Columbia's slightly less advanced laboratories and much more rigidly religious approach to the sciences, however. Maybe it's even a combination of these reasons.   It seems to me that if you want someone to go away, writing SJ baiting outrage pieces only gives your target more noteriety. I and a lot of other people here hadn't even heard of Beer Wench until now. Sex sells, and if she wants to use the old bar wench trope to promote herself, it flies in the face of equality to tell her she can't.   Two cities? More like Rapture and Columbia. Your move, lerminerty.   Thanks for the recommendation. I'm moving out soon, but I'll do what I can.   Well, I have been taking them food and I know many neighbors have. In the long term, the colony needs to be fixed. In the short term, however, I think these kittens will be alright.   Every relocation and neutering program I've found wants me to take them there, seeing as how this is rural Georgia and our animal control is poorly funded at best. I would take them all myself, but I'm in a wheelchair and don't drive.      Sad and true   Perhaps I should say sapient? They don't ponder or wonder or imagine. They're clever, but they aren't sapient. Speaking of pain, you do know that plants can feel pain, right? They react to the stimulus of pain in some really interesting and shocking ways, it turns out. If we're using pain as a benchmark, we're going to have to learn to live off of solar energy or something.  Nice appeals to emotion, by the way. Emotion has no place in debate.   They're not people and not sentient, so it's irrelevant. They're livestock.   Sure, but they desired meat.   Maybe more fit for /r/Headcanon.   Such democracy.   Politicizing children. Classy.   It's 2015. How do regimes as backwards and repressive as the Saudis still exist?   Tell me your wisdom, butterfly.  "Fuck Chechnya"  And then we went to war.   It looks so perfectly like a dopey, happy go lucky guy with a pompadour.    I typically give children bottles of vodka and a razor. It'll toughen you up and get you ready for the real world, you sheltered little shit.   Reply:  "That's okay. I won't get him anything."    Damn. Sucks if they're immortal.   21 days ago  Talk about a blast from the past. On a fairly large subreddit. Why'd you dig this up?  Anyway, I'm not talking about blood sport. I'm talking about the public seeing a function of the state. We open court trials, after all. This is a similar principal.   Anyway, I'm on my phone and can't type my full thoughts on the matter.      Wait, then what the hell happened to Pubertus?   LIAR. YOU ARE A LIAR. IT LIES.   This is the same fucking shit. The Ukraine will never get better.   And does OP care to share with us?   Holy shit that one was good. I think it could be expanded upon.   For real. Can't stand the heat? Get out of horror. Trigger warnings absolutely kill suspense. Goddamn.   Kind of ruined any surprise that might have come of it, though.   That's a BDRM(?) varient I've never seen. Some oddball version specific to the Ukraine?  	153
 See above. :)    I am an author. I don't hide it, and I don't lie about it.   Sometimes I have free giveaways. And in all honesty, they are for self promotion. Why else would an author give up his/her work for free?  Readers. Authors need readers.   I understand the strong feelings Reddit has against advertisers, so I do my best to keep my promo's to the correct subreddits.   Regardless, on one of my promo's a few months back I used Reddit as well as other forms of promotion (Facebook, Twitter, Google+ and pretty much any place I could post a link) and a certain Redditer didn't care for the use of a forum they seemed to take as their own personal playground. I have been following this persons comments for the last while looking for some kind of shred of decency, a glimmer of hope for the spark of humanity, but I haven't seen it. I had hoped they were having a bad day and I just happened to be the recipient of that. However, in light of their comments since my turn in their spotlight, I just don't see it.  So, they downloaded my free work, created a profile on Amazon, and promptly tried to give all my books a 1 star rating.  They got away with one. At which point a few of my readers decided they didn't want this person to get away scott free and sent out letters to Amazon asking for it to be removed.  In the end it wasn't taken down, but it was downvoted enough to no longer matter as much. But the stir created by my readers was enough to spike my book up into some higher rankings for a while, and that got me a little more notice.  So, their attempt at a personal strike, even though it hurt, (Authors do care about how people take their work. We all want to please everyone, even if it isn't possible.) turned out to be a good thing for a little while.   My reader list spiked. I sold a few dozen more works than I normally do, and I gained a small amount of money in my bank account. Perhaps the trend will continue, even though I see the ripples fading even now.   You. Yes you, the redditer who claims to be "Helping". You used the information I provided for free. You struck out at me in real life and tried to sabotage my work.   You are a prick.  But because of your actions, I have had the best two months in book sales in a long time. No, I'm not going to be famous any time soon. No I am not going to be rich. But for the next two months I have little more disposable cash in my wallet and it's partly due to your attempt at petty revenge. All because I don't agree with what you say.   Your hipster wanna be, pot smoking, old before your time, old people watching self can try to hide in the darkness of the internet if it makes you happy.  I see you.  I know that you tried writing, and failed. I can see it in your typing, I can see it in your responses. You have an education and it shows.   Shame you never grew up.  So again. Thanks. Your little attack had a good outcome. I hope one day you can realize how you actually did help, even though your intent was to harm.     Already is.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_air_car   Your camera focused on the ground really well.   This is Reddit. They want to hear about you but if you self promote you get down votes. Damned if you do, damned if you don't.   Past Jumper.  Time travel is hot right now.   Or Home World?   Perhaps Space Rogue? By Origin?   One of the Wing Commander series? It sounds familiar...   Remove outside distractions and try a change of pace to a more active read. Of course, a lot of people have this problem when reading. Frame of mind makes a big impact on how you read.   Why you gotta be this way?      I can think of a couple redditors that have a seat warming up.    That is an error code that your on-board computer can use to report the status of the car to you.   It's saying that hell has frozen over.   This is very logical.   Next level funny right there!   Has more to do with the lighting and the camera itself.    Trolls and negative comments get down voted. Under normal settings with 10 down votes most comments get blocked for you.   You can take my word the trolls are always out and if you leave them an opening , they will attack.   If you want a sample change your settings.   I don't have time to go into depth, but I see you are getting few comments. So here is a quick thought after reading a short bit.   Right of the bat, look how many words start with "f" try reading that fast...I had to untie my tounge.   Be sure to read what you write out loud. If you are like me, and know the words by heart, read the sentences normally, but backwards. Last sentence first and so on.  You will soon find some of our errors and sentences that don't flow.  Hope this helps some.   Pm me...with your skills I might have something to send your way...   I got a WiFi keyboard for my Samsung, but I use it only when I am stuck with nothing else.

Would help to know a bit more about her tastes?   Sci-fi Fantasy Either of those in tastes I can help, other tastes? Let us know.   You can use a PC, cell phone, tablet...pretty much anything electronic these days will let you read an e-book.   The Event, by J. Heppner. It's a dark mash up of fantasy with a post apocalyptic twist. Definitely not for the young readers.   I think you should be a lot less concerned about the job of security, and more concerned about the major buildup on your cables.   Discusting.    Keep reading. If writing is for you, it will happen down the road.   Mirror Thief, by Jamie Heppner  What happens in the world inside of a mirror?   I am sharing free stories on Amazon...does that count?   Because they are both genres that I write, and I just can't seem to get a break lately?         You can't make someone do something like this. Either she will, or she won't. The decision is up to her and her alone.   If it doesn't come back up...we will always have our memories to fall back on.   Who am I kidding. I have the memory of a gnat!

Getting enough income from my writing to work from home and enjoy my kids childhood before they grow up.   Was going to down vote cause...enough already...but, can't do it. You win.   Future Jumper Series by Jamie Heppner.   Okay that does make some sense, still a very expensive way to edit.   I am going to take it you don't have any beta readers yet. You might want to look into finding a few it will save you some time and money in the long run.  What kind of story is it?   Did you do cover art as well?  By chance did you think of just printing it out on basic paper and handing those out?  Congrats all the same though! At least you have something in print!   You might want to look into Createspace...  That is very expensive for just 10 books, and you are saying it's your proof? You should have just done one book. No point in having 10 books with glaring errors in them.   Createspace also gives a discount on proof orders so you don't have to spend so much.  Of course, there could be no errors at all, but do you really want to take the chance?   So, what part of this is funny?   Are you using an e-reader? (Assume yes on my part) send me a PM with your email address. I will send you all 3 of my works.   Thank you for serving. No matter whos wall you choose to stand and defend.   And if you don't want to be naked but are still super hot, feel free to have clothes present, just put them on the floor beside you.   I have found that the majority of the buy-return on Amazon is due to theft.   Of course I can't prove it. Amazon refuses to assist me in searching out the culprits, they just send back letters that say "we actively monitor all returns" aka we know, we don't care. Sadly, not much you can do about it.    I have found, so far, every dollar spent for advertising is a wasted dollar. Unless! It is on personal advertising. And by that I mean heading out and printing posters, setting up book signings, the things along those lines are your best bets.  After almost 4 years in self publishing I am just starting to see a monthly income of about 100 dollars. And that is with 3 full titles under my belt and a couple collections of short stories.   In short, the more you put into your work, the more you will get out. For me, my family and personal life come before my writing, so it is taking a much longer time to build a reader base.   Getting it available is easy. Getting it read is hard.  I have been on the top 100 lists a dozen times and I am an unknown name. I can create spikes in sales with a good stint of advertising, but they always fade after a couple of days. If you think of your writing as a business, that will help.   But whatever you do, don't quit your day job.   Notalwaysright.com The customer is not always right...   You might want to look up Russell Blake. We both started writing at about the same time and he really dove into it. His model for success would work for anyone dedicated to the craft.   I'll get back to you on this later...   Upper left...don't mess with her.    Reposting yourself? Fail.   So far I have found every dollar spent on advertising my work has been a waste. I truly hope yours aren't and would love for you to update this with some numbers.  I already see you have long list of people marking it as -to read- hopefully it pays off.   Welcome to reddit. Where self promotion is frowned at and pictures of kittens and puppys hit the front page.   If only I could find a kitten to fall asleep on one of my books...be right back!   Best to look into an e-reader. Physical books are great but you can't beat an e-reader for travel and large books. (word count)   Jumper series..   http://www.amazon.com/Worlds-Unbound-Future-Jumper-books-ebook/dp/B00HUHM2WK/ref=la_B006N2IJU2_1_9?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1395279069 sr=1-9   First book is free if you want to read a sample.    Very well said.   As it sits my numbers are so low a single theft stands out. Of course my loss of .25c isn't going to break the bank any time soon, nor will it send me into the depths of dispair. (Pit of Dispair?)   It's more of the stance of a simple theft. Not many other areas of life allow others to simply take something and people shrug and say, ah well, perhaps others might pay me.   Sadly the more authors that simply shrug it off and move on, will only make it harder for others to stand and say, "I'm not okay with it."  If perhaps one day if I am big enough in the literary world that I know longer notice a single theft my stance might chance. I will have to wait and see.   Oh, I don't go yelling and guns blazing, but every book stolen is money taken from me. And I can honestly say I have never heard, "So I stole this great book yesterday..." Or if they did tell someone and they asked "Where did you get that book from? Oh, I pirated it from..."   Not trying to be mean, just in all honesty, I feel most people that steal work aren't likely to go tell all their friends about it.   Yes. And many friends have as well. Heck, Amazon practically invites it with a seven day return policy.   Until you have had your work stolen. It is not flattering in the least.

Thanks for the read, and I hope you enjoy another of my giveaways.       Looks like a late night of DS2 for me! I will just repost after midnight. #Noharmdone   And lose 8 hours and entire continent. I don't mind giving my work away now and again, but the exposure is nice. Even the negative feedback.    Yeah. So not funny.    Free promo starts at midnight, no way I will be awake at that time. How might you suggest I reach people that are. Can I set a timer on my post?    Is it just me or is giving away something for free getting a lot harder. ^Maybe I should start doing door to door sales...^Oh wait, it's free...can't sell...^Damnit   Done. Thanks ;)    If you do happen to grab this free E-book, and feel like leaving a review, I wouldn't complain. Of course, that is only a request and by no means necessary.

Till then, I have other works available now ;)  (Shameless plug inserted)^Sorry    That might have been implied...   Sadly, they are multiple files for the complete collection. So...unless I made more than one post, confusing more people, and getting even more down-votes, I am stuck with linking to the main list. When I have a single book available for free, I am sure to post it directly.  Thanks!    Fire Jumper...cept it's a girl.   Nasa used it and left it in the depths of space, but it's coming back and it's still alive.   Having to promote myself for almost no return.

Because you have self published, your work must be crap and full of mistyped words?   I resemble that remark!   I love the .ca being a Canadian myself. What is your stance on previously e-pubbed works?       It's a glitch on amazons side. They told me they will look at it on monday...helpfull...so if you wait til tomorrow the collection should be available. Sorry.   Some readers are reporting the don't see the first four collection coming up as free, if you don't please look again tomorrow as the promo continues then.   Thanks! I understand reader taste all to well, I am a reader to after all. They are my earliest works so I hope you enjoy them.   Is she interested in a gig in translations? Mit dansk er rusten...   Also...the promo was split between Sat and Sunday on Amazons side, so it might be a glitch in the program. If you wait until Sunday the next promo kicks in and it should work that way.    They are saying....grab my free books! O_o    Please refresh your browser, it's up as free on my end and people are downloading it as a promo. If you still can't get it to work let ke know in a PM and I will email you a PDF.   Yep, we are going for another rip off. Thank you to everyone that grabbed my work last time, you helped me reach #1 and #2 spots on Amazons free sections last time.  If you already grabbed any of my work, thank you again, and nice to see you back! Perhaps you could take a minute to share this link with another site or two. Maybe a cross post? Or a FB share?   Asking too much? Probably...but sometimes it doesn't hurt to ask!   Either way. Thank you again for the downloads and I hope you enjoy my story!       I haven't read the last one yet, the first were so dark, but good...how is it without too many spoilers please?   Bitch...   You are very welcome. Glad to be here for you. Just remember, a 40+ year olds advice. The shit that seems so terrible today won't even be a memory 20 years from now. Get out and try something new.  You say hi to someone and they blow you off? You are already better off because they aren't worth it if they don't even know how to be nice to a stranger.  Life is short enough, no point wasting it on the small stuff.  You need me, let me know, usually on reddit at least once a day.   Don't have to be in a band to be a drummer!  I don't know how many people I have known that just play an instrument to play it.

Step out of your comfort zone once in a while, and don't be afraid to fail. Actually, some of the best times I have had are when I was epically failing at something.  In the end the sun will come up in the east and go down in the west and you will have another chance to try something else. Even if you aren't any good at it.   Depends on your hobbies? What do you do that makes you happy?  Confidence? Well, that comes with time. I am almost 41 and some days I still don't have it. Other days I do.  It has a lot to do with your own perception of yourself.  I have had people tell me that they are terrified of me, only because of how I look. I don't think of myself as terrifying but that's just a perception others have. People that really know me know how kind hearted I can be.   You are working for money now to improve your life. I don't know how old you are but I am guessing still under 20. You are just starting out. When you get into that new job you will meet new people, make new friends and form new relationships. Life is just starting to get interesting, and you are in control of your future. Make it a good one and I would be happy to live vicariously through you.    The floor is so clean you can eat off of it!    English would be a touch more helpful, but I got the idea.   The Event by Jamie Heppner, scifi fantasy with a post apocalyptic twist on the norm. It will evoke some emotions for sure.   The Event - by Jamie Heppner. Entire book written with that as the underlying theme.   I have something for you to read. You should be able to read it without word. Need that email address when you are ready.    You need a home copy of word...seriously. Set it up to save to dropbox if you are worried. But things will go better for you with word.    Okay I am starting with word for now. You might not see anything until you get back to work, but I will leave comments inside the file. If you wish, you can hit me with your email addy. I should have something for you to look at in the first couple pages.    Do you write with Word? If I send you a file that has track changes enabled would you be able to see it?   	110

For some reason I didn't think his response was "pretty much explaining it" and thought the question made sense. When I think "unpopular opinion" I think of an opinion that most people may not agree with but can understand why somebody may think that way (e.g. Communism works). When I think "fringe opinion" I think of an opinion that would make most people respond with something along the lines of "are you fucking serious?" (e.g. President Obama is actually a space alien). I was trying to ask where to draw the line between something that is not widely agreed with and something that is considered ridiculious.  Edit: I think I just answered my own question. If an opinion would make the overwhelming majority of people say you were nuts or doesn't make sense, or is extreme it is "lunatic fringe", but if a good number of sane people would agree with it and make positive arguments in favor, but not the majority, it is simply unpopular/fringe.

My grandfather didn't like sunroofs either and waited extra time to order a Volvo without one.      That looks so painful   It made me laugh.         Did you pick this up at at the Serbian grocery store?   This really isn't a FWI type question.         belongs on /r/imgoingtohellforthis         Those look like W210 seats.   I understand that I might the flamed because you may assume that since this post is about Justin Bieber it must be a troll, but that is not the case. If you look at the recklessness, idiocy, and entitlement that Bieber has exhibited and the paths that many has been celebrities go down, I wouldn't be surprised. On top of that it is relatively rare for a teen idol pop star to have fame that lasts for decades to come.   Think about MC Hammer, another pop star who became rich and famous while still young and went into multi million dollar debt after splurging on mansions, cars, and other luxuries a few years after his peak, or Lenny Dykstra, the arrogant Major League Baseball player who formed a series of unsuccessful businesses after his retirement and resorted to credit card fraud, car theft, and stealing his seized possessions after going bankrupt. Has been celebrities, expensive lifestyles, and entitlement are not a good combination.   You're probably right unless he does some other stupid shit shortly after and goes back to prison. It will be 23 years since the murder and car chase, 20 years since the murder trial, so many if not most people will either not care or be too young to remember what happened.   Any details about this?      1980 Mercedes 300D. Was for sale right around the corner from my house. They said it was too old (this was last year), rusty, and expensive to maintain.   I wouldn't be that upset, they haven't aged well IMO.               Dahmer's Dinner   /r/creepy has been becoming /r/gawkatpeoplewithdisabilities lately.   Maybe the wheel was stolen.

Sales of non sport/luxury 2-door coupes really plummetted in the 80's because of this.         1974-79 Buick Skylark. Similar to the Chevy Nova, Pontiac Ventura, and Oldsmobile Omega.   You just linked to the Lincoln, Nebraska sub.   I could actually see this car being drift missile material.      An 80s Lincoln Town Car or Mark VI is a step above the Grand Marquis.

I looked it up and Wikipedia did say that the 1.0 Yaris has 70 hp, but according to some of the answers to a question I asked on this sub once, many Germans are able to make it onto the Autobahn in low hp vehicles.  http://www.reddit.com/r/cars/comments/2rnivz/are_many_cars_unable_to_be_driven_on_the_autobahn/cnhjawt   Their White population has been in decline for years, but I guess "nonexistent by 2050" is probably too much of an exaggeration. According to [this article]( http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/number-of-whites-in-steady-decline-1.1223994#.VWuSoP3JDcs), it is predicted to be 20% lower than in 2010 by 2040. However, unless there is a big economic boom and South Africa becomes developed like a European country, I don't see how the number of Whites over there can do anything other than decline.      Geo Metro, 85-00 Corollas, Buick Century, Ford Escort   Racism (either their own or directed towards them), crime, unemployment, and poverty will make all the Whites leave by then.   Edit: This would probably apply to most other African nations with a sizeable White population as well.   A repeat of Pussy Riot may happen, but that's about it.   Probably not in our lifetimes. Germany still feels incredibly guilty for the Holocaust.   and salt water vs. fresh water makes a big difference. On some car forum I remember once reading a thread about a guy who unwittingly bought a Katrina Corvette, but lucked out because it turned out that it had actually come from an unaffected area of New Orelans where the previous owner flooded it with a garden hose to scam money out of the insurance company.      Mitsubishi Mirage, Mercedes-Benz GLA   A few questions about this happening that I can think of,  1. Will this change the "face" of Islamic terrorism?  2. How will this effect the spread of ISIS influence to the rest of Europe?  3. Could ISIS cause another war in the Balkans?

Looks like psychotic Hillary Clinton and a talking movie dog.   On another site, it said that when the victim's body was prepared for burial, his face was reattached.      I don't think this was done by Baumeister, though it has been incorrectly attributed to him online. Baumeister was a gay serial killer who picked male victims up at bars, he never murdered his father.

A practical one that actually functions in all situations and environments and won't get hacked or glitch up is very distant if it will ever come.   Looks like it has drag queen makeup on.   There's a few articles I saw, but they are all in German.         Put it in someone's bed while they are asleep.            http://farm2.staticflickr.com/1094/1223146475_b77e584f97_z.jpg?zz=1   I would consider his view to be valid in Europe.   This type of car is becoming less common and seems to still lag behind older models and European counterparts in terms of collectibility. They are overlooked as an attainable way to enter the classic car hobby.   [600](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/85/1984_Dodge_600_ES_Turbo.jpg)   I just realized that there is a GMC Sierra and a Ford Sierra. One is a large American pickup truck, the other was a European family sedan and hatchback.      Where's the performance-luxury fighter? (that approach worked pretty well for Cadillac).  There was the 300 SRT8 up until last year.   The name and look is like something designed by Rockstar Games.   Are you the Jeep driver's defense attorney?   They were in the 70s and 80s.   [This is the first thing I thought of,](http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2015/2267447154_ebf4cd2633_z.jpg?zz=1) it's at the Hard Rock Caf in Orlando.   There isn't anything I can think of that makes them exceptionally terrible cars, but their sales seem to lag far behind Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, and Lexus.  Edit: Maybe its the current lack of a compact to compete with the 3 Series, C-Class, A4, and IS.   GMC, they're mostly just redundant rebadged Chevys at this point. Kind of like Mercury during its last few years.   The new Continental concept, with its limousine like back seat and Bentley inspired styling looks like it might be promising.   L.A. 92' x 10      On reddit, on another site, or in person? If so, why?      Also, many POS cars tend to look better than they actually are in pictures. I know that there were factory authorized conversions and assumed this was one without really looking too closely.      I never did this, but I see other drivers do it all the time in my area, though I have always thought it would be illegal. It usually happens on main roads going through town where they will basically use the shoulder as if it is a turning lane to get around straight moving traffic that is stopped.   Why do half of the cars on this sub look like they are early 2000s timewarps?   I actually think this is a pretty well done conversion, though I wouldn't choose it if I were in the market for a G-body.      He's not high, he's just a tinfoil hatter. Look further at some of his other posts and you'll see.   Which I guess means it will drop in value significantly after being discontinued and then be beat to hell or dilapidated by a new group of owners who buy it because it will be a late model car available in large numbers for cheap which can be financed with no credit.   I decided to ask one question for all four since they are all in the Balkans and thought that asking individually would be cumbersome.  Edit: Forgot to include Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo.   or they've been stolen.   Like the Golf GTD or M550d.   I don't see too many Golfs from before the mid 2000s anymore, so that might be a good predictor for newer cars. Same with Jettas, but interestingly, B5 Passats seem to still be holding up.   Even if gas prices stay low?   Pretty much all the late 70s-80s large American cars (e.g. Chevy Caprice, Ford LTD, Dodge Diplomat) were still common 5-10 years ago depending on where you went, but now they are becoming a rare sight.      Up until about five years ago, Lexus LS400s were still all over the place around here. Now I don't see them that often.   I was kind of thinking that since Castro's death will most likely coincide with the current thawing of U.S.-Cuba relations, it will mark a symbolic end of an era for Cuba.      A car that I once forgot existed.      Beginning your title with "vote up if" is violation of intergalactic law.

 I'm surprised the BBC allowed a Reddit screencap with that particular comment about Islam!         I think the difference is that she has already graduated and therefore the university cannot do much directly. It's the Student's Union that is being hateful by continuing to employ her.  I wonder if there are other options open to the University, if they can't discipline her directly and if the SU refuses to do the right thing then perhaps they could just ban her from campus?                  Here's an alternative report: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-32781942                           Yes. More good news from the recent election.  http://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/general-election-results-vince-cable-simon-hughes-and-lynne-featherstone-lose-on-bleak-night-for-lib-dems-in-london-10234357.html            Here's a fairly recent case they didn't prosecute: http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/woman-who-made-false-allegation-6661309   A huge amount of wasted police time and the false arrest of three men. They gave the false accuser a 90 fine!     GMP has never prosecuted a victim for making a false allegation'  If the allegations are clearly false then why are they described as a "victim". No rape happened so what exactly were they a "victim" of?   Here's a fairly recent case they didn't prosecute: http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/woman-who-made-false-allegation-6661309            They always outline the reason on the certificate so just click on the link to that.      Found this story via a Greater Manchester Police Twitter feed. They're the ones who refuse to prosecute false rape accusers and have never done so as stated here: https://web.archive.org/web/20150517211511/http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/15/behind-the-scenes-at-a-police-rape-team-bbc-documentary                     Go defend child sex abuse somewhere else.      What if there was a belief system involving cutting kids arms off, or ears?   Some openly oppose it, others just try to sabotage the legislation and come up with random esxcuses why it shouldn't happen. The best known case is opposition to hared parenting by the National Organization of Women in the US (one of the biggest feminist organisations in the world):  https://nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/20980-as-it-was-and-ever-shall-be-now-opposes-equal-rights-for-fathers  http://www.avoiceformen.com/mens-rights/opposing-shared-parenting-the-feminist-track-record/  The good news is that exposes of the track record of such groups has led to them purging the proof of their opposition to equal parenting rights from their websites, so they do at least seem to be becoming ashamed of that fact they openly opposed shared parenting   They already did ask him and he doesn't want it to happen. The court has ordered the surgery against his will.      Fine, so an adult can get circumcised if their family has a history of foreskin cancer (something that doesn't exist).  I still don't see why you want to mutilate and abuse kids so badly.   You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. There are at least four distinct types of FGM, some of which are more severe than MGM and others which re in fact less severe.   All forms of FGM are illegal, including the least severe ones. in fact even a ceremonial pin prick is against the law.    When on earth are healthy breasts removed? A breast reduction is performed to reduce back pain when the breasts are too large. They wouldn't be against removing a foreskin that is for some reason 20 times longer than it should be and it causing some sort of health problem as a result.    you ignored the multiple healthy body part procedures listed  All of which grow back when trimmed.   They support shared parenting, which is something strongly opposed by most feminist groups.  Their only other good policy with any sort of gender link is to fund STEM university students, which will benefit more males than females (though perhaps not for long if the education system continues on its current feminised path).       if parents have the choice to abort a fetus and completely deny the child the right to live their life, how is trimming a bit of penis skin off an issue?  So genital mutilation is ok becasue abortion is also allowed? Female fetuses get aborted too you know, presumably FGM is cool too? Also if we can abort fetuses then why not kill the baby when it's a week old too right?   He obviously meant any **healthy** body part. No one is opposed to removing diseased/damaged foreskins (or tumors etc)             I think I finally met a Tory politician I like.  Same here, though the problem is that he's very much a Tory rebel rather than the norm. I expect he'd be popular with the grass roots of the party, the problem is that those in charge are mostly nothing like him really.   The fact that they've got one really good MP doesn't really make the rest of them any less shitty and out of touch with reality (though it does help a little that he's got a position of at least some importance).  It's also noteworthy that Raab has barely mentioned gender issues in the 4 years that have passed since he made these comments. I guess the various attacks from Labour, the BBC and the left are quite effective at silencing people from speaking uncomfortable truths.      Lost of disgusting comments here making fun of child abuse or mocking normal male anatomy.  On the plus side people are upvoting the story and so at least most people support the protests.                  It was more of a rebuttal of her comments and her myopic assesment of world history.   There's actually a long history of Africans invading small English and Irish coastal towns, abducting the population and taking them back home to use as slaves: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_slave_trade   More good news from the General Election, seems like a genuinely great guy.      Didn't think this article was their best work, but I've actually noticed their London branch actually has some quite talented writers and thinkers.  There's been a very noticeable decline in the quality of newspapers here, the latest example being the Telegraph which haemorrhaged almost every single one of its best writers over the last few years. It has gone from perhaps the best UK newspaper as recently as 2008-10 to an average publication today. Therefore new developments such as the launch of Breitbart London are extremely welcome.   That's becasue people like this either end up in politics or obtain influential positions in the media. The progression of idiots from senior National Union of Student' positions to roles within the UK Labour Party is basically automatic these days.   I hope you mean the Youtube OP and not me. I'm completely against sexism against both men and women and would never deny that either could exist.      Some news coverage of her statement: http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/goldsmiths-university-diversity-officer-in-racism-row-i-cant-be-racist-because-im-an-ethnic-minority-woman-10243202.html         Someone has tagged this as **"Old story, 1st reported weeks ago".**  It's true that the original racist/sexist incident was weeks ago, but this is a new report, which outlines her response to the allegations of racism and sexism. I.e. it is a brand new development, with a number of different outlets all picking it up today.  **Please remove this misleading flair**. Thanks.     It will still be better than her speech though.      There are rare cases of politicians campaigning to help men and fix men's issues. Can't think of any off the top of my head in the US, though I expect people at NCFM or the National Parents Organization would know a few.  Of course, most areas will have zero pro men's human rights candidates, though it's still worth doing your research. Furthermore, if there's a misandrist feminist standing in your area (or perhaps a pro-MGM religious nutjob) then please just go out and vote for any of their opponents.   What the page used to look like: https://archive.is/KiTjt  original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/31ragv/this_uk_gym_charges_men_60_more_than_women_for/  Second thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/336i7g/update_peak_fitness_gym_statement_on_their/                                     So the BBC finally let Ray on air, though only 24 hours before the polls opened!  I expect this broadcast wouldn't have happened at all were it not for everyone's complaints and the significant interest in BBC Nottingham's bias.      Not sure if there's a men's rights angle to this yet or not, though Twitter is known to partner with radical feminists to censor content so I'd expect there is. Most filters tend to disadvantage the freedom of speech of men's human rights advocates, so even if the radical feminists haven't been involved I'd still expect there to be issues for us to deal with here.      Labour still beats the Lib Dems hand down when it comes to misandry.  Two of their equality ministers (harman and Hewitt) were found guilty of sexism against men, with one also given repeated official warnings from the statistics authority for lying about the gender pay gay.  I'd say the misandry of Labour's Vera Baird alone matches everything the Lib Dems have.   Jo Swinson got booted out too, she's someone who thought men should pay more for insurance for being men.      She has a long history of feminist anti-male sexism. Easily the highlight of the election results. More on here MGM comments: http://equality4men.com/2013/09/18/featherstone-proves-she-is-uks-most-sexist-against-men-mp-with-crass-comments-about-boys-willies/      An agenda to ensure doctors don't harm patients? That's certainly true, I don't deny that, I'm fully against the mutilation of kids but I have plenty of other medicine related interests too. I would hope most here have the same opposition to doctors harming kids, though given only 44% upvoted this post then perhaps not...      I have a variety of interests and expertise relating to medicine. Areas include cancer, genital mutilation, mental health.  Apologies if I've posted too much on any one of these and not enough on others of late, but I don't have any agenda relating to any one topic and this particular link is clearly of huge value to this community.      I wonder is the "Survivors Manchester" organisation is actually trying to get this problem fixed? I couldn't see anything on the website about the need to sort out the definition of rape (though I only read through a few pages).      Actually that's **exactly** how it works: http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/07.20/10-deathquiz.html   If a woman reaches the age of 70 then they've got a decent chance of making it past 82. I'll admit I did forget that female life expectancy was as low as 82 there, in other countries it tends to be nearer 84 for women.   She'll be 70 if she serves her whole sentence (and I bet that doesn't happen anyway). Even if she get released as late as aged 70, well that's not especially old these days, particularly if you're a woman.   Wouldn't a life sentence have been more appropriate?   In legal matters there's a commonly used Latin expression which is as follows: **"Expressio Unius Est Exclusio Alterius"**. This translates to "The expression of one thing is the exclusion of another."  Such an expression might not be of much relevance were there numerous parties ignored by De Piero, or if there was another excuse or it it was sheer forgetfulness (for example if Mike hadn't showed p to the count or if she didn't know his name/party). However, Mike went out of his way to target De Piero and highlight her misandry and it's pretty obviously she's deliberately chosen the words she used. Even if she was so bitter an childish that she had decided against acknowledging him specifically she could have said " Helen, or Philip, or Simon and others" then that would have been ok. This didn't happen and therefore it's more than reasonable to assume she's against helping anyone who voted for J4MB unless she says otherwise.            Is he stupid enough to think that gay men and lesbian women are all just one big borg?  The author is actually also 100% homosexual himself.      The photobomber is campaigning for the rights of fathers and their children.   Mike has clearly made an impact if she's not only shunning him but also anyone who dared to vote for him. She actually has a legal obligation to work on behalf of everyone who lives in the constituency.      Interesting that Mike's opponent appears to be refusing to represent any constituents who voted for Justice for Men and Boys! He's certainty made an impact there for her to have shunned the party's voters in such a way.   That's a third party listing which happens to use Amazon's site. I was talking about products actually sold/stocked and hence endorsed by Amazon.  There's a big difference between some random person putting something up for sale on Amazon and the company itself actually choosing to sell it.   Under UK law "Rape" can only be committed by men. I'd assume the police are using the same sexist and exclusionary definition and therefore this campaign is focusing on the minority of males raped by other men.   The problem is the double standard. All the content the feminists find particularly objectionable has already been removed from sale. So we're now in a situation where Amazon will only sell material inciting gender based violence if the victims are male.      Amazon is one of the few remaining retailers that insists on selling the "Boys are stupid, throw rocks at them" books      Please sent tweets to @BBCNottingham  Complaints to david.holdsworth@bbc.co.uk                  The BBC has a legal obligation to be 100% impartial becasue of the way it is funded. If other organisations act as badly as the BBC, then it's still actually a far less serious issue becasue of the differing legal obligations.   Mike's a better writer than he is a broadcaster. His colleague Ray Barry is the best at handling tv/radio though of course the BBC have refused to let him on air in the last couple of months.   So, would you care to show us a recent BBC broadcast showing J4MB interacting with someone who isn't female?  People forget just how powerful the BBC are, they have 70% share of UK tv news.   Exactly, even some in the men's rights community don't even support Buchanan. This story is about one of the most blatant breaches of the BBC Charter imaginable. It's about journalism, not any political party.   This is clearly related to journalism ethics and the BBC clearly has an agenda. Just yesterday the published the most incredibly biased article about Joss Whedon: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32591260   As requested I'm resubmitting this with a better title to illustrate exactly what's happened and what the new developments are in this story.  Apologies for not choosing a better title first time.  Can we put some pressure on the BBC management to investigate this?            Perhaps I should resubmit with a better title?   No it's far worse than that. Remeber, the questions were mostly about helping women.  Therefore in your analogy, every discussion would involve the right-wing candidate being forced to discuss how best to further the policies and goals of the left.  The BBC rigged not just the audience, but the questions too!   The development to previous posts about this story is that the BBC have admitted to imposing the all-female audience on J4MB entirely deliberately.       fair treatment is making sure that you only get asked on your specialist topics in front of your preferred audience?  No, that's the problem becasue it's exactly what happened to the Labour candidate isn't it?    Yes, how dare the BBC not give proper time to a fringe party that will not get any seats.  Did you even read the article. They've already given a load of praise to a fringe party that isn't' even standing yet.  Furthermore, it's not really about airtime at all, but fair treatment. Had the BBC given 10 times a more coverage to J4MB than they did but continuing with the same spin and bias then everyone would have exactly the same concerns.   Complaints should go to head David Holdsworth, BBC Controller, English Regions **email david.holdsworth@bbc.co.uk**  alternatively you can make a formal complaint here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/complain-online/  Tweets should be sent to **@BBCNottingham**   There's a key update in this article to what we knew previously. The BBC have now admitted that the whole thing was 100% deliberate!  Complaints should go to head David Holdsworth, BBC Controller, English Regions **email david.holdsworth@bbc.co.uk**  Alternatively you can make a formal complaint here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/complain-online/  Tweets should be sent to **@BBCNottingham**  perhaps someone can come up with an appropriate hashtag?                           WNBA teams are usually owned by their NBA counterparts.         It was probably true 60 years ago.         It barely gets any attention from anyone, but the only significant discrimination I can think of is the lack of HPV vaccine for boys.  It's far from exclusively an LGBT issue of course, and almost all aspect of men's health are underlooked/ignored by most politicians. However, of the 2,000 male lives every year, gay/bi men would be massively over represented.  Shame we don't see the LGBT lobby up really focus on this instead of the insignificant issues that do get attention.   That's Sandi Toksvig, author of "girls are best".   All the abusive comments listed with any sort of gendered angle are directed at men, yet somehow even her opponent spins it as sexism again women. Wouldn't vote for either of them if I lived there.   So, Toksvig is an "equality" campaigner yet somehow also the author of a book titled "girls are best".   So Sandi Toksvig is going to lead an "equality party" whilst also being the author of the book "Girls are best".   Is this the same Sandi Toksvig campaigning for "equality" who also authored a book titled "Girls are best"?    Politicians won't support the MRM, but they will look at specific issues (especially if they're cheap to back).  Almost all men's issues are cheap to back or even have a significant gain for taxpayers. The government clearly hates men, otherwise they'd have implemented the cost saving ones ages ago just to save cash.  * Getting rid of MGM (actually makes money for the NHS in cost savings) * Fixing family courts (basically free and saves money in legal costs) * Shared parenting (free, though loses the CSA their cut of child support)   SNP are worse than the Lib Dems for sexism against men, I'd bet there are 3 or 4 Lib Dems in the country who are well worth voting for, but zero for the SNP.   Remember, **you can get rid of your tv licence and still legally watch BBC iPlayer**. A lot of people don't know about this loophole. The licence fee only covers live broadcasts.   Yes, shame they can't be more neutral. Most of their policies are neither left nor right-wing in nature really so it seems a shame for them to describe themselves in such a way.   J4MB are standing in two constituencies (was originally three) and plan to contest 50 next time around. The other candidate wasn't invited to his own hustings debate, therefore making this far worse than you suggest.  Also, I don't see why boys get their genitals mutilated without their consent (and at taxpayer expense) whilst females get protected by law. That's probably the party's strongest policy and it gets huge support.   Ray's your candidate, not Mike. Try watching some videos of him instead (even Mike admits that ray's the better speaker of the two).  Ray has been a regular on the tv show "The Big Questions" every so often.   Good point, though most of the MPs in that area would be SJW sympathisers too.  Also, if enough people email multiple staff the BBC, then we can win. Not everyone there is a complete asshole (and even some that are do realise when the organisation has gone much too far).   Ray Barry wasn't allowed to attend the BBC Broxtowe hustings. A shame really, he comes across as very knowledgeable and above all else really compassionate.  Are you saying you'd like to have a chat with him or meet him to get to know more about the party? Or have they already got your vote?    Why did they do that? I don't understand what this is supposed to accomplish.  They obviously don't like the party so decided to do everything within their powers to intimidate its members and sabotage their election campaign? The BBC is well know for it's left-wing SJW bias, though this particular example is particularly blatant even by their standards.    Good point, though I thought they counted each women as half a man?   A few questions I asked in my complaint:  1. What is your organisation's justification for banning men (and the discussion of their issues) from only UK hustings on the BBC to feature the political party in the western world representing the human rights of men and boys? Do you at least now accept it was clearly a mistake to do so?  2. Why couldn't a non J4MB seat be chosen instead?  3. Which member(s) of staff were responsible for imposing this gender based discrimination at such an historic event?  4. Why was Ray Barry not invited to his own hustings? Who was responsible for failing to send out his invites? Was this bias a deliberate act or supposedly a mistake?  5. When can we expect to see a men-only hustings discussing men's issues on BBC Nottingham prior to the 2015 General Election in order to ensure fairness and gender balance in your output?  6. When will Ray Barry get his chance to appeal to voters on BBC Radio Nottingham before the election?  7. How many members of staff at BBC Nottingham have a gender-feminist political outlook and are therefore naturally hostile towards the human rights of men and boys and/or J4M B? Did any of the individuals who are hostile or dismissive of J4MB have any role in this scandal?  8. Why was the very existence of J4M B portrayed as a problem on the Midlands Daily Politics broadcast? Why was Ray Barry yet again airbrushed out of existence?  9. When will we finally see the party engaging on-air with its supporters or at least the very many supporters of its ideas?  10. You all follow various political parties and local political personalities on Twitter, yet not a single one of you follow someone as high profile as Mike Buchanan. How do you expect to keep your listeners informed of stories relating to local politics if you're all blatantly ignoring one the the area's most significant political figures, someone who attracts global interest?  11. Have you apologised to Mike and Ray for the horrendous mistreatment of them and their party by BBC Radio Nottingham? If not when are you going to apologise? (I'd suggest doing so publicly, on air and BEFORE the election, not afterwards).  12. When are you also going to apologise to your male listeners for denying them a voice?     There are 649 other constituencies where the BBC will also have held hustings debates. I can't find a single other case of a single sex audience at at on of them.   OK, fair enough.   It doesn't matter what their political position is, the BBC have clearly attempted to sabotage their election prospects.  Secondly, ignoring the slight Conservative bias, the fact is that 75% of the manifesto is mostly spot on and covers hugely important equality issues that get sept under the carpet. Furthermore, if there's specific media and entertainment industry ethics issues you'd want them to cover, or any mistakes you've spotted, then drop them a line in a couple of weeks. They do tend to be quite receptive to feedback.   Done      That's a kind offer, the thirst for activism and gettings things done on this subreddit is really admirable. Some email addresses:  * sarah.julian@bbc.co.uk (the presenter) * pete.saull@bbc.co.uk (the other guy helping out) * mike.bettison@bbc.co.uk (BBC Nottingham editor) * philip.chapman@bbc.co.uk (BBC Nottingham editor) * David.Holdsworth@bbc.co.uk (in charge of all local radio)     Plenty of other media ethics posts here of late.   Note that they also rigged most of the questions so they were about women's issues, therefore preventing J4MB from discussing its manifesto.  They also held a second (mixed gender) debate in the constituency of the second J4MB candidate, though they didn't actually bother to invite him to take part! (and he's their best speaker)  **Therefore the BBC has completely banned men in from any interaction whatsoever with the only men's party in the UK.**  The BBC is funded by a compulsory licence fee, and as a result is duty-bound to be impartial. What they have done breaks countless BBC editorial guidelines and it's blatantly obvious that they have directly interfered in the apolitical process and attempted to sabotage the campaign of a party who's views they disagree with.  Some email addresses for complaints      sarah.julian@bbc.co.uk (the presenter)     pete.saull@bbc.co.uk (the other guy helping out)     mike.bettison@bbc.co.uk (BBC Nottingham editor)     philip.chapman@bbc.co.uk (BBC Nottingham editor)     David.Holdsworth@bbc.co.uk (in charge of all local radio)  You can also make a formal complaints here: http://www.bbc.co.uk/complaints/complain-online/  Tweets can be sent to @BBCNottingham  (the info you will need to fill in is that the broadcast was at 6pm on 23 April on BBC Radio Nottingham)   Update: full breakdown of events prior to broadcast from J4MB:  https://j4mb.wordpress.com/2015/04/22/bbc-radio-nottingham-anti-male-bias/   You can listen to the full "debate" here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKjIpu30_AE         What a farcical article. To think that the Indy wasted time in this rubbish yet still hasn't written a single word about the lib dem "kill all men" Twitter scandal.   A voice for men isn't on the list of banned sites. Therefore please reinstate the post. Thanks.   Note that they also rigged most of the questions so they were about women's issues, therefore preventing J4MB from discussing its manifesto.  They also held a second (mixed gender) debate in the constituency of the second J4MB candidate, though they didn't actually bother to invite him to take part!  **Therefore the BBC has completely banned men in from any interaction whatsoever with the only men's party in the UK.**                Why are you linking it in here?  Apologies for posting Maine related news to r/maine  I'm sure you have countless better sources for this hugely significant story. No doubt they all go into far more detail than Elam's article and beat him to breaking the story. I'll happily delete this post when you post them...             Don't forget to vote in their poll, Mike is currently on 14%.  	199
 buy them on iTunes like I had to :P    So glad i'm not the only one who thought this! As soon as I saw the two initial combatants I was like ofuck two-handed greatsword vs broadsword and buckler... obviously the guy with the buckler is just gonna parry riposte that big dudes ass. Forgot how real life plays out..    I don't mind the ones who do it for fun but I work at a gamestore and some people definitely take their opinions on gaming too seriously haha. Like they're BFFs with Miyazaki or something.     don't they kno NDS OUTSELLS all those CPU peasants everytiem?!   Mann all this is making me want to give pvp a go!    Is this the estate where all the orgies are at?    weakness: pyromancy    How the fuck... Do you not spread the lube in your palms first before slathering your dick in it?    Of course its my city, where nothing interesting ever happens. Damn midwest.    thanks!    Dank Souls is my favourite video ever    Where'd all the footage of the guy wearing the Faraam set come from? Was that included in the original version of the game or just promo material? I'm late to the party and only have SotFS    I was thinking the Loyce Knights    I solo'd Sinh fairly easily and I was stuck on Fume knight forever until I got help so i'm fairly confident you got this    Shitty nightmare man. I once had one too where I was in a catacomb-esque closed off arena fighting a giant version of my own character. I was unarmed and he had full havel and a great sword, swung it down on me and that's when I woke up.    Different strokes :) That sounds pleasant too. And don't worry haha we have a special, lower table for drinks.     idk, my mates and I make a time of it. Takeout, drinks, loud music, tons of weed.. Basically a party with computers and gaming. Playing from the comfort and solitude of home is nice too though.     Is a tv a monitor? Not even trolling just curious if any display = a monitor to some people   people with friends   WOAh ACTING    Lol when Jared's like "I love The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo." Not going to lie I thought she gave off that vibe too. It's great.    Pretty hard choice... character game is strong with this one. I love Gilfoyle, Dinesh and Jared all for different reasons though. Gilfoyle is the relatable one, Dinesh is just pure comedic gold and as a huge Office fan I can't get enough of OJ either.    Na, i'm gonna keep watching. It was a meh episode except for a few laugh out loud parts but i'd be lying if I said I didn't still want to see where it's going.   As for reality.. I mean I know some of the hardcore nerds out there would love to see a tech show 100% based in reality but come on guys. It's not like only programmers and hackers watch this shit. That would be fucking boring to like 95% of the audience.    Same. The whole invisible man treatment with Erlich always cracks me up    Every time.    I laughed during the show and then came on to this sub and decided I needed to be angry about it because it broke consistency haha    lol yea I hear Ivory Crown is an even bigger pain in the ass. Not looking forward to the lightning unicorns.    "Just bring me some cool ranch doritos and chicken nuggets" NO DON'T OPEN THE DOOR MAM JUST LEAVE THEM OUTSIDE    Thank you to NonYaBeznez on 360! I was stuck on the Fume Knight for nearly a week. I literally bought gold just to get help with the fight. Yesterday I managed to summon someone but we both kept dying to him anyway. Today this dude pops up and absolutely carries me away to victory. I maybe took out a third of the health myself. Thank you again friend! Now on to the frozen wastelands...    It took me way too long to remember where the titanite demon is in Anor Londo. Blocked memory I guess. Those 1 hit downward jump stabs...:(     Second one is true Solaire.. the other was casul    Oh yeah I think you're right... Oh well that's her problem, I never had beef. I usually save ladyboy for the end of the playthrough anyway.    Yeah for DaS1 at least in the earlier playthroughs, you could get a LOT accomplished via suicide runs. Like killing pinwheel before gargoyles kind of shortcuts. DaS2 suicide runs to flip a switch or grab an item are still viable but the whole health loss thing is a bit more of a deterrent.    First 6~ playthroughs I almost exclusively used two handed greatswords. Last playthrough I went through with a baller side sword... like a totally different game.    I never ever kill any of the Firekeepers anymore and I always use the Dark Seance ring to get to Gwyndolin instead of killing Gwynevere. Only people I kill are Vamos for the helmet and of course that fuck Lautrec where he sits in his cell.    Same. And the spooky skellies definitely reminded me of the catacombs!    FUCK ZE FUME KNIGHT    I thought resins were the only way to buff melee    Aitor. edit: And always a knight.     I've been through Dark Souls about 7 times now on the same character, love the world and the PvE experience to death but now i'm starting to get bored and want to try my hand at PvP. Only problem is i'm on an outdated system and it's also a bit of a financial commitment since this is the only game I play on console these days.   So my question to those with 360's is: Is there still an active PvP community for Dark Souls?  Also, i'm neearly done DaS2, just stuck on the Fume Knight. I assume since this game is newer there's still a fair amount of people playing it, is this a fair assumption? I'll try out pvp on both of them if I get live, but from what I've heard from friends the original Dark Souls pvp experience is the way to go.  Any input would be appreciated!   Man I've played though like 7 times on a pure melee character because ranged spell casting has never been my thing...only recently realized after seeing a youtube video that some spells actually just buff your melee weapon.. now I kind of want to start a new character just to experience sunlight blade haha    Don't get too cocky around Pinwheel. I once lost like ~500k souls because I forgot to retrieve them in the bonewheel area and died to a surprisingly nimble pinwheel one playthrough.    My first playthough I thought they were an item you had to pick up more of as you went along (no idea they refilled at bonfires), so I managed to keep my original 5 until like the Taurus Demon, wondered why it was so fucking hard..    Only point I ever use a shield in DaS1 is for the fight with Sif. Otherwise two-hand for dayz    I've never pvp'd but i've gone through to NG+7 with full giant armour, waay too much strength and two-handed GLS/BKS/Zwei. Pure melee, All about dem tanks and swings. Just don't forget to equip the mega weed ring!     Solid advice, just one of those boss fights that takes patience I guess!    I do roll a lot and two hand my weapon though! I just always fuck up once he's got his flame sword buff and usually die to him around 1/4-1/5th hp haha :(. I just need to git gud.    Absolutely :) It's like the bass massaging every part of you at once!    Thanks man i'll definitely look into those books, the "flow" effect is something that very much intrigues me.    Agreed!    said the same thing yesterday when I got out haha    But I don't mind.    I agree.    You are right.    Wow I never knew this was a thing, thanks for the heads up I hated getting through this place enough as it was! Love Veldstadt though. Fave boss!   That's crazy! On a side note I hate this boss so very much. So many tries and still I can't beat the fucker :(    I tried explaining this to some of my mates who aren't into techno and they just sort of stared and laughed. It doesn't really happen with groovier and more percussion based tech housey stuff (which I still love), but a lot of the time when I'm listening to deep, textured rolling techno like Abdulla Rashim, Deepbass, Ness, Polar Inertia, etc I literally just kind of drift off into this weird meditation-like limbo where my mind is completely void of thoughts and the only signals i'm receiving are the shifts in the music and the physical sensations of the bass hitting me. During this time I can usually drift off to sleep in an instant regardless of the volume of the music, and basically everything else melts away until the mix ends or the vibe is somehow broken.  Do you know what I mean?    First off just let me say that I love Adam Beyer as a DJ and I listen to his radio show every week. He throws a great party and his mixes are legendary. However, as a label, he and his fellow artists' releases are just very predictable and similar. Sure I love the Drumcode sound, but it's definitely a formula they rarely deviate from whereas other labels are constantly trying to evolve their sound. Plus like someone else said, time and a place. People on this sub want the gems and rare tracks, not something they can easily find on a top 100 list on Beatport.    New macbook background! :) Love how you managed to combine futuristic and traditional architectural elements instead of just giving everything the Starwars treatment! Comes across as more organic.    Damn son nice one!    Eccentric setup in a good way! Love the triple vertical setup and the variety of boards. Do you watch anything with those monitors configured that way or do you have a tv for that?   Alright never caught the bit about the ocean being dried up, makes a lot of sense then!    First off let me say that I absolutely loved the movie! I got dragged along to see it not expecting much but I was quite pleasantly surprised both by the quality of the actual action/stunts as well as the intriguing setting and lore. Also loved that we had no lame romantic subplot shoved down our throats. It certainly turned me onto the franchise in general, I'm definitely going to have to go back and watch the others now.  However, I do have one question that's been gnawing at me. At one point in the movie they reach the edge of the Citadel's wasteland and say something along the lines of "we have enough supplies for 160 days of riding" yet it's still implied that they wouldn't reach their destination if they attempted to go that way. If the events of Fury Road are set in Australia, then wouldn't it only take like ~30 days max to cross the entire country by vehicle? Or did they just say 16 days and I misheard them? 160 days does seem awful long...    Haha wow that's a pretty lame reason to ban someone... probably some vegan, needs more chicken in their diet. GET HYPE!    	64
 Totally agree! Lol i would rather not have tambourine over a crappy tambourine.   A pastor that can preach the message about the shrewd manager.  I havent ever heard a pastor that preached on this.   Costa Rica  Its basically a country where the land is beautiful, people are beautiful and nice, and just so damn peaceful.   Def a place to visit at least once in your life.   As men we have way bigger egos then ladies do. We might be the nicest guys in the village but if a woman disrespects us a good number of times then we will either go Godzilla on them or wimper away into a shell in the darkest cave in sight. Neither of which are good.   This should be at the top   Whatsup, im 90% lazy   Unless the persons a total introvert and overthinks stuff. Like me but still trustable tho.   I think they give loaners based on how long it would take them to service your car. Few hours of service means you sit your butt down and grab a free coffee. Otherwise, grab a loaner most likely the same as the one you're driving! Unless they think you'll move one up.   They're probably like crap what do we give a guy that already has the best!   You're lucky theres an Audi in the picture. Else we would totally hate you! - Someone from the northeast   Totally agree with you. I feel happy when i do cry because finally i feel somewhat normal again.    Did you get to learn how to fly a plane?   Gonna go on a limb and say you work for Boeing. If true, you should check out the Boeing 747 documentary on the History channel. It was very good.   Where does God say that? Not that I'm for homesexuality but I've never read the Bible say anything about demons being against it. Unless its another holy text. But still would like to know.   Ahh the ole Ad Hominem logical fallacy  I thought redditors were better than this.   Well the warranty company was giving them a hard time! And I felt like I shouldn't argue since after all im leasing a new car for free. But now I'm at a point where I just want my old car back or at least something new. lol.but at least they are replacing it with a new engine. cost was $13 grand and I paid about $4k for warranty so warranty paid off for sure.   So I have been borrowing an Audi for a while now from my local dealer. They're replacing my engine under Fidelitys warranty which means they're taking their sweet old time (about to be 5 months now)  I didnt care too much because a new engine is better plus I get to a drive around a nice loaner.  Anyway my current dilemma is that I bent one of the rims and have a flat in one of the tires. I can probably get away with plugging the flat tire so I dont have to buy them a new tire. But I wonder what I can do besides just telling the dealer that hey I bent your rim. I'm assuming if i tell the dealer they're either going to make me pay for the rim + tire + labor or contact my insurance (which Im assuming means a rate hike on my insurance). So whats the better option? Or do you think they won't care and just replace it on their own (wishful thinking i guess)?   I feel your pain!  They gave me a freakin galant at one of the dealers I went to. Needless to say that i never went there again!  My current and usual dealer usually hooks it up with a nice loaner like Q5, A6's. Best one yet would have to be A6 Supercharged. That car was something else. But never an S-series. I had no idea they loaned them out else I would've asked.   I had some fun loaners but never anything with an S! ahh I need to step my game up!   So there is a verse in the bible [1 Corinthians 7:9] which talks about not to burn with passion and if someone cant control themselves then they should get married.  I dont think these guys are at the stage where they cant really control themselves but I'm sure that the temptations are going to get stronger in the long term if proper boundaries are not set.   Thats why courting with intentions of marriage might be a good idea. Im not saying they should solely get married for sex but if they do love each other and are compatible then i dont see why not again assuming they are somewhat mature enough to make that step.    You dont but if they're still living in their parents home and are fairly young then getting "parental guidance" would be a wise idea.   Also im not suggesting marriage so he can start having kids. Im suggesting that if they are in love and with parental "guidance" they should get married if theyre at the right age rather than burn in passion and guilt.     No def not.  Only if they truly love each other and assuming they have parental approval.   I didnt see an age.  I'm not suggesting that they get married because they had oral sex. Im suggesting that these temptations are only going to escalate. So first create boundaries that will allow you to have some control over it. But if they're near an age where they can be married than why not. Of course under the approval of their parents since they might not be old enough to make a wise decision in this matter. If they're 17 then def no and my comment on seeking parents approval would have cleared that out of the way. However if theyre in their early 20s then maybe they can. (Im basing this off on avg marriage age of 27-28)   I'm going to have to side with you haven't lost your virginity yet.  Oral sex is not penetration. So you're still a virgin!  That said you obviously feel guilt so ask for forgiveness. And I would agree with an earlier post that starting right way create boundaries! Aka no alone time, etc.   That said, how old are you guys, would marriage be an option? Because sexual sin is going to get louder. And if you two really love each other than it might be wise to get married with your parents consent.   I brought maggi to school once. I can totally relate to that kid. :/   Curious to know. How did u turn out. Career wise that is?    Spike   AMC aren't live but they do have on-demand content.    So I'm looking at the S P and for that matter most stocks and everything is relatively going up.  We had two major crashes in recent years near the dot-com and the real-estate boom. Both were relatively priced at 1300-1500 S P. Currently the S P is at 2062.   Do you think we're due another crash?  I'll admit that I don't know jack about investing but as a skeptic the idea that the markets are continue to go up, up and up seems far-fetched.    AMC too.

Its just politics. Sit back down.   Is it ghee because chances are its ghee :)   Became an engineer but damn wish I was a doctor   You're right that we have lived in a bubble for the last 20 years.   The question still remains. How will guys deal with this? U dont have to answer it but its just a question. And maybe the answer really is just that guys just suck it up.   If some girl says to you that they are "rebellious" and that I have to accept it. I'm sorry but how is that in any way considered an "ok" thing.   Not so much an article but a post on India questioning the same thing.   http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2ujezs/np_women_in_india/   Even if you do make money you should treat others with respect.    Actually, her folks were middle class too. She however was a doctor who studied in russia. Couldnt pass the exams (fmge or mci -- whatever its called) for the past four years but had the arrogance that she was A doctor. I was ok with whatever crap was going to be thrown at me except for the arrogance. Not that I want a completely submissive wife or anything just you gotta have respect for each other. And if you're going to act arrogant than you should bring something to the table.   Think... alpha = dominant beta = passive, submissive, weak.   after visiting india recently I noticed that girls in India really are starting to act like jerks. this just continues to prove my point. lol. i actually wrote an article today you might enjoy or at least offer your opinion on.   **This post is going to come off as very arrogant. But I promise you that its meant in a good gesture.**  So i grew up in US for the past 20 years and before that I was born and lived for the 7 best years of my life in India. That said, few months back I went to India to "find a wife". I really didn't want to go but I went anyway for the sake of my parents.   Anyway, I pretty much grew up as a beta male. Was always taught to be the nice guy and suck it up. Partly because our culture, religion, and upbringing has formed me to be this way. And honestly I enjoy being this way.  However when I went to India I realized that alot of girls are alpha females. They're disrespectful, arrogant and self-centered, etc. But at the same time they were confident, self-assured, smart, etc. Now don't get me wrong not all girls were like that but many were.   I guess my question to you guys is : * How should the current generation of guys with our upbringing get used to this? (because in all honesty our culture hasn't prepped us for this) * What happened to Indian girls? (was it the competition, pressure, etc)     Trust me they're very nice people. And the scenery is beyond beautiful.     Theres gotta be a way that we can overcome teasing right?   lol something i would do   Costa Rica. Happiest country in the world.  	45
                                                    Showing support for what? We don't know why she was fired. You mean showing support for better communication by the admin to the mods?   You really ought to have included "per capita" in the title, OP. Unnecessary confusion.         The discussion of this over at /r/hiphopheads is disgusting, if anyone is interested in seeing white guys justify hateful language.      This doesn't make sense...      I love how the simplest comments can be so sexy.   This looks like an alien abduction.   "I've risen to convert your children to the gayness! MWAHAHAHAA"                                             He doesn't even know what he's talking about. The deal hasn't been revealed yet. People really have no idea how trade negotiations work or how to conduct them. You want a fair deal for your country? You want trade to help you (because you *do* need trade and it *can* be helpful)? You're going to need to get with the program and stop shooting yourself in the foot by exposing the negotiations to criticism in the womb.         I mean I would also argue that Jackson was a genocidal maniac toward Native Americans and Alexander Hamilton was, well, not as much.                  Your sources are half reputable and half laughable. RT (State-run Russian propaganda), breitbart (koo-koo crazy ultra-conservative webmagazine), random imgur links, random reddit comments?  If you're going to ring alarm bells about something, you need to do it with better sources. Be ironclad!     	53
 240Z with race cams and exhaust with all handling upgrades. You won't be disappointed.    Funny enough the first and only time I saw one was at the Oldsmobile nationals 3 or 4 years ago.    I've been looking into importing a Cappuccino, but it's so hard to find websites that are super sketchy. I guess I'll just have to wait until I can afford to fly to Japan and buy one.    I did, I was feeling pretty lazy.      I am almost positive that is an LM spoiler, and not aftermarket   Is that the Gas Monkey F40?   Will you marry old gregg I like you I want to marry you    I'm a huge fan of RWB, but their 964s just don't really speak to me as much as their 930s and 993s   Is there any way to change rim models on a car? I'm currently working on a Rauh Welt skin for the Yellowbird, and it just does not look right with the base rims. If I made a model for a new rim, is there any way that I can swap it out? More specifically, it really needs 3 piece rims.   I'm having that same exact problem as well, no matter what gear or rpm   Yeah, and I don't think that was a factory color either, but the owner could have changed it.    It doesn't look like it. The fenders don't look flared enough, but still a great looking car either way. Edit: just noticed there's a rear window wiper, I'm almost positive no GT2s had them    Should be in your inbox now, enjoy!   Well that just ruined my day, German shepards are my favorite breed    Hey everyone, I just got an email from Fanatec with the invite code. I'm not going to use it, so if any of you want it just let me know. It's US only.    Yaaaaaaaaaaas, I absolutely love these videos. I've been waiting for the 2014 one for a while.   3.1 was probably already wreaking havoc on itself with head gaskets    Really digging the color    Yes   That's really weird, I used to have that problem too but all I had to do was reinstall drivers and firmware and it worked fine. Best of luck though.   993 GT2   I just bought it and it's working fine. I don't know why there would be a problem in the first place.   I recently started playing Forza 4 again, and I was going to buy the Porsche DLC, but I was told by a friend that the DLC doesn't work anymore. I'm not exactly sure what he means, but I was curious to if any of guys have bought DLC lately and have had any problems.   'Straya ya bogan      I would love to see some chase footage, but I have no idea I'd any club would allow it    Love the winch on the front    Aren't you guys in eastern MA sitting at like 50" total right now? And I thought we got it hard here in western MA   My god    What kind of crack are you smoking? I replaced the timing belt, balance belt, all the pulleys, and water pump in mine for around $400.    But 600HP is still pretty impressive considering that its a 3.5 V6. I'm assuming that it will be mostly carbon fiber, so I can imagine that it will be pretty light which will help with power to weight.  	32
 Of course, you realize that the President of the United States is the President of the United States 24/7.  The problem with the Kasich situation is that we the Ohio voters elected him to do one job; and, on our dime he is abandoning his job to run for another office.           I get up every morning at an early hour.  After a shower, feeding the pets, and making a pot of coffee to leave by my wife's bedside table I head out to my local Starbucks where I read the New York Times and hang out with my pal aka, the Dude.  The two of us have become such an institution at this SBUX that we've made tons of sober friends, SBUX regulars, and even networked various business deals including recently introducing an orthopedic surgeon to his new medical practice--just by hanging out and learning the names of regulars.    Good for you, please keep doing what you're doing.   Congratulations, you have a running start on a whole new way of life.     Thanks for this insight.   Exactly right.   I've been there, but by continuing not to drink it got better and it got better pretty quickly.       That sounds just like my "adventure in moderation" after 15 continuous years of sobriety.  After two weeks I descended into a 7 year hell-on-earth relapse.  I am truly grateful to be a month away from my 6 year anniversary, again.  I did it one day at a time.    There are lots of living examples of this right on this sub.   Good job on telling on yourself.  I hope this was cathartic for you.  If I were you, I would focus ENTIRELY on recovery for the next 90 days and listening.  Noon and early evening AA meetings work for me.   I'm so glad you are choosing to begin again.  I am not drinking TODAY in solidarity with you.    My own prison was in a bottle, my own dark thoughts were the razor wire, I don't want to go back there either.  This reminds me so much of the Harriet Tubman quote, I paraphrase: I freed a thousand slaves, I could have freed a thousand more if only they knew that they were slaves.                        "Hedge" really sounds like he's saying: I love my wife, but her in-laws can stay out.            Not a problem, didn't see it.                  Yeah, the Massey Energy CEO, Don Blankenship bought chunks of the WV Supreme Court just to win a civil lawsuit.  He loved it!   Hey, /u/SoggyAugi -- I wrote a "what's next" post [called the Baby Steps.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  The Baby Steps are entirely based on my personal experience, but lots of us on /r/stopdrinking use these ideas in our own ways to find a path.  Good luck to you.   Nothing bad in my life, nothing at all--was ever improved by adding alcohol.  I have been at the precipice, and by choosing to not drink my life got better.  I feel for you, brother.  Hang in there.   He had remarkable insights and he was a deeply compassionate teacher.                           Yeah, this is how I make the distinction between interest and commitment.  I am committed to my daily decision not to drink TODAY, so I doggedly persist.  I am interested in playing my guitar, and too many days in a row it merely sits at my elbow...condemning me, LOL.   I saw Father Martin, live at the Cleveland Masonic Auditorium back in the late 1980s, what a hoot.     I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; keeping Thursday SOBER in Cleveland.                 Welcome /u/Leaping_ezio to r/stopdrinking.  At this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  Maybe you will find some ideas there that will be helpful to you.  Good luck.   My body and my central nervous system were healing for the first month or so.  It makes some logical sense that you might be feeling nausea in the early days sober.  The healthy gut bacteria may be rebuilding its biome in the GI.  If you continue to have symptoms, by all means go see a licensed professional.   When I stopped drinking in both 1986 and then later in 2009 I found psychological counseling invaluable to addressing anger and other troubling issues.  I'm grateful that I had the resources available to me at that time to obtain counseling.   Good work.  You might also [do the morning check-in with us.](http://is.gd/afsucks)   Very cool, idea.     Wow, that's terrific!  I am so proud of you.      Ha, ha, ha....   With an "s?"   In the dictionary under delusional; illustration 1.                           I was sentenced to federal prison about a year after I returned to sobriety in August 2010.  I had been a nationally prominent civil trial lawyer with a business worth potential millions.  I was disgraced and fearful and miserable and I didn't drink.  I didn't drink the day I was sentenced or any day since that time by doing what I talk about all the time: I made a daily decision not to drink TODAY and I doggedly persisted.  No single event, no bad news or good, no sadness, no disappointment, no loss is too great to bear for one day.  Then I repeat, tomorrow.    My life is filled with happiness, joy, and freedom because of the decision I make TODAY not to drink.           That one was really my bad, I intended to send that to whole other subreddit.     Yes, but why are the citizens of Ohio funding our Gov's run for another political office.  Security for a presidential run is a whole lot more involved and expensive than for a vacation for a non-presidential candidate.  I think then SC Gov. Mark Sanford proved that.   Well, then again, there's that.   I think it's a mistake to think just because someone makes money they can't also be an idiot or politically and socially unacceptable.  Trump falls into that category in my opinion.  He is beyond the pale.     There are also online meetings: [here](http://www.aa-intergroup.org/directory_venue.php?code=AV) and [here.](http://www.aaonline.net/)      OK, I'm glad I asked.    Personally, I am not that different than you in terms of the underlying anxiety issues and to be honest, even though I live in a major American city (Cleveland) AA can be a little like high school from the standpoint of early sobriety.  On the other hand, given some blind courage and a gritting commitment to just go and actively listen my entire life (including my bipolar disorder) changed positively for the better.  Also, most of my preconceptions even about how I would be received were completely mistaken.  This has been my experience with AA everywhere I've gone over 30 years.    Go it alone didn't work for me, but it may work for you.  Good luck, and I hope you will consider keeping /r/stopdrinking for support.            Good for you, /u/Trunner3000.  Preparation is ACTION and personally, I found acting my way into better thinking worked a whole lot better than trying to think my way into better acting.   Congratulations, /u/cake_or_radish on 345 days!!!  Triumph: My tax debt OfferInCompromise has been received and the IRS lifted their month long levy on my salary;  Struggle: Still struggling with debt and budgets, but thankfully, it's one day at a time;  General Chat: [What do drinking dreams mean?](https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/2dit1m/what_do_drinking_dreams_mean/)   Why is AA bullshit (in your city)?            I am not drinking TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; I'm keeping hump day SOBER in Cleveland.   This is great progress.  Too often newcomers in the throes of early sobriety give up hope of feeling better but you are am example that even a couple of weeks cam be huge.  Keep doing what you're doing    Great to hear from you, GS.  Don't be a stranger if you can help it.   I have so many activities that 24 hours is insufficient to the purpose, but I do remember that time in early sobriety when I felt at loose ends--what now?--I asked myself. I jumped into AA meetings and activities, that was huge.  Then I asked myself what did I always want to do.  In my case I always wanted to play guitar, so I signed up for an adult education class, then private lessons, and then I joined a group.  It was great.  I resumed avid cycling and I joined a cycling group for weekly night rides.  I joined a sober bowling and gold league.  My life was soon overwhelmed with activities.   I actually did some of the pioneering law in this area in the US.  In my experience families are universally viewed as the victims of abuse; although in one instance I represented a family who came into possession of photographic evidence of abuse and who turned over the evidence to prosecutors only to be charged with possession of "child porn."  The charges would in due course be dismissed, but I suppose it goes some to prove your point.         I've read extensively in the Orange Papers and while the obsessiveness of Agent Orange is remarkable, the work is poisoned by the sort of thinking that has no actual meaning or purpose other than to air out Orange's grievance and crap all over other's recovery.  As SM2L says, it has nothing at all to do with my experience in recovery.     Or maybe just truing.   They should be smoking.            Welcome /u/BlackDogBlues66 to /r/stopdrinking -- at the [link is a post that sets out some "next steps"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) for the newly sober that are based on something my AA sponsor called "baby steps."  I hope you feel motivated to check-in regularly on the sub and keep us posted on your progress.   Ah, I'm sorry, /u/equallyconfusing that you find yourself in this sad situation.  I've been there in so many ways and for me it always began with the first drink.  I had to stop drinking, [the Baby Steps are how I did it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Then I needed sustained time sober, finally I needed RECOVERY which gave me a systematic way of making the appropriate amends to those I hurt.  Until I did all those ACTIONS, my words were worthless.           Maybe a week or two at most.   Hey, /u/thenewmeihope -- this is what I call "writing checks drunk, that sober I can't cash."  It's OK. It's more than OK if you draw the lesson you're drawing.  Down the road, maybe you can make amends, but for the time being, let it go works best in my experience.   After 15 continuous years of sobriety, I went back out to drink moderately.  I was successful too, for 2 weeks.  Then I descended into the deepest, darkest hole.  It took many years and it was only by some miracle not of my doing that I was able to come back to life in 2009.   Nope, not for me.    Wow, powerful stuff that.     Interesting, but I don't think the medical and mental health communities are at all focused on the "spiritual entity" part of recovery when they make the recommendation to attend AA meetings.  I think instead they realize that AA meetings are the most easily accessible, affordable, and effective programs of recovery.    And might one, just "skip the middle man" and just go right to some conception of God?  If that were true there would be no drunk Roman Catholic priest, LOL!  In my experience, it is not a religious zeal, or spirituality that is at the heart of the recovery from alcoholism--it is instead an appreciation that ALCOHOL is the higher power and self will or will power alone can not in the usual case, beat the disease.  Instead a core recognition that the power of fellowship with like-minded others who are on a sober journey IS the solution.  From time immemorial, religious "cures" had been proposed and failed.  AA grew up as a radical reaction against the "moral" cure of the Women's Temperance Union, the Baptist pledge, and the Oxford Group.     I slipped through a changing light the other day in a retail district of my town.  The Honda from the side street that I passed on my right pulled up beside me and the passenger rolled her window down and said, "You give all bicyclists a bad name."  I replied, "Yeah, that's a shame, but even people on bicycles make mistakes, though I'm sure you never do."  Let's not all pretend that every action or inaction is from a place of malice or arrogance.   Well-said.     Great and powerful post, /u/rose_the_wolf.  I am majorly pulling for you friend.   Let's do this, CR!   Welcome to our sub, /u/heyizabella (Isabella was my fav cat)--so at this [link is a post called the Baby Steps](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which is what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  Maybe something there will be helpful to you.  I hope to see you checking-in daily.   Good for you!   I think there is pretty good evidence that in early sobriety coffee is a net positive.  It's frankly why one of the symbols of AA is the coffee pot.   I toughed it out; because my brain, my body, my central nervous system were healing and the experience of others told me that it would take a little time before I reached equilibrium.     I totally agree.  This isn't support, it's purchase.   Did you ever read my /r/stopdrinking [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Why don't you come join us on that sub?  We are actively taking action to stop drinking.   Seriously, folks, don't screw the clients.                     The discipline I imposed on myself in my early AA was to go, listen and listen actively to each person without judgment.  It didn't take me long to see myself in many aspects of what others said and to learn some discernment skills, taking what helped and leaving the rest behind.  The mere action of going, and listening was all that I needed in the first days and weeks.     You are on the verge of being eligible to do the morning check-in if you're interested!   Outstanding, I've been off for several days around the holiday, too.  I go back to work tomorrow and I agree, the time off has been wonderful.   Welcome /u/silkslittedsheets to /r/stopdrinking -- if you've been in "lurk" you may or may not have come across the [Baby Steps link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) which lays out what I did to stop drinking and to get sober.  I'm convinced based on some feedback that the Baby Steps are not a bad place to start stopping.  One of the things that I've also found very useful is the sub's Daily Check-in.  It's turning into a running narrative for a lot of us as we go along.  Good luck.   I'll do more than wish you luck; I'll share [the Baby Steps link](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/) with you in the hope that something that worked for me will resonate with you and help as you go along.   This observation about speakers trying to convince themselves that AA works, may be true.  Remember, as they say in recovery "De-nile (denial) is not a river in Egypt" and in early recovery we are often still awkwardly selling ourselves on recovery.  Embedded in AA recovery is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy--a deliberate focus on changing behaviors in order to change thinking.  I often compare it to learning how to play guitar--which I successfully undertook in early sobriety.  At first it's really hard, awkward, uncomfortable.  Nothing came easily for me.  But as I slowly learned chords, scales, and songs and I practiced my brain automatically sped me up so that I sound pretty good even with my rudimentary skill set.  The same's true for new people in AA.  They may look awkward, or even phony, but let's not judge--in many cases these are the same hopeless, helpless drunks that made little or no sense when we sat on the barstool next to them staring at Sportscenter on the TV over the bar.      I would highly suggest that you post at /r/alanon or better yet check out an Al Anon meeting IRL.  This is not a "blow off" my ex-wife's most powerful and loving action--working an Al Anon program--changed her life and mine.  Best of luck to you and the alcoholic in your life.   What worked for me were the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  These simple sober actions worked for me and lots of others too, long before I ever came across them and re-worked the ideas for this sub.  So good luck to you, /u/funkhouser1907.   Here's the thing about your powerful post; because you have 9 days and are saying these things you have the proximate credibility to be persuasive to newcomers when with some years of sobriety we can say the words and fall on deaf ears.  Congratulations, keep doing what you are doing and you will find your authentic self.   My sincerest sympathies, my friend.  My thoughts are with you this morning.   But the savings on "product" makes it so worth it.         Apparently :D                  r/titlegore      Anger and resentment are the chief offenders in relapse.   Good for you!   I describe this self-insight as that moment when I crossed the line from someone who is stopping drinking because it makes sense in light of all the bad consequences; to the ex-drinker who truly values my new sober life.  At this moment in my experience, cravings left me.  As long as I keep putting one foot in front of the other, I am confident I will not drink again.         Did you participate in the making of this video?  Hmmmmm...               I will not drink TODAY no matter what happens good or bad; sober in Cleveland again this morning and off to Starbucks to read the New York Times.  Have a great day, everybody!      Cedar Point is an hour from my house.  So, while you're in Dayton, make sure you hit all the Wright Brothers sites.  I read the new bio and I was blown away.     I am very relieved for you.

[Keith Jarrett the Koln Concert](http://www.amazon.com/The-Koln-Concert-Keith-Jarrett/dp/B0000262WI)   The wisdom of labeling alcoholism a disease is this central concept; we have an effective treatment for which we OURSELVES are empowered to address by our daily choices and participation in recovery.         So /u/field__notes did you ever read through the [Baby Steps post?](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  It's what I do everyday to stop drinking for TODAY, only.  Why not join us on the daily check-in tomorrow morning?  We can all start stopping together.   Good luck.  Working with others is the best way to get and stay sober.     Welcome /u/titty_sprinkz --thank you for sharing your thoughts about Fernando.  Somebody once pointed out to me that our eyes don't see inward, we need to look to others for our own reflection--that sounds like what you did so powerfully in speaking of Fernando.  So I stopped drinking and I got sober by doing the things I describe at the [Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Maybe something there will be helpful to you.  Good luck.   Absolutely, I didn't mean to pre-empt the debate, but merely lay out my thoughts on the one topic he mentioned in his post.     Wow you are in a dark place if I'm reading your post correctly.  I see myself 6 years ago, in your account of where alcohol has you.  I had to get help and stop drinking in order to find true happiness, and my authentic self.  Sustained sober time was an answer to the lies that alcohol was telling me and I got sober doing the simple actions I detail in the [Baby Steps post at this link.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Let me be clear: I can't be happy drunk when drunk I text others about suicide. That simply is not rational and I suspect you know it or you wouldn't be posting here.  Good luck and keep posting and commenting.   Congratulations, /u/Hollow_Ponds -- an invite to join us on /r/dinos will shortly follow unless one of the other DINO mods beat me to it.   I just suggested in a comment to another post that the 90 day no drink challenge might be a way to gain some clarity on the issue you're grappling with.  The way I stopped drinking was via [the things I discuss at the Baby Steps post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Why not see if you can arrive at your own answers by simple sober actions for some sustained time without alcohol?   If I were you, I would stop drinking for some time, maybe set a goal of 90 days in order to gain clarity around my relationship with alcohol.  I found that my problem wasn't the 3rd or 4th beer or drink, but the first.  My way of stopping goes right to the heart of that problem:  [the Baby Steps are focused on learning how to stop drinking in the here and now.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SDCleveAkron/comments/2i427b/the_baby_steps_where_to_start_stopping/)  Good luck to you.      It's interesting, almost the entire medical and psychological communities agree that alcoholism is a disease; but, the occasional dissenter when given voice in popular media or by Penn   Teller tends to animate the debate.  It's like the anti-vaxxer-thing in my opinion.  So why is alcoholism NOT a disease in their opinion?  Well, for a variety of reasons almost all of which are highly debatable--but, the big one is: you can't "catch" alcoholism like you can AIDS or Dengue Fever or Small Pox.  But alcoholism isn't an infectious disease (although if you think about it, maybe it is to some extent)--alcoholism or the disorders that we conventionally think of as alcoholism is more like diabetes or heart disease.  Our early life choices, and our genetic predispositions often bring on the disorder.  As far as I am concerned, I may not be responsible for getting my "disease" but I am wholly responsible for daily treatment.         Why don't you talk about those things you don't know whether you agree with on this subreddit?  At least we can supportively discuss the issues with you.   infrequently   Good for you, you have a real running start on a whole new way of living.  Solid insight about the reach of this "disease."   I suppose this would be surprising if anyone truly believed that Breitbart was anything more than a crew of rightwing grifters pretending to be hard hitting political journalists.   I'm upvoting you.   I'll bite, what?   How much did you donate?         Actually pretty descriptive.

The Islamic State has been gaining thousands of followers just through its own successes - doing nothing is not much of an alternative.   I agree that bombing Iraq, and civilian casualties that result, will create some extremists, but I think doing nothing could be worse. If the Iraqi government can regain control of the country it is the best chance to reduce the number of extremists.   Interesting perspective, but makes sense.    No ground troops - only air strikes in Iraq   Very unlikely, though no doubt a handful do.   The parties have been urging MPs to vote with them and support intervention in Iraq.   We hope that through airstrikes we can support the Iraqi ground forces enough that they can regain the territory lost to the Islamic State in the past few months.  Given that the Islamic State is encouraging terrorists in countries around the world, we feel the world would be better without a strong Islamic State (IS) movement.          Really?

The moment you start equating human and other animal lives you start to create all sorts of moral issues - do you have a moral obligation to prevent a lion killing an antelope (you would stop a lion killing a human).       Well in the situations of hyperinflation the government tends to print money and use it to pay its debt.   In quantitative easing the government buys debt or government bonds from banks.   Money is just a medium of wealth used to assist bartering. If one person has all the money it ceases to play that role. Alternative currencies would set up (e.g. gold standard, where there is some intrinsic value).   Inflation is defined two ways (both mean the same thing): - The rise in the general price of goods - The fall in the value of money  If you print money, there is more money in the economy yet the same amount of goods. So the nominal prices of those limited goods rises.    When you print a large amount of money the value of currency decreases (inflation), and people's wealth decreases...

Most researchers I know working on diseases in animals, really want to find a treatment - not for the profit, but for the patient.   Very little animal research is done by the military, but the bit that is is almost all for treating war injuries e.g. the best treatment on site for someone who has been shot to ensure they survive, or studies into PTSD.

 Ah, yeah.  I see the goals of the sub-bass range in drone and trance as quite different, but that may just be a reflection of the kind of drone I like (i.e. I like drone that uses the bass instrument to add harmonic content across the low midrange in addition to the sub-bass fundamental).  You could do it with sines and have a very clean sound for bass, too.  I don't have an example to pull up right now, but I will try to come back to this tonight and offer something.   [Sure...](https://soundcloud.com/exuberant_void/1292014a)   This album...I never got the appeal.  To me it sounds very pretentious, yet generic and bland at the same time.  The time-stretch seems like an improvement, but...meh.  Those intervals...   We could make a wiki linked in the sidebar.   Can't access - did you leave the playlist private?   That's a lot of four on the floor and melody for a drone   Sine waves are pretty boring because they have no overtones (so you can't get anything out of them with a filter, etc).  An overdriven sine wave with a tight lowpass that sweeps a bit could give you a versatile, simple bass drone, as the overdrive adds overtones (duh).  But even easier would be to use a saw with a tight lowpass (resonance mid-high, cutoff low) and sweep (modulate cutoff with an LFO) that a bit.  To make it pulse, you can modulate its amplitude with another LFO, or just duplicate it and make the duplicate very slightly out of tune (so they go in and out of phase, sometimes doubling each other and sometimes canceling each other out).   Before you ask he is on no medications nor has he ever been on any ssri's or anything of that nature.  What about supplements, herbal teas, etc?  Perhaps there is some non-drug substance that you or he ingests that influenced the rate at which MDMA was metabolized.  Many popular herbs, supplements, and spices influence the expression of various liver enzymes.   Looks like the kind of tube some dispensaries will sell you pre-rolled cones in.    I'm wondering if that is what he truly feels or if it was just the drugs talking  I think this is a false dichotomy; it doesn't have to be one or the other.  I don't know you all, but if I had to guess, I would guess that this is how he really felt in the moment he said it.  But that moment was partially drug-induced, right?  Depressants don't make people think other people are their soul mates, but he wouldn't have said that without taking the depressants.  So you should be a bit skeptical, and so should he.  If he isn't, then it sounds like he's not being very realistic about his own thoughts and feelings.  But you know, I don't think it's a big deal.  If you two love each other, you'll be able to talk about it and grow closer through that (regardless of the outcome).  Just be honest with him and talk about your experience.   I like it.  The lack of bass and inclusion of creepy intervals gives it a distinctly 1980's science fiction feel to me.  At times it feels sort of melodramatic (kinda like 1980's sci-fi, haha) because of this, which I would tone down if it were my work.  To do that, I'd probably just pull back the velocity on the creepy sounding notes, but I might also add / lower the hz of the lowpass on the reverb.  You could do a lot with the sub-bass and bass ranges if you wanted to.  I could hear a sub-bass tone pulsing around .5 to 6 hz really easily, which could add a lot of complexity and change over the course of the piece.  I think just adding a continuous sub-bass tone because it ought to be there would be a mistake, though; the drone has a cool sound *from* the lack of bass, I wouldn't give it up without getting something in return.   There is a lot of information on that page, but I didn't see anything that resembled a probable mechanism, nor any direct biological evidence that DMT in concentrations likely to exist in vivo could reduce cellular oxidative stress enough to extend life during hypoxia.  If the information is there, would please you restate it in clear, concise English?  As it is, it hardly seems worth digging for; most genuine funding proposals *lead* with the science.  This leads with new age mumbo jumbo and a ton of name-dropping.   Yes, of course - I don't intend to misrepresent you as thinking COX2 is the whole story, nor as thinking that potency and efficacy can be equated.  But despite the disclaimer, your post implies that this difference is highly relevant to the OP's belief that they are similarly powerful.  It really isn't; OP is about right in believing that ibuprofen and curcumin are similarly powerful medicines.   No it isn't - it just assumes a synthesis-naive student audience.   Ibuprofen is more powerful than Curcumin, atleast at COX-2. Curcumin's IC50 is 15.9m. Ibuprofen's is 1.5m.  I disagree - it isn't this simple.  I searched Pubmed and found the same two numbers; I don't dispute them.  But these numbers only inform a comparison in COX2 inhibition between equal plasma concentrations of these drugs, not in their efficacy during actual use.  It appears likely that curcumin can be tolerated at higher doses for longer periods of time than ibuprofen can.  In this case, the difference in effect for users may be greatly diminished.  For chronic conditions, curcumin may even be more effective, or similarly effective but with reduced risk of ill effect (as ibuprofen is not tolerated in sustained high doses).  More importantly, the [mechanisms by which curcumin works](http://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/20/5/9183) are numerous and varied, going well beyond inhibition of COX2.  The [mechanisms by which ibuprofen works](https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA166121942) are also quite varied, though COX inhibition is often heavily emphasized.  I doubt that it is possible to present a rational argument that one or the other  can be known to be a more effective treatment for any particular inflammatory disease state without relying on empirical data from a clinical study comparing both drugs at work in a diseased population.  Pharmacology is very, very complicated; scientists have good reason to use pharmacology to inform the development of treatments, and not as a means of developing them.  Clinical trials are necessary to test hypotheses about the efficacy of potential treatments; pharmacology is necessary to generate new hypotheses and inform trial design.   It's worth looking into, in my opinion - the obvious choices haven't worked for you, CBD has immense potential as a treatment for social anxiety, and many states now have CBD-only prohibition exemptions.      500 to 1000mg is a common dose, and has worked well for me personally.  A wide range of doses have been used in the clinical literature; there is quite good evidence that curcumin in this dosage range or even below it can help inflammatory disorders.  For example, [this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21194249) used a dose of only ~100mg curcumin twice daily in the form of two Meriva tablets, and found benefit for knee osteoarthritis.  I wouldn't worry too much about the acute effects that you notice; pain is highly subjective anyway, and it's unlikely that you'd be able to distinguish the effects from placebo if you were given curcumin in a single-dose blind test.  This is also true of ibuprofen, etc. - likely true of most pain meds that aren't opioids.  That doesn't mean it won't help you over time, though - there is plenty of evidence that curcumin reduces inflammation to a clinically relevant extent that improves inflammation dependent disease states over time.  It's a good medicine for what it does, and could be a good adjunct treatment to help manage the stiffness and joint pain associated with TMJD (which obviously needs to be treated through other modalities as well).   The answer depends on what you want from curcumin, and on how long its effects last.  Do you want to build up an ongoing anti-inflammatory effect to treat a chronic inflammatory disease, or do you want an acute effect to treat acute pain?  Curcumin takes about an hour to reach peak levels in your blood, and has a half-life around an hour as well unless delivered in certain nanoparticle preparations.  This suggests that its action begins within a half-hour or so of taking it, and trails off about three hours after that.  Taking it with a meal should stretch this out by an hour or so.  Meriva apparently uses a time-release formulation, but according to the data on their website it doesn't actually seem to change the time course outlined above.  I'm not confident about this - their presentation is confusing.  Generic curcumin+piperine supplements are far cheaper and have strong research behind them; they'll probably yield a much better return on investment as you could buy two or three times the curcumin for the price and get the same or better bioavailability.  Any supplement with 5mg+ piperine per 500mg curcumin will do.  Anyway - if you want it to have an ongoing effect, you'll have to take it a couple times a day.  For example, with breakfast and at bedtime.  If you only care about it working at night, then you could just take it at night.  Given that curcumin is so cheap if you take a few minutes to find the best deal online, and taking a pill with breakfast is easy, it seems worthwhile to take it 2x a day if you have a chronic condition that it could help.   Well, you've tried a lot of the things that are commonly recommended...on to the slightly more obscure, I guess.  If it's available where you live and you can afford it, you should consider cannabidiol - either as an isolate/extract, or in the form of high cannabidiol low THC cannabis.  There is a decent body of scientific evidence supporting its use as a treatment for social anxiety.  For examples, read the introduction of this paper:  [Cannabidiol Reduces the Anxiety Induced by Simulated Public Speaking in Treatment-Nave Social Phobia Patients](http://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v36/n6/full/npp20116a.html).  There's also a strong body of anecdotal evidence available on reddit and elsewhere for CBD or CBD+THC's efficacy in treating social anxiety, generalized anxiety, and PTSD-like symptoms (for what that's worth).   Debunk This: Cold Showers Helpful for Depression/Anxiety  The title of your post, the first line of which is a link to the study.  That is the misrepresentation, because the study does not claim this at all.  It claims that more research should be done to find out *whether* cold showers are helpful for depression/anxiety.   Whoah dude   When administered with piperine, curcumin reaches its maximum levels in blood serum within an hour or so, and shows a half-life around an hour as well.  One nano-particle formulation has shown a much longer half-life, but with comparable peak levels etc (mentioned in the examine.com link).  Ibuprofen, a popular synthetic anti-inflammatory, also takes an hour on average (varies by preparation) to reach max levels in blood serum.  This doesn't mean ibuprofen takes effect in the same amount of time as curcumin, as their mechanisms of action differ (they produce very similar anti-inflammatory results, but in different ways).  But they are probably quite similar in their time to action.  Ibuprofen is often said to have an onset time around 30 minutes.  [Bioavailability of ibuprofen following oral administration...](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6904/9/19)  A small amount of piperine must be included for curcumin to be absorbed in humans at all; you shouldn't use any curcumin supplement that doesn't include at least 5mg (more is not better; 5mg piperine per 500mg curcumin is more than enough).   Sources for curcumin's pharmacokinetics etc:  [Examine.com: Curcumin](http://examine.com/supplements/Curcumin/)  [A Comprehensive Review on Pharmacotherapeutics of Herbal Bioenhancers](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/tswj/2012/637953/)   Ganoderma is a genus of mushrooms.

In that thread, it was strongly implied that there was a middle manager whose *personal* views about bitcoin were causing Google as a company to avoid innovation involving Bitcoin.  I did not find that particularly believable.  What you're suggesting is quite different (a senior decision carried out by a middle manager), and much more believable.   There is an important difference.  Using the statue you linked as an example, the key phrase pointing to this difference is  until the warrant is executed.   Of course search warrants are not a matter of public record *before they are executed*, because this would undermine the purpose of the warrant (to obtain evidence by force).  FISA court records remain secret after the warrant has been executed.   3    That is not true at all.  I guess you care more about being right than anything; no point in corresponding further.   The court is considered "secret" because its proceedings and records are all classified.  This might not seem like a big deal if you're ignorant of how the United States' legal system is designed to function.   It isn't considered secret because its *existence* is secret, but because its hearings are conducted in secret and all substantive records are classified.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Foreign_Intelligence_Surveillance_Court#Secrecy  That might not sound like a big deal if you don't know much about how the United States' legal system is designed to function.  In brief: courts are public for a very good reason, and when they aren't, more abuse happens.   I seriously doubt that's where the downvotes come from.  Perhaps gossip was too strong a word - but I doubt I would have been spared the downvotes if I had just called it a lousy primary source.   That success could very easily be due to initial good decisions, and have very little to do with the quality of strategic decisions made now.  Hmm...I don't believe that it could be so extreme.  Google's initial success was about 15 years ago, and most of their growth occurred over the next decade after that.  It seems to me that they have demonstrated much more than successfully executing their early ideas.   For the most part, I agree that we should condemn driving under the **influence** of psychedelics.  But I have yet to meet a person who can't understand the difference between *no effect at all* and *some effect*.  When people make ridiculous statements, it discredits them.  To claim that there is no safe amount of drug to drive on is obviously ridiculous, because there is always a dose that has a no effect at all, and doses whose effects are marginal, etc.  I would drive after a half-glass of wine with dinner, because it does not effect my perceptual or attentive abilities.  I would drive 3 hours after taking LSD that barely did anything.  I would encourage anybody else to do the same, and I would attempt to refute anybody who claimed that I was being irresponsible in doing so.   You edited your posts to include brain regions...nice.  At the time of my writing, it was true.   If I read that same primary source in an article by the New York Times (or whatever secondary source you like) I would think it was a crap article.  It's just gossip, no matter who delivers it.  It's like reading a "news article" on Reddit whose sole source is a post on Reddit from last week.  Who cares?  edit:  Ruh roh, I'm disagreeing with popular opinion on /r/bitcoin.  Downvotes incoming.   Google remains an outlier.  I'm not saying they're the best company ever, or that their business practices are admirable, or anything like that.  I'm saying that they are unusually successful, in a tier above most other companies in terms of *success*.  That is true.  Look at their stock price.  Compare it to their competitors.  Laugh at how ridiculous MoDuReddit's comment below appears in the context of data.   Huh...well, what you said is true, but you're using this phrase "like every company" in a very different way than I meant.  I did not mean "Google is a wonderful good company where nobody makes mistakes."  I meant "Google is an unusually successful company."  That is true.  It also suggests that they have overcome some problems that other companies have not.  Apparently /r/bitcoin doesn't like that fact stated.  Sigh...echo chambers.   Oh dear - thank you for correcting me.  There I was, adrift in the dark seas of ignorance, believing that validity and soundness could be rightly equated...but lo, the wise and wonderful /u/MagnusT came and enlightened me with their profound nibblets of truth and reason...from /r/bestof !   Well, all kinds of things are possible.  Mere possibility accompanied with a couple sentences of gossip hardly merit a front-page article.   Hmm...it seems to me that whether an excellent emulation of emotion would be good enough (or desirable) is open to debate, but could not reasonably be known until it had been tested repeatedly.  But I disagree that it is necessary at all.  For young children, teaching could be done by AI accompanied by one or more babysitter-like adults (or teenagers).  So the AI would replace the expensive teaching labor, and open up more inexpensive babysitting labor.  But for adults and perhaps teenagers and even older children, an AI teacher lacking emotional simulation may be sufficient all on its own.  Certainly AI without emotions would be sufficient for adults - college professors are not expected nor required to provide emotional support to students whatsoever.  You could learn from the privacy of your home, or in small study groups composed of your existing peers, in a private lecture and Q/A session from an amalgamation of the knowledge and teaching styles of the greatest minds in recent history...likely for the cost of equipment and little more.   I have no idea - I don't know Mike, and there was almost no content in the link about the Google claim...  But one middle manager  there (who shall remain nameless) hates Bitcoin and has the ability to veto most kinds  of work Googlers could do on it. I had to repeatedly go over his head in order to get  bitcoinj released and most employees simply aren't willing to engage in that kind of  corporate politics.  Is all I could find.  Seems highly improbable, and there is no evidence offered.  Perhaps Mike is lying; perhaps Mike is mistaken; perhaps Mike is very naive about management practices, and is honestly reporting an experience that is badly distorted by that naivete.  Who knows?    I honestly don't understand why this thread exists; it should have been downvoted into oblivion as a crap source, as far as I'm concerned.   This does happen a great deal in the stoner echo chambers of Reddit and various social media sites.  But I am certainly not interested in discounting the findings of the study linked in the OP.  I have often championed negative research findings about THC in particular on Reddit.   This post is the first time you've discussed a specific brain region.  Doesn't that seem just a bit disingenuous for you to chide me now for criticizing your prior posts, given that they did not specify any particular part of the brain?  ...  Also, I do not see how any particular thing you've cited and claimed in this reply contradicts anything I have said.   Come on, now you're making truly ridiculous claims.  Everybody has *some* non-zero quantity of humor, however small.   I don't see how it's relevant whether I've worked for a difficult middle manager or not, but for the record, I have (and I've been one).  I'm not saying that this never happens - just that I seriously doubt it is happening in this case.   Yeah, usually middle managers aren't a big deal at a huge corporation like that.  People often become a middle manager by accident, just by doing their job reasonably well and staying at the company for a few years.   Haha.  I find it quite believable for most companies (especially any one that I've worked for).   As stated elsewhere in this thread, the research you are considering relates to different parts of the brain from those reported on in this study; this study provides no evidence for your speculations.  I think this demonstrates my point fairly well.  Although it is popular nowadays to believe things about "serotonin levels" and "oxytocin levels" fluctuating in the entire brain, and this causing various affective states, there are no scientific bases for almost any of these ideas.  Even highly generalized neurotransmitter systems like the serotonin system make specific connections in specific areas with differentiated receptor subtypes and functions throughout the brain.  So you can imagine how skeptical a person might be when they read something like  lowered Oxytocin levels highly correlated with behavior patterns of long term stoners  if that person understands that the actual finding always specifies a specific location - and must do so, because oxytocin's role can only be understood in relation to what it is doing and where.   Your statement in no way contradicts it being safe to drive on a sub-threshold dose of LSD.  I'm ashamed to see this sub engaging in petty disagreement-driven downvoting.   Google is not like most companies; it is an exceptional company (i.e. it is an outlier).  I would not expect major decisions at Google to be based on the personal preferences of relatively junior employees such as middle managers.   I have a very hard time believing that these effects are the result of rogue middle managers.   How do you know?  If the effect is mediated by cannabinoid receptors, it seems the great coincidence would be if CBD *didn't* interact in that specific way (i.e. the way it has already been demonstrated to interact with THC and cannabinoid receptors).   You're being ridiculous.  There is some amount of LSD on which it is safe to drive.  You can't reasonably claim that a sub-threshold dose of LSD is unsafe to drive on, for example; it has no effect.   This presentation of data is profoundly misleading.  It implies that all members of each profession displayed are either Democrats or Republicans, which is obviously untrue.  [About 43% of Americans are independants](http://www.gallup.com/poll/180440/new-record-political-independents.aspx)   Google is a profoundly successful, massive multinational corporation.  I don't find it plausible that their decision making process about working with Bitcoin could possibly be this simplistic.   I believe so.  I searched for a couple minutes, but could find no suggestion that B6 turns urine yellow.   If it was only B12, then it doesn't matter.  The effect is mostly caused by B2, which is yellow and is rapidly cleared in urine; I believe some other non-12 B vitamins also contribute.  Almost any B-complex or generic "B Vitamin" supplement taken in a sufficient dose (e.g. 500% RDA, a common 1-pill dose) will turn your urine bright yellow.   Why not?  It seems like a reasonable hypothesis.  I was only able to access the abstract, so cannot tell whether the authors identified a mechanism; if these effects are mediated by a mechanism that CBD is known to interfere with, it would seem very likely that CBD could protect against this effect.   Perhaps such ideas could be used to generate hypotheses for further research, but stated as a series of  tenable conclusions your post appears wildly speculative.   OP is really small   5'7 and 130lb with little fat  I doubt they could fail.   If the sample was yellowish and you didn't take a heavy B-vitamin supplement that day, it should not come up dilute.  Normal people who aren't trying to beat the test may drink as much as you did in the normal course of their day; if that qualified the sample for being diluted, they would have to either instruct you not to drink so much or reject a large proportion of their samples.  B-vitamin supplements will turn your pee very yellow for several hours if the dose is high, as it often is (even in multivitamins).  In this case, you can't use the faint color as a clear indicator of a lack of dilution.

It can be characterized by a set of somatic, emotional, and behavioral symptoms, one of which is a high risk of suicide. **This work presents a hypothesis** that depression may be caused by the convergence of two factors: (A) A lifestyle that lacks certain physiological stressors that have been experienced by primates through millions of years of evolution, such as brief changes in body temperature (e.g. cold swim), and this lack of "thermal exercise" may cause inadequate functioning of the brain. (B) Genetic makeup that predisposes an individual to be affected by the above condition more seriously than other people. **To test the hypothesis, an approach to treating depression is proposed** that consists of adapted cold showers (20 degrees C, 2-3 min, preceded by a 5-min gradual adaptation to make the procedure less shocking) performed once or twice daily. The proposed duration of treatment is several weeks to several months. The following evidence appears to support the hypothesis: Exposure to cold is known to activate the sympathetic nervous system and increase the blood level of beta-endorphin and noradrenaline and to increase synaptic release of noradrenaline in the brain as well. Additionally, due to the high density of cold receptors in the skin, a cold shower is expected to send an overwhelming amount of electrical impulses from peripheral nerve endings to the brain, which could result in an anti-depressive effect. Practical testing by a statistically insignificant number of people, who did not have sufficient symptoms to be diagnosed with depression, showed that the cold hydrotherapy can relieve depressive symptoms rather effectively. The therapy was also found to have a significant analgesic effect and it does not appear to have noticeable side effects or cause dependence. **In conclusion, wider and more rigorous studies would be needed to test the validity of the hypothesis.**  I don't think I was unreasonable in my assessment at all.  You misrepresented this work as making a claim it didn't make, and that was the only falsity presented.  p.s. ETA:  estimated time of arrival.   that is a simple algorithm that picks one battery a sufficient distance from the last set and positions the next three relative to the first one so the closest (or axial) distance to the previous set is within a certain pre-programmed range. This is hardly an AI. This machine could be made entirely without any electronic sensors or programming chips, it could all be mechanical / analog, would you still call it AI? If you were to stack one battery onto another or get two stuck together it would likely make a mistake or crash.  Whether this is an AI or a simple algorithm (or both) seems like a potentially interesting discussion, but ultimately one of semantics - which algorithms qualify as AI, and which do not?  Whatever answer is "true" depends solely on the definition of AI; it's a question about how we choose to use words, not an empirical question.  It also seems to me that any AI *will be an algorithm* (or collection of algorithms).  A sufficiently complex algorithm that models intelligence is an AI.  So the difference between the sorting algorithm for that robot and an AI, for you, seems to be one of degree and not of kind.  If that robot sorter were complex enough, you'd call it AI.  AI complex enough to teach children is beyond our lifetime   Is it really?  Well, this claim certainly doesn't follow from what you said before it.  Perhaps it is true, perhaps not.  It's an empirical question with only one right answer.  Here's an AI that seems somewhat more relevant, and certainly more complex:  [Deepmind artificial intelligence @ FDOT14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfGD2qveGdQ)  I doubt this AI, given the sensory and linguistic capacity to interact with human children, and an understanding of the goal of the day's class, would choose such a terrible strategy for child education as the one you proposed (repeating "quiet please" endlessly).  This AI was presented at a conference last year.  It has, among other things, mastered a wide variety of arcade games with no instruction or specialized training, using a form of computer vision to interpret what was happening and what were good and bad outcomes.  That's quite an algorithm...and you really think we can't get one to model any useful teaching activity in the next 50 years or so?    Resting energy expenditure during the last 30 min was 4.5+/-2.5% higher in the placebo trial and 10.7+/-2.5% higher (P0.05) in the caffeine/ephedra trial  If that's coming from the 10.7% figure, you're badly mistaken about what that figure means.  It represents an increase in resting energy expenditure following a meal taken with ephedrine and caffeine.  The increase in resting energy expenditure caused by the meal alone was ~4.5% - only **6.2%** of the increase could be attributed to ephedrine, and this increase should be considered a peak effect - not one that can be expected to last 24 hours.  Furthermore, this increase is not in total energy expenditure, but in resting energy expenditure.  In a typical adult, this would never be 2000 calories, but more like ~1500.  This is because it does not include calories burned due to physical activity, which are not changed by ephedrine.  The evidence cited above does not support the claim that ephedrine will cause a 200 calorie increase in total energy expenditure.  edit:  I missed this before.  You said:   A proper EC dose is 3 times a day, these studies are conducted with a single dose once per day.  This does not matter at all, because the study reported an increase in *rate*, not total expenditure in a day.  You would need additional doses to maintain the increased rate across a longer period of time, but these extra doses would not get you a greater rate.     The only thing to debunk here is your misrepresentation of the paper.  The paper presents a hypothesis and a proposed research study.  You present it as a claim that cold showers have been shown to treat depression and anxiety, which it is not.   Where do you get 200 calories a day from?   Rocket engines carry their own reaction materials (e.g. fuel + oxygen).   https://www.usafreedom.fail/  This page summarizes important points, with links to the relevant sections of the full text.   It is!  I am using the board that generates the control signal and midi, and will scavenge the choke in the power supply.  But the rest is available.  I will try to post pictures later today.   There's a reason this study is not in their list of studies supporting increased metabolic rate in humans at the top of the page - it was conducted with only   eight healthy subjects   all of whom were about 24 years old ("23.4+/-0.8 years").  Incidentally, the authors of this study concluded that   Although significant, the increase in energy expenditure is negligible in terms of weight loss.  How can that be? **10.7%**!!  That 10.7% figure is a misinterpretation; here it is in context, from the abstract of citation 7:  Resting energy expenditure during the last 30 min was 4.5+/-2.5% higher in the placebo trial and 10.7+/-2.5% higher (P0.05) in the caffeine/ephedra trial  This is an error on Examine's part, because they reported the figure as though it represented the difference between normal metabolism and metabolism on ephedrine, which it obviously is not.  The correct figure would be 10.7 - 4.5 = 6.2%, which approximately agrees with the other studies cited in that paragraph.  This increase is in resting energy expenditure, so does not include exercise etc.  So for a normal sized healthy adult you could be looking at 1600kcal * .062 = 100kcal / day according to this study, **if you assume this rate change lasts all day**...which is a huge assumption, and one the authors clearly didn't support, given their conclusion...  Although significant, the increase in energy expenditure is negligible in terms of weight loss.    Can you link?  I've never seen anything reasonably applicable to human use over 5% (which is probably unrealistically high).  edit:  I looked at the two studies examine.com has for EC / ECA stack metabolic rate.  Each study examined the effect of a meal + ephedrine / EC stack on metabolic rate for the hour or few hours after the meal, comparing it to a placebo (just the meal, no drugs).  Only one study gave a quantified difference, which in the best case for non-obese individuals was about a .05 kcal / minute greater increase in metabolic rate post meal with the ephedrine.  .05 x 60 (minutes/hr) x 24 (hrs/day) = 72 calories a day.  But this calculation assumes that the increased rate persists for 24 hours, which is unlikely considering that it was measured just after a meal.  So it seems that the best case at a great stretch with much benefit of the doubt that examine.com's citations can support is about a 75 cal a day increase in metabolic rate.   So, education still requires a teacher.  But what makes you think that that teacher can't be an AI?  [Watch this video of a robot sorting randomly placed batteries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClXfa4stfJM)  This is the work of an AI that currently exists, and can perfectly sort objects in arbitrary two-dimensional arrangements.  It isn't following a pre-programmed motion - it decides how to move to sort the objects presented.  How is the task of teaching different from this?  What is so special about creative thought - what do you think creative thought *is*?  To me it seems obvious that it is different in degree - it is a more sophisticated and complex task - but not in kind.  It's the same kind of problem.  And it can be reduced to a series of deterministic algorithms that an AI can perform as well or better than a human teacher.   Basically any jobs that requires thinking or judgement calls on the fly. Sales, nurses, most skilled trades (electrician, plumbers, etc.), education, law, almost all coding related jobs, analysts, social work, management, etc.  If it requires creative thinking to do, even if rarely, that job probably can't be automated.  Why not?  What do you think is so special about creative thinking and decision making that it can't be done by an adequately sophisticated AI (or AI+ robot)?    The figure I've seen is 4-10% piperine by dry weight.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9619120  in humans after a dose of 2 g curcumin alone, serum levels were either undetectable or very low. Concomitant administration of piperine 20 mg produced much higher concentrations from 0.25 to 1 h post drug (P  0.01 at 0.25 and 0.5 h; P  0.001 at 1 h), the increase in bioavailability was 2000%. The study shows that in the dosages used, piperine enhances the serum concentration, extent of absorption [yada yada yada]  So according to this, at least, about ~300mg of pepper (20-30mg of piperine) increases bioavailability by ~%2000.  That would be a good amount of black pepper - well more than a pinch.  More like a teaspoon or so.  But research is like that - dosage is high to ensure that you can find an effect.  I wouldn't take that figure as a dosage recommendation, but as an upper bound.  This is why I also based my recommendation on common product configurations.  Many use only a few milligrams of piperine (approximately equivalent to a pinch of black pepper).  If 20mg raised bioavailability by 2000%, how much will 5mg raise it?  Could be 2000%, could be 500%, could be 1.4355%.  But for various reasons that have to do with how piperine actually does this (see [this article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3458266/) for more detail), I believe it's quite unlikely that the effect suddenly appears at the fairly massive dose of 20mg but is inadequate at 3-5mg.  ...  I agree with your point about the practicality of dosing turmeric vs isolated curcumin as an antiinflammatory drug - you just need too much curcumin.  You can probably get a useful lifestyle enhancing / lifelong effect by eating curry all the time, but for an acute effect like you would get by taking an ibuprofen, you really should use an extract.  One or two capsules vs several tbsp of turmeric?  Easy choice.  But with piperine, I disagree.  The dose you actually need - not the research dose to confirm an effect exists, the end user dose - just isn't very high.  You can just eat a meal that includes a decent bit of pepper (what meal doesn't) and then dose.  If you're concerned, eat a meal that includes a bit of pepper and then dose with a supplement formulated with piperine for a wider margin.   There are strong relationships between cannabinoids and opioids, cannabinoid receptors and opiate receptors.  The systems seem to work together.  In any case:  a daily hit of endogenous opioids and cannabinoids can be yours for the rest of your life, at the low low cost of half an hour of cardio daily.  http://www.jneurosci.org/content/22/3/1146.full.pdf  http://www.jneurosci.org/content/21/14/5344.full  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3033219  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiological_effects_of_physical_exercise#.CE.B2-Endorphin https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurobiological_effects_of_physical_exercise#Anandamide  etc   Intense exercise may be another good one.  Doesn't work as well if you're out of shape - you have to do some work to get a decent psychoactive effect out of exercise.  But it does work, and via a similar route to opiates (maybe a bonus for you).  I doubt you'll be able to sustain habitual opiate, benzo, or alcohol use in this way without experiencing the ill effects of tolerance and physical dependence.  You'd be better off looking at lifestyle changes.  It takes effort, trial and error, etc...but you can actually gain a substantial, lasting positive change in your mood, motivation, attentive abilities, memory, and so on.  No drug habit will do that for you.   /r/hailcorporate   You need a lot of turmeric and a very little bit of black pepper, judging by the ratios that are common in research and offered curcumin/piperidine supplements.  Think 2tbsp turmeric and a tiny pinch of black pepper.  Take it after a meal that contains fat.  If you're anything like me, a few doses of that will get you thinking about buying a curcumin supplement in capsule form.  Turmeric contains ~2% to 4% curcumin, and you want a few hundred milligrams of curcumin to get a decent dose; that 2tbsp dose above was probably a bit small.  This stuff is pretty cheap if you shop online and know how to find a good deal; a potent curcumin/piperidine supplement can replace ibuprofen in your medicine cabinet and is worth a little cash imo.   Yes, fuck yohimbine.  Not safe in this combination.   CUTTING RAGE STRIKES AGAIN  CAN"T EAT MUST DESTROY NOOBS    does ECA stacks actually burn fat by themselves, or does it only cut your appetite?  It's a little of each.  It increases your resting metabolism a little bit (~50 calories a day), gives you a moderate energy boost, and usually destroys your appetite.  In practice, the increased energy and appetite suppression are the primary benefit.  It might not sound important now, but if you're actually dieting into a caloric deficit, that boost could make the difference between doing a decent cardio workout today and not; the appetite suppression can make the difference between actually dieting at a 500cal deficit and nibbling away 200 calories of it because you're hungry and bored.  That kind of thing actually adds up over a few weeks into a difference in fat loss   Can't read the article without registering.   Well said; I concur.  Better to err on the side of more philosophical discourse than less.   I think this is a fair point.  I dismissed the question above as misplace because I honest do not believe that the OP is seeking the kind of answers that would come from an actual philosophical inquiry into the question.  OP wants to know whether people who have had experience X ever end up having experience Y afterward.  That isn't an ideological question - it's an empirical question.  So it seems to me that the kind of answer OP wants - whether this phenomenon occurs or does not - is an answer from science, and not from academic philosophy.   I'd be happy to answer that - I think it's an interesting question.  But first: what does the word philosophy mean to you?   Sure...but this question isn't particularly relevant to the discipline of academic philosophy.  As others suggested, you'll probably get a better discussion in a sub that's about personal transformation etc.   Congratulations. :)   Any of the classical psychedelics (LSD, mushrooms, cacti / mescaline, DMT, ayahuasca).  Your intention and setting are important, as any of these substances could be used in low or moderate doses for entertainment as well.  If you have suffered any significant trauma in your life, are anxious or depressed, etc, then MDMA would be as likely as anything above to induce a life-changing experience.  It may be better to start here if you're inexperienced and seeking positive change to a painful life situation, as MDMA has a strong positive push to it that can clear a lot of obstacles that could be quite difficult for an inexperienced person to handle on psychedelics.  You must test any chemical substance (e.g. MDMA, LSD, mescaline, DMT) before use to determine that it is what it's been claimed to be.   I recently tried 3.5 grams of cubensis with much the same outcome--a come up really similar to the come up I get on MDMA, some minor visuals (textures, movement in things that are already patterned in "the real world," some slight trails) but the trip was really mild, really short...  This sounds like what many people would experience on a dose of 1.5 or 2 grams.  You could try taking 5 grams or so, see if anything changes.  Some people seem to require higher doses.  I have yet to find anybody who is naturally immune (but have met many who have temporary SSRI induced immunity, etc).  But first you should determine whether another substance you're taking is interfering, as this is a very common reason to have blunted or absent effects from psychedelics.  What medications, drugs, supplements, etc. had you taken recently when these experiences occurred?   Don't be silly.  The correct labeling of supplements depends on local regulation.  Looks like they're required to list the weight of the individual tabs and the total weight of the package contents, and that these figures are not intended to show the dosage (which is presumably listed in Chinese elsewhere on the label).   Don't freak out; you probably just need to know a little more Chinese to find the actual dose.  Extremely unlikely that they are selling tabs made of pure melatonin; 500mg is about how much a typical packed 0 capsule weighs.]  Why don't you show us a picture of the rest of the label?   It seems reasonably likely that the actual dose is written elsewhere on the package in Chinese, and that the 500mg per tablet 30g per package is a measurement of total mass, not the dosage.   This may be the winning answer.  It seems highly unlikely that these tabs actually contain 500mg of melatonin. A well packed 0 size capsule often weighs about this much total.   Have you abandoned your claim that the lack of non-human animal civilization is conclusive evidence that non-human intelligent animals are less intelligent than humans?   The story in that link is unlikely to be true; the behavior described is extremely unprofessional, and unlike anything I've heard or experienced of pre-employment testing procedures.  Results are not usually available until a couple of business days after specimen collection, and are not shared by word of mouth to the applicant, but through paperwork delivered to the *employer*.  If that's the only evidence against the product, and you have good reason to trust it, you should not be concerned.    I'm looking to know about when I will be able to pass an accurate urine drug test, ways to speed up the process, or cheat the system.   You can't speed up the rate at which your body eliminates THC and its metabolites by any appreciable amount.  Don't waste your time and effort trying.  What you can do is cheat the system.  If your parents are going to test your urine with a kit they bought, you can probably fool this by drinking an extra gallon or two of water the day of the test (or every day until they test, if the day is unknown).  Also, you should not give the first urine of the day for testing.  Make some excuse to ensure that you can give a dilute sample.  If you're going to have to pass a real drug test, done by a lab, then you should follow [this tried and true method](https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/33vb0i/i_have_to_pass_a_drug_test_in_three_weeks_and_i/cqop3vx) if you have time, or else find a way to substitute fake or another person's urine.  I only smoke once every weekend  Oh, haha.  Actually, you can probably pass any test within a week if you follow the dilution method linked above.  Don't bother messing around with fake sample substitution.  Just delay for a week, follow the link above, and you'll pass anything.   Yes, of course intelligence does not cause civilization.  But do you understand why your argument is flawed?  However, some intelligence is obviously not sufficient, as there are many intelligent species that have not created civilization  You're assuming that the lack of non-human animal civilization is evidence of a lack of non-human animal intelligence, and ignoring all the other possible explanations of why non-human animals have not created civilization.   *Might* is the key word here.  You have no idea whether this is true, and have presented no evidence to suggest that it is true.  By comparison, there is ample evidence that bottle-nose dolphins possess similar cognitive abilities to our own.  Why not look at any of the other differences between human and non-human intelligent animals?  Of those animals known to have advanced cognitive abilities and complex social structures, humans are the only ones with hands.  Perhaps civilization can only occur if you have appendages that can be used to build complex tools.  edit:  Intelligence can be presumed as a prerequisite for forming a civilization.  Yes.  some intelligence is obviously not sufficient, as there are many intelligent species that have not created civilization  No.  You are arguing that   A is needed for B  B has not occurred  Therefore, A has not occurred.  This logic is faulty.  Consider this:  Wood is required for a fire.  Fire has not occurred.  Therefore, there is no wood.  But what if I had wood, but no spark?  Then this argument would produce a false conclusion.    Not necessarily... we only have one example of human-like high intelligence, i.e. with the capacity to create a civilization.  Hmm.  Perhaps I misunderstood you.  The abbreviation "i.e." essentially means "in other words."  I took you to mean that in your view, the fact that humans created civilization shows that their cognitive capacity is beyond that of any other species that has not created civilization.  This conclusion obviously does not follow, as intelligence does not require civilization creating capacities.  There is plenty of scientific literature on the various cognitive, social, and perceptual abilities of human and non-human animals.  It does not support your assertion that intelligence in any broad sense can be adequately modeled as a continuum, nor that humans are far more advanced than all other known intelligent species.   edit:  Even within human beings, intelligence cannot be modeled as a continuum.  The closest you can really get is a collection of continuous measures.  These might be used to derive a single IQ for practical purposes (e.g. predicting whether a child will need special education), but that IQ is only a summary of a series of variables used as indexes of various cognitive capacities (e.g. spatial visualization) - which are themselves indexes of still more specific capacities (e.g. mentally rotating a 2-dimensional figure).   It's easy to condemn people over the internet from the comfort of your home, or on your phone as you go freely about your day.  I saw the contradictions in his letter, too.  But how can I hate this person for regretting actions that have put him through the last year and a half of imprisonment and trial, and which will now take at least the next twenty years from him?  That is incredibly cold, and incredibly naive.  You should go commit some non-violent crime that puts you in jail for a month, and then see if you can still be so callous.   we only have one example of human-like high intelligence  It is extremely unlikely that this is true; that you offer this as an unqualified, unsupported claim suggests that you are ignorant of the scientific literature on this topic.  Although the suggestion that octopuses are a comparable intelligence is unlikely to be true, there are two other groups of species containing members whose intelligence may be approximately equivalent to our own: toothed whales and elephants.  Most of the scientific evidence we formerly used to justify human cognitive supremacy (e.g. brain-body size ratios, cortical convolution and relative surface area) can just as easily support the cognitive supremacy of bottle-nosed dolphins, for example.  Here's an article that discusses toothed whale intelligence and seems especially relevant to the thread:  [Dolphin social intelligence: complex alliance relationships in bottlenose dolphins and a consideration of selective environments for extreme brain size evolution in mammals](http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/362/1480/587.short)   Sure - the metaphor only goes so far.  But your argument depends on inevitable expropriation being a good enough reason not to even *try* establishing new ways to express the idea of anarchism.  Doesn't that seem a bit ridiculous, considering that every useful thing has a finite (and often quite short) lifespan?   That is true.  It's also true that psilocin is quite unstable and most of it is lost on drying.  You're really just looking at small effects like gastric emptying time (slower absorption from whole mushrooms vs. isolated compound or tea) and traces of baeocystin as probable mechanisms for some minor difference in effect.  Every time I've used mushrooms was distinct from every other time I've used mushrooms, despite obvious consistencies.  The same holds for LSD and all other psychedelics I've taken more than once.  I wouldn't expect myself to be able to distinguish the difference between 4 AcO and mushroom tea.  	104
 Alright, so is that going to require taking anything major out?   I was in a spot where I needed to force cold air into the engine, that's what I had to do. I didn't come here for support with my decisions, I came here for help. It's applicable to the problem so I included it. From what I've read it should cool down when I rev the engine or go around 60 if its the fan clutch right? I shouldn't have to hit 100mph to get results. I feel like it cooled down there because there was so much air going into the engine. Is there a definite way to tell if it's one or the other without tearing it apart? I live in an apartment complex that doesn't care for me disassembling my car in the parking lot lol   Yep.   I noticed they were using the "Roman candle" for their spells. It's good, but I think it's a bit reckless considering you cannot turn them off. The "flare gun" item has a lower rate of fire, but the damage is much higher.   Well the strength skill will be phenomenal also, but I'm not sure which career skill he'd have time for. I have heard that it's possible for a player to incorporate those skills into a career tree but it isn't easy.   If you aren't picky go for the machining skill tree. I've always been in it, you learn skills that can branch out into other skills like metallurgy, electrical, maintenance, and other kinds of things. Good say to grind currency too, in the US server I've averaged 16.00 an hour!   I had a similar experience, I was just drinking some vodka for the happiness buff and my frame rate dropped insanely low. Like we're talking black screen except for a minute every couple hours. Next thing I know I've spawned at this stone query (fortunately I didn't lose any gear) and my pre 2000 update vehicle I just grinded currency for was missing its bumper. The devs really need to work on this.   Yeah I heard something about the vampire boss thing, but I'm pretty sure they changed it to a hand-spear type weapon in an update following this sword. Apparently the boss was really op so they put in a stronger weapon to counter it. I'm pretty sure they removed the vampire boss completely around the time of the firearm update (at the very latest).   Know if they'll be restocking?   I gotta have that thing Lol. Does anyone know if its going to be sold separately?   Well, the car won't cool down until I hit over 100 so I think the fan clutch is probably okay. Is there a way to check the radiator? That is comparably easy to get out of the car if I can check that out   I have a 94 bmw 325i that's overheating, it seems to be leaking a small bit of oil but not too much. I think it's the water pump but that thing is an absolute nightmare to get to. Is there a way to troubleshoot it to see if that is actually the problem?  May be worth noting that the thermostat was not working but I replaced it... Still overheating though. I think maybe the overheating from the thermostat may have melted the plastic impeller on the water pump. Is there anything else I should look into in addition to that? NTB did a pressure check and said it was holding pressure, if that helps at all.   Think 16 gb of ram will do it? I'm in the midst of building my pc so that's all I have ATM. I plan on adding another 16 gb and a much better graphics card eventually but that's neither here nore there lol   I'm really into mmorpg's but can't find any free ones I like. Can anyone suggest anything? Please not runescape, that has taken more money and time from my youth that any other game combined..   Did they add another area to mobile? I've got the pc and mobile version but the last I played the phone version they only had the first area.    Geez calm down no need to yell   BE PATIENT?!?! I'LL BE PATIENT WHEN I WANNA BE PATIENT! HOW DARE YOU EXPECT ME TO WAIT FOR A THING!   If you play any instruments this would make a decent dampener to reduce echo when recording. That would be my excuse anyway..   :c   I named my son chair, is it the same thing?   Can confirm, need pics of lack of penis.   Truth be told I haven't seen the herakles yet. I'm more of an arctic kinda guy myself Lol   https://m.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2zwr5e/can_some_one_tell_me_why_it_is_dangerous_to_use/    pretty good starting point...

 You are a one righteous dude, Jim!   Since you're a vet, I highly recommend you contact the Red Cross in SLC and reach their veteran mentoring division. They might have a list of vet friendly companies that could be hiring now. And if you fall on hard times, they can definitely put you in touch with the right people (VA, VSOs, etc).  I work for said division in Provo, so feel free to PM me :)   To be frank, they're not that bad.   Apocalips Now sounds like a good name for a certain type of movie...   They're politically active or work (or want to work) in the non-profit sector. Swoons me instantly.   Someone here said they wouldn't date people who enjoy weaving 17th century French baskets. I lost my shit, yo.   Yup. The imgur extension for Chrome does this really easily.   Besides what others have suggested, you could maybe see if they list certain authors that are related to the arts.    The Underground Railroad, though it didn't destroy slavery, certainly aided a lot of people to freedom. And Woman's Suffrage (in the US) worked.      Just don't overuse it. It can get annoying if you do that. Otherwise, whatever.    Share you profile.    I've had work come up and cancel the same date on me twice. It happens.

On a second look, the CBPP's look a little higher than Heritage's, depending on how you define entitlements.   So are the numbers correct or is something amiss? I always thought the CB was a neutral group, but you seem to be indicating the numbers are different. What sources are you referring to?   Which technicalities?   Is the CBPP not trustworthy? They show similar numbers. I thought they were a neutral source.    http://goo.gl/Lq57Ev  What's wrong with the numbers? Is the CBPP doing their data wrong?

Not they shouldn't have their say, but they shouldn't try and control the legislature.   I appreciate Mormons themselves though.    Why?   Tree fiddy.    Anything special about it? Never heard of it.    Yes, they're national, but they're only in one or two cities and not spread out across a whole state. I think that makes them kind of local.    My best guess is ceremonies and parades. Can't see any other reason.    Lynn might be, but Salem and Peabody are definitely not. They're pretty safe and affordable.     This is why I moved away from Mass. Too expensive and the job market sucks. Both of those need to change.    *Into The Wild* will make you want to drop everything and go hitchhiking across a country.    Ah, thought it was Utah. My bad!

Someone posted here inquiring as to what the building actually was, since it still seemed to be maintained, yet no children were ever spotted near the building. /r/conspiracy eventually picked it up, and started an investigation as to what the building was actually being used for.

I did, at only the age of twenty. Didn't win, and didn't intend to win, but it was a starting point.    I've only received two out of the blue messages from woman. Responded to both. So...100% response rate?   Lots of call centers and a lot of IT type jobs. Construction and trucking seem to be big too. Good amount of NGOs are stationed here if that's your thing. It's really not hard to find something that pays the bills (rent in SLC and the surrounding area is very cheap, like $400/mo for a room). Within a month of moving here I got several interviews and call backs.   You can check out this site to get a feel for what's available: http://www.ksl.com/jobs   If possible, there's always moving. I moved to an area where jobs fall out of the sky. Of course that's not possible for everyone, but if it's an option, take it.  Edit: For reference, I'm in Salt Lake City, where there are "Hiring" billboards and signs dotted across the land. Yes, actual "Hiring" billboards.   No, but, if we are to have positions of any sort we must be prepared to defend them. To question ourselves constantly assures us our reasoning is sound. To blindly go around claiming things without knowing what backs them up doesn't make one a good thinker.   This is how it is with my new job as well. We're allowed one unexcused day, and after that there's possible disciplinary action, though we have some added protection due to unionization.    I'll never forget a pair of JW missionaries coming to my door. I was listening to them politely until one of them mentioned JW's were the only faith to send missionaries out worldwide. I brought up the Mormons doing the same thing, and the two seemed generally confused. almost defensive about their claim. Was very weird.    I'm too good for this world. And too cheap.

Best advice: learn their stories, be mindful, and don't get upset when they disagree with you. Many of these servicemen have be mishandled by the military or the government (and in the case of the US, the VA).   To bring them to the ideas of statelessness, connect their ideas of patriotism (if they are patriots) and steer that towards a love not just of their own country, but for a love of all mankind.    The US government is the most well armed force on the planet. To take on such a foe would require a great amount of strength, and an even greater amount of sympathy from those within the ranks of the Feds (military, politicians, DEA, FBI, etc). Local police forces would also have to be convinced to join the site of the rebels rather than the side that funds their pensions.   The US, being so large and diverse, would also have to find some unifying factor for rebels to be supported by a grand majority. This factor would bring together conservatives, progressives, radicals, and the apolitical alike.   Such a rebellion would also have to be very well organized, or so popular that so many come on board the cause that taking on the US military could possibility result in victory.   Be mindful that if we're talking civilian versus army, these means that it's guns versus tanks, fighters, war ships, and missiles.    So, a rebellion could take place, but a successful one would be hard to come by.       You could try Americorps VISTA or one of their other programs.  After serving with them you become eligible for an education award (the amount depends on your length of service, which can generally go up to a year). I'm actually with Americorps myself, and after a few months of part time work I'll be eligible for a $2k education award. If I served a full year, that number would be about $5k.   Or find a company that does tuition reimbursement.    Do it. Getting that degree allows you to enter not only into fields that will feed you better, but fields that are also more benefitial to your community, like non-profit work.   http://vocaroo.com/  Sound recording site.   I have faith in God, and follow Christ as my teacher. However, I don't need clergy for these beliefs. To me, any belief is fine, but religious hierarchy is destructive towards one's own way to God.    I applied for a VISTA position in Wyoming, and was one of only two people to apply. So there's that.   When I was living in Wyoming I made a 7 hour drive down to Denver (I think she only accepted the date because I was punny, and she didnt realize I was in a different state for some reason). It was totally worth it.  Now that I'm just near Salt Lake City, I'd say a two hour drive is my maximum. which I've done a few times.    I just fantasize about getting my own apartment with rabbits and cats to keep me company. One day...   For what it's worth, during the Civil Rights Movement there were some Return To Africa groups pushing for black Americans to go back to their ancestral land (and these were run by black Americans, such as the father of one Malcolm X). The effect of that movement was negligible.     Submission Comment:  According to the author, Jeb Bush has a staunch history of being an active conservative governor on things like education and the Second Amendment, yet Republicans seem to often ignore this, either due to ignorance, or his "non-conservative" stances on immigration and Common Core. The article shows how tough Bush will have it come 2016.      For VISTA, you will definitely become poor, and you will grow to embrace it (unless you have a killer amount of savings in your bank). My stipend was $900/mo, and rent was about $400/mo, which gave me $500 to things like food, clothing, and entertainment. Wasn't terribly hard to live by, but it was a struggle on occasion.  Also, if you're a first year VISTA like I was (NGOs can host a VISTA up to three consecutive years), you'll be breaking ground for the organization, so expect some bumps along the way.  	110
 If I can't find out how many calories something contains, I don't eat it. Simple as that. This is why I almost never eat out, most restaurants/restaurant chains don't have the nutritional information of their products available, and even when they do, sometimes it doesn't make the food they sell nutritionally optimal still. There is no secret to changing your body, and knowing how many calories you are ingesting daily is the absolute most important thing by far, and so some sacrifices must be made... and yes, one of these sacrifices is avoiding things of which you cannot figure out the caloric content. I'm sure that's not what you wanted to hear, but it's the truth.    Honestly, there is no magic solution. In order to get workouts in everyday, to keep track of your caloric intake and nutrient breakdown everyday, to prepare all your meals everyday, to make sure you get enough sleep everyday, which are all key to changing your physique, it takes a certain level of dedication. Such a level of dedication is not acquired in an instant, it takes time, sometimes years before you can get to the point where you can do this. People like to think that you can wake up one day and, just like that, start living a strict lifestyle. That might be true for some, but in my experience, the discipline and ability to work hard consistently that are necessary are definitely not acquired overnight. I've been training for almost a decade now, and once in a while I still miss a workout or mess up my caloric intake. But one thing for sure, the longer you wait to start, and the longer it will take you to get where you want to be.    Yes, people with the thrifty phenotype.    Caffeine doesn't increase appetite, I did answer that. Also, caffeine isn't technically physically addictive. You can get 'addicted' to caffeine just like people get addicted to eating certain foods or watching certain TV shows.    Personally, I love caffeine when I'm cutting, because it allows me to maintain my overall energy level and the intensity of my workouts despite eating less nutrients. I like to combine caffeine with another stimulant/sympathomimetic drug, such as Ephedrine HCL, Synephrine HCL or Methylhexanamine. I find that they work synergistically and give me a good energy boost before an intense workout. Caffeine or stimulants at large shouldn't increase hunger or appetite, on the contrary, stimulants tend to aid in weight loss. Firstly, they do so by increasing ATP production via an increase in body temperature, which further increases metabolic rate, thus heating up the mitochondria of the cells and therefore further increasing body temperature as well, and with this you get a full-circle effect that promotes free fatty acid utilization. Secondly, they actually suppress appetite, since they increase the release of the leptin hormone from fat cells via increased thermogenesis (like previously discussed), which reduces appetite.    If anyone is interested, the full paper can be accessed here:  http://libgen.org/scimag/index.php?s=A%20Human%20Thrifty%20Phenotype%20Associated%20With%20Less%20Weight%20Loss%20During%20Caloric%20Restriction  The paper is called 'A Human Thrifty Phenotype Associated With Less Weight Loss During Caloric Restriction', it's from the American Diabetes Association.  Basically, they found that there are two types of weight loss phenotypes: a 'spendthrift' and a 'thrifty' one, and, given the same caloric deficit, those with the thrifty one will lose less fat.   Quote from the paper's Discussion section:  'We have described for the first time that obese individuals with a spendthrift phenotype lost the most weight during 6 weeks of CR. A 1% smaller 24h-EE decrease during fasting (range 25.3% to 212.1%) led to a larger energy deficit of 124 kcal/day, or a greater cumulative energy loss of more than 5,000 kcal over the 6-week time period. A 124-kcal/day smaller energy deficit in the thrifty phenotype is equivalent to the amount of energy expenditure reduction caused by a melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) gene mutation in Pima Indians (;110140 kcal/day) (26), which predisposes these individuals to obesity (27).'    I'm looking for reliable information. Science isn't always right, but it's self-correcting and still the most available source of information that society has.    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25843057  The effects of dietary protein and amino acids on skeletal metabolism, Jessica D. Bihuniak, Molecular and Cellular Endocrinology (2015), doi: 10.1016/j.mce.2015.03.024   To quote the review study:  ' Findings from a short-term amino acid supplementation trial in older adults suggest that different groups of amino acids induce opposing effects on IGF-1 (Fig. 2; Dawson-Hughes et al., 2007). Supplementation with the branched chain amino acids, isoleucine and leucine, caused a reduction in serum levels of this growth factor, while the aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and histidine, increased IGF-1 levels. Milk contains greater amounts of phenylalanine and lower quantities of isoleucine compared to meat products such as beef and chicken (Sosulski and Imafidon, 1990). The amino acid profile of milk may therefore be more conducive to supporting a rise in circulating IGF-1 levels.'  Numerous studies have correlated circulating levels of IGF-1 and growth hormone with adiposity:  http://ajpendo.physiology.org/content/295/2/E385.article-info  Lower growth hormone and higher cortisol are associated with greater visceral adiposity, intramyocellular lipids, and insulin resistance in overweight girls.

That's what I do. I'm never satisfied, and so I'll never stop working hard. Not a bad thing.    Injected some GHRP/GHRH, took an amino acid supplement, then went for my 30 min morning cardio. The calorie burn was insane, almost quantifiable... Then, I switched to an isocaloric diet recently, so I had some homemade pancakes made with almond flour, cottage cheese, liquid egg white and chocolate whey protein powder. Tasty! This day started off very well! No goal in sight for now, just want to keep getting leaner and leaner while maintaining muscular tissue.    The amazing things about this research report is the fact that there were no side effects and, most importantly, the method of administration used (intranasal). Of course the anabolic properties of GHRP are nothing new, but that's not the point.   This is one of the house in the Salem spawn on World of Keralis. You can easily check it out yourself.       Andesite looks good with everything.                   Yep. I don't know too much about Buddhism sadly, but didn't he go from thin to fat and then to thin again and that was supposed to have some symbolic meaning? Not sure if that makes sense.    To be honest I don't even know what it means to be happy. I mean, I know how well-being is produced in the brain, but happiness as an abstract concept, I have no idea how to define that.    Knowledge isn't happiness, on the contrary, knowledge has made me feel all the more cynical and lonely in my short lifetime. The more I acquire knowledge, and the more I look down on people in general. I don't want to feel this way and I know it's not right, but I can't help it. But knowledge is also success and power, and I like to think that these two things can eventually be used to achieve happiness, even though I'm not sure about that. I just need to find how to make the bridge between the two. I guess that's the next step. Making the bridge between knowledge and happiness.    I get your overall point, but I'm not sure what's wrong with the word 'adipose'. It's just a word that comes from the New Latin word *adiposus*, which means 'fatty'. Adipose tissue is just the connective tissue the body uses to store nutrients it cannot use for energy. I'm not sure why you have a problem with that word.   Also, I'm not sure what you mean by 'dangerous'.    I know that, no matter what, it'll never be enough. I will probably train and diet all my life, and never find the body that I'm looking for and that I correlate with my own happiness. And therefore, I feel like I'll never be happy, and the thought scares me. I'll never have the low body fat percentage that I want. I'll never be as muscular as I want. My diet will never be as good as I want. My training will never be as on point as I want.   People keep commenting on my progress, and keep telling me how well I seem to be doing. But it doesn't seem to matter, I'm still never finding myself satisfied. It feels like I'm in an endless loop, like I'm walking an endless path with an unreachable destination. I call it 'trying to find Neverland', or, in other words, looking for something that will never exist.   Am I the only one who feels this way?    Feel proud, you just avoided a ton of needless fast-digesting carbohydrates and LDL cholesterol fats!   I hate the state of being fat, but I blame society, not individuals. People are ignorant because our system doesn't raise them properly. People's life habits in general are disastrous and they pass them down to their children, resulting in a vicious circle that is hard to break from.    Eat more dietary fibers (they slow digestion and keep you full longer), make your meals more satisfying, maybe by eating more but less often as well.    Agreed. When I started losing weight, it was only for myself. Now I want to show what I've done to others so I can show them that it's definitely possible and not out of anyone's reach.    I would suggest sticking to eating less until you are at a weight that allows you to exercise more safely. At your weight, you can lose fat efficiently enough through dieting alone.    Personally, I keep my beliefs about nutrition and exercise a secret. I don't ever talk about it. Most people are ignorant about the basic biochemical principles behind nutrient science, and my friends and relatives are no exception. And I don't feel like trying to educate them on things that that they don't really want to learn. When people are young, it's easy to teach them things (I know, because I've worked as an elementary school teacher, and kids themselves are rarely the problem), but as they become adults, people become more wrapped up in their own beliefs and close minded and it's more difficult to change these beliefs. As a result, most people have ridiculous food related beliefs and food has become a taboo subject on the same level as religion and politics in society. So, personally, when food topics come up, I either don't get involved or make random generic bullshit-ish comments.   I guess my best advice is: don't say anything. Resent those around you for being foolish, but don't let them know how you feel. Just do your own thing, and keep getting progress... when others see it, it will speak for you better than words ever could.    Personally, I prefer the mental pain of being hungry over the days or even weeks of guilt that always follow eating good that I'm not supposed to. That's why I make my meals as filling and satisfying as possible, and if I'm hungry, I prefer to suffer from not giving in. Knowing that I stick to my goals and that I keep control of my life helps me be stronger mentally, so it's not too bad.    I think you can easily find one on your own with a quick Google search. But the best advice I can give you is to educate yourself on how to perform the main compound weight lifting exercises. Compound exercises are ones that use a lot of muscle groups at once, such as the squat, the deadlift, the bench/dumbell press, etc., and they are at the center of most HIIT style weight lifting routines, since they are quite effective for maximizing number of calories burned and muscular mass and strength gains.    Weight lifting is actually how I started losing weight many years ago. Now I do cardio as well, but for cardiovascular health. In my experience, HIIT style training (doing heavy compound exercises (squats, deadlifts, etc) with little rest), which is a form of training that combines weight lifting and cardio, combined with a caloric deficit, is the best and most efficient time way to lose weight. Your workouts are short but extremely intense, and no need to spend hours doing traditional cardio, such as running outside or on a treadmill. Also, this method of training boosts the metabolic rate of free fatty acid utilization, meaning you burn nutrients faster long after your workout, even at rest.   Nowadays I do fasted morning cardio and lift weights 6-7 days a week, but mainly because I enjoy it. Fasted cardio is good at lower body fat percentages, to force the body to use body fat when it otherwise wouldn't since your stomach is empty. You can train everyday or every 2 days depending on how you do it, what mostly matters is diet and getting enough sleep.         Tom Platz was my motivation growing up as an aspiring bodybuilding teenager, and he still is!  Guy is a freaking legend!    If you drink alcohol and stay within your caloric intake, then it real makes no difference compared to ingesting nutrients. But the real problem with alcohol is that it makes being at a caloric surplus much, much worse than normal... The body sees alcohol as a poison that it must break down first, and the enzymes responsible for breaking down foods cannot do their job as usual because they are busy breaking down ethanol. In other words, your metabolism is disrupted, which results in a significant increase in the fat tissue uptake rate of triglycerides. Yep, alcohol is quite horrible for the body. :/   I find that the removing unhealthy foods part is especially important, too. Of course if there's chocolate bars and ice cream in your house you're going to be tempted. But if there are none available, much easier to not eat them!    One way I stopped eating fast foods and other 'unhealthy' foods was removing all of such foods from my house and always buying and preparing my food for the entire week ahead of time. Sundays are my food prep days, and I take 3-4 hours of my day to recalculate my TDEE, make my caloric intake and nutrient breakdown for the week, make a list of food products, go to the grocery store, buy all those products, and then cook and weight all the food. And every single day of the week, from Monday to Sunday, I know what's going to be in every meal because that's what's been planned and there's literally nothing else to eat in the house.   I also make sure to make meals that are tasty, satisfying to eat and fiber rich enough to avoid cravings, and use some food seasonings, such as calorie free sugar and calorie free spicy sauce. My diet tends to mostly be made up of white meat (chicken, tilapia, salmon, scallops), starchy vegetables (yam, squash, parsnips, peas, asparagus), oats, egg products (both whole eggs and liquid egg white) and some fiber rich fruits (raspberries, blackberries, apples).    I just don't think it's effective to maintain. You want your body to constantly grow and adapt, and maintaining homeostatic balance is the best to ensure this never happens anymore. Instead, you want your body to be in a state of perpetual shock, by being at either a deficit or a surplus all of the time. As someone who's interested in being both lean and muscular, that's my opinion anyway.    There is two reasons as to why society is becoming incredibly obese:  1) Genetic variances amongst individuals in various physiological processes, that is, hormones, hormonal relationships, neural pathways, etc;  2) Deeply rooted cultural practices that relate to eating behaviors.  Neither of these will change within our lifetimes. It will take long for societies to change their cultural practices, and considerably longer for our species to change its physiology in the face of the evolutionary mismatch that people's harmful life habits are nowadays. And by 'considerably longer' I mean possibly tens of thousands of years.     I look down on the state of being overweight, because, from an evolutionary perspective, humans were never meant to store this many nutrients in adipose tissue. This adaptive trait was never meant to be taken to the harmful extent that it has been in recent history.  But I do not blame individuals, I blame society. As a kid, I was overweight, because I was ignorant, as are all humans when they are born, and there was no one to teach me. Growing up, I was lucky enough to learn and acquire knowledge on my own, and as a result I changed my life habits and got rid of all the excess triglycerides in my fat cells.   Most laypeople do not even understand the basic principles behind the biochemistry of nutrients, and so they have no idea how or what to eat. In fact, most people don't even know what a nutrient is to begin with... Even worse, most people are not only ignorant, but also proud of their own ignorance. In my eyes, obesity is merely one of the many outcomes of that. Ignorance is a vicious circle; obese people who don't see the issues with their ways pass down their ignorance to their offspring, therefore also likely passing them their unfavorable genetic baggage in the process. This is the cycle of life.   But there is nothing we can do. Widespread ignorance is, like I said, a vicious circle, and societies throughout history have not only failed to break it, but have also been victims of it. I don't worry, however, because I know that, in the long run, life will run its course as it always has; many generations of metabolically abnormal people will live on, until they are slowly and surely replaced by those whose physiology has adapted to today's ignorant eating habits. Until then, all we can do, the few of us who were lucky enough to learn, is watch as the masses are slowly killing themselves with their harmful life habits.      Yeah, my bad. I should have said cardio and resistance training, not weight lifting. My brain tends to associate resistance training with weight training, but weight lifting is merely one example of resistance training.    2lb per week is a 1000 daily calorie deficit. If you have a TDEE of 3500, you have a high weight with a low body fat percentage. Even people who have a high weight due to being morbidly obese do not have such a high TDEE.    In order to eat 2500 calories and stil lose 2lb a week, you would have to be insanely heavy and muscular. 1500 sounds much more realistic.    I suffer from hunger while thinking of how I can make my meals more satisfying the next day. Simple as that. I prefer enduring mental pain over going above my target caloric intake.    I think lifting weights is much more time efficient for weight loss than spending hours walking outside or on a treadmill. If you are so out of shape that walking is the only thing you can do, then like you said, you might as well skip exercising altogether and stick to eating less until you drop down to a weight that allows you to exercise more easily.    Glycemic index is inaccurate. You need to look at the glycemic load, which is the result of a formula that takes into account both how quickly a food is digested (a.k.a the glycemic index) and how much sugar it actually contains. To illustrate my point, if you base yourself on the GI alone, carrots appear unhealthy, because they are digested quickly, but in reality they are fairly healthy because very little sugar is actually digested. Lower glycemic load does not necessarily mean less sugar, although she obviously needs to cut down on foods that are rich in sugar and devoid of everything else, because those obviously have an insanely high glycemic load, since there is nothing to slow down the digestion of copious amounts of monosaccharides. But, for example, foods that are rich in sugar but also in dietary fibers (which slow down digestion), such as certain fruits, are completely fine. An example of a low glycemic load fruit is the strawberry.     Not necessarily, but yes, it can involve supersets.    HIIT is basically weight lifting and cardio combined. You lift weights, but at a high pace, and with lots of volume and little rest. It doesn't have to be 'insanely hard', and it can definitely be adapted to one's own physical abilities.    Nice! Congratulations!   You don't really to cut sugar down. You need to cut calories down, rather. Also, diabetics and people with related metabolic abnormalities do not need to refrain from eating sugar. But their body cannot metabolize glucose normally due to improper insulin response, and the outcome of that is what's dangerous, so they need to watch how their body responds to sugar ingestion more carefully. Also, you need to realize that, just like you controlled your own destiny by getting there, you can also control it to start from where you are and reach a healthier destination. Diabetes is likely caused by a mix of unfavorable genetic baggage and insulin resistance developed as a result of prolonged periods of being at positive caloric balance and eating high glycemic load foods. But it can definitely be controlled by eating a well balanced diet and exercising regularly. Your destiny is still very much in your own hands.    Lifting weights with your arms will not 'tone' your arm fat. Losing body fat will tone your arm fat, along with fat proportionally on the rest of your body. And it doesn't matter if you're eating 'healthier' or not, eating 'healthier' will only help you lose weight insofar as it puts you at a daily caloric deficit, just like exercising. You could do no exercise whatsoever and eat only junk food, and if you end everyday with a negative energy balance, you will lose weight. I'm not saying don't exercise or eat junk food, but my point is that caloric intake is mostly what matters. Also, there is no such thing as 'healthy' and 'unhealthy', because nutrients on their own are harmless. Rather, it's about the overall nutrient choices. Sorry if I come off as rude, but the whole healthy/unhealthy thing is, from a scientific perspective, meaningless bullshit that society has been trying to shove down people's throats in recent years.    Going vegetarian for ethical reasons and to protest against what our society is doing nowadays with animals, I can understand. But for weight loss, it's absolutely pointless. If anything, you're making it harder on yourself, because proteins and fats are most easily found in meat/animal food products. In order to lose weight, you need a caloric deficit and a well balanced diet of proteins, carbohydrates, fats and micro nutrients, and where you get those from is largely irrelevant. I applaud you for your weight loss, but you didn't lose weight because you 'went vegetarian', but rather because, like I said, you went on a daily caloric deficit and had a diet that prevented you from being too hungry.   It's nice to share your achievements as a means of helping others, but it's less nice to try and spread ignorance in the process.    If I had to choose between cardio and weight lifting for weight loss, I would choose the latter. In my experience HIIT style training is the absolute best way to lose weight and by far. When I started losing weight, I was just eating a daily caloric deficit and doing heavy compound HIIT training (squats, deadlifts, etc, with high volume and little rest), and no 'traditional' cardio, and I lost over 40 pounds. Now I do cardio, but I do it mainly for - you won't believe it - cardiovascular health, and also because, when you have low body fat, doing cardio on a empty stomach increases your metabolism's free fatty acid utilization rate quite significantly.    Define 'fast food'...    This depends on many factors.   Not all foods are digested at the same speed. Not all forms of physical activity use the same sources of energy and at the same rate. For the average person, though, it won't make a huge difference, and if your goal is merely to reduce body fat percentage, it's more important in the long run to slowly but surely reduce daily caloric intake. Sure, though, you are definitely correct in that most people do not have the same energy requirements everyday,  and this is partly why their weight tends to fluctuate from one day to another. But if they consistently eat less, then ultimately they still lose weight as you already know.    Yes it does. Not all macro nutrients are processed the same. If you're at an even or negative energy balance, nothing gets stored as adipose tissue. However, composition still matters, because your body needs proteins, fats and either fats or carbohydrates in order to survive. Amino acids are needed for various vital processes, fats are needed for your brain, and either fats or carbohydrates are needed in order for ATP to be produced via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. To that end, the body prefers carbohydrates, but if it has none, it can use free fatty acids via ketosis or transform amino acids into glucose via gluconeogenesis.   If you're at a positive balance, that's where the fun begins. Excess fats are directly stored in the adipocytes, thereby increasing the production of leptin and other adipokines, making you hungrier over time. Excess carbohydrates are not directly stored obviously, but they still indirectly increase adipose tissue uptake rate of triglycerides, because they are the preferred source of energy. Proteins, on the other hand, do not significantly increase adipose tissue storage, even though the conversion pathway does exist (for example, via gluconeogenesis). However, if you eat lots of dietary proteins, no carbohydrates and little dietary fats, some of the excess proteins will be converted to glucose, like I've said, so the outcome might be the same as eating some carbohydrates, although that's not something I'm 100% sure about and more research needs to be done from what I've read.  Also, when it comes to carbohydrates and proteins, not all sources are equal.   Firstly, low glycemic load carbohydrate foods will make you feel 'full' longer, since ghrelin, the hormone that makes you hungry, starts being produced once your stomach has been emptied out. Also, high glycemic load foods, particularly those rich in monosaccharide sugars and low in dietary fibers, create a greater insulin response. Combine this with a caloric surplus, and you get a vicious circle of insulin and leptin resistance that makes people fatter and hungrier over time. This is because, like I said, insulin 'drives' nutrients into the system at a faster speed, thereby increasing adipose tissue uptake rate of triglycerides. In turn, since leptin is an adipokine (which means it's produced from adipose tissue), its production is increased; the more leptin is in your body, and the more your body becomes resistant to its effects. In other words, if you're at a positive balance, then the more insulin you have and the more leptin you have as well, and therefore the hungrier you also become as well, and with this you get a full-circle effect that promotes obesity, diabetes and other metabolic diseases.   Secondly, not all sources of dietary proteins are equal, by far. Animal/meat proteins have an amino acid profile that  is less conductive to the production of the signalling protein Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) than that of dairy proteins and vice versa. IGF-1 is a signalling protein that does basically the same thing as insulin. Also, animal/meat proteins tend to have a lower glycemic load, since dairy foods also more often contain monosaccharide sugars (such as milk), which promotes a greater insulin response, like I've discussed above.    I would not be able to tell you, I have never read this book. It does sound interesting though.    The mistake you're making is thinking of it as a 'diet', as something that you must force yourself to do. There is no beginning or restarting. It's a way of living, the way everyone should live. From an evolutionary perspective, we, humans, were not made to be sedentary or to eat a large supply of foods that are extremely rewarding to the brain but devoid of nutritional value. Also, calling it 'eating healthy' is inherently wrong, because it implies that there is something else, that there is such a thing as 'healthy' and 'unhealthy'; there isn't, because nutrients on their own are harmless. It's about being active, having an appropriate caloric intake for your level of activity and making nutrient choices that will keep you hunger free so you can lose weight at a steady pace. There is no doing this 'on and off'. Either you realize that your way of living is wrong and you change it permanently, or you don't and you stay the same person.    Check the FAQ/Wiki...    Keep your caloric intake the same, but increase your carbohydrate intake IMHO. Carbohydrates are the main nutrient that is correlated with leptin serum production. Leptin is a adipokine (adipose tissue) signalling protein that counters the effects of the endocannabinoid system in the brain, which is made up of different THC-like compounds that increase ghrelin serum production (thereby increasing appetite) and slow down metabolism. This is why a lot of athletes and fitness celebrities who are concerned with body fat percentage cycle their carbohydrate intake. After a long period of caloric and carbohydrate intake restriction, leptin production is lower, making it hard to keep body fat %age low.   edit : by carbohydrates I mean starchy carbohydrates with a low glycemic load, not sugars.    Also, just to clarify, the fat that comes from food takes two forms in the body: free fatty acids and triglycerides. At the end of digestion, dietary fats are converted to free fatty acids, and then used by the metabolism to produce energy. However, if you eat in surplus, excess fats will be converted to triglycerides. Then, because triglycerides aren't water-soluble (meaning they can't travel through the bloodstream), they will be combined with other compounds to form lipoproteins. Lipoproteins will in turn travel through the bloodstream until they reach the fat cells, where the triglycerides will be 'released' and then stored. When you 'burn fat', the opposite happens: the fat cells release triglycerides, which are converted to free fatty acids and then used for energy by the metabolism. So, in short, when I say triglycerides, I simply mean stored fat.    A calorie isn't 'just' a calorie. Fats are directly stored as fat, whereas carbohydrates indirectly increase fat storage, because carbs are burned before fat to produce energy, if you eat more calories than you need. So, both fats and carbs will lead to more fat storage if you eat in surplus. On the other hand, some studies show that proteins never get stored as fat, even if you eat in surplus. Does that make sense?       A lot of people believe that all calories are the same regardless of nutrient source. But my review of the literature has told me differently. Maybe fats and carbohydrates end up having the same impact on energy balance, but a lot of studies have found in recent years that the pathway for conversion of proteins to triglycerides almost never happens, even while on a fairly large caloric surplus. For example, in a randomized control trial by [Bray et al (2012)](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1103993), healthy human subjects didn't undergo a significant increase in adipose tissue uptake rate of triglycerides even though they were on a 1000 calorie surplus from dietary proteins. I'm not saying the pathway doesn't exist. For example, certain amino acids can be converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis (the process by which proteins are converted to carbohydrates), and then to triglycerides, but in reality this never happens. Most excess proteins actually seem to be excreted out as urea in the urea cycle via the body's main metabolic pathway.       The LDL cholesterol, due to its low density, can 'crawl' underneath the blood vessels and, over time, block arteries. On the other hand, the HDL cholesterol is too big to crawl underneath anything, it just floats its way through the bloodstream and pick up the LDL cholesterol along the way.    What supplements do you guys use for blood pressure and cholesterol when on cycle? I know of red yeast rice, sytrinol and Co-enzyme Q10.       My job of choice is teaching, but I secretly dream of one day making it big into the competitive bodybuilding scene. Training and eating all day every day for a living would be a hell of a lifestyle, I mean it's already what I do but getting paid for it would be a dream come true.    IMO it's Elite Tauren Chieftain. It's seldom seen, yet it's arguably one of the most versatile legendary cards in the game. Also, it can quickly turn into either one of the best or one of the most useless cards in the game based on the power chord it gives you and what that power chord gives you.    Yeah I've noticed that more girls seem to want that than guys. My university's Faculty of Education is 95% girls... I'm literally the only guy in half of my classes.       I have been posting everyday since day 1, I think. I'm 21 year old, I live in Montreal, Canada. I'm currently studying, having recently completed the first year of my double major in Education and Biochemistry. In the future, I would also like to study Pharmacology if I have the time, as I took a Drug Action course in my first semester and it was one of the most interesting ones I ever had. I plan on becoming either a language or science teacher... I could teach French, English, Spanish, or some generic Science class. In all cases, whatever my day job ends up being, I hope it allows me to travel and see the world!   I only feel slightly nauseous because of how insanely difficult it actually is. And I don't know why it happened, but I was properly fed, hydrated and rested, so I didn't feel like I was endangering myself.    Good luck to you, friend... I managed to get rid of sugar rich foods completely, but it was hard, especially the first month... Then it got easier and now I'm mostly craving free! So it's definitely possible, but prepare to be head strong! No easy way out in life!!   This is just basic science. When you are at either caloric maintenance or deficit, all the nutrients get used in the main metabolic pathway in order to produce ATP. But if you eat in surplus, what happens? The excess nutrients get stored as triglycerides in adipose tissue, causing fat cells to grow and, eventually, proliferate. You don't need a source for such a common fact.    Doesn't matter where you're at in your journey, simply seeing progress in the mirror is the best reward IMO.    When I was younger I used to ask myself 'what happens to the fat cells once you lose the fat?'  Later I learned, the adipocytes (fat cells) never go away, they just shrink down. In fact, white adipocytes will grow 4 times their original size, and then they will divide and the absolute number in your body will be permanently increased.   I was talking about this with one of my instructors the other day. He said, not only are shrinked down cells waiting to be filled back up (meaning it's easier to re-gain the lost fat), but also, the more fat cells you have, and the more adipokines your body produces, even if those cells are shrinked down to the smallest size. Adipokines are basically hormones made by your body from adipose tissue (stored fat), such as leptin.  This means that, even if you become very fit, once you've been fat, the way your body works is changed forever...   One more motivation to make sure my future children never go through what I did.      Actually, if you want your abs to be extremely visible, you simply need to have a low body fat (10% for men, 15-17% for women) and then to slowly reduce your water and sodium intakes over multiple days.    Looking at myself in the mirror every morning, what I see is the best reward. No need for anything else.    I don't know how people find such foods tasty to be honest. Personally, I find donuts and other sugar rich products disgusting to eat. Just too much sugar.    The problem with 'putting your life on pause until you've attained your desired look' is, once said look is in fact attained, you often find yourself getting back to reality with the exact same life issues as when you were overweight. I am speaking from personal experience. Going for unhealthy/obese to aesthetic looking is no doubt a life-changing thing, but it doesn't solve everything. Don't put your life on hold for weight loss, instead, make it a part of your life.    I buy it from a 'natural products' supermarket near where I live. Some of the things they have are healthy, some sadly aren't, and they have some products that are expensive and which you can also find for cheaper at a regular supermarket, but this 'sugar' isn't one of them... I haven't found this anywhere else except on the internet. Some specialized websites sell it. Basically, it's made by adding extract from Monk Fruits (a fruit that grows in Southern China, also known as luo han guo) to a sugar polyalcohol known as (2R,3S)-butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol. You can buy both of these things individually online.    Today I've been on a high carb, high protein low fat diet. My muscles have been very flat for multiple days of no carbs in a row and I'm trying to get some fullness back.   Today's diet looked like this:  Post fasted morning cardio meal:   640 calorie homemade chocolate pancakes, made with oats, low sodium low fat cottage cheese, chocolate flavoured soybean protein powder, and egg whites  Mid workout meal: 300 calorie protein bar, 30p 30c (10 fibers), 6f  Post-workout meal:  700 calories, extra lean ground chicken, scallops, yam with some spinach and asparagus  Chocolate pancakes using this recipe are definitely one of my favorite foods, it's healthy, tasty and filling. Rich in fibers, low in fat, high in proteins and carbs. I also like to eat them with Lakanto on top; Lakanto means 'sweet plant' in Japanese and is a sugar alternative that contains 0 calories.     This is also one of the upsides of living an active lifestyle. If you train hard everyday, your TDEE becomes so high and your metabolism so much more efficient that you can eat a lot more and a lot more variety for the same weight loss outcome. But becoming healthy is very much a double edged sword, because the deeper you engulf yourself into a healthy lifestyle, and the more you also become alienated from society as you come to realize that most people, unlike you, are unhealthy and ignorant. It took me many years to overcome the other edge of that sword... When I was younger, I used to be extremely arrogant and to look down on other people, whom I used to refer to as 'laypeople'. But over time, I've learned to think and care less, because you can't live a life in which you hate everyone around you, it's a foolproof way to become depressed and isolated, which is what you were trying to overcome by becoming healthier to begin with.    Amazing! I feel the same way as you. When I was overweight, I felt depressed, hopeless, future-less... But as my life became healthier and my body changed, I started becoming increasingly happier. Maybe there's something wrong about correlating your happiness and sense of self worth to your physical appearance, but at least we're happy and that'll always be better than feeling like crap when you look at yourself in the mirror.   I think at some point you just have to be strong and tell yourself 'this is where it ends!'  Many years ago, I decided to completely stop eating processed foods that are rich in sugar. And the first drastic step I took back then was to remove all such foods from my house. But even then, it was hard. For the first month, I would constantly walk around the house, desperately looking for something that I might have forgotten to get rid of. I used to refer to this month of my life as 'the month of great darkness'. But then something amazing happened: the cravings went away completely. I was genuinely satisfied with meat and starchy vegetables. And the desire to eat sugar rich foods never came back and I've been steadily losing weight ever since. So the thing you have to get from this is, changing your diet takes time, and you have to be patient. It's definitely going to be one of the hardest things and you're going to suffer, or at least I did. But in the long run it will be worth it... seeing your body change before your eyes is one of the greatest feelings I have ever experienced.    I am pretty much in your situation. Was obese as a teen, now I'm at 12-13% and trying to get down to 10%. I tend to avoid fruits and get my micro nutrients from starchy vegetables and multivitamin supplements instead. The main reasons for this is because I don't find that fruits fill me up that much, even the fiber rich ones, and also because anything that contains simple sugars is very more ish for me. I've been using Ephedrine, caffeine citrate and austinine's weight loss supplement stack along with fasted cardio to cut down. I've tried Clenbuterol for a while, but the side effects became a pain in the arse after a while.  Diet wise, I alternate between high protein low fat high carb and high protein low fat low carb days because I like alternating between the more 'full' and the more 'ripped' looks.    All true.    Yep, I'm pretty sure that's the main reason this works.    For me, it takes about 20 hours a week, which is not a lot of time really. I prep all my meals for the weeks on Sunday, which takes about 3 hours. I usually do an hour to an hour and twenty minutes of weight lifting, and 40 min of cardio daily, 7 days of week. 7 x 2 = 14 hours. Add to that the 20 min of bicycle that it takes me to get to the gym and back, and the 10 min that it takes me to take a shower and change clothes. 7 x 0.5 = 3.5 hours. 14 + 3 + 3.5 = 20.5 hours but sometimes I take a day off so it takes 20 hours of my week on average, which is not a whole lot.     Has anybody else been having success with this? I've been doing this for a while, and it seems to work.  Whenever I'm not satisfied with how vascular I look, I keep my caloric intake constant while dropping my carb intake, from something to 40% proteins 40% carbs 20% fats to 70-75% proteins 5-10% carbs 20% fats over a couple days. And when I find that my muscles have become too 'flat', I increase back in carb intake. This is only anecdotal evidence, but I find that I usually get the best mix of size and vascularity when I increase to around 50/30/20% up from 5-10% carbs.    Hard to say if you're doing something wrong based on the information you're providing, but even if you're on the deficit that you say you are, weight loss takes time. This is only anecdotal evidence, but for me, it comes in peaks. I'll be at the same weight for a couple weeks in a row despite being on a deficit every single day and then after a 2-3 weeks, boom, I'll have dropped a pound. I'm at a fairly low body fat too, so it might be more than just a pound for you. In all cases, be patient.       Explain your situation to her. She's your mom after all, so she should understand.  Also, you can buy a small portable food scale.    The number of calories that you actually ingest is probably insignificant, especially since fruits are not very caloric to begin with...    Well, they contain literally nothing but sugar. For example, Wendy's Small Honest Tropical Green Tea contains 60 calories, 100% of which come from sugar, since it contains 15g of it. Imagine taking a large spoon, putting 15g of table sugar in it and eating that table sugar... There you go, you just drank Wendy's Small Honest Tropical Green Tea.    How much of a daily caloric deficit you can sustain without losing muscle class depends on your body fat %age. If you are at 20% or more, you can easily sustain a 800 or even 1000 caloric deficit without any downsides. The 'lack of energy' that you're experiencing is more likely to be due to poor nutrient choices. If you eat meals that are satisfying to eat, and that are rich in fibers, in proteins and in low GI carbohydrates throughout the day, there should be no such thing IMO.    I don't think you realize how complex this is. You cannot answer that question based on caloric intake alone, like I said. Generally, though, I think you should eat more on the days that you are more physically active, and less on the days you are less active. Besides that, the research on meal timing is controversial... there is no definitive answer like you're looking for.    You don't 'lose the discipline to stop eating'. I mean, sure, the absence of inhibition might play a role, but what mainly happens is that it lowers blood sugar level, causing you to want to eat more, even though no energy is actually being produced, since ethanol is empty of nutrients. This is generally why nights of going out and drinking are concluded at McDonalds. If you take into account that it increases adipose tissue uptake rate of triglycerides (since the enzymes responsible for breaking down food are busy breaking down ethanol instead), and also that when people drink they generally end up being at a positive energy balance in the process, you can easily see how people who drink at all are generally fatter than those who don't. Alcohol is definitely harmful to the body and has no conclusive health benefits even in small quantities, and so it should be avoided altogether, IMO. It's especially horrible for athletes and physically active individuals, since it also disrupts natural synthesis of various muscle-building hormones (testosterone, growth hormone, etc) and causes dehydration.    That question is impossible to answer based on the information you're providing. Nutrient utilization depends on your when you're eating what versus your metabolic needs at various moments throughout the day. Not all nutrients will be digested at the same speed, and not all nutrients will be used and stored as fat the same way either. If you eat 400 calories right after exercising, those calories will not be treated by your body the same way than if you're eating them right before going to bed and after a day of being inactive. Similarly, if you eat 400 calories of fast-digesting carbohydrates, those calories will definitely not be treated the same way than if you're eating 400 calories of meat.   Eat them post-workout. Simple sugars are normally digested extremely quickly, meaning they create a greater insulin response, causing them to be 'driven' into your system at an extremely fast rate. Since your body can only use up so much at once, a big percentage of them cannot be used by the body to produce ATP, and is instead stored as fat. However, post-workout there is something that happens and which is known as the post-exercise insulin effect; your body, in order to recover, needs more energy than usual, and so creating an insulin response that is greater than usual is actually beneficial. This is why I personally never eat sugar except post-workout.    It's called excess post-exercise oxygen consumption, also coloquially known as *the afterburn effect*.   Basically, in order to recover from exercise, your body uses up a lot of oxygen, which causes you to end up being at an 'oxygen deficit'. In order to make up for that deficit, your body must performs many physiological processes, all of which require Adenonine triphosphate (ATP), the body's intracellular unit of energy, or in other words, what allows humans to live. How is ATP produced? Via the body's main metabolic pathway, the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). As the nutrients (proteins, carbs, fats) that you ingest are transformed in the TCA, a transport chain of electrons is created, and the final result of that chain is ATP.    When you exercise, your body heats up. This is simply because, when your exercise, more ATP needs to be produced in order to keep you alive. Because ATP is being produced at a fast rate, the mitochondria of the cells heat up, causing an increase in body temperature. This leads to a full-circle effect that causes the body to burn nutrients at a faster than normal rate, because more ATP is also needed in order to release the extra heat as sweat so that thermal homeostatis can be maintained.   This also happens post-workout... All the processes that the body must undergo in order to 'replenish' oxygen require more ATP as well, causing the body to use up nutrients at a faster than normal rate.   What does this mean, simply put? Anaerobic exercise (short-term high intensity exercise) causes your metabolism to burn calories at a faster than normal rate, both during and **after** exercise. In fact, studies have found that athletes tend to burn calories faster for up to 48 hours after anaerobic exercise, and that the magnitude and length of the effect seem to be positively correlated with the duration and intensity of the exercise. This explains why HIIT style training might be the best form of exercise for weight loss.   This is also why I personally perform compound weight lifting exercises everyday. Compound exercises are simply ones that involve many muscle groups at once, such as deadlifts, squats and clean   presses. As I've explained, they will cause a significant metabolic increase both during and many hours after workout. Also, over time and with proper nutrition, they will cause an increase in muscular tissue, which increases metabolism as well, simply because ATP is needed to create and maintain muscular tissue, and therefore, the more tissue you have and the more ATP you need in order to survive.    If you perform compound weight lifting exercises daily, you are burning calories at a faster than normal rate literally all of the time, even when you are sleeping.          Well I didn't stop. Just went to my locker and had a snack. :p   Today was back/arms/hamstrings/calves/abs day. I usually only hit back and arms, but I missed a leg day this week, so I had to make up for it. I did the following:  Barbell deadlifts 5x8   Leg presses for hamstrings 4x12   Stiff leg deadlifts 4x10  Smith machine calf presses 4x10  Sitting calf presses 4x10, squeezing hard at the top  This was the first part. Then I had one small workout meal, 300 calories, 20g proteins, 35g carbs, 10g fat. Then I went for part 2:  Weighted pullups 1x10 and 3x7, making sure I keep the form strict  Close arm bench rows 4x10  Concentration curls 4x10 per arm  Strict barbell curls 4x8  Weighted decline situps 3x10  Weighted hanging leg raises 3x12  20 min of elleptical machine  20 min of Stairmaster machine  Then I had a 600 calorie meal:  Lean ground beef for the proteins and fat, salmon for the proteins, fat and omega-3, yam for the starches, 2 medium bananas for the potassium and the post-workout insulin spike.                Also, Etho. His channel is one of the most family friendly ones I've ever watched. I've never heard him swear or say a single obscenity, and I've been watching him since the begining.       I'm not the OP, but no need for cheat meals. You can count your calories and eat meals that are healty, filling and still very tasty. No need for things like pizza, ice cream, chocolate bars, etc., when there are so many things that are healthier and just as satisfying to eat. You can also use 0 calorie sugar and salt (in moderation) to season your meals.    Thank you!    Woke up 1 lb lighter today, down to 179 from 180. I am getting super lean and closer to 10%. I took a day off from both morning cardio and weight lifting yesterday, but I kept my caloric intake very low, avoided high GI and high sodium foods and have been scaling down my water intake over the last couple days, which has helped tremendously. For me, the pain of not giving in to my food urges is far outweighed by the feeling I get when I look at myself in the mirror when I wake up and get to see not only how lean and vascular I am, but also, most importantly, how incredibly far I am from my fat and depressed teenager days. Pizza and ice cream used to be my favorite 'cheat meals', and today I haven't had either in exactly 7 months; I know because I've marked down every single day on a calendar. I am going to attend my first Physique show ever in November, and I'm already hyped up for that. At the age of 22 (I'm currently 21), it's going to be my first time ever on a stage. I am sooooo excited!    This will be 100% automatic as long as you have bonemeal. Change your mouse button to a keybind, and put something heavy on it. It's now fully automatic.    Yeah I know one day means nothing in the long run. But I was fat throughout all of my childhood, so now I have this irrational fear that I'll lose my muscle mass and that my abs will get replaced by a belly whenever I don't exercise. I know it's merely psychological, but it takes a huge toll on me at times, like today.    It doesn't matter. Yes the Wither will lose focus on the Iron Golem and Villager, but if there are no other mobs when the chunk loads, he will instantly gain focus of them again.    Today was a shitty day... Had sleeping problems last night, ended up sleeping only 6 hours, couldn't train because I felt too tired. I kept my caloric and carb intakes low. Had 3 small 500 calorie meals throughout the day. Blueberries with 1 egg and some liquid egg white in the morning, extra lean ground chicken with red beans, raw almonds and broccoli for dinner, and some salmon with asparagus for supper.    This was built on my friend's private vanilla server. I was AFK there for multiple hours, and assuming no mob spawns or walks into the area, it will never break.   Here are the designs used:  1. [Tree compressor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoBPh7Sz8WU)  2. [Wither cage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqYa--dJMYA)  The double chest of wood represents about 2 hours of being AFK at the farm.          I don't think it's within my grasp to help you, as there is so much to say... You need to do your own research. But what I can tell you is that it's not just a matter of being weak minded. There is an hormone in your body known as leptin and of which the main purpose is to suppress appetite. That hormone, however, is produced by your body's fat cells and so, the more fat you have, the more leptin is produced by your body. When you produce too much leptin, your body becomes leptin resistant, meaning it no longer suppresses your appetite as well as it does in physiologically normal individuals. You might have accumulated so much adipose tissue that it's become physically impossible for you properly control your urge to ingest foods. So, if I was you, I would seek medical help. This is not something that you can solve simply by being 'strong minded'. That's just my humble opinion, though, and I am no doctor.    I don't eat that kind of food... But that's because I would rather suffer mentally from not eating a pizza than experience a slight outburst of satisfaction from eating it that would be instantly followed by days of mental pain from the guilt of having deviated from my target caloric intake... Not saying it's healthy for the mind, but if you want to accomplish things that others don't, you need to be prepared to make sacrifices that others won't. No easy way out in life!      Nice! Can't wait to see it!   Blackrock Foundry, Blackrock Mountain, etc., yes. :P   This one is pretty much flawless, in that it doesn't miss any leaves. The only thing that you could improve at this point and that I can think of is speed, in other words making it even faster, if that's possible. I could be wrong though.    I tried with both obsidian and furnaces, but it doesn't work, the logs get pushed into another direction and end up messing up some redstone and/or pistons.    [There you go.](http://www.filedropper.com/withertestworld)  I copied the whole thing from the original world with MCedit and put it into a test world, otherwise it would take forever to download. Also, I made a small mistake in my explanation, it's the bottom layer of pistons that needs to be removed, not the top one, because I previously lowered the entire Wither cage by one block, and now the top layer does get destroyed by the Wither, but not the bottom one.    I recalled right after posting this, too bad you can't edit the title.    They would be. Basically, I just don't know how to convert it from 9 to 6 without messing up all the pistons.    [Here's some more pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/DXD2E)  Does this help?   It's far from finished. I've just done the entrance and the first room. But I will release it eventually when it's complete enough to my taste.    Bad things.    I don't know if you guys can see what's going on here, but basically, this contraption compresses the wood logs into a '3x3' shape. This is problematic because the Wither doesn't destroy the upper layer, and this layer causes to block the Wither's view of the Iron Golem, thus breaking the Wither 'cage'. I'm trying to modify this contraption so that this 3x3 box becomes a 2x3 one without the top layer.          I managed to do 10 strict form weighted pullups today! I was never able to do that many when on a caloric deficit in the past! Guess I somehow got stronger!!   lol that attention mistake though...    For oak trees, the ceiling above the dirt block where the trees grow is lowered using a piston and a slime block. For acacia trees, the compression system simply goes off twice, getting rid of the odd block it misses on the first time when it activates again.       The problem with losing weight rapidly is you spend a LOT of money on clothes haha! I feel you. It's a good feeling though.    Awesome!      Sure, I'd love to join! I'm from Canada (Quebec). I'm 21 year old. My weight loss journey started about 6 years ago. I started at 250lb, and I am currently at 180 with 12-13% body fat. My goal is to lose another 5 pounds and get to 10% while maintaining muscular mass and strength as much as possible.    Yes, indeed, it continues to work as a stimulant even after the appetite suppressing effects go away in my experience, and it might also have slight metabolic boosting effects, however minimal they are.    I don't know if you guys know this, but there's a fruit that grows in Southern China and which is known as *Siraitia grosvenorii*. If you add extract from that fruit to a carbohydrate derivative known as D-threitol or (2R,3S)-butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol (which can be purchased from various research chemical websites), the result is a beige grain-ish substance that looks and tastes very much like sugar but contains almost literally 0 calories, only polyhydric alcohol, which contains about 0.1 calories per gram. You can use that substance in recipes that demand sugar, any desert, protein cake, etc.  (2R,3S)-butane-1,2,3,4-tetraol is basically a sugar that is found in certain foods (such as pears) and then fermented in corn using a technique known as enzymatic hydrolysis, in which molecule bonds are cleaved with the help of oxygen and hydrogen.   I use this substance combined with pure carob powder and chocolate pea protein powder to make a chocolate cake that contains as little as 130 calories per serving. You can also add oats to get something that is low in calories and fats, and rich in proteins and dietary fibers, thus making it extremely filling and rewarding to eat. You can also make a LOT of other things with it, since it's basically a sugar substitute.   This is actually true. It's not been demonstrated that well in humans, but in gorillas, when one male is about to replace the current silverback and become one himself, he usually experiences a drastic increase in testosterone that both influences and is influenced by his body posture and behavior.   For example, [check this study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9294641).   Yeah, I could easily go the drug route, but I'm still young (21), and I want to prove to myself that I can do it all naturally before I start using any body enhancement methods. And yes, I will further reduce my caloric intake slightly in the near future to see what it does.    Hey, thanks for the reply! Yeah, I will definitely cut down my water intake when I prepare for my first posing comp, that might just do it. I'm also already using EC, in fact I have been for a while, and it doesn't really affect my appetite anymore but I'm still using it for the presumed metabolic effects based on the scientific literature I've read. I've also used Clenbuterol HCL for a while, but it didn't seem to do that much of a difference and the side effects were rather harsh for me, so I stopped.    When I started my journey, I was 15 year old and at about 30% body fat (as confirmed by my family doctor at the time). 6 years later, I'm at about 12-13% (I know because my abs are fairly visible) and trying to lose the last 2-3% that I need in order to get to 10%, but it's so hard. I've been exercising 7 days a week, lifting weights 5 days, doing 40 min of fasted morning cardio daily, keeping a daily 700 calorie deficit, keeping my carbohydrate intake low most of the time... And yet, those last few bits of fat just don't seem to want to go away.   I know it's going to happen someday, even naturally, but it's so hard, and I'm finding it hard to remain motivated lately... Wondering if I'm ever going to reach my goal? Over the years I've learned that what can be one of your worst enemies is doubt -  doubting yourself even though there's a part of you that knows very well you're doing everything right and that all that's left to do is being patient.  Those of you who finally reached the magic fully-visible-abs number of 10, how did you finally get there? How was your journey? I would love to hear some motivational stories right now.                         Just received a free sample (2g) of this from a company based in Eastern Europe that I often order from.  It's labelled as follows: *Yellow Horned Poppy Extract, 98.9%. Pain relieving supplement that lowers blood pressure and produces mild hallucinogenic effects*  Couldn't find much information on Google. Not sure if I want to try this.           This might seem like common knowledge, but in all these years I had never realized that the 'lying End of Ender' texture was an integral part of the block itself, and not an addition on top of the block. In other words, End Portal blocks are 7/8th of regular blocks until right clicked with an Eye of Ender.       Does such a command exist?       Actually, if you have really low body fat (sub 15% for guys, sub 20% for girls), doing fasted cardio might help you get rid of the 'stubborn fat', but otherwise, nope, there isn't.    Fasted cardio if you have low (sub 15%) adipose tissue, regular post-workout cardio for everybody else IMO. This is due to the reduced effectiveness of fatty acid metabolism and higher substrate utilization in highly trained, low-adipose tissue athletes. When you have little stored fat, your body becomes less 'lenient' to release its own fat as free fatty acids in order to produce ATP, but in a low-insulin   low-glucose environment, it has no other choice than to do so. Also, in some studies that I've seen, high endurance sports athletes (such as runners) are actually shown to have improved fatty acid metabolism in a low glucose environment, but this has never been shown to be the case in laypeople, even though there is some evidence that it does promote fatty acid metabolism in general.    Whoa man, this got deep quickly.    Also, this post is tagged as Creative but you can totally do this in Survival mode!    Possibly, but I prefer using fire because the smoke that emanates from underneath the cauldron as a result makes it look like the water is being heated up.    In my experience, it's theoretically impossible to get to this point because a) after a while, the effects just become so intense that you don't feel the need to ingest any more, and b) because, after a while, it just stops having an effect altogether, no matter how much you ingest, and you just have to wait a while before using it again.    I placed a Netherrack block underneath the cauldron, lit it up with a flint and steel, then placed a cauldron above. Then I filled it with water using a bucket, and emptied half of its content using a glass bottle.    Yes, and they have surprisingly low neurotoxicity, lower than that of ethanol and antidepressants. The LD50 is 3 times that of caffeine in healthy rodents!      I have a family relative who lives in a small South American town where they are grown naturally and used as part of the daily spiritual life by the natives who live in the area. He has access to a fairly large supply of various mushroom species and often sends me some. It takes a trained eye to spot the psychadelic ones in the wilderness, though, because psilocybin mushrooms are part of a huge family of mushrooms not all of which are comestible let alone psychoactive.    Nope, strangely enough, I've never had any gym-related hallucinations, which is a tad disappointing. I can't wait for the day it will finally happen!    I don't like alcohol, because it's empty calories, and I hate to have to reduce my caloric intake throughout the day just because I plan to be drinking down a 600 calories of alcohol at night. Also, alcohol dehydrates, reduces the production of various muscle-building hormones, increases fat storage, and lowers blood sugar level.  I don't like THC either, because, although it's not nearly as bad for your health as alcohol, it makes me hungry. This makes sense, because it mimics the effects of the endocannabinoid system in the brain, which is far from optimal when I'm either cutting or lean bulking (which I'm doing all year long).   On the other hand, psilocybin mushrooms contain nearly no calories, are actually packed with certain vitamins, don't affect my physical health or make me want to ingest food, and I've always had vastly pleasurable psychadelic experiences using them, even with low doses. Also, while they don't take away hunger, I usually don't feel the need to eat while using them, because I'm too busy observing the world around me and feeling weirdly pleasurable sensations throughout my body. And it's always better than stimulant drugs, which, while they do take care of hunger, can also have a plethora of adverse effects at high doses, such as heart palpitations, tremors, and the inability to fall asleep at night.   With psilocybin, I've never had any such things. The visual experience is always positive, and slowly fades away progressively, leaving me with a profound sense of well-being and inspiring hope as it does.                                                                   	173
 the google algorithm keeps recommending me jihadi shit... when my autoplay is on on youtube, it will automatically take me to some death to America or terrorist video... i turned that shit off...  *puts on a tinfoil hat as well...* ...i know they are just trying to brand me a terrorist... wondering when my door will get kicked down...   making the state more efficient is not the goal...      ive never met a climate change denier.... perhaps its because everyone knows climate changes all the time... ice caps on mars are melting.... obviously that didnt result from our hairspray cans and suvs... climate change is part of a much bigger phenomena... we are actually seeing drastic changes to EVERY planet in the solar system... in fact what were once ice moons are now liquid seas... anyone that thinks man is somehow to blame for global warming on mars is a serious true believer... the western/UN climate agenda is nothing more than a power grab... and all the big environmentalists outright admit it... its no secret that the communists piled right out of soviet union/ east berlin and into the climate movement...  The literature about climate change published by all the powerful America/Global think tanks decades ago all go something like this:  From the David Rockefeller founded Club of Rome 1991 - The First Global Revolution:  "In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill....All these dangers are caused by human intervention....and thus the real enemy, then, is humanity itself.... humanity requires a common motivation, namely a common adversary in order to realize world government. It does not matter if this common enemy is a real one or.one invented for the purpose.... Now is the time to draw up a master plan for sustainable growth and world development based on global allocation of all resources and a new global economic system... The Earth has cancer and the cancer is Man..."  Quote by Paul Watson, a founder of Greenpeace:  "It doesn't matter what is true, it only matters what people believe is true."  ... and illl just leave this H.L. Mencken quote here:  "The whole aim of practical politics is to keep the populace alarmed  and hence clamorous to be led to safety  by menacing it with an endless series of hobgoblins, all of them imaginary." And, "The urge to save humanity is almost always only a false face for the urge to rule it."  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0rLfkvl8BI    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w0rLfkvl8BI       I understand all of this. It just has zero real world application. Almost no property, in the real world, is owned as a result of this process or line of thinking. This concept of the origination of property rights has no relationship to the actual ownership of property in the actual world.  EXACTLY! THATS WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO CHANGE! :) Property has been expropriated by mere decree, force and, violence. This is exactly what libertarians are fighting. Equating what has happened in the past via state actors, and violent criminals with what libertarians propose is just inaccurate. Private property rights are actually a limit on state power - And actually propertarian theory DOES have many real world applications... how do you think property was accumulated in the first place? This continued to occur until 100 years ago and is actually still occurring in a bastardized version. You can still actually homestead in places out west and in alaska. Yes, you must pay tirubte to government first but the same principle applies. State and local governments will 'give you' (and again its not thiers to give in the first place) very cheap or in alaskas case even free land if you put it to good use and ad to the local economy. Many agreements stipulate that you build a home or start a business within the first 2 years or something. This is still the homestead principle at work. And its a natural principle. Even animals mark their claim...  	7

Seeking Refuge  "Now that Bitcoin exists, we hope that Greek workers and merchants can use it to protect their income through this crisis." - BitPay business development manager Pablo Magro. To fight inflation, Latin Americans have historically stored their wealth in American dollars. The increasing restrictions some countries have placed on buying dollars have left these citizens financially vulnerable.  In Argentina, even though government restrictions were somewhat relaxed after the peso experienced a sudden drop in value in 2014, those who are approved to buy dollars are limited to purchasing just 20% of their income, capping their monthly savings at $2,000.  Getting this approval is a cumbersome process, leaving most Argentines with a higher restriction barrier to exchange their local currency. However, the numbers are rising from $39.2m p/day bought in June to $60m p/day bought in July, forcing the government to tighten the restrictions.  Extreme restrictions on currency exchange have led to the emergence of a black market specifically for trading pesos for dlar blue, American dollars with an exchange rate that runs about 50% higher than the official exchange rate.  Acquiring dollars this way is illegal and risky, so Argentines seeking to protect their savings often buy ADRs (American Depository Receipts), local bonds denominated in dollars, gold, silver, and other commodities that are traded on local and international stock exchanges.  greek man crying The image of Giorgos Chatzifotiadis crying outside a Greek bank was seen across the globe(Sakis Mitrolidis/AFP/Getty Images) No Bank Account? No Problem.  News of bank closures in Greece in the past month have sparked panic, then bank runs, leaving many Greek citizens without regular access to their bank accounts.  For Latin Americans, this situation is already too familiar. Among Latin America's 600 million inhabitants, more than 60% are unbanked, meaning they have no access to bank accounts.  Despite the obvious economic need, most financial institutions are unable to serve this unbanked population.  Fortunately, purchasing and using bitcoin does not require a bank account. All it takes is just a mobile phone, which 70% of Latin Americans happen to have. In contrast to the banking system, the Bitcoin network operates 24 hours a day, every day of the year, and can be accessed by anyone on the internet. It presents an immediate, accessible solution to receive wages and securely store savings at very low cost, with no additional resources or hardware required.  Entrepreneurs and companies have already begun to make bitcoin solutions available to consumers in the region. Belize's Advanced Cash is particularly significant example, accepting bitcoin payments for top-ups to its popular digital wallets and prepaid cards which are used throughout Latin America. This mainstream integration of bitcoin payments is allowing both banked and unbanked customers to secure their savings in the cloud.  	198

 We genuinely couldn't give a fuck about losing him on a free, keeping him this year would be worth more than what you are offering   Critters? Sounds similar can't remember the clown but not seen it for a while   Fair play to him    Thank you for 20 RVP and for giving Fergie the perfect send off   What the fuck is CMV?   No they aren't    Yeh we will definitely sell for a big loss after one season   He can still be a professional about it instead of act like a cunt, imagine if he was a member of your staff or someone on your team. I'm a united fan so couldn't give a fuck but he's still acting like a prick   Jesus what a little wankstain   After he has picked a pug and gets asked why  "It's a bulldog innit?"  Kingsman   I watch other leagues and couldn't give a fuck who wins, it gives me true enjoyment as I'm a neutral who gets to watch great games but couldn't care less about specific teams   No because it's weird  Haha at bandwagoners downvoting me, I'm sure you support all the better teams in the different leagues because you feel a real "connection" with the teams   He was only 20 then in all fairness so maybe couldn't adjust that well but since then he's been all over with the national team so he might be ok now   Trust me mate he's painful at times because you know he can be an absolutely brilliant fucker but instead he just causes you physical pain    He has but he will never kick on, he will have a game where he looks like a world beater and you think fuck me what a player we have and then he will be absolutely abject for the next 6 games and you'll want him benched and then he will have a great game and then be fucking abject for 6 games etc etc time is a flat circle yadda yada   You are right, he is too inconsistent. It's not so much bad work ethics I genuinely just think he has a bit of a mental block when it comes to taking the next step, he always seemingly sabotages himself by doing something stupid/infuriating   We've no idea how well he will do   Yyyeeessss finally!!!!! Can't believe he is finally leaving and getting off our wage bill.  He was great in 2010-11 and one of the best in the league but fuck me he is probably the most frustrating cunt I've ever had to watch and I've had to watch a lot of them   	18

    If we are talking about opening scenes, I gotta say Inglorious Basterds. I was holding my breath with anticipation for those 15 minutes and what was on the screen was a guy drinking milk.   Yeah, Pratt would basically be Andy Dwyer looking for artifacts.   That's also one of the reasons you can't have Chris Pratt. He is Chris Pratt in every role. I agree with you on Bradley to a degree though, I just think he looks a lot like young Harrison Ford.    JUST DO IT! MAKE YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE!   Bradley Cooper looks the part. Chris Pratt has got the charisma but he's basically one big goof and I wouldn't want to see him as Indiana.  This Matthew Davis guy looks acceptable, but I don't know if he has the charisma or the star power or the acting chops.   Deckard being a replicant undermined the film a little as well.    I just pray we don't have a complete copy of the OT with Kylo Ren being Darth Vader and Snoke being the Emperor pulling the strings from behind the scenes. It would be lazy writing. Hopefully the story is significantly different.   This is bullshit - you're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything useful to the discussion.   MAD MAX: FURY ROAD!!!   Making a full planet of Boba Fetts was definitely a terrible decision on George Lucas's part.    I just watched that film two days ago for the first time as well. Thought the bar scene and the opening scene were fantastic pieces of cinema. I couldn't really tell if the film wanted to be taken seriously or not though.   Just watched Ex Machina. Thought it was absolutely fantastic. Isaac and Gleeson are some of the best actors working right now, for sure.    I watch 500 Days of Summer at least twice a year.

 The hardest I've cried since I was a child was two weeks ago when I learned my best friend, the first person I met in college, took his own life. He went back to his hometown one night to go to a dentist appointment the next morning and never came back. When I texted him the next day his brother called me and said he saw I texted Anthony's phone and that I deserved to know what happened. Turns out his mom came home that morning to find him crying in the shed with a gun in his mouth. After she tried to pull the gun away, he put the gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger. I don't even want to be at this college anymore, the only person I spent time with is gone.   Threw a kitchen knife modern warfare 2 style and it bounced back off the wall, hitting me in the eyeball with the plastic handle end.    How could Dexter spend 8 seasons becoming more human, connecting to his son only to leave him with a different murderer? And do you think Deb shooting you at the end of season 7 would have been a more bittersweet ending?    Hey Michael!   I've read that many of the scenes from Dexter had little improvisations you put into them, were there any memorable instances where the directors told you you went too far with yourself and crossed the line between Dexter and you?

And I love it and hate it.    Absolutely, the benefits are fantastic. Usually. I don't want to sound like one of "those people" but working out, even at all, will help you let that energy out and sleep much better, I promise :)   Why didn't Helen Keller scream when she fell off the cliff?

The super powers are real, and I've known for a few years but I seem to forget until after going over a week without an orgasm. I don't know about you guys, but I've known about the super powers for about 4 years now, ever since I saw one picture that said not orgasming for a week can double your testosterone levels. It's as if reading that picture made that a real fact. I've tried telling people about how horrible and weak I feel the days after fapping, and they've told me they fap with no such feelings. So whether this feeling we get after fapping is real or just made in our heads, one thing is for sure. The super powers are more than real. Orgasming in general has begun to make me feel weak, and casual sex with girls I'm not into is beginning to lose its thrill because I know how weak it'll make me feel. I'd rather go a week without an orgasm and lose my social anxiety altogether rather than have one night flings every week. Right now, right now is the first time I've hit the week mark without an orgasm, even if I haven't fapped in 2 months. And this is the first time I've felt the powers of testosterone. I hope this helps you fapstronauts who aren't feeling the super powers yet but haven't switched to hard mode, it's worth it.   All I had to do for karma was take a picture of my zune.

    "A DISABILITY worker has admitted a 13-year history of sexual abuse against some of the states most vulnerable people in a case that has shocked authorities.  Almost of all of Craig Gilbert Handasydes victims were unable to communicate, meaning they could never report the abuse.  One of his eight male victims was deaf, blind and mentally impaired.  The men, aged between 25 and 50, were abused between 1998 and 2011 while living in Department of Human Services disability supported accommodation.  Mr Handasyde, 47, was employed by DHS as a disability development services officer to care for the men."      I hate some people now. Not you guys! just these types..ok must be bedtime!

Last updated on 4 May 2015 - 12:49am  SAN JOS: Costa Rican authorities declared an emergency on Sunday after a ship carrying 180 tons of ammonium nitrate sunk off the country's Pacific coast.  The National Emergency Commission (CNE) urged people to avoid swimming at beaches and suspend fishing in the region off the port of Puntarenas, 90km west of the capital.  The CNE said the accident occurred on Saturday when the boat sank in heavy seas. Two crew members were rescued without incident, the CNE said.  Ammonium nitrate is often used in the manufacture of fertilizers and explosives, and can be dangerous to health in cases of direct contact with the chemical.  AFP      I just posted a sort of guide (on this sub) , mostly taken from a friend's site, entitled  'CHECK YOUR KIDS FACEBOOKS FOR SEX OFFENDERS AMONG THEIR FRIENDS LIST'. Lol really bad title I guess. Anyway it's already being down voted but while it is still up u may want to have a gander if you have some concern re safe use of apps etc by kids/teens/etc.    posting this in response to questions re the father that used kik to lure kiddie pore using his own children's pics.  CHECK YOUR KIDS FACEBOOKS FOR SEX OFFENDERS AMONG THEIR FRIENDS LIST (ty Trench)  Thanks to this article from KYW Radio in Philadelphia (Come on South Jersey and Philly peeps sing along with TrenchKYWNews Radio1060) I was introduced to a Facebook app called Friend Verifier. Its an app that allows you to check your kids Facebook friends list for sex offenders.  The first thing youll need is a Friend Verifier account which is free. The second thing youll need is the login and password of the Facebook account youll be checking. Remember, youre the parent. You should already have all of your kids logins.  Log in to your childs Facebook account then go to the Friend Verifier website log in to your FV account then click on the button that says Scan all friends for sex offenders. It doesnt hurt to check your own Facebook friends list either. Thankfully mine came up empty but I can say that at least in that way it works.  However even Friend Verifier will tell you that not every search is perfect and may miss a sex offender in their scan due to whatever information is already out there.  Wile FV is a great tool no tool is perfect and once again I remind you that as a parent youre the only true defense between online predators and your kids."   and "Again I say to parents its up to you on whether or not you want to allow your kids to have Snapchat on their phones or tablets. However I urge you that if you do make frequent checks on their friends list to make sure that no adult is contacting them for sexual reasons."  From the story he wrote re the dad using kik: "Now Im not saying that Kik should be driven out of business or anything like that. Kik is just a tool but its the way that others use that too that you should be aware of in order to better protect your kids."  I'm not even going to mention the Craig's List   Backpage horrors.  http://trenchreynolds.com/   way I read it is he pretty well forced his kids to pose, then used those pics to lure others.    Anyone with kids that have cells really need to be on top on their use of sites such as kik/snapchat/etc.      /\_     I broke mine :(   In fact someone snuck up and grabbed the cherry wood piece dang it!   I think I read ..somewhere..that he has a daughter and a son, and that he used their pictures to pose as a teen, attracting other young people to respond as if they were dealing with someone of their own age.    wow, this is seriously awful.  I'm so sorry for the difficulties you are going through. It doesn't sound as if those that have the power to make change happen care at all.  The world really needs to wake up and see what these seemingly small and localized water lack situations are adding up to.  Start saving any rain water you might get, cover it tightly so as to help prevent mosquito borne illness.   Reuse the water you wash with to water any garden you may have.   Please people, stand up for those being affected by the lack of water in Puerto Rico now; we very well may be next if action isn't taken rapidly.     yes. http://www.nrdc.org/globalwarming/watersustainability/   "SPRINGFIELD TOWNSHIP, OH (WOIO) - A 35-year-old Springfield Township man was arrested after he confessed to using nude photos of his own children online.   The man originally turned himself in to officers stating that he had only traded photos of himself with others on the social media app, Kik. Kik is an instant messaging app where you can send pics and video to any other user in seconds on any smart phone. Last year it had 120 million users, many being teenagers.  Detectives were able to later determine that the suspect also traded nude photos of his two teens. The material was traded with both juveniles and adults.   Detectives have been in contact with the FBI to assist further in the investigation.  The father is now charged with two felonies. He's sitting in the Summit County Jail on a $100,000 bond. He's due back in court next month.  19 Action News has decided not to identify the man to protect the identity of his kids. "  Please be on top of what your children are doing on line with these types of apps. It's the way that others use that too that you should be aware of in order to better protect your kids.      It's mighty scary stuff once you start reading up on it. Let's hope it will be several hundred more years before it gets the urge to move again, and that by then people will have found a way to mitigate any potential harm.    you hit the nail on the head:))   I hope you waved back!

The Kazakh Ministry of Agriculture announced on April 30 that the poultry imports had been suspended as of April 28.  Last week, Kazakh authorities temporarily banned Russia-made butter, chocolate, candies, and mayonnaise, while Russian agricultural watchdog Rosselkhoznadzor barred the import of 20 tons of wheat flour from Kazakhstan.  Earlier in April, Russian authorities suspended Kazakh dairy products imports to Russia.  Some media reports in Russia and Kazakhstan have called the situation a "trade war" between the two countries, which are close trade partners and founding members of a four-nation Eurasian Economic Union created this year on the basis of an existing customs union.  In separate statements last week, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov and Kazakh Deputy Economy Minister Qaiyrbek Oskenbaev said that there is no trade war and that the bans were motivated purely by health concerns.       of course.

High waves in Acapulco claiming the lives of a young EDITORIAL SDPNOTICIAS.COM Sat 02 May 2015 16:36   "Swimmers are encouraged to respect the lifeguard staff recommendations not enter the water if it is with high waves, avoid approaching observe their break, as it can be caught and suffer an accident." Acapulco, Guerrero.- A high waves recorded this day in the port of Acapulco, also known as "Swell" reached different urban areas, in addition to that claimed the life of a young tourist from Morelos, who died on the beach wallow.  Civil Protection of Guerrero announced that at an early hour, the port authorities issued a warning.  "They swimmers urged to respect the recommendations of the staff of life, do not enter the water if it is with high waves, avoid approaching observe their break, as it can be caught and suffer an accident," he reported.  However, the young deceased, who was 21 years old, ignored the warning and went into the sea, so he drowned.  The intense activity at sea came to urban areas and flooded several homes. The hardest hit is Coyuca de Benitez, where were damaged about 60 homes. With information from La Razon      http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/05/02/403770619/may-day-protesters-police-clash-in-seattle  "The Seattle Times reports:  "A day of peaceful May Day rallies for immigrant rights in Seattle turned chaotic Friday night as a separate anti-capitalist march descended into clashes between police and protesters on Capitol Hill. "Three officers were injured and admitted to Harborview Medical Center. Several protesters reported injuries from pepper spray and projectiles fired by police. Sixteen people were arrested." Member station KUOW reports: "The day began with a small Black Lives Matter gathering at Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park. Those people then joined the annual May Day March for Workers and Immigrant Rights. It began at Judkins Park in the Central District then headed downtown for a rally at the Federal Courthouse."  "According to The Associated Press: "Earlier demonstrations in Seattle and Portland, Oregon, to decry racism and income inequality were largely peaceful, but protesters who gathered later in the day confronted police, who attempted to keep them from damaging property and disrupting traffic."  at least they made note that the black lives matter portion was peacefully conducted.  baby steps I suppose. But your point is well made. I didn't see any reports of looting/fire starting either, both of which make matters so much more news-able (yep I invented that word).  Idk. Were there any fires set/looting that went unreported?

I say we dump him in the middle of the pacific to try   help him.   I weep.         I'm assuming the dog was infected by fleas.  However:    "...Four days later, the dog's owner entered the hospital with a fever and a bloody cough that became worse over the next few hours, but an initial blood culture was misidentified, according to the CDC report.  As the patient's symptoms grew worse, the test was redone and he was found to have been infected with pnumonic plague, according to the CDC report. The remains of the dog were also tested and were found to be positive for the plague bacteria.  "Frankly one of the biggest surprises of this outbreak is the source," said John Douglas, of Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and one of the study authors. "Primarily ... dogs dont get sick at all or they get a minor illness," after being infected with the plague.  Janine Runfola, of the Tri-County Health Department in Colorado and lead author of the report, explained that cats are more likely to infect humans with the disease than dogs because they exhibit more symptoms. "For pneumonic plague a more likely scenario would be you have a cat [play] with prairie dogs and infected fleas get on the cat," Runfola said. "The cat gets sick and sneezes and coughs on its owner."  "The plague is caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, and can infect the body in different ways. For example a flea bite can lead to infection of the glands, which is called bubonic plague -- notorious for the epidemics it spawned during the Middle Ages in Europe. Because this plague was spread from dog to owner through coughing, it developed into pneumonic plague, according to Douglas.  The plague is known to be endemic to prairie dogs in the American Southwest, which can then lead to isolated outbreaks of the disease in domestic animals or humans.      not sure, Gonna go post in /r/colorado, I think I may have forgotten to earlier.  ok that's done.

 What is Soul Level?   I'm not 100% sure what Soul Level is. Is that just your normal level?   Holy crap that would be so great! Thanks! SL is 13436    This is legitimately the first time I have said aww outloud from a /r/aww picture. "Awww"   I love Solair. I want his armor. I would never *kill* Solair. If anyone has a character on PS3 where they wouldn't mind giving me the armor I would be forever grateful. If you do I will give you my Dark Sign!   Misleading title, I know. This may have been posted before, but this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XPAdlkQYYA ab_channel=REACT) makes me want to run into the room and show these kids how to play. Especially the two girls who were bitching the whole time. At least this gave some more people a chance to see dark souls, even if it was through some shitty perspective. (I am very salty about this video)   Any Animal Crossing fans?   indeed. Keep the same villagers, add more shit so we can sit and play for an hour plus. Loans for PWP would be gr8.   Some say he's racist... others treat him like a god. Adolf Hitler has done some crazy things, but you won't BELIEVE what he did to these Jews!   Taking the time to use the Wii U to do animal crossing would be a strain. The game would sell 100% better on 3DS as well. Anyone else with me?   I don't get it.   I'll try, thanks for the help! :)   Never been to the Depths. I went to blighttown through the valley of drakes.   By the "gaping dragons tail" do you mean drake sword? Like I said it's my first run.   :( Do I at least get his armor?    ed the guy with the eggs on his back at the spider lady as well.  I may have... I will check. oh... that means I have to go back to blighttown... rip me   D: Is there no other place to get pyromancy's flame. I know there is some way to get it if you get egg headed, but idk if that requires the daughter of chaos to be alive.    I think I killed him :/ I raged and went on a murderous rampage. Alot of NPC's died that day.   Where is he located at Firelink Shrine?   Where could I get a Pyromancy Flame?   8chan, hitler, isis, nazi, north korea, patriarchy, piccolo, satanist, stalin to name a few. lul. Fucking Dragonball Z offends feminists :p   I am not a member of the Chaos covenant or whatever. Solair is my favorite NPC and would hate for him to go insane. I killed white daughter of chaos after the Quelaag fight. Any way to save him? (I am at Anor Londo, so I don't think he can go insane yet, I just want to make sure) also first play through.    I am wanting to figure that out myself. :/   What the *fuck* Danny!?      Hmm. DAMN YOU MODS! D:   Wow, more salt in this comment than in that entire video.      I have an idea for the use of the clothes hanger after the ring extraction!         haha, thanks. :P   AC for the DS emulator. You can use cheats and spawn all the bells you need! :)   same   nah   What is going on?   Hey, the only thing I got to take pics is a 3DS. If you are fine with that I will post a pic.   frontyard*   Just woke up. What the hell have I done. :P NOT a fig tree though. No fruit. Also, found a way to make this weed related. Weed won't grow under it either! (oohh noes!)   Seriously didn't know. Was brosing /r/all and saw /r/trees. Didn't click the photo but I thought, hey, maybe they will know. Why not /r/weed or /r/marijuana?   DAMMIT TREEMAN! I thought a man of trees would know this. :p   on a scale of 1/10 the amount of grass surrounding my tree. That does not mean pelvic hair. It means that my tree hates grass. I am not saying I hate weed. I am saying... dammit... I give up. You get what I'm trying to say right!?    Just realized this is a weed subreddit... *facepalm*   I don't have a camera to take a photo of it. It is gray and has green leaves. The leaves have 3, idk, prongs(?) It won't let any grass grow within ~3 foot radius of it. Do any of you guys know what it is?   Semi-off topic. From my experience, Acer is not too reliable. I have had their products often breaking and messing up. Not sure about their monitors though. Just a thought :/   The fuck is that pic? I am very confused.      I laughed at this way too much...   Why are you spamming copypasta?      Well, the majority do. There are always a few exceptions, but most Christians do. Most Christians avoid talking about the Old Testament because of all the "Why did God kill everyone?" and the "Don't shave your sideburns" comments. :p   Okay, thanks for the info. Since I am not planning to buy more cards with the money should I go with TCGplayer or ebay? Which one have you had better experiences with selling cards?   I guess after you buy it take a vid of you scratching the marks in and save them all in a folder. Lots of work but when you are working with expensive equipment it is prob worth it.   Did you ask him if he was Robin Williams?   Ultra OP build. All you need is Super Saiyan, SS Goku's Z-Soul, and Crusher Volcano. Charge, go SS, spam Crusher Volcano, for every kill ALL your ki fills up again. 2ez4me   Old Testament and New Testament for Christianity.   I will. You are the only person to respond so far. :/   I've been playing for a little while. Never needed to sell cards because I like to collect them. Then, I pulled a Voice of Resurgence foil which is supposedly worth some money. Where would I sell it? Online? Local game shop?   ah, I see.   "Do as I say, not as I do." -Linus 20??   So it is just a generation of every book ever randomly? Wouldn't that take an infinite amount of time?   Can someone explain what this is?   Hey guys, speaking of PC accounts, lets exchange our PC account names. My account username is: XxX69PotatoCrusher69XxX. Also, I have PC Gold so I can play games with you.   Islam should have 4, Christianity should have 2, and Atheism should have a Kindle. :p   Ahh, I see. Thanks for the info! :)   I know how to take them, but how do you get them to your PC? Do you use an adapter and a SD card reader? Seems like a lot of work.   I really want to go on a salt filled rant about all these fatpeoplehate idiots that would get on bestof and I would have gold for 10 years. Instead, I only have 2 words. *Fuck you.* I have been a fan of Boogie for years now and it sucks how these assholes have no respect for him and what he has been through because he weighs "too much". I have been following boogie for a while and it astounds me how he gets all this hate and keeps going, keeps trying, and continues to inspire people. This dude is amazing. His fan base is just as great. He has the best community, who fucks up every asshole in the comments section who is a dick. Every time Boogie makes a video, I click it, and watch it. I will laugh, or cry. This dude has brought so much joy, and courage into my life there is nothing I can say to these pea brained bigots who don't look at *him*, but his *weight*. Also, I realize this is exactly what I said I wouldn't do earlier on in this comment... fuck.   What are we supposed to be seeing? A potato-quality Burger King drive-thru?    Also, Unpopular Opinion Puffin was banned a while ago. Que butt-hurt mods in 3... 2... [deleted]   I think she knows exactly what she said... (   ) ( ~  ) ( o  o)   Wasn't this banned? Also, how are you expecting this dumb generalization to not be downvoted into oblivion?   I think she knows exactly what she said... (   ) ( ~  ) ( o  o)  	72
 Shows the kind of man he was. Understood what he was up against and made the right calls to get it done. That's what we call a leader, here in the States. Now look at Britain.. Couldn't protect themselves from a paper cut without the US military.  "Checkmate" - George Washington      [MRW I watch that video.](http://i.imgur.com/GhzjoRT.jpg)   George Washington showed you what we think of your kind.   One of the leaders of the American Revolution visited England after the war. His host entertained him comfortably, but was the sort of fellow who constantly disparaged America and Americans generally and never could get over the fact we had beaten them in the war.  To amuse himself and to twit his American guest, the host hung a print of George Washington in his outhouse. It had been there for a few days, and the host knew the American must have seen it, but he had said nothing. Finally overcome by curiosity, the host asked his guest what he thought of the picture of Washington.  "It is most appropriately hung," the American replied. "Nothing ever made the British shit like the sight of George Washington."   "Washington was the only Southern slaveholding Founding Father among the top seven to emancipate his slaves after the American Revolution."   TIL that /r/TIL is anti-America and hates the founding fathers.    We do not care what Englishman think about us. We are Americans. You can keep your anti-American shit-stained mouth on that side of the pond. And, please, Churchill does not compare to George Washington.   Well said!   Hell, most sober drivers I see should have never been allowed behind the wheel.    Says the guy that voted for Obama.   I ripped the page out and hid it in my closet for safe keeping.    k   lol thats funny   Ask yourselves...Why would anyone want to give more money to the government? Are they spending your money wisely now? Do they have a tight budget that they adhere to? Would it matter if we had this extra revenue? How do you know it would help? The US Government does not use your money wisely now, what makes you think they will somehow become budget pros if they had this extra money? Where would the money go? Where would it be spent? How is your money being spent now?    Liar! Liberals tell me all the time that if you ban something unicorns appear.    "Give us more of your money. We are great cutting waste. We will give you the most bang for your buck. We spend your money wisely on stuff like $436 hammers and such. We need more!" - US Government   I just asked a poor person for a job and they said to let them know when I found one.    Top Gun is one of my favorite movies of all time but that doesn't mean Tom Cruise is *not* batshit crazy.    Racists are bigots but that does not mean bigots are racist. A racist is someone who believes in the superiority of one race over another, or who acts differently (usually negatively) towards a person or a group of people because of their race. A bigot is a blinkered, narrow-minded person, usually also very intolerant and unable to see anyone else's point of view. People can be bigoted about things that have nothing to do with race.   Kanye is one of those people that just needs a good ass-whoopin. Talk shit their entire lives until someone actually puts them in their place. No one has put Kanye in his place yet. With an ego like his, its bound to happen.    Kanye West is a racist bigot.   Kanye is a worthless pile of worm shit.   There were 17 producers credited on Beyonce's self-titled album. You know who produced Beck's "Morning Phase"? Just Beck. A well-deserved award for an incredibly talented artist. Fuck you, Kanye!   And they blew it on housing dope smokers at the county jail and whores.   Sounds like your animal shelter employs a bunch of damn commies.    Once you hit 34 or 35 you start to get the, "You are a little older than I was looking for" or the "I can't get passed the age difference" responses. The first time I got one of these (I was 35) was the first time I said to myself, "I am officially getting old." Now I am in my 50s and still hoping I find the one. Wish me luck, guys!

People who use the passing lane as the slow lane.   Vaccinations should be "voluntary". Giving the government the power to strap you down and put a needle in your arm is not something I could ever foresee me being supportive of. People should be vaccinated, but it should be up to the parents and not the government. More education on the subject? Sure. Forcing needles in peoples arm by government agencies? No, thank you.   ummmm, yes, I am here for the gilding..... I have cheeseburgers, if you are interested.       Did you forget the comment I was responding to? So are you saying that selling a 20oz water and some lottery tickets is not harmless?   Why does a gas station clerk keep a pistol under the counter?   I, for one, do not want a government that can force a needle in your arm.   [MRW I watch that video.](http://i.imgur.com/GhzjoRT.jpg)         That I did, accidentally. Thank you, fellow patriot.

I have been using Avast Endpoint Protection Plus on my servers -Per server license comes in 5pack. It has an Exchange feature. It can be pushed to clients. Its cheap and gets the job done. It's not the greatest solution on the market but if you need cheap it works. It is not as robust as Groupshield but has been great at capturing any type of infected file trying to get through and has a decent spam filter.   Instead they guaranteed the sell of a product for an entire industry. Damn those 1%'ers!! *wink* *wink*   Considering they were able to pass the Affordable Care Act without Republican votes would make me assume that Democrats are the reason that Democrats could not get single-payer health care through Congress.

The top comment has the same GUID procedure as my link. I just thought that maybe OP didn't read my comment. Thanks!   And the DWORD entry is Decimal?  Edit: Also, if nothing else has worked, try making the size limit something like 3 times the size of current DB size instead of 8000. How much storage do you have where this DB is located? You can also try recreating the registry entry by following the [walk-through](http://tinyurl.com/qzarslk) on technet.    Make sure you are running the latest updates. Are you running low on storage? Did you make this registry change? If so, did you restart Information Store? Still having issues?   So glad I live in a country where citizens have the means to protect themselves.    ....and wind up ~~in ditches~~ as Engineers with some other company.    I could have possibly worded my post a little different to keep from confusion. No apologies needed, but thanks!   I was not trashing your post. I am trashing our elected officials. I am very happy to see this still in discussion. I am just pointing out that we need to do more. We need to guarantee the passage and enforcement of this legislation. We are the voters. We are the only ones who can enforce it. The fact that all we ever have is discussion and nothing actually happens is not where we want to be. I appreciate your post and your continued efforts to keep the word out.   God gave us free will. He does not pick and choose our battles.   [...i don't know what we're yelling about?!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCVHpnixj88)   There is a reason it is no longer a default sub. /r/politics is nothing more than the left nut of the Democrats sack.    Warren is too left leaning to win the general. Anyone that believes otherwise is lying to themselves...same for Bernie Sanders.      When one of these States actually passes said legislation and enforces it, I will believe something is actually being done about it.

I do not have the palate some of you more experienced drinkers may have. I may just not know how to understand my palate. Scotch is my favorite to drink. I am a sipper. 1-2 ounces is usually as much as I will drink in one setting. What I do know is that Oban 14 is my favorite Scotch. I love the taste. I cannot explain it the way some of you do. All I can say is I love the taste and it has been my fav Scotch for some time. I do try different types of Scotch any chance I get. I just had the Glenmorangie Nectar Dor 12 and enjoyed that very much.   Masons do much good for their local communities. They have earned their respect.   I personally have watched multiple illegal immigrants get employed using false documents. We actually uncovered a document scheme at a company I used to consult for. A legal immigrant was providing stolen documents for illegal workers. Had been doing it for 10+ years. Had provided documents to 1000s of illegals. The documents being provided got them through eVerify with no problems. This is just one company I consulted for in the past. eVerify is only as strong as the border and enforcement. The point is, if you are breaking the law you should be held accountable. Whether its knowingly hiring illegal workers or being in this country illegally. If you are here illegally then you are breaking the law. Those that are breaking the law should be punished. Secure the border, fund and push enforcement, verify legal status and deport those that are here illegally.    We shouldn't have protected classes at all. All classes should be equally protected under the law.   I am all for giving more funding to ICE and enforcement. I would like to see more deportations and raids. I do however disagree with the article that "The border security issue is, at this point, 90 to 95 percent solved," If this is so then how are millions of immigrants (almost 12 million - 800k annually) still crossing our borders?   All expenses paid including airfare, free jumpsuit, and all the Britney Spears music you can handle.   You failed to answer my question. How do you punish businesses, which majority are following all rules, when the illegal immigrants are using legitimate SS numbers that are stolen? All I got from your comment was blah blah blah blame Reagan blah blah blah Amnesty.    How do you punish a business when illegal immigrants are using stolen SS numbers that pass eVerify checks? You must punish the people doing the crime...the ILLEGAL immigrant.      Thank god!      Hi, Elon!   What is your favorite cartoon?  Thanks for the AMA!

Of course, this is all assuming you are running Windows OS.   Edit: Link   They show ads for most things..that doesn't make me jump off my couch and go buy it. Why? Because I can think for myself and make my own choices in life.    But its reality.   Why do you need luck? Pay it back!    He did not kill himself because of money. Guaranteed.    You mean like losing your home, cars, life savings, and children in a divorce? I see what you are saying. Paying back a loan you signed for is much worse than losing everything you have because you married a pussy with an attitude.    People make mistakes. There are repercussions for mistakes. I have made mistakes in my life. You have made mistakes in your life. But those are mistakes we made. Those mistakes were based on choices we made. We must deal with the repercussions of those mistakes. Either we learn from it or we dont. Its not someone elses fault that we made the choice. We made it with our own free will. Someone else did not make that choice for us. We must own up to our own mistakes in life and learn from them. Blaming others will do nothing for us.    Then do not get one if you cannot afford the interest on it.   You should never sign anything unless you KNOW, not think, know what you are signing.    I am saying that if you sign a contract then be prepared to deal with the repercussions. The entire argument of the cat or knees is irrelevant as it would be illegal to write that into the contract. You are grasping at straws. People should be able to enter into any contract they want as long as it does not affect someone else directly. If I sign a contract saying that I am being loaned $100 and that contract says that the interest will be 75% if I do not pay it back on time, who is the idiot? I would never sign anything like that. There are millions of poor people. Do you know why those millions of poor people do not rob the grocery stores on a daily basis? Because there are repercussions to robbing that store. You will go to jail. Repercussions for actions. Is it cool that poor people that cannot feed their families will go to jail if they steal a loaf of bread? not cool, no. but its reality. If you make a choice there are repercussions for that choice.    Physical violence is illegal. Charging interest on a loan is not.    Again, why sign something if you do not understand what you are signing? He physically signed his name to that piece of paper. He had every opportunity to turn around and walk out. He had every opportunity to read the contract. I have no problem with people taking loans if they need the money. I do have a problem with people taking other peoples money, signing a contract to pay it back, proceed to not pay it back, and then blame the lender. The lender offers a service. If you do not want their service, do not use it. There are millions of poor people. Do you know why those millions ofpoor people do not rob the grocery stores on a daily basis? Because there are repercussions to robbing that store. You will go to jail.    This is just a liberal website using the death of a kid to further their anti-capitalist agenda. Sorry for your loss.    It says right there in the contract what the interest will be when you fail to pay the loan on time. It says right there. And this was not this kids only option.. give me a break. If he was so down on his luck and could not afford to live then he should have sold his ipad, iphone, shut off his internet, his cable tv, and just got the basics in life. He chose to use payday loans because getting rid of the other "needs", they are wants not needs, was too unbearable to think of.    Maybe I am... but how does that change the fact that this kid made a choice. He signed a contract know what the repercussions were of failing to follow through with his end of the contract. He made his choices. And there were repercussions for those choices. On top of that he made a selfish choice to leave his family here to deal with his death.    No, I grew up very poor. I was also very poor while I was in college. I lived on bologna, water, and kept my electric and water on. That was it. I did not go sign contracts I could not pay back. I scrimped by. I went without. I lived in the bottom of the barrel for most of my life. What I didnt do was take someone elses money without paying it back and then blame them for it.    How is it a trap if its spelled out in the contract that you sign? If you cannot afford to pay back the loan or cannot follow through with your contractual agreement, then do not sign a contract.    Exactly. Maybe he did not see an ad at all? Or maybe he wasnt as broke as its made out to be. Maybe he was spending his money on cable tv, internet, ipads, etc. Maybe he saw the ad on the internet. If he was so broke, he should not have had anyway to post on Facebook before his death. When I was broke I had electricity, bologna, bread, and water. That was it.    Who took out the loan? When you sign the loan that says they will kill your cat if you its not paid back, do not be surprised when they kill your cat. Do not sign something if you are not prepared to deal with the repercussions.   If you have a job there is no excuse for not feeding your kids. Turn off the cable and put down the $500 cell phone.    An advertisement does not force you to do anything. You still have to make the choice to purchase the product they are selling. Its not the advertisers fault you made the choice you did. They sell a product. It is your choice to buy that product or not. If you cannot afford something, do not buy it. Its very simple, actually.     Some borrow even when they know they wont be able to pay it back.  And that is their choice. There are repercussions to choices we make.    Or, you know, get a job and feed your kids.   Guess he should have paid it back to the terms of his contract. He knew it would do that. Its in the contract.    You mean you took responsibility for your own actions? How dare you!   Who cares what the advert says. How are they watching adverts if they cant afford to live? He made a choice. He was not forced to take that loan out. Stop blaming others for peoples personal choices in life. Nothing made him do anything. He chose to do it. I do not care what the advert said... he made the choice.    Have to place the blame somewhere. Personal responsibility no longer exists to these people.    Do you know how stressful it is using an iPhone 5s when the 6 is out?   How could he afford those tablets?   So you paid it back, learned a lesson, and didn't kill yourself over it? Glad you took responsibility for you own choice and paid it back. You kept good on your word.    I have been without. I would not take someone elses money on contract if I was not going to pay it back. If I needed to feed my family I would work  and earn a paycheck to feed them. How could he afford those pills he OD'd on if he could not afford food? He had Facebook... how did he have Facebook if he could not feed his family?    He killed himself. No one else did it for him. He did this to himself. He is responsible for his death. He made the choice to end his life.    iPhone 6   Or, you know, don't take a loan out you cannot pay back. It's very simple. Personal choices have repercussions.    Everyone is given the terms of the contract before they sign it. If you cannot handle the possible repercussions of the contract, do not sign it. Take responsibility for your life. Stop blaming someone else for peoples own personal mistakes.   Yahoo, AOL, and IRC chatrooms.... A/S/L ? *train_subject1917 has joined the room*   I understand. Glad this will work for you.

                   Tons of books have contemporary technology in them? Or am I not understanding the question?   Like there are both lots of stories where characters have cell phones and use computers, and there are lots of books that incorporate emails and stuff into the text.                   I think it's publicly available, but Melville House also published it in book form                                 "no one speaks in prose" as they say.   At the same time, keep in mind that the books you are likely referring to only deal with the upper classes who, especially at that time in say England, were obsessed with seeming cultured and proper.                                  This is silly. You can absolutely teach students a diverse range of literature without cutting all of the old canon.             such a great book!   Ursula K. Le Guin for sure.   Neil Gaiman for sure.   C.S. Lewis for sure.   Robert Howard for sure. (Unless you are trying to make it just "high fantasy" and not all fantasy)  Gene Wolfe might be a good call too.            I'm going to back the heck off and argue that right now is a golden age for both readers AND writers. There will be more written and published this year that I want to read than I will be able to read in my lifetime. The gatekeepers are being made obsolete by sites like Smashwords, and yes, Amazon. And yes, as a consequence, right now the market is being flooded. I agree. There is definitely a lot of crap out there -- but there's also a lot of great communities that help people wade through and find some absolute gems. That's the thing -- remove the gatekeepers and the words will flow.  I think it's weird that people assume that gatekeepers are a purely bad thing. "Gatekeepers" also make sure work that gets through is professional, edited, revised, formatted correctly, etc., in addition to theoretically making sure it is good.   I think the ideal situation is one where gatekeepers exist AND there is a way around them, but where authors still get paid decently. A world where authors don't get paid well, but everyone and their mother can publish Harry Potter fan fiction is... fine I guess, but not a great way to insure good lasting work.                                      Tons of plot in the series does not involve the Starks at all and nevertheless contributes to its themes,  Sure, all to be fair the books start off almost all stark. There are 72 chapters, plus a prolog for AGOT. 53 (or 74%) are Stark characters. Tyrion and Dany are the only non-Starks with POV chapters (plus the one prologue)   ACOK adds a few Davos chapters and Theon chapters (although Theon is a Stark ward so is part of the Stark tragedy), but is still basically all Stark. Book 3 adds Jaime and Sam (the latter is part of the Jon/Stark tragedy), but is again a majority Stark chapters.  It is really only in books 4/5 that Martin starts going into the other non-Dany / non-Stark storylines. That's when we really see the non-Tyrion Lannisters, the Iron Islanders, the Donrish, and so on.    I mostly agree with you, but at the same time I have a hard time calling someone who sold people into slavery (Jorah) or a pillaging pirate (Asha) "good" people. Even Dany has caused tons of horror, though I guess her heart was in the right place at least.    sigh, not sure the semantic game you are playing. He outthinks his opponents, whether that's "cleverness" or "results driven" or "early deconstructionist knight" is kind of immaterial here.    As I said in my last post, Bronn is only one of the many lucks Tyrion gets so I don't want to argue too much here. All i'd say is that Bronn is only as skilled as an average knight, but he is way more clever than 95% of knights in his depiction.    I'm not really acting like anything, just saying Tyrion has lots of luck! look, skip past Bronn being his savior found randomly in an inn. Tyrion is saved from death by Varys for no super logical reason (Varys risks losing so much there.) He escapes despite stopping to kill his dad. He is saved from the stone men, he is saved from drowning, he survives outside of Meereen... he's constantly surviving when probably most people would die.   It's totally cool, almost all narratives do this. I'm just disagreeing that only the bad guys have luck while only the good guys have bad luck ala the post's original argument.    Also    a single Knight we have little reason to rate as a champion fighter.  I mean, we don't get power ratings or something, but he is the captain of the Eyrie guard. He should be a pretty great knight    Your argument is that your average rando sellsword could have accomplished all Bronn did?       The book still presents him as someone near the top of warriors you'd place money on in a contest. He's not top 3 maybe, but probably top 15...whether it is "cleverness" over "pure strength" or not. That's pretty good luck for Tyrion!   Godly warrior, as in like the strongest around? No. But he is sold as one of the most CLEVER warriors. He defeats the Vale knight, he helps plan Blackwater, he runs the gold cloaks...he's pretty stellar all around.   And the fact that he is just a random sellsword at the same inn that Tyrion and Cat happen to both run into each other at is totally luck.   I'm not saying some luck is bad, just that "good" characters do get plenty of luck in the books too.     Amazon seems to have really wanted to reward authors of well-written, lengthy novels and stem the flow of poorly-written shorts.   This seems smart to me. The old model really rewarded shitty, quick, short books. That's not good for anybody.   But I agree that I don't know if this fix will solve the problem.    Yes agreed. Martin is flipping those Tolkien idealist fantasy stories on there head, but that doesn't mean he necessarily thinks one is 100% true or false.    Well we have to define what we are talking about. In Martin's world we aren't just following random people, we are following the RULING class. Kings, princes, generals. People who are born into wealth and power, or who gain it through war and conquest.   Can you ever be a good person who gains power by war and conquest? Martin does a good job of showing how people can commit horrible acts but still be "nice guys" you'd want to have a beer with or whatever.    But I agree it isn't necessarily intrinsic to the human race. It probably isn't even necessary in all parts of Martin's world. But it is intrinsic to a power structure like the Westerns world when you are in the ruling class.    I mean it's our news too. Politicians have sex scandals and shit every day. We venerate people like Steve Jobs who were famously assholish to everyone around them (Jobs even lied in court to prevent child support payments to his daughter). The NFL has players who were involved in stabbings or ran dog fighting rings.   Basically, we venerate power not goodness.    The real world of 2015 or the real world of... medieval era times?   I think it's probably pretty accurate that for most of human history rulers were horrible assholes for the most part who constantly trampled on the rights of those below them. The poor people have been shit on forever, and Machiavellian schemers DO tend to do better than idealistic good guys.    I like this analysis! Although I'm not sure if it is entirely accurate.   The books (and show) have kind of bent over backwards to help out our heroes many times over.   Take **Tyrion**. He just happens to get one of the apparently best fighters in Westeros--Bronn--on his side? Bronn is a random sellsword who is both willing and able to defeat knights in fights to the death for a stranger and a little pay.   Plenty of luck and plot armor has been needed for **Arya** to survive, or for that matter for **Jon Snow** to survive the wildlings adventure. Arya survives being around so many enemies for so long. Snow somehow doesn't get killed by wildlings who really have no reason to trust him, then survives climbing the wall and so much   **Dany** has luck coming out the butt at every instance, although I guess since she is magic and prophecized you can explain it. I mean there a dozens way she should have died marching with the Drogo. Skipping her magic shit, she still should have died in the red wastes, or in Qarth, or in one of her various military campaigns in Slaver's bay.   etc.       Blood Meridian   Seems accurate for Martin's world, right? At least so far in the series, the "good" characters---Ned, Jon, Robb, Tyrion, Sansa--all are either killed or constantly undermined and abused.   But I think the article is right that the ending of the series might be more of a "good guys win!" thing      I know people are probably sick of GOT articles, but I thought this one was actually very smart and made interesting points about fantasy storytelling in general         I think it is certainly true that much fantasy serves as escapism, especially with the white washed nostalgia for the medieval era being so common (part of the ASOIAF appeal is that it makes that era look horrible instead of super awesome knights and princesses battiling evil with happy songs)   ah yours didn't show up when I searched, guess cause you had social media tag stuff on the link. Sorry!                   Genres all overlap too though. Is Lethem's "Gun with Occasional Music" a Crime/Noir or a Science Fiction book? Is Gene Wolfe's Book of the New sun fantasy or SF?   Anyway, contemp lit just means contemporary literary fiction. Last 40 years maybe?    Thought this might be inspiring to share (cross post /r/books)       Every other red priest DOES actually seem to be aligned with Danny. So the fact that Melissandra seems completely detached from this is odd. I do know she's classified as a shadow binder.  Not Thoros, the only other red priest in Westeros.   This is a world where there is very little communication across kingdoms. Most of Westeros only knows vague rumors about Dany and her dragons. It's not like the red priests are calling each other on the phone discussing their crushes every night, you know?    ah yeah I always took it as blonde hair (ie the proof of their bastardy)    it doesn't say that he will die super young though, does it? Or even before Cersei?                   despite the headline, it doesn't seem like either person in the interview is advocating that   Yeah, I mean it depends on what we are talking. Small presses pay more like 1,000 to 5,000 on average. Big 5 imprints pay more like 15k average for a debut novel, from what I've seen. But often much more too.    I'd say the main thing to know is that ideas are a dime a dozen. It is the execution that matters. What kind of execution? Depends on what you are trying to do... write literary novels with great prose, or work that fits neatly into a specific mass market genre. Either way, your idea is only getting you 25% of the way there. The execution of the idea is the main thing.    I think the claim is more that the average debut book advance is $5,000. I think that's low, and it's probably more like 5 to 20K depending on the genre. Still, not a lot.                      Agatha Christie had a whole series with an old heroine detective, the Miss Marple novels       Agree with fighting the 1%, just think that would be better done against banks, wall street, tech companies, and agro-mutlinationals... not authors or even publishers (most publishers aren't really that big, and the ones that are are big for shit like cookbooks and celebrity memoirs, not quality fiction. The fiction imprints don't make that much money)   Sure, but those three don't single out artists in the way that the vast majority of internet commentors do.   We live in a really weird world where people call authors greedy evil assholes for asking for a few bucks for a book they spent years writing using their 500 dollar phones and sipping their 5 dollar lattes.    That's an uptick from digital books after Amazon did a lot to damage profits in print books for years though. I dunno, it's impossible to pose an alternative history and figure out if Amazon's nonexistence would have helped or hurt.   I do think that in ANY industry having one player have so much control of the market is bad. It is doubly bad if that one player isn't really invested in the production, but just in the distribution and sales.   I'm not sure piracy is as much of a problem in books as film and TV though. Even today, the print market is much larger than the digital market. People aren't as keen on ebooks as they are on digital music/film/tv   Although I still root for Stannis, in the books at least, I like your AA theory. Makes sense that Melisandre would mix them up that way instead of just being 100% wrong about who is AA.    Well I think any of them could die before "The final fight" but I'd say the following are unkillable until at least the last half of the last book, based on the narrative weight Martin has given them:   * Dany * Jon Snow * Bran * Tyrion  Others I really don't think will die before then  * Euron (think he will be big baddy along with White Walkers)  * Sansa (think she survives whole series, though she is certainly "killable" if Martin wanted) * Arya  Character I hope lasts till near the end:   * Stannis   You'd argue that based on what stats or inside publishing data?    What I never get is that people freak out about artists wanting money, but no one calls Steve Jobs or the CEO of Chipotle or the head of some toothpick brand or whatever else some "greedy capitalist arse" who we should steal from... even though I'd much rather huge corporations lose money than writers.    I'm sure Spotify and such help curb piracy, but they also pay complete shit. Like they are killing the music industry it seems.    yeah video games are much closer to like feature films... or TV shows. So many people involved.    the NYT is still held in very high regard too, it's the gold standard of newspapers even if papers are dying.   Also, the fact that the NYT hosts the best seller list doesn't have much to do with their journalism or the reputation of newspapers in 2015. It's like, the Bailey's Prize for Women's Fiction is sponsored by Bailey's Irish Whiskey, the Michilen guide to restaurants is run by the tire company, etc., but even if people hated Michelin tires they'd still respect the ratings int he restaurant guide.                                        A bunch of these already exist. The best is Oyster.   Well even if this theory was true, which I don't think it is but hey it's fun, no way could they fit this into the finale.   In King's Landing alone, we will have to deal with Cersei and Margery and their dealings with the High Sparrow. That will probably take up all our King's Landing time, since we still have Jon Snow being killed, Stannis marching and maybe attacking, Sansa/Theon/Winterfell, Dany's advisers dealing with her leaving, Arya killing Trant, and probably a scene with Dany.    Although really I think probably only 3-4 of those 6 will die: Jon, Trant, and either Kevan or Bronn   I listed Jorah, but even though he has death sentence, narratively it makes sense for him to stick around until he has infected a few people with Grayscale   Don't think that Balon will be shown. That will happen in season 6. Really don't think Stannis dies yet, hope not at least. Anyway:   5) Jon Snow 4) Meryn Trant 3) Kevan Lannister 2) Bronn 1) Ramsay  HM) Jorah   I'd say:   1) Arya will certainly appear, probably kill Trant and get blinded.   2) Stannis will absolutely appear, as he was in the episode trailer. Not sure if we'll see any battle with the Boltons though.   3) Something along those lines has to happen to finish the Winterfell arc.   4) 50/50  5) I think this will happen, 75%  6) I think we'll see Dany land somewhere, maybe encounter the Dothraki.   7) Yes, gotta have some Drone follow-up/reveal.   8) Yes, 100%. Olly will stab him.   9) Nah.     Eat whatever the Wildlings survive upon outside the wall. And defend the wall!  a) The Wildlings fled south precisely because they couldn't survive north of the wall anymore.   b) Even ignoring the White Walkers killing everyone with zombie army, the Wildlings were surviving during normal summer and winter. This is the long night, the horrible winter that will potentially destroy the world.    Or name yourself Lord Commander after saving the NW--they couldn't deny him that.  Yes they could, and that doesn't solve the problem of not having enough food to feed an entire army for years during an impossibly long winter anyway.    Use all that iron bank gold to buy food from Essos.  Winter has only started and the snows are so deep Stannis cant' even march! Trading ships from Essos are not delivering food to the Wall. It's cut off.    Davos told him to go back, but Jon Snow made it clear that Castle Black couldn't feed and house his entire army for the winter, which likely lasts years in Westeros world.    Dunno, I think it would leak. I mean, honestly, bookstores get books well in advance of the release date. You can't just deliever a book to millions of bookstores the day you want it released.    I think Stannis, in both book and show, legitimately feels like he is both forced to be king and forced to fulfill the prophecy to save the world. I don't think he did it for himself like Walter White.    Littlefinger doesn't seem like the fighting type to me. He wants to sit in the shadows and see how the chaos plays out. he wouldn't risk getting killed by either side.    Not really how book publishing works. Takes a few months to go through editing, production, printing, and distrobution even with the quickest of turn arounds.     It also is very obvious that they can be pretty awful when they try to invent plots from scratch without adapting from the source material.  They are always adapting from the source, IMHO. They just combine and streamline a lot, sometimes really well and sometimes really badly. I think all their choices have been really logical, even if the writing or directing failed certain subplots.     But would be wrong with having those two as advisers.  Not sure i'd argue his death was good or bad, but Dany has Daario and her dumb husband as advisers, and then Tyrion comes and Jorah semi-returns. I can understand wanting to simplify things there.    I wish they would have stayed true to the books for that storyline. I thought the rape scene with Sansa was unnecessary and her being there is very strange for me.  Stayed true by having Ramsay rape and torture a fake Arya stark character who hadn't been set up yet? I think TV viewers who didnt' follow the books would be totally lost there.    Feel like this season was very mixed. the Hardhome episode might be the best of the entire series, and it was wildly different from the books. On the other hand, many of the book changes were weak and the Drone stuff in particular was really bad. Hoping that it was set-up for important Dorne stuff in season 6.    Left column: Stannis gives speeches about how it's totally right for single innocents to die to save thousands, and he tries to sacrifice an innocent child to the flames.   Right column: Stannis believes the end of the world is near and he is the only hope. Melisandre told him seasons ago that he would have to betray his family to win the great war.    Does he even really have powers? He resurrects the one dude over and over again, but he never resurrects anyone else. I think the implication is that the Lord of Light wants him alive, not that Thoros has great powers.    Gotta disagree, I think the show (and books) make it very clear that blood is required for magic. Miri kills Dany's child to "save" Drogo. Dany kills Miri to waken the dragons. Stannis is half-dead after Mel creates the shadow assassins.  As for Thoros, I guess no blood is used exactly, but Beric comes back more and more a shadow of himself and LSH... well.        It also pisses me off that Benioff would implicate Martin; he knew full well that the episode would cause controversy (which seems to be this season's running theme and it's starting to get on my nerves  Are the showrunners really anymore gleeful about causing controversy than Martin himself (when he talked about how the Sansa sample chapter would make people freak out, etc.)?          Word, agree.    This is a semantic question. What's the line between mythology and fantasy or folk lore/fairy tales and fantasy? Is the Odyssey fantasy? Are the Grimm fairy tales?   Personally, I'd say the real first modern fantasy is whatever prose book that used fantasy elements but WASN'T directly based on or retelling myths/fairy tales/folk legends should count as the first real fantasy work.     I mean, they're certainly reprehensible, but neo-Nazi is just inaccurate  Vox Day (Rabid Puppy guy) is completely a neo-Nazi, and I'm not one for hyperbole. I don't think that label fits the Sad Puppy guys at all though.                   ah link didn't come up, but I guess new Republic just republishes New Statesmen pieces now                                                         Yeah, but honestly my guess is that he will just wrote more books. I'd be surprised if we don't get at least an 8th.     Why do people seem to think writing a great show and sticking to source material NEED to be mutually exclusive?  I didn't say that. But you said they should have changed the plotlines they wanted to do in order to fluff up the show and make it take longer than they were planning for it to take. That doesn't make sense if your goal is the best show (according to their standards.) That only makes sense if you think staying behind martin matters the most.    It's at least one more year before you have to add filler.   So now you want them to add "filler" to the show for possibly years and years until Martin finishes? If book 6 comes out in 2016, which is a big IF as far as I'm concerned, then it took Martin 5 years. It took him 6 years to do ADWD and 5 to do AFFC. So he is averaging over 5 years a book.   So let's say he does 7 books (I think he will probably do 8 but...), that's 2021. And since the show has to be filmed and come out after that, we are talking 2022 for the show. The show is planning to end in 2017. You want them to add FIVE YEARS of filler just on the hopes of staying behind Martin?   Honestly, your and my personal preferences aside, that's just logistically really hard. You have actors who want to do other things can't be locked into contracts that long. You have show runners who want to do other things. And you have the fact that GOT is the most expensive show ever made. Can it really sustain itself for 12 seasons? How many prestige dramas have lasted that long? Most Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, etc. type shows last half that, and they are much cheaper to make.

Most Mad Men, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, etc. type shows last half that, and they are much cheaper to make.    1) their goal is a great show, not staying behind Martin's writing  2) what would one season help? Martin MIGHT finish book six by 2016, but it will take years for him to do book 7 (and he may well stretch to 8 or 9).    Plus the two books don't even cover the five years, right? Only like one year has passed    b) That GRRM is going to start writing the books to dovetail with what the show is doing and deviate from his own original trajectory.  I think the exact opposite, that he will change his original plan to make the books move away from show               Oh, last month? The book is City on Fire by Garth Risk Hallberg (might have the name slightly misspelled). Comes out this winter I think.   It's totally rare, but that's just an extreme example. Even if you publish a book with a small indie press that only pays you 1,000 dollars, they will send a hundred or more review copies out, get your book distributed to bookstores, set up readings, radio interviews, and the like.   Presses do a lot of marketing work.    That isn't really true though. Yes, all debut writers have to do some marketing, but that doesn't mean that presses don't do a ton of it for you and do MORE of it based on how they think you will sell. I just read an article about a debut novelists who got a 2 million dollar deal and his publisher (Knopf? I think) was sending out 6,500 advance copies to reviewers. Something like that is HUGE at getting your book talked about and sold.     IJ isn't that great of a benchmark for long novels   True, BUT IJ is one of the longest single book books. Like, on that wiki list you have Proust's In Search of Lost Time which was released as 7 different books over the course of many many years.   But, yes, there are books longer by both men and women.       Sure, but what does that have to do with my post? I'm just saying he DOES get lit snob respect these days   Kind of, but I think basically every real publisher deals with Amazon (and Barnes and Noble and every other big place) because they have to to survive.       Here's the thing though: studies say that 1 million books are published each year. The major publishers put out thousands of titles each year. Books have been written for centuries.   So, there are many millions of books out there.   As such you and me and everyone else relies on a ton of filters to decide what we read. Right? And those filters--from book reviews, to marketing budgets, to "the canon" taught in school, to what your friends read--are skewed by the racism and sexism in society.   This isn't your fault or my fault or any individual's fault, but it's how everything ends up shaking out.   So to be clear, I'm not saying YOU are racist or sexist. I'm saying society is. And it takes a lot of work to overcome that.    Authors don't control that, their publishers do.     You read like another self hating white guy. Why the fuck would I go out of my way to "diversify" my reading log? Why would I want to read worse books just because black women wrote it?  In a world with billions of non-white people, and huge histories of fantastic literature in tons of countries all around the world, why on earth do you assume that diverse reading means "worse" books?    I think it's a pretty great time to be a white female author. But it's minority authors, that's a different story in America.   Look at the bestseller lists. Almost no one on them is non-white.    You... never heard about slavery? Or Jim Crow? Or the statistics of wealth distribution in America?   	200

The truth is that this isn't something you can teach, you have to learn from your current position and unlearn your own biases. But you're on the right track, keep trucking on and you'll find your center one day!   Nothing. This is enough.       It was 4% the hour they announced it.    Does it feel good? ;)   Yeah crazy. Absolutely crazy. I thought I would die first.      Is this better? ;)   Interested. Link to thread please?         I don't have a stake in either side... but infrared sensors and computers are more than capable of sensing deer at 40mph... one travels at the speed of light and the other computes at it...   3 days of flat is really little compared to total profits, it's probably not even worth the cost of implementation.         OMNISLASH         ok.   It's only mind blowing in the context of today. Look at a multiple decade stock market chart and you'll realize that astronomical drops of 50% look like blips overall. You have to realize that context is relative, so looking back at technological progress from the next century would blow your mind by twice as much.   The correct way to reconcile your mind blowing-ness is that nature develops at a logarithmic rate not an arithmetic rate, and hence progress has to be charted as a relative construct as opposed to an absolute one. It only makes sense to account for progress as that made between two points of development as opposed to comparing all random points in time on the same scale to the beginning. When you do it that way, it doesn't seem that extraordinary.       The only thing that matters is ROI. What's the incremental return on that school to another? If the breakeven is less than 10 years, then from a financial perspective it's feasible.    I've been a professional copywriter for 5 years. What's your budget like?   MUCH more poor. Much much more. You can't even imagine it.    They'd probably say the same thing. Except in poverty and malnutrition and surrounded by the stench of death. Or hunted down as fugitives. Being kicked out of the house is easy mode.    It's easier to accept that this has been how things have been for centuries and how they will be for centuries more. It's true what you say but it's far more utilitarian to forget about it and learn to live with the limits. Let other people break them, there certainly isn't a lack of people trying.    Cookies are literally the easiest thing in the world to make. Butter sugar flour chocolate chips    Wealth is relative. When you've only experienced growing up rich, it seems normal. Have you ever held yourself accountable for being richer than 80% of the world's population? For instance, by not complaining? Many would (and probably have) kill to be where we are.   The correct way to find peace with money isn't to get more of it, but to stop seeing those with less as inferior. For instance, Myanmar Rohingyas are every bit as equal as we are, just much unluckier.    Most of us are like this.   Same.       No. It's a legit way of saving money. If you really wanted to drill down, just find out how much % their stores/total PPE are. If it's not meaningful, it's unlikely.      It boggles the mind.                              man, I was thinking exactly not to make that mistake when typing the title.       Why? Is he a good roommate?   Those two things don't go together.   ... time flies.          Stock market isn't perfect.

As we speak I am contacting the Federal Reserve and informing them that you are a good-for-nothing, society draining top-down economics bear, and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, penny pincher. The storm which wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your portfolio. Not only am I extensively trained in the ways of Graham and Doddsville, but I have access to the phonelines of Warren Buffett, Carl Icahn, Bill Gross, Ben Bernanke and Jim Cramer *combined*; and I will use my political and social capital to its fullest extent to wipe your miserable trades off the face of the market. I will call the offices of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and even Lehman Brothers to ensure you will never spend another day slaving over adjusting font sizes in Powerpoint slides at 3AM in the morning. If only you could have known what your tongue wagging would have wagered on you; but you couldn't, you wouldn't, and now you're paying the price.

Everyone wants Meg.   Your par interest would still be 21.5% in 1988. It's impossible to think of it now, but at the time rampant inflation was considered a very real threat. The yield reflected accurate sentiments on the dollar's purchasing power at the time.  Go do a google search of Vockler during his tenure. It was a very interesting and very different time, almost alien. Even Warren Buffett expected inflation to continue breaking new highs indefinitely. There was even someone here who bought 30y Treasuries at 15% awhile ago, which if he had held would have made him look like a genius.    Reddit's upper echelons are starting to clear out the weeds to transform it into a family friendly "real" company.

I admit the grammatical error is my fault, but regarding the tone most of that was due to multiple revisions requested by the client. The article started off with the more natural tone as in /r/investing, but when the client wanted me to fix sentences here and there according to their liking without explaining why, the article as a whole ended up sounding disjointed. Also, sometimes you're not quite sure what the client actually wants, so when he says 'ok' I just rolled with it and wrapped it up.  I'm positive I could deliver on decent industry standards if required, and I have the background expertise to fulfill it. Could I perhaps write a new article on any recent relevant topic and resubmit them to you? Or get the client to edit the old one?   Thanks in advance regardless.

They're big, safe companies meaning they're relatively safe and don't fluctuate that much. I barely even touch them now.

 This may not be what you're looking for if your problem is just seasonal - but I have pretty dry skin and this used to be a big issue for me. And I found that getting your skin in as good shape as possible is really key to making it look good. I make sure I wash my face really well - I just use a basic cleanser but I use a clairsonic - I think it really works wonders. Next use a chemical exfoliant. I'm addicted to Dr. Dennis Gross Alpha Beta peel (aka Black Magic Face Pads) but they are NOT cheap. If this is not a constant issue I don't know that you would find the investment worthwhile. There are other peels that have some of the same ingredients though. After that, I then moisturize giving time for it to sink in well, and then I follow with primer - also giving it sink in time. Then I use my Bare Minerals foundation that I use all over followed by the tinted mineral veil. I'm using the compact formula now which has a bit more coverage than the loose powder - when I used that I would use a powder concealer to touch up any red still shining through. This way it was easy to blend it into my overall foundation.  I sometimes find with blemishes and nose dryness liquid concealer can often get cakey especially as the hours pass on.    It would afford the same control the pill gives to women - having personal and discreet control over your re-productivity. It was probably more revolutionary when it was made available to women because the other methods are often complicated, unreliable, or unavailable to women of social status. [Try getting  getting your tubes tied or even getting an IUD as a woman who hasn't had children *now, much less 53 years ago].   Men do have the option of condoms, though I understand many men don't like to use them, and relatively easy access to vasectomies (which can be reversed). The pill however is a discreet and simple way for personal control.   This is a well-meaning and legitimate question: why did you take your kids with you to Ikea?  We live near one and my husband and I go fairly often just to eat meatballs and stock up on tealights and crab paste (KRABBA!). But I see kids swarming all the time; I almost stepped on one when it divebombed in front of me. But I've *really* always wondered why they are even there. And if they are, why they aren't in Small-land?   I tend to blend my Milk base out, especially around the edges, with my fingers. I don't typically wait terribly long, but a minute or two, and then I just apply my eyeshadow with brushes as normal.    When I was in high school my mom gave me a few Bobbi Brown lip palettes. I never really used them - but I wasn't very into lipstick or very serious about my makeup. Luckily I saved all the things (and they held up) and now  ten years later I use them pretty frequently!    I know of at least a few stores where it has nothing to do with my perception - these gendered sections are in fact *labeled* as such. I was at a chain store specializing in scrapbooking materials that had a labeled "BOYS" section, where the Star Wars stickers and paper was located, and the "GIRLS" section - no Star Wars.     You look fantastic!      As a lifelong (female) Star Wars fan I get super mad when there are stores where things are categorized by gender and Star Wars are under the 'boy' section. I have to restrain myself...    YES! This was my first time using it and it was instant love! Prior to getting on MUA, I had really only used pencil liners. I picked up a liquid liner a few weeks ago (Loreal Lineur Intense) but wasn't too pleased with it - didn't really have the opacity I wanted.     Thank you!

ALAS :(   This is so BADASS.     Delivering something warm? Or perhaps with catnip? :)   Not Python related, but Michael Palin, I adore your travelogues. Pole to Pole is probably my favorite - I love the vastly different cultures you encounter but I have to imagine that passing through the USSR just as it was on the brink of collapse was shocking. I was amazed that it did not seem at all imminent to many of the people you met. What has been your favorite trip so far?   When I was in elementary school I was home sick and my mom rented me Holy Grail. She said she thought I would like it and went out to run errands. I loved it, and when it got to the end I actually sat through all of the music after the film ends. I sat there waiting for the movie to come back before I realized that it wasn't. Then I sat and laughed my ass off realizing it was actually the best way it could have ended.   To this day, I still watch it when I'm home sick. I'm convinced it has healing powers.   The part of "The Universe" when Eric and Terry are in space and the big green grid comes up is where I always conceived of all maths happening. Thank you, it makes maths much more enjoyable.

[ugh](http://imgur.com/y1hV9pt)   Depending on how old grandma is she may not know the neighbor girl's age. When I visit my grandparents' assisted living home some people ask when I'm graduating from high school and others attempt to set me up with their sons who would be my father's age. I'm in my late 20s. I've just realized that at a certain age, you stop caring or being capable of determining young people's ages.   My dad (an engineer) has always said that "big ass" is a technical term.    In high school we read the play "'Master Harold'...and the Boys" by Athol Fugard - a play that explores institutional racism in apartheid-era South Africa. People were so uncomfortable calling the characters black (or white), that my teacher had to routinely tell people to stop calling the black characters African-Americans. I recall him yelling, "THEY'RE JUST AFRICANS."   The beer shampoo  interesting... my (American) mother used beer on her hair when she was growing up. I think it was supposed to increase shine. She wouldn't really drink beer until she was in her late 40s because for her it was akin to smelling like soap!   I would highly recommend you talking to a counselor or administrator of some kind to get *something* on the record. Also, keep all those texts. Given his aggressive behavior, it would be wise of you to have a record. Since he is your professor, he is in a position of power over you, and he could use that to your great disadvantage.    SWEET SWEET PEARLY   My husband and I have played through TTAODK two or three times and I have cried EVERY DAMN TIME.  But then Butt Stallion makes it all betta.   My guess is that someone Axebombed the place. When I was in college, Axe would send a lot  of the frats boxes of sample sizes. The bros employed them by duct-taping the sprayer down, threw them into suites, and held the doors closed.    I know I enjoyed it because while the plot could be understood, it did put faith in its audience and put some challenging ideas out there. Also, the way the stunts were done (largely without CGI) were incredibly and really added to my enjoyment of the film.    I will say, while the plot, dialogue, and characters were as thin as Chinese gymnast, the reason to enjoy that movie is the incredible set design and costumes. But then you should probably watch the 'making of' videos instead of the movie itself...  	31

 apparently 3 of the 4 are in custody, their seeking the 4th (who beat the thing with for 30 seconds with a baseball bat, evidently).  I hope they all get locked up and spend some time thinking about their actions.    I hope it fixes the lightning issues!         A tour in iraq is safer than many things - we're very good at combat life-saving these days.       Shit, why not make all drugs legal? Why not sell nerve gas on street corners? After all, any reasonable regulation is the "slippery slope to fascism", we should just live like anarchists forever.  Smokers litter all over parks (i have never been in a park anywhere that didn't have butts in it), they ruin the smell of the place, and they can take their nasty habit somewhere else instead of a place meant for people to enjoy.   No one knows when their numbers up, to be sure. Fucking depressing to think about, though - one minute it's fine, the next you're gone.   that's why i rarely read the comments even on shit i post in /r/news - everyone tries to out 4chan each other being stupid over tragedies. It's pretty sickening.    that would be my guess - the guy rolled and accused jared of some level of involvement. If it's true or not, who can guess - not find out anything until more info's dumped.   Maybe, maybe not. Only time will tell.  I can guarantee these things will be so expensive that if they do work, they could only be used for very high value targets - would probably limit their effectiveness, somewhat.    I don't do anything shady, but if i did, i wouldn't do it on tor. It's a giant honeypot, one way or the other.   i'd consider it extremely cutting edge, high-risk research. If it'll pan out or not is anyone's guess - but i'm guessing it'll never be reliable enough for weaponization, unless we make some kind of serious break through.    Lol, law enforcement officer's stolen gun? Guess we need tighter gun control laws, right?   It'd look less like the revolutionary war and more like the iraq insurgency. Probably be lots of sabotage and sniping and IED's rather than outright "battles" in the traditional sense.   Would just come down to how much it cost to give in to the insurgency's demands vs. continuing to resist.  America's a vast area with extremely varied terrain. Would be almost impossible to keep an eye and ready firepower on even most of it, let alone all of it.   Probably fell down a hole or into a ravine or something, and just got stuck down there. Can happen to anyone.   I think i've found a junkie who covers up their acknowledgement of their addiction to cigarettes by lashing out at people who want to help them.    Good. The fewer places people can smoke, the better. Shit is a menace.    There's a tremendous amount of space in the sky, but everyone in the sky is going to a few set points, across a few set routes, so it's much smaller than it would otherwise seem.  That said - mid-air collisions are pretty uncommon.    Fucking tragic. My sympathy to the families of the people in the cessna, and i hope the F-16 pilot makes a swift and full recovery.   the best we can hope is that a lesson's learned from this and future accidents of this type can be avoided.    Was a really weird case, i remember when it was fresh. Definitely racially motivated.    My favorite Frederick Douglass quote:  "To suppress free speech is a double wrong. It violates the rights of the hearer as well as those of the speaker."   I think the main problem with Clinton is that she's just not exciting as a candidate. She'll win - of course - but she's not someone people get enthusiastic about. Kind of a safe bet, in a way, like buying a toyota.   I wonder if they'll ever get it working.   Am i the only one concerned the chick on top is gonna fall down and hurt herself? :/ it doesn't look very safe.          Yeah, i strongly suspect the truth is a lot more "i got high and shot someone" and a lot less "i found a gun that magically went off"      Qualia, yo. You're expressing that your qualia is different than other people's (which it certainly is).    that's kind of what made the story interesting to me. It seems pretty open and shut; why bother to even figure out why beyond "he was crazy"? But there they are, trying their hardest to figure out what happened and the why's of it. Very odd.    Got that right. I consider the confederacy to be nothing more than traitors, and shameful ones at that. Hell - the confederacy killed more americans than the nazis did.      First time i fought a shoggoth in CDDA, i was taken totally by surprise. Those things are nasty.   me to!!!   indeed so. I mean not only is it a total non-sequitur for where he lives (minnesota has as much to do with the confederacy as mars does) but he should have known that being a volunteer fireman is an honorable and prestigious position, not a platform to do political activism from.    It is indeed a racist shithole. A few days ago i posted a story about some multi-felon who shot someone in san fran, and i legit barely noticed the guy was an illegal immigrant. An *enormous* number of people in that thread were squealing about "trump being right" and how this is somehow standard behavior for illegal immigrants.  I was honestly a little taken aback.       I gotta say, of all the things that are bizarre about this case (and there's more than a few oddities) this guy sitting down to do an interview with a news crew before he's even gone to trial has to be the strangest.  it's not even a dumb move: it's a *catastrophic move*. It's like playing chess and you decide to dump battery acid all over your self in lieu of moving a piece.    damn peculiar, makes me wonder if the people involved were a little nuts or if the area is rough or what.            Indeed so.      can't say as i blame them. situation like that the advice is "get out if you can get out"   George Zimmerman  here was a guy who could have been *something*. He could have leveraged a tragedy into helping people. He could have used the cameras pointed at him to accomplish some good. Hell, he could have done some advocacy for some cause.  Instead, no, he just turned his own life into a giant shitshow and continued to make terrible choices.    Fireworks are pretty astoundingly dangerous if you're at all careless with them. Used properly their not to awful (if from a legitimate source) but the minute someone improperly uses them, it's bad news.    Having been in a similar situation, that's some shit you never really get past. Images will haunt that dude for the rest of his life.   thanks to the great god Alcohol, i can see it happening just like that, actually.       I'm not some carebear who thinks we should coddle criminals, but it's abundantly clear to me this is a sick kid, not some kind of vile criminal. That she's not getting the help she so desperately needs is a complete and total failure of the justice system and our society.         Like any medication, there's good and bad to it. Overall, their beneficial - they certainly save more lives than they cost - but their not a purely benign substance.   The heart of irrational behavior is to do the same thing over and over and hope for a different outcome. It's clear that negotiation and conventional military intervention is ineffective. Something new must be tried.    translation: If you're rich, white, and have a good excuse, you can own all the guns you like. Anyone else? Tough shit, guns are for people better than you!    If you're a citizen of america, you got as much right to say what you think america should do about ISIS as i do, being a citizen. The idea that you have to be an expert to contribute what you think we should do is false. We're a republic, that means we get a voice, even if it's just what our gut tells us.   Me? My gut tells me all this violence and barbarism is a sort of boat-burning: their saying they won't negotiate nor surrender, that we either have to fight them until they cease to exist, or accept them existing. Given the two choices, i'd prefer we wipe them out.   With more communism, yes.   What do you recommend, sternly worded letters and negotiations?    "We can get a tech guy from disney to shove some animatronics into the corpse, make it move, nod, sign bills that give us whatever free ponies we think we deserve. Simple!"    Well spoken. People forget that having kids isn't some mandatory thing, and that it's a choice people make rather than something that *has* to happen.  And yeah, we do need more vacation time in the US to be sure.   That's exactly why i'm not running a business right now: the regulatory and legal hurdles make it just not worth my effort to put everything in and risk getting nothing out.   Wonder how many people take the leave and then just never go back to work. be a nice surprise for the employer expecting someone to come back only to find out - Psych! - they'd rather wipe asses instead, thanks for the paid vacation before quitting.   I can kind of see the logic in it - the juvenile justice system is just not geared to deal with schizophrenic murderers (nor, i think, should it be).    Wait until electric vehicles are the norm, and this shit's mandatory everywhere.    I fucking love that song.   You'll never find out how on reddit.             I wonder if the lawyer being named Roger Jones is a coincidence or a family member.   Life isn't about need, but that said i've often needed a machete-type implement when doing yard work.    Yep, and sobbing now that the gravy train has come to an end.   Also it's stupid as fuck, looks absolutely moronic, and is impractical to boot.    The challenge here is less turning it into a worker's paradise, and moreso keeping it that way for any length of time given the vagaries of human nature.   Indeed so. I mean looking at the current crop, "My parents are mormon doomsday preppers" is a hell of a lot more interesting than the Elio motors "ama" (really more like "ask us softball questions so we can get some free marketing") that's further down the page.       I dunno what the story is with this kid (I mean, typically speaking a 4 year old does not just go missing one day and no one report it!), but i want whatever software they used to generate the image of her. That thing is very nearly flawless!    I considered most AMA's just giant marketing ploys, so i don't even consider a decrease in quality of them a hit to the site, overall.   I'm a (reasonably frequent) content poster, and i could give a rat's ass about any of this bullshit. So long as i'm still getting upvotes and generating conversation, i'll still be posting to reddit.   It continually baffles me how much people over-estimate their privacy online.    nah, sounds like garden-variety bad luck, really.    indeed so! Just like many countries have no serial killers.   lemme tell you, this shit is a microcosm of modern life. People get all worked up over absolutely trivial shit, and then are shocked when real problems keep going unsolved.    Well earned!    I gotta think that's the case almost everywhere. By nature, homeless people are difficult to get a solid number on, and tend to move around a lot. There's just big parts of any given society that don't show up in official facts and figures.    that's actually my first thought when i see something like this - was it a design fault, a maintenance fault, or user error? It seems like it'd be safest to just assume as many people as can fit on the deck will be on the deck, and to build accordingly.       They desperately wish they were.    I kind of disagree with packing weapons in with the toys, but some of those honestly don't look *too* awful.    That's most certainly a crime. Hell, that's probably like *5 or 6* crimes.   I view it as a sort of inevitable evolution; people'll get tired of it soon enough and then find some new thing.   Just goes to show how far you can get not understanding the underlying principals!          They might not have understood germ theory, they might have had no clue how the disease actually spread - but they certainly knew how to stop it getting into port (or at least put forth a good effort).    Never, ever, trust the state. Constantly watch it, constantly call it to task, perpetually challenge it, but never, ever trust any state nor any part of any state.  That said, part of the state's job is to maintain order, to enforce laws, and to bring what measure of safety it can to the citizens. And part of that is a well managed, monitored, and questioned capital punishment system.   I certainly would not approve of a capital punishment system that denied due process or that operated in secret, or something like that. Not at all.         I meant more the police, but if no one in the house is talking then maybe they genuinely don't know who did it, either.    if financial cost is the primary consideration of justice, then i weep for this country.  We accept numerous - infact, almost *innumerable* - trade offs every day concerning safety. More people have died because of bee stings than wrongful executions.      Gotta be one of the strangest shootings i have ever heard of - a 2 year old and a 9 year old shot in the torso (but alive), taken to the hospital in a car (rather than an ambulance), four adults and 3 other kids in the house and they got no clue who shot them?  Absolutely strange.      So now the tune changes from "we need tougher gun laws (that criminals will ignore)!" to "we need to start confiscating guns off law abiding citizens, for their own good!"   Nice way to move the goal posts, there.   I almost have to assume it's something to do with my video card, or my OS or something. I'm sure they'll hotfix it soon as they figure out what's going on.   with me it's dark 24/7 more or less, with night being *really* dark. Sometimes restarting the program helps, sometimes it does not.   "damnit marie i told you to throw the fucking things, not hold onto them!"    I've always been a staunch supporter of captiol punishment, for a number of reasons. Foremost among them, there are some people who are - at a word - irredeemable. They commit crimes so awful that they cannot ever be trusted to return to society, they show no ability to ever be rehabilitated.   Keeping such a person locked up removes them from threatening society, but it does nothing to prevent them harming other prisoners (who may have committed quite minor offenses), it does nothing to prevent them influencing people on the outside (this woman could seek to contact her living children, for example), it does nothing to stop them escaping (as those two killers in new york did recently).   If a person cannot be redeemed and cannot rejoin society, then the best thing for everyone is an execution; it limits their suffering and it protects everyone from further harm.  I think this is probably the most i've ever written about my thoughts on the matter at one time, hah.    Incompetence to stand trial is (perhaps ironically) not really about mental health: it's about mental *state*. Someone can be totally batshit crazy, and so long as they realize what they are doing is wrong and a crime at the time they do it, they are mentally competent to stand trial.  One advantage of the competency system is that when we find someone to be incompetent to stand trial, it's pretty non-controversial - [Just check out this guy, for example](http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2015/01/immigrant_from_mexico_who_speaks_aztec_language_declared_mentally_incompetent_to_stand_trial_in_2011.html)    Shipped off to a mental hospital until the doctors find she's safe to release into society or she dies.   [John Hinckley Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hinckley,_Jr.) would be an example of  someone who was found mentally incompetent. Because it's a notorious case, and is quite long-lasting, we know more about the treatment and outcome than most such cases.    the bar for being found incompetent is *exceedingly high*. Almost no one is legally incompetent.    It's really weird. On the one hand, she acknowledges she doesn't feel bad about what happened. On the other, she takes full responsibility for it, and expresses no desire for leniency. .  My natural inclination is to say she should be put to death (it isn't like she can be rehabilitated!), but since that's not possible in her state, being removed from society forever will have to do.    There's apparently two convictions that they don't say what they are - a quick google doesn't turn up what they are, either.    I thought this was just me, they need to seriously fix the brightness levels to be usable.    I gotta say, having the mod system set up like that is a ....crappy design choice.   puts on sunglasses and walks away   The gun laws that made it illegal for a felon to purchase a weapon? Because he couldn't legally buy or own a gun in any state, due to being a felon.   haha one can only imagine the discussion that must have taken place in that car.    san francisco (and california) have extremely strict gun control laws. This guy wasn't a citizen *and* was a felon, so he could not legally buy guns in any state. Any weapon he used was illegally acquired.   Sorry for your loss.    I was a little surprised /r/news stayed up honestly.   [there are actually bullet proof backpacks you can get for kids.](http://www.thedenverchannel.com/money/consumer/bulletproofing-your-kids-at-school-bulletproof-backpack-put-to-the-test)  Companies like [AR500 Armor](http://www.ar500armor.com/) sell relatively cheap body armor (and it's back ordered in many cases because it sells so well!) Something like a concealment plate carrier would work well for every-day wear.    To me, san francisco is actually most mentally connected to the Zodiac Killer.   edit: and Full House.    Actually, Mega City One only [rarely uses the death penalty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega-City_One#Law ) - typically for mass murder or what we might call treason.   Of course, a great many perpetrators get gunned down, but only in self-defense by the judges.     Tumblr's just like reddit: follow shitty subscriptions, hate it. Follow good ones, it's awesome.   that's fucking horrible, i can only imagine how awful that'd be to see.    And if he had attacked a plane, you'd be saying "they should be taking these concerns seriously!"  Security people can't win: If they take concerns seriously, they "go to far". If they don't take them seriously they "aren't doing their jobs". It's a no-win situation, but i'd prefer they err on the side of safety than on the side of being incautious.    sounds like a reasonable outcome. People had concerns, reported the concerns, and the concerns were dealt with in an efficient and through manner. it sucks this guy was inconvenienced, but it's not like they beat him with a rubber hose or something.   yeah, this has "dumb kid" written all over it; i definitely don't think he was malicious in what he was doing, just thoughtless.    these could probably be grown with zero herbicide and zero pesticide, interestingly enough.   Honestly, i'm a little surprised too - i barely noticed that detail when i read the article.   It's amazing what a company can do when it has huge revenue and a desire to have the best people for the job.    that's pretty crazy and TIL!   guy definitely made a poor choice.   The thief driving a BMW is pretty strange, to be sure. And targeting a news crew is pretty uncommon, especially in daylight and considering the difficulty of fencing the cameras.   I dunno, maybe more'll come out of it, but at this point anything seems possible.           I've heard conflicting things - some say it's bad, some say it's alright in moderation, etc. I generally only do it if i have no choice and it's for a very small span of time.      there were long, dark periods where i was just grinding and grinding and grinding for cpu, and it sucked. This might well fix that.   Thank christ, there's nothing worse than styrofoam for actually keeping food in. The containers break to easy, they sweat horribly, and they sometimes half-melt in the microwave. Whatever replaces them's gotta be better than that.   I actually usually point to Karla as proof that the justice system ain't just.    It's definitely a strange crime.   hopefully if he gets it, someone blows his brains out. The man's an animal, plain and simple, and it's an injustice to humanity itself that he's allowed to still be alive.   right? It'd probably make it to frontpage if i couched the title as something about worker's rights...      Since this post has no business even *existing* i figure i'll go a little off script.   Actually true story: yesterday i went to wendies, and they were (evidently) training a new girl at how to be a Wendies worker. So my g/f gets a Frosty. The new girl kind of heaped it up a bit (so it looked like an ice cream cone). No shit, the manager told her that was to much to put in there and that it should be level with the cup and to remember for next time. Right in front of us, no less.   I almost thought about bitching to corporate about it, but decided not to.            	150
 I think it's a bit unfair to call that list "The Ultimate List" or anything similar as the user behind the list did. And it's also strange and irrelevant to base it that heavily on awards on nominations. Also, there's pretty much only English language movies in the list. Of course, they don't only speak English in The Pianist (2002), but you probably get my point. It would be better to call it something else, maybe "Top 100 English language movies based on awards/nominations, popularity and a bit of critical acclaim".   Here's my list:     1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)        2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)       3. L'eclisse (1962)       4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      5. Tanin no kao (1966)     6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       7. Suna no onna (1964)      8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)     9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)     10. Stntang (1994)       Probably this one:      http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/directors/   I didn't like it at all. The storytelling is very episodic, bombastic, clear and quite boring with no interesting finesse or nuances, but rather ends up being forced and obviously dramatic. I felt the characters were pretty thin too. Even if Russell Crowe does his role good, it doesn't help the film for me. It's hard to realize that the same director did the much, much better Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), I suggest watching that instead if you want to see Weir when he actually is doing a good movie.   On of my favourites. So damn great.      The Room (2003).   Yeah, Claire Denis doing science fiction isn't the first thing you expected today. Interesting.         You don't know if you can go through Federico Fellini's career, but you had no problem with Ingmar Bergman and Woody Allen considering they've done even more films? Heh.     Anyways, have you done Andrei Tarkovsky? If not, do it!   Well, you can always start with some of most important and critically acclaimed directors. Get to know directors like Jean Renoir, Claude Chabrol, Alain Resnais, Franois Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Eric Rohmer, Robert Bresson, Louis Malle and the others, read about their films and explore a bit on your own. [This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinema_of_France) article on Wikipedia will give you a brief overview of the history, that is to say if you are interesting. It's not that much, but I think it really helps to know about the important names and just have a little backstory to everything.        Anyways,  bout de souffle (1960) by Jean-Luc Godard and Les quatre cents coups (1959) by Franois Truffaut are two classic French films that one must watch when it comes to French cinema. They are quite easy to like and will offer you a good start.   The Limits of Control (2009) by Jim Jarmusch is in my opinion of the best films post-2000. Why? I think it's very misunderstood by many critics and a big majority of the public. But of course, there are those who just don't like it.       I remember that Jarmusch said that it was an action movie without action, which I think is a fitting description. I simply love how Jarmusch is playing with the thriller/spy genre and at the same time pissing on the conventions. He takes away sex, weapons and cell phones, and there you have the three most used attributes of modern action movies removed. We also never come close to the threat we get hinted at. American agents are following the main protagonist, another character gets abducted, we see a helicopter in the sky, but Jarmusch never puts any importance to those things, which is great and liberating considering how they still are a part of the film. He moves within the thriller genre, but leaves out the parts that are loved by the mainstream movie viewers.        Without spoiling too much, there's a certain scene in the film where there would be non-stop action in an ordinary action movie because of the circumstances, but Jarmusch even denounces action at that point too, he just puts imagination to use instead, which I feel is one of the main things the film is trying to say, that imagination is unstoppable. It's probably the best middle finger ever made to the viewers who always want everything explained to them. Brilliant. Also, Sunn O)))   Boris are part of the soundtrack, which just makes it better, as well as all the references to film and art in general. And the cinematography is just top-notch.   La Tour Montparnasse Infernale (2001).   You don't know about it? In my opinion, it's one of the best films ever made. It's directed by Andrei Tarkovsky and is loosely based on the life of the great 15th-century Russian icon painter that had the same name as the movie's title. While it's a biography, it's also a depiction of a very dark period in the Russian history marked by endless fighting between rival Princes and by Tatar invasions.   Andrey Rublyov (1966) would probably have been amazing.       How important is a movie-villain?         Not at all. But that totally depends on what kind of movie it is and in which context you want to put the question in. There's plenty of movies that have a villain as an important part of the plot, and also plenty others that don't focus on that kind of classic plot at all. If a movie has a villain, I would say that it's usually always more appretiated with a villain that has nuances and depth than a villain that is just straight evil. Although it also depends on how the movie is handling it and how other parts work together with it.       I'm not a fan of Gladiator (2000), but it was also many years ago I saw it, so I can't really say anything special about it. But different movies with villains handles them differently, I think that's the basic thing one has to acknowledge. And I guess it's good that you yourself can point out what you liked and not liked with the villains in those two movies.   * Il sorpasso (1962)       * Im Lauf der Zeit (1976)       * Pierrot le fou (1965)          Really? It's on lists like The 100 Greatest Sci-Fi Movies, 100 Science Fiction Films (BFI Screen Guide), AFI's 100 years...100 thrills, AFI's 100 years...100 cheers, Empire 500, Spike Lee's Essential Film List, The New York Times Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made, The Guardian's 1000 Films to See Before You Die, They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?, Reddit top 250, FOK! top 250, The British Film Institute: 360 Classics, 501 Must See Movies (from the book with the same name), 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, both the directors and critics Sight and Sound 2012, David Thomson's Have You Seen? A Personal Introduction to 1,000 Films, and probably many, many more.       The fact that it made the Reddit top 250 probably says that it's quite loved on a site like this. And many of the other lists are already proving that many critics like it as well, just to take some examples.   Great movie, but is it that unconventional to see in those kinds of list? You can see it on MovieSense 101, Reddit top 250, FilmTotaal top 250, Empire 500, The Guardian's 1000 Films to See Before You Die, FOK! top 250, They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?, Sight and Sound 2012 (both the Directors list and Critics list), 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, OFCS Top 100: 100 Best First Films, and Jonathan Rosenbaum's Essential Films to take some examples.   Here's my top ten list:           1. Der siebente Kontinent (1989)      2. Andrey Rublyov (1966)        3. L'eclisse (1962)       4. Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)      5. Tanin no kao (1966)        6. Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       7. Suna no onna (1964)     8. Hiroshima mon amour (1959)      9. Nattvardsgsterna (1963)       10. Stntang (1994)         Well, there's several sites that you can use to keep track of the movies you have seen. IMDb, Letterboxd, ICheckMovies etc. Some have more functions than others. I can't see the weird thing in it.   How do you mean? It's quite simple. For example, you rate movies and keep track of that. Then you make a top 250 with the best ones every year, or whenever you want.   [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0stXu60iVE) one from Offret (1986).   If I have to choose one, I would go with They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?:     http://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films_table.php         To say it quite simple:      *"The They Shoot Pictures, Don't They? 1,000 greatest films list is primarily compiled by using 1,825 individual critics' and filmmakers' best-films-of-all-time lists/ballots. The resulting list is very diverse and spans virtually all movie-producing decades and countries."*        I've seen almost every movie, and I can say myself that it's indeed a quite diverse list with tons of great and important movies. Many of my absolute favourites are on it. It'll give you a great overview of cinema in general.   Have you seen Andrei Tarkovsky's movies? He was great when it comes to using and putting dream sequences into his films. Stalker (1979), Zerkalo (1975) and Nostalgia (1983) all have them for example. Especially Zerkalo (1975) has a great flow when it combines dreams with contemporary scenes, memories and newsreel footage.   Because 90 critics gave it a positive ("fresh") rating and 11 gave it a negative ("rotten) one, so the percentage of positive reviews is calculated by that. You can read how the Tomatometer works on their website or on the Wikipedia page. Sometimes people seem to misunderstand how it works, I don't know if that's the case with you. Also, you could probably get some more insight when it comes to what some of the critics liked about it if you just read the reviews. You simply didn't like, and that's it. That's how it can be sometimes.   Fitzcarraldo (1982) by Werner Herzog.   Welt am Draht (1973) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder is my favourite.   It's a bit cryptic, but if you decontruct the film, there's a lot of political content to be found. Maybe [this](http://www.filmcomment.com/article/endgame-michael-hanekes-cache) article can help you understand everything a bit better. [Here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F6MJhwGLFQ) also an interesting video Dan North did that's about the film and the content that could help as well.   A splendid and great movie I hold very high. Filled with rain, loneliness and despair. The bar scene with the singer is amazing, one of my favourite movie scenes of all time.   Heh, I just posted a message about this some hours ago in the thread about the film. And as I already said, it probably means that the rights for showing it on television in the United States are cleared. So I guess we won't have to wait too long for a Criterion release. Too bad that I'm not in the US, so I don't think I can see it when it airs, but I'm glad that I have at least seen the movie once. It's a great one. Let's hope Qing mei zhu ma (1985) by Yang gets a nice restoration as well.   I don't necessarily see a slow pace being something bad or a disadvantage. Rather the opposite, it gives time to appretiate things like sound, the images, lightning, editing (especially if it's good and/or interesting) etc., it also gives me time to think and feel. I'm not in a hurry. The scenes are in the exact pace that Kubrick meant them to be. In real life, things move as they do, and a big part of cinema does mimic that. Sometimes movies could also invoke a feeling of immersion of time, something that Tarkovsky was good at for example, the feeling of being lost in time in the film.   When you say "have watched most things", it makes me wonder a bit. That's quite vague. Anyways, it's an entertaining, funny and good little flick, no more, no less. I wouldn't put it up as one of the best films ever made, quite very fram from it, and nothing I would put in my top 250 for example, but it's not a bad movie at all. Another thing, there's a newer TV series with the same name that's quite interesting too, it's inspired by the film, but has an anthology format.   All these things are very easy to find using Google. Yes, I know it's an easy answer, but you are demanding quite much. I don't think anyone here will have the time to spell out everything for you. It's very hard to know what you will be asked exactly. It's also even harder to give out certain moments, because there's really quite much information.      Read some here:     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_film        Mark Cousins did an interesting documentary about the history of cinema, The Story of Film: An Odyssey (2011). It gives you a rough overview and goes through all of the decades with important movements, directors, key moments etc. It's a bit long, but as I said, it's very hard to cover so much if you have limitations. That's probably your best shot (plus the Wikipedia article) if you want to keep it simple. There's a ton of essays on what people think stands out with Kubrick, his importance and so on. Again, Google is great.   Lars von Trier's Melancholia (2011) had some great CGI that worked well. Examples:      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOXNPovY6yE   Robert Bresson wasn't really a part of the French New Wave. He was a big influence though. And some directors hailed him as some sort of prototype or precursor to the movement, which I think is a better description. First of all, Bresson wasn't that outwardly experimental and not as politically extrovert as some of the New Wave directors. You also have his religious views (Catholicism and Jansenism) that didn't really fit in that much with the other filmmakers associated with the movement, especially not considering the youthful iconoclasm that New Wave films often had. And even though he wasn't outwardly experimental, his films were quite different from the typical New Wave films, but that's mostly because of his own rules he established to use in his movies.   I think I prefer Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009) more than Cach (2005). Do you mean that Cach (2005) didn't give you answers enough? Or anything else? I wouldn't really call it a lack, it's just the way Haneke works. He just doesn't provide you with simple answer, that's one of the best things with many of his films.   Well, it isn't necessarily that I don't like it, it's more that I'm deliberate when it comes to my grades. Also, I've only rated 367 movies from the 2010s, which isn't that much maybe. So there's a lot that I haven't seen yet too. Anyways, it doesn't change the fact that a 3/5 still is a good movie for me.   Not a big fan of him, but Se7en (1995) is decent.   Well it seems my top ten would look like this together with the ratings:      1. Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013) (Lav Diaz) 4/5       2. Book chon bang hyang (2011) (Hong Sang-soo) 4/5    3. A torini l (2011) (Bla Tarr) 4/5       4. Amour (2012) (Michael Haneke) 4/5      5. Da-reun na-ra-e-seo (2012) (Hong Sang-soo) 4/5          6. The Act of Killing (2012) (Joshua Oppenheimer) 4/5      7. Dupa dealuri (2012) (Cristian Mungiu) 4/5      8. Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011) (Asghar Farhadi) 4/5         9. Le Havre (2011) (Aki Kaurismki) 4/5      10. Like Someone in Love (2012) (Abbas Kiarostami) 3/5       Ten of the best ones:         * A torini l (2011)      * Book chon bang hyang (2011)      * Cach (2005)        * Das weie Band - Eine deutsche Kindergeschichte (2009)       * Jodaeiye Nader az Simin (2011)       * My Winnipeg (2007)         * Norte, hangganan ng kasaysayan (2013)      * The Act of Killing (2012)      * The Limits of Control (2009)        * White Material (2009)         The movie is scheduled to be shown on TCM in the beginning of September:     http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/511703/Brighter-Summer-Day-A/           This probably means that the rights for showing it on television in the United States are cleared. So let's hope it won't be too long for a release. I just can't wait. It's a great movie that is begging for a Criterion treatment.   When it comes to horror, I would say that some of my absolute favourites are mandatory:         * Eraserhead (1977) * Hxan (1922) * Les diaboliques (1955) * Les yeux sans visage (1960) * Nosferatu, eine Symphonie des Grauens (1922) * Onibaba (1964) * Possession (1981) * Repulsion (1965) * Spalovac mrtvol (1969) * Yabu no naka no kuroneko (1968)   What do you mean exactly? It's a bit hard to tell. Of what I recall, the AMPAS started to nominate foreign language performances in 1960, with the first award given 1961. And from 1960 to 1966, Setsuko Hara did her last eight films. So she never had so much chance to get nominated and/or awarded for example. Then you also have the rule that films must have been commercially released in Los Angeles County and have English subtitles with the theatrical release etc., which can be a factor in cases like these. Anyways, I never measure the quality of a performance based on nominations/awards from the Academy Awards, I was just answering the question OP asked.         Your title basically says exactly the same thing about the ending as your post. If you want a discussion, you should probably point out why you thought the ending was shitty and what you were dissapointed with.   It is. But OP just asked where one can stream good quality movies for free, not pirated ones. There's a lot of stuff out there that is entirely free and legal to stream on various sites.   Actor: Chish Ry      Actress: Setsuko Hara   My Winnipeg (2007) by Guy Maddin.   https://www.youtube.com/     https://archive.org/index.php       http://www.hulu.com/ also lets you stream some movies with a free account.   My single favourite one is L'eclisse (1962) by Michelangelo Antonioni. A great exploration of alienation, loneliness, doomed love, the inability to communicate, materialistic natures, and emptiness, all together with a poetic and hauntingly beautiful visual style and top-notch acting.   Sylvester Stallone himself has been a big collector of knives for a long time, it's quite known. So that explains the connection with knives in some of the movies he acted in.   A similar thread was created some hours ago, but it was only about gay and lesbian movies about relationships, but I have the same answer for this question, so I'll quote myself:       *"Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. No doubt about it. I just love how the whole film takes place in one location and I love the long takes and how uncompromisingly shot it is. A film where only women take part in, drowned in decadence, power games and German angst. It's just so intense and amazing."*   I always find it so strange when people ask these kind of questions, why certain movies received so much bad criticism. Read the reviews, you'll probably found several ones where people point out why they didn't like it etc. It's as easy as that.       Look here to find a lot of external reviews from all over the world:     http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1823672/externalreviews       There's also sites like Metacritic, Rotten Tomatoes etc. If you want reviews from every Tom, Dick and Harry, just check out the user reviews on IMDb. And as I said in a similar thread, it doesn't always have to be you that's missing something because you like/dislike a movie and a big majority of people have another opinion, taste is subjective.      I myself didn't like the movie at all. If you wonder why, I'll just copy a short summary of what I wrote in an older thread about it:          *"I thought it was quite bad. For a narrative film of this kind and for it to be an allegory of interest, the story was too simple sided and superficial. In the end, I couldn't care less about anything. The whole movie felt something like a promotional commercial for Die Antwoord, which was silly. And quite everything actually felt silly, stupid, hollow and over the top in a bad way. From the pathetic dialogue to the action and to how it was shot. It's hard to take it seriously, because it doesn't work as a comedy or any kind of critique of something either. It makes me wonder if Blomkamp offered someone from junior high to write him the dialogue."*   Well, I would suggest this link for you:    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110632/externalreviews          It links a big amount of external reviews of the movie. Some people like it more than others, some people dislike it more than others. But going through some reviews might help you see exactly what other people like in the film.    I was never in to Noir films, then again, I've never seen one      Well, you pretty much explained it yourself, heh. I myself would recommend looking into Touch of Evil (1958), Double Indemnity (1944) and The Third Man (1949), some of my own film noir favourites. All three are quite mandatory if you have the slightest interest in cinema at all. Sunset Blvd. (1950) is also a must see, even though it isn't one of my personal favourites, it's still important. If you are interested, film noir is well worth looking into, the 40s and 50s were two of the greatest decades for Hollywood in my opinion.      Art Theatre Guild. To start with, the connection with the Japanese New Wave is of course essential, a movement which I am really fond of. ATG's production system always put the art of moviemaking in the centre. All of the projects were selected solely on their artistic merits, nothing else. ATG was also totally free from the structures and conventions of the mainstream Japanese studio system, so the movies released by ATG often had focus on interesting, rich, nuanced, experimental and radical explorations of sex, violence, politics, and social revolution. And with films like Mujo (1970), Kshikei (1968) and Bara no sretsu (1969) to take some examples, the films usually had very high quality the them. Nagisa shima, Akio Jissoji, Shhei Imamura, Toshio Matsumoto, Yoshishige Yoshida, Kaneto Shind, Kji Wakamatsu, and Shji Terayama are just some of the directors that were affiliated with ATG. And that's some of the best ones from Japan.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mortal_Instruments   My favourite movie is Der siebente Kontinent (1989) by Michael Haneke. For those who haven't seen it, it's about a middle-class couple that's living together with their daughter. They dream of escaping to Australia to start a new life. Their current life is monotonous and full of routines, but they decide to do something about it one day. First of all, I love the form and how uncompromising it is. There is no soundtrack, so the little music that exists in the film is diegetic. The color palette is very dry and bleak, just like the overall atmosphere. Haneke takes his time by telling the story with long and static takes instead of moving the camera, which I'm a big fan of, I think that just adds to the form and connects well with the monotonous life of the family. There's no clear answers, which I also admire Haneke for, he is great when it comes to asking important questions and making his audience think and feel.        There's no other movie that made me feel as much as this one. It's just crushing. It's like a punch in the gut. Der siebente Kontinent (1989) also gives some interesting discussions about alienation, existentialism, society and materialism. One of my favourite scenes is the one with the family sitting and just staring while their TV is on with the song "The Power of Love" playing, a wonderful juxtaposition considering the nihilistic tone and depressing atmosphere the movie actually has.      I can go on talking about it a bit more, but I'm not going to spoil out everything here, so this will do as for now. In my opinion, this movie is simply amazing and a true masterpiece.      I don't get why you are questioning if you are missing something or not, especially not when it comes to a movie like this. It doesn't have to be you that's missing something if you didn't like a film. It's a franchise that already has a big fan base and a big amount of the general public is probably going to love it, that's easy to figure out. Also, it's a big mainstream Hollywood movie draped in CGI that seemed rather problematic and flawed just by looking at the trailer, did you really expect a cinematic masterpiece? And of what I have seen, there's been some critique here on Reddit about it, so I wouldn't say that the movie is as loved as you seem to think.   Here's 15 great movies that have stunning visual styles:         * 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)        * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985)        * Den-en ni shisu (1974)         * El topo (1970)         * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)       * Himiko (1974)        * Le mpris (1963)        * Marketa Lazarov (1967)       * Narayama bushik (1958)       * Saraba natsu no hikari (1968)           * Sayat Nova (1969)       * Sho o suteyo machi e deyou (1971)     * Shura (1971)     * The Holy Mountain (1973)        * Werckmeister harmnik (2000)          There was a similar thread in the Criterion subreddit, although it concerned their own releases only. But my number one favourite still remains the same outside of that collection, so I'll just qoute myself and repeat what I said about it:      *"Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. No doubt about it. I just love how the whole film takes place in one location and I love the long takes and how uncompromisingly shot it is. A film where only women take part in, drowned in decadence, power games and German angst. It's just so intense and amazing."*   Film Art: An Introduction by David Bordwell and Kristin Thompson is a good start if you are new to film analysis. It goes through the basic stuff pretty much in a quite accessible way. It also has several other references which can help you go further in your quest. You can find it pretty much everywhere. If you don't have the money, check out your local library for example.   When you mention American Beauty (1999) and Eyes Wide Shut (1999), I think of The Ice Storm (1997), Mulholland Dr. (2001) and Happiness (1998).   Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. No doubt about it. I just love how the whole film takes place in one location and I love the long takes and how uncompromisingly shot it is. A film where only women take part in, drowned in decadence, power games and German angst. It's just so intense and amazing.   And I would like to take the opportunity to recommend one of my favourites, Die bitteren Trnen der Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. Fantastic movie.      Looks like a movie where the white men are supposed to be the heroes when they are saving the other white people from the foreigners. Hooray. And of course, the main point is probably that we should care the most for the priviliged white American nuclear family. While this could be a great chance to get some discussion going when it comes to politics, war and coups, it's probably not going to happen. Seems to be a very problematic movie. And the slow motion scene in the trailer was really silly. I'm almost already tired of this solely based on the trailer and premise. And that isn't a good sign.   Do you have some examples? Because I looked on their website and the cheapest Blu-ray titles from Criterion Collection were around $22.99 (exept for two that were $19.99 and $21.99). Some were also already on sale. If I go to Barnes   Noble and check out some of the same titles when they are having their sale, I'll still get a cheaper price.   I think this is the case of when they're trying to make a satire out of something, but only to become a part of it themselves, which doesn't really work well and becomes more of a problem. It's almost the same case with Showgirls (1995), I can appretiate what Verhoeven is trying to criticize, but the movie has a tendency to become a part of it itself.   A really cool and great Shinoda movie. It really looks splendid, very well shot.   I don't know what you were trying to say, because you just proved that you still save some bucks if you buy from the sale. Depending on where you live and the amount you are spending, there's free shipping available at Barnes   Noble too. Sure, Amazon sometimes have it as well, but it seems to be easier to get at Barnes   Noble. Also, Barnes   Noble can give members additional discounts plus coupons, which can get you even better prices. For example, I bought the Zatoichi: The Blind Swordsman box set from the Barnes   Noble sale last year for very little money, I don't think you'll ever be able to find it on Amazon brand new for the price I got it for. The main thing is to always look and compare the prices, but of what I have seen, you rarely find better prices on these titles than from the Barnes   Noble sale, so your argument doesn't really hold.   Everyone else? Do you have some examples of where you can find titles from Criterion Collection at the same price as the 50% off sale that Barnes   Noble have?   Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. This is the opportunity if you want to get some titles from Criterion Collection cheap. I have some titles written down that I want, we'll see how much it gets. Poor wallet.   Uzak (2002) by Nuri Bilge Ceylan maybe?   I think one of them was sarcastic. Or maybe you are too?   2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) and Solyaris (1972).      Well, it's good that people are addressing how African-Americans are portrayed in film, but it seemed rather strange to make a whole article about how the writer is done with the film. It's been around since 1939, so this isn't really any news. It would have been more relevant if it was a review or if she talked about how it is today and making similarites and/or differences to put it in context, or just something else to give it some more discussion value.    His      A little correction, it was written by Kristen Page-Kirby, a woman.    But some of them are just in English and neither are set in America (thematically or geographically) nor have any involvement of America.       And OP asked for the movies to be either American or in the English language:        *"What are some of the best American/ English language movies created by foreign directors?"*   The releases by Criterion Collection usually have nice looking menus. I like the simplicity that many of them have.    Here are some examples:           http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/images/reviews/76/full/1371834742_4.jpg      http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/images/reviews/76/1184330045_4.jpg      http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/images/reviews/76/full/1406554394_3.jpg   I don't really care about height, but since you are asking, I'll have to go with Gunnar Bjrnstrand who was 6' 3".   I never really considered this before you asked, but Nema-ye Nazdik (1990), Nun va Goldoon (1996) and Ayneh (1997) are three movies that came up in my head. They all came out in the 90s, they are all Iranian movies, they are all filmed in Tehran, and most importantly, all of them are metafilms, which I think connects them in a special way. Also, it should be noted that it's three different directors behind them.   1. C'era una volta il West (1968) (Sergio Leone)      2. Paris, Texas (1984) (Wim Wenders)        3. Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo (1966) (Sergio Leone)     4. Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927) (F.W. Murnau)      5. City Girl (1930) (F.W. Murnau)      6. Possession (1981) (Andrzej Zulawski)         7. Providence (1977) (Alain Resnais)      8. Repulsion (1965) (Roman Polanski)     9. The Holy Mountain (1973) (Alejandro Jodorowsky)      10. Blowup (1966) (Michelangelo Antonioni)          * A Zed   Two Noughts (1985): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sClBFDt4jSE * Rengoku eroica (1970): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiOnETIFQCY * Solyaris (1972): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qGI9E70Pe4   Modern Times (1936), that's how you do slapstick comedy.   I'm glad that people are talking about these things. While I don't fully agree with the writer about storytelling and characters and what every film needs, I can agree with him about a higher standard, that people should have that today. In a way, it does have to do much with taste of course.        When I was looking at the list of the highest all-time worldwide box office films (about 600 films), I could probably count the ones that actually are good/decent (of those I have seen) on two hands, maybe even only one. I may be picky, but I think it says a lot when it comes to Hollywood and how big budgets doesn't at all equal great movies, at least for me. It's almost the opposite when it comes to my taste. The best movies I've ever seen are not even near that list.        The one who wrote the Turn off Your Brain article actually said something very good:      *"We should demand more from films. Instead of asking viewers to turn their brains off, how about we ask the people who make these things to turn their brains on?"*   Wake in Fright (1971).   It's not bad. Probably Malick's best one. Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek are great in it.   Alex Garland said in March earlier this year that a sequel would likely not happen in the near future. And when he said that he meant at least not with the crew that was involved in the film he directed.  Source: http://screencrush.com/dredd-2-not-happening/   I would say that the best ones are these:          * Eclipse Series 3: Late Ozu    * Eclipse Series 11: Larisa Shepitko     * Eclipse Series 13: Kenji Mizoguchis Fallen Women      * Eclipse Series 19: Chantal Akerman in the Seventies       * Eclipse Series 21: Oshimas Outlaw Sixties       * Eclipse Series 39: Early Fassbinder       * Eclipse Series 40: Late Ray        In terms of the best films, I would easily choose The Ozu set. But it all depends on what you like and what you are into.   Oldeuboi (2003) is one of the most popular and loved Korean movies, so that's a recommendation. It's good. I don't know if you have seen it already, if not, that's a good and easy way to go next. It's also a part of a trilogy.              Otherwise, check out [100 Korean Films](https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/100+korean+films) and [100 Korean Masterpieces by Film 2.0 (2008 Edition)](https://www.icheckmovies.com/lists/100+korean+masterpieces+by+film+2.0+2008+edition/) which are two list that provide you with some essential and important Korean cinema, you'll find both newer and older films there. [Korean Movie Database](http://www.kmdb.or.kr/eng/) and [Korean Film Archive](http://www.koreafilm.org/) are two other useful sites that could come in handy too.        Lately I've been into Hong Sang-soo, a great director from South Korea that makes good dramas. I can recommend Book chon bang hyang (2011), one of the best movies I've seen post-2000.   Great and beautifully shot film by Yoshida.   La plante sauvage (1973).   It's a great film. I like how simplistic it is in a way, but still big, beautiful and full of depth. Talk about a strong debut. A very interesting depiction on how rural life, poverty and dreams can be to human beings. Ray's direction is just lyrical and poetic, very pure and full of emotions. Ravi Shankar's music is amazing too. And when it comes to Ray in general, I have to say that he was a great director and very important for Indian cinema (and of course cinema in general). Jalsaghar (1958) is my favourite by him. I remember that it was the first Indian film I ever saw. It makes me happy that Criterion are releasing the Apu trilogy on Blu-ray and that we're going to see even more of his films restored. Speaking of Ray, I actually bought a little book about him written by Folke Isaksson and Stig T. Karlsson that I should start reading soon.   Pather Panchali (1955) is brilliant.   Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) is quite good, but I wouldn't say that it's as masterful as some of Ozu's best films. Koreeda's work doesn't really have the same framing and uncompromising form as many of Ozu's films have, even if we can see that he's a bit on his way in specifically Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) where the influences are very clear. Koreeda said himself that he feels that his own films are much closer to what Naruse did, and I would also agree a bit with that, especially with the bleaker worldview in social reality and a bit more sentimentality. The tranquil subtlety and unique stillness isn't really on par with Ozu for me. Some of Koreeda's work before Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) also had a more documentary feeling. And let's not forget that Ozu did comedies and gangster films in the beginning of his career. Anyways, the themes in Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) are of course very similar to the majority of films that Ozu made, that's easy to agree with. I'm just a bigger fan of Ozu than Koreeda, but I absolutely think Koreeda has done some good stuff. As I already said, Aruitemo aruitemo (2008) is good, although it's more of a homage that copies a lot from Ozu and Naruse than being something really, really unique.   It really seems to deserve it, the movie looks so absolutely terrible that it's sad.   I think it could help to read the novel of the same name by Thomas Pynchon. But if you want to do it before, after or not at all, that's up to you. I think the main thing is to not just try too hard understanding exactly everything. I feel that a lot of it is meant to be complicated and confusing to the viewer, just as it is for Sportello. In my opinion, I also think that it's more important to take in what you simply feel before understanding it all. There's probably several in-depth explanations online, which you could read afterwards too. Multiple viewings could help as well.   If short films count for you, then I believe Pool Sharks (1915) is the oldest one.      * Andrey Rublyov (1966)        * Der siebente Kontinent (1989)      * Erosu purasu Gyakusatsu (1969)         * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)        * Jeanne Dielman, 23 Quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles (1975)           * L'eclisse (1962)       * Nattvardsgsterna (1963)       * Stntang (1994)      * Suna no onna (1964)       * Tanin no kao (1966)        I really liked Stntang (1994) much more than the novel.   The original release. In my opinion, the edited version has a jazzy soundtrack that doesn't go too well with the atmosphere of the movie. And the narration by Burroughs isn't at all necessary, the images speak better for themselves together with the already existing intertitles. Also, the edited version is heavily cut, which leaves out a lot.   I haven't seen that one, I just know that it wasn't really well-received, but it was clearly a financial success. And by the looks of this, I guess money is the big motivation.   Mon oncle (1958) by Jacques Tati.   It is! I would easily put on my top 10 list of both the best Swedish movies ever made and the best silents ever made. It has a great and dark atmosphere, an interesting narrative structure and top-notch use of double exposures.   Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes from Star Wars (1977).    You have never seen a trailer and thought "I will probly pass on that one"?   Of course, I don't think anyone watches every single movie they've seen a trailer for. There's thousands of movies I mostly ignore. But that doesn't mean that I convinced myself to never watch it in my whole life. I just prefer to have an open mode to the whole thing.   To be honest, none. I'd rather see more original, innovative and interesting ideas and movies revolving around anything other than tons of so called cinematic universes where the studios pump them out one after another, on and on. Of course, I realize that these kind of things make money and that's what Hollywood are going after as well as the big general public, but it would be great to see a big change. I can't say that the majority of these big movies getting pumped out with their own cinematic universes hold any real quality either. I know this change isn't likely going to happen though, but that's my two cents.   I can't think of a single movie where I said to myself or anybody else that I'll never watch it. I don't see any real need for myself to set any specific boundaries when it comes to things like these. If I don't want to watch a movie, the reason is more likely because there's other movies I rather watch or because I'm just not that interested in it, which doesn't have to be a case of putting it on a list of movies I'll never watch. I try to be pretty open-minded when it comes to what I watch, but what I like is another thing.   Gena Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence (1974), she's simply just amazing in that one.   The Limits of Control (2009).   There's a lot. I suggest that you look up some of the stuff Criterion Collection and Eureka (Masters of Cinema) have released, they usually have great transfers. And well, it also depends on what you mean with "older".           Here's three examples of some older films that I own that look amazing:       * L'eclisse (1962) (Criterion Collection)        * Pickpocket (1959) (Criterion Collection)        * Seppuku (1962) (Masters of Cinema)         http://www.blu-ray.com/ is also a good source if you want to know a bit more about certain releases, they have a big amount of reviews where they for example talk about the video quality etc.       Based on the films you mentioned and liked, I would really recommend looking into these:       * Ascenseur pour l'chafaud (1958)       * Hiroshima mon amour (1959)   * L'immortelle (1963)         * L'amour  mort (1984)        * La peau douce (1964)          * Le mpris (1963)       * Pickpocket (1959)      * Ma nuit chez Maud (1969)      Maybe you already know some of them because you mentioned films by Resnais, Malle and Truffaut already, I don't know how much you have watched so far, but they're all great.  	121

    How did you convert the tail?  and did that battery give you good operating time?  I have been thinking about going with something larger.  Another person mentioned the brushed motor might be inefficient do you think it would be worth getting a brushless to convert it?   Thanks for the suggestions,  I think if i make the ailerons big enough and with enough throw they should make a difference.  As for the motor i have thought abought replacing it, but the problem is i have no idea what to replace it with.  This is my first project, and I don't really know how to decide which motor to buy.   So I have an old 2 channel fighterbird from a long time ago.    http://www.hobbyzonerc.com/Products/Default.aspx?ProdID=HBZ4000  I am trying to convert it from a 2 channel to a 4 channel.  I think the only things that i am really going to save are the motor and the fuselage.  The electronics are just too old.  My question is what kind of esc should i use with the motor it has.  I am pretty sure it is a brushed motor.  It looks almost exactly like [this one](http://secure.hobbyzone.com/search/hcag1055.html?gclid=Cj0KEQjwqe-rBRCv_J6qs6isp6EBEiQAmbctFvBjGdlD69sZoG2TEcgYfqfWj6G93EO6dwa5Rk4JyqcaApkF8P8HAQ).  The problem is i can not find any statistics on this motor.  I would like to figure out what the amps and voltage requriements are so i can buy an appropriate ESC and battery.    Can anyone help me out?  I feel like this could be a fun project, I just need some help figuring this out so that i can move on to the other parts of the airplane.         Stay tuned at /r/New_Horizons  for updates.   This sounds like it would do great over at /r/nottheonion    I am so tired of everything being about profits.  They do it to satisfy investors in the stock market, but as soon as you have a bad year or something Investors leave you behind.     I knew they were out there I just did not know how to get them.   I edit mostly in JOSM.   But I only visit Puebla once or twice a year.  Is there some repository for GPS traces?   I am mostly trying to map in Mexico.  There have been a lot of new bridges and  roads in Puebla so a lot of the old imagery is outdated.    Bing Aerial Imagery Analyzer  thanks for the link   So I remember hearing a while back about a possible deal to get the imagery updated for OSM.  I was wondering when can we expect it to be updated?  in some places it is getting as much as 4-5 years old which is a big problem because It makes mapping new features exceedingly hard.    I am just wondering how long is the time between imagery updates typically?   Yea someone mentioned that it might have been slightly purposeful.  They compared the bending in LOK to boxing, which makes sense with it being a similar time period to the 1920s.  It's still boring though.   Bending from Avatar The Last Airbender.  That or the force from Star Wars.   I completely agree the animators for ALTA were much more creative in their choreography camera angles and blocking than LOK was.   I agree although frame by frame the quality was higher, I feel like they were much less imaginative blocking out the scenes and with their camera angles.  I also really missed the choreography of the ALTA fights.  I feel like LOK often involves the characters just using their bending to throw things at each other.  A great comparison is the [Toph, Aang, and Azula fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdcdhgn0zHM) vs the [Kuvira and Korra Fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqYY17r1UjQ).  For me the the Korra Fight is just plain boring visually compared to the ALTA.  They are standing in pretty much in the same place and just hurling things at each other.    This is just one example there are plenty of others in Korra where they are just throwing things and ALTA ones where there is excellent choreography and it it is really fun to watch.   We need proof.   Is this really a Go Pro?  or is it just a fisheye camera?  It seems like any small camera in an extreme situation is called a Go Pro these days.   My question is what was Saudi Arabia's motive?   Basically if the pages were to prove this, it would show that the Bush administration basically cherry picked the data they wanted so that they could get public support behind attacking the countries that they wanted to.  Politically Saudi Arabia has been a relatively good ally in the region.    The motive would be they did not want to attack a country that was an "ally" and also pretty well armed.  They preferred to focus on countries that were not friendly to the US and would be relatively easy to invade.  Like Iraq and Afghanistan.  Notice they did not invade Iran, because that country would have been able to defend it self much better, even though Iran was much more of a threat by the "Axis of Evil" standards than Iraq was.   How did your computer not die from the part count?   If anyone is interested we are posting updates at /r/New_Horizons         http://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/38e77t/nasas_hubble_finds_plutos_moons_tumbling_in/  here is the conversation over at /r/space   It tries to prevent people from rating out agriculture companies when the people leak about bad practices going on.    There are many ways to go about doing it, in some states they have made it illegal to lie about your intentions when getting a job.  I believe this particular one makes it possible to sue the employee for damages which is just ridiculous.  It would be like If the car companies had quality control issues and started passing laws saying they could sue an employee for lost sales if they go to the media about the quality control issues.  The only difference is this is our food which makes it even more scary.               he looks a lot like [Elon Musk](http://images.fastcompany.com/upload/610-e-musk-1.jpg)      Why was PETA even taking the dog?   True if you are in the middle of nowhere but when you make an approach this close to an object it is more likely there will be other stuff.   This was a joke with a fun Youtube video.   I wonder what the surprising observations are.         I guess it can be slow sometimes.      Google cough cough       The two main companies are Telcel and Movistar.  I would suggest Telcel, but both should work just fine.  Telcel is like the Verison of Mexico.  Have a great time Puebla is the best!!!   yea i completely agree with this OSM has a huge advantage of being open source and everyones map.  plus there is no controversy   What you are not accounting for is the money.  If SpaceX wants to continue to develope they need a steady inflow of cash.  CRS is an amazing source of income for SpaceX which enables SpaceX to continue to develope other things like the raptor the falcone heavy and much more.   is there any backstory to what is happening here?      Less fuel, happy customers.   ohh that makes sense   PARTY!!!!!!!  They should have built this section first. Before they did the northwestern section.   and you can usually race them at your local yacht club.  which give you great opportunity to grow your interest.   yea good idea.  When i had my 3GS i updated it  and eventually it got to be a glitchy slow mess.   Ok thank for the heads up.   /r/rasberrypi cough cough            Cmo se relaciona esto con Puebla?      http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/thumbnails/image/nh-styx-kerberos-loop-larger.gif    Direct link.  Shamless plug /r/New_Horizons   Come to /r/New_Horizons we are posting updates all the time.   I wonder how many more moons they are going to find before this is over.   Wow great article I did not know there was a Elon musk biography coming out.   Do you mean the name?   yea i found that out from someone else I was never taught to use the flaps except on short and soft field.   What is a DF?      You are a true hero in a time of need.            I think it has something to do with 2016 I lol'ed so hard.   This is my favorite one so far the missile launcher is the best part.   O my god they just keep getting better and better.   That cracked me up so much they are spending 1k on horse 600 an sword 7000 on girl.   Wow over the last day we have almost doubled the amount of subscribers to /r/New_Horizons. I want to say welcome to everyone new, I know everyone is looking forward to seeing awesome pictures of Pluto in July.  As a quick memo to everyone, updates from New Horizons have been a bit slow lately We expect them to pick up more as New Horizons gets closer to Pluto.  We will post updates, photos, ect as soon as we find them, but sometimes we can go a few days with out any new material.  If you see something interesting don't be afraid to post it. Anyway to the main point of this thread.  This is our second comment thread.  If you have questions, comments, theories, ect post it here. Hopefully we can answer anything you are wondering about.     I googled and this is the best I could find I can not spell.   Really I have never heard of taking off on a long runway with 10 of flaps.  I thought 10 was for short field.   Also they took off with the flaps down on a gigantic runway.  I wondered if they bothered to get the POH or a Checklist when they got the airplane.   He has [downgraded from the Jet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHi6vuikhZ0).  Also the "North Korean made Plane" looks ~~offley~~ awfully familiar I wonder if they have been exporting it ;P  Edit: My spelling IS that bad.   I Think the way they are doing it now works pretty well.  Wikipedia has had to be more organized with their efforts to stop vandalism mostly because they have encountered more organized vandalism like from Scientology and congress lol.   That tends to be pretty unusual though.  Usually the people messing with the maps are new people that just make a couple gag edits for fun and never come back.   I used to do map maker.  I stopped a few years ago when i started to realize more and more that I was basically giving this billion dollar corporation free labor.    I found out about OSM when I was looking for maps for my GPS and came across http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/ great site and I made a profile and started contributing to OSM after that.   All those things are exactly what Google Map Maker had in place.  It's not impossible to solve but it would be difficult.  I feel like wikipedia has shown that it can be done though and I feel like OSM should use similar techniques to Wikipedia to solve the problem of vandalism if it starts to become a problem.    I also feel like one thing that has protected OSM for a while is actually how the learning curve is steep.  Especially for JOSM.  Having multiple editing tools makes it a lot easier to stop vandalism in my opinion.  The ID editor is the easiest to use and would probably attract the most trolls.  If you needed to you could put more restrictions on the easier editors or something like that.   It used to be a i did not have to worry about when something said (spoilers all) because the books were well ahead of the series. But i am starting to be afraid when it says (spoilers all) i should watch out that the series does not spoil something for me.   It's all about demographics  California is having issues with antivaxers in some of its most affluent neighborhoods.   ohh god you got to love the news   I was in elementary school and I just remember thinking about how long it would be till 2015.   Yea I feel like the only thing that keeps OSM from experiencing this problem is the small size of the community.  If OSM were to get as popular as google maps you would start running into a lot of the same problems.   I feel like the only problem with this picture is the ages are way off.  Toph is still book 2 size meanwhile Sokka Looks like he is in his 20s   Can you be more specific?   I think i enjoyed the later seasons more because Korra matured and stopped acting like a jerk.  I don't like watching shows with characters who are disrespectful and act like jerks most of all when they do it to the people who are most important to them.  There is a difference between being strong willed, and being disrespectful, and Korra was disrespectful up until she went back to Tenszin in season 2.  I remember one episode that stuck out for me from ATLA was first episode of Book 3 when Aang made a point to be nice to Katara's dad even though Katara was obviously unhappy with her dad.  That made him so much more mature in my eyes than if he had just sat there.   I am that guy. I wish we would have gotten to travel and see more of the world like we did in ATLA.  Avatar is about saving the world, not just Republic City.      you should come check out /r/New_Horizons we are posting updates about the mission.   Yea but this is under a very controlled circumstance.  Aborts don't happen when everything is going right.  also the reason it didn't start tumbling was because of the trunk.  In general you want something to be passively controlled in circumstances where you might not be able to be confident in your data or your systems.  People forget that lifting the trunk is not that big of a deal.  The Soyuz lifts a fairing and the habitation module as well as the decent module during its aborts.   I just realized is that Azula bending fire?  It seems to me that the intro is [Pakku](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Pakku) bending water, [The Boulder](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/The_Boulder) earth bending, [Azula](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Azula) fire bending with orange fire instead of blue, and possibly an older version of [Aang](http://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Aang) air bending?  The air bender seems the most ambiguous.   I thought you were asking a question.    maybe but I think you need more extreme height differences for it to really be a factor.   There is only tallest mountain in the world, and we are sort of turning it into a trash heap with a crazy amount of tourists.   I think the problem with raising the price is you just further make it into a rich persons vacation.  Ideally you want real mountain climbers climbing the mountain not rich people looking for a cool vacation.  I would be up for closing it completely or really limiting it, but if you do that China and Napal have to work together.  Because if you only close the Nepal side people will just climb from the China side.   It's not really a surgery, it takes seconds.  It doesn't grant you magical STD protection it just gives you a slightly lower likelihood which doesn't really matter in places with relatively low STDs.  And it doesent really matter on the individual level, but can make a big difference for the population overall in places in Africa where 15% to 50% of the population has HIV/AIDS   Only one guy has only done it.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didier_Delsalle   Not to mention that you would only be able to carry one or two bodies down at a time.  It would also be really expensive.  You would have to pay millions to for the helicopter as well as pay some people a lot of money due to how dangerous it is.  As of now there is no one willing to pay that cost.   I am guessing the percentage of oxygen in the air is about the same, but at a higher altitude there is less air.  So you take a breath and less molecules are going into your lungs.   Yea I feel conflicted about how its like a rich person adventure now.  It's kind of sad how the mountain is just getting covered in trash and dead bodies.   I listen to music while I am driving, but driving does not include radio calls, marking checkpoints, and so on.   Not really https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Global_Map_of_Male_Circumcision_Prevalence_at_Country.svg  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision#/media/File:Global_Map_of_Male_Circumcision_Prevalence_at_Country.svg   It is crazy to hear the stories about guys skin coming off their legs like socks.  It's horrible and amazing at the same time.   As I said I am not advocating for circumcision.  I am not saying everyone should be circumcised.  I am just pointing out reasons why it is less controversial and generally not considered to be on the same level as FGM by the medical community and the general public.            I do agree that it is morally questionable how circumcision is usually done to infants.   It tends to fall into 3 major categories.  Almost all of the time it involves removing the clitoris and then depending on the type they may remove other parts.  The less extreme forms would be comparable to cutting off the end of the penis. the most extreme forms would be comparable to removing the whole penis.  Either way circumcision does not affect the mans quality of life in any way close to the way FGM affects a woman.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation#WHO_Types_I.E2.80.93III   http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/  There are a lot of reputable sources saying it does.   Circumcision is less controversial though, is generally not detrimental to the mans well being/sexual health and arguably has health benefits like reducing the transmission of HIV/AIDS as well as some other STDs.  FGM is more like cutting off the whole or part of the penis.  Edit: I didn't realize stating facts would be so unpopular.  here is a link talking about how HIV transmission is reduced with circumcised heterosexual males.  http://www.who.int/hiv/topics/malecircumcision/en/  Edit2: Everyone calm down, I am not saying I support circumcision.  Edit3: Defined well being.  Edit4: /u/blank_sunday_stares posted a good link showing no correlation between circumcision and STDs http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19115756 I thought I should put it in my post.  I did say that it was arguable wether it reduces HIV/AIDS transmission.  As always more science could help.   I have been seeing in a lot of posts recently showing people listening to music while they are flying.  I want to know peoples opinions on it.    Personally I don't think I would listen to music while I am flying.  I feel like it would be a distraction and possibly make me miss radio calls from ATC if I have flight following or something.  But I want to see what other people think.  Do you listen to music while you are flying?  Also what is the legality of it?  What are the restrictions and so on?   I think the advantage would be you would have a means of transportation once you got to your destination.  That still omits the fact it would be ridiculously expensive.   i think you underestimate the depth of rich peoples pockets i think if he could sell 50 of these he would be successful and i would be tempted to say that there are 50 people in the world that would buy this.   I think the best way to do a movie would be to make a completely different story line from the books maybe something after the events of the tv show.        There have not been any updates on New Horizons in the last few days.  There have also been no new pictures in the last few days either but rest assured that we will post them as soon as they come out.  It takes a while for pictures to be uploaded by Nasa.  Many times new pictures were actually take weeks prior.  Even when New Horizons passes Pluto you should not expect to start getting the bulk of the pictures until at least a week after.   If it makes you feel better I am a 90's kid.   I am amazed how easy it was for her to turn that nob I would have thought the o rings would have created more friction than that.  Are the o rings lubricated?   lol i didn't even realize that was your post.  Thanks for that by the way i can fly my rockets now without feeling like i am flying through honey.   It was I personally think that 1.0.2 with these small physics edits is the best of both worlds.    machConvectionEnd = 3.5  newtonianConvectionFactorBase = 1  newtonianConvectionFactorTotal = 1  What do these factors do? I have not edited them and i am a little afraid to do so because they were not in the original aero edit post.  http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34l0l2/psa_the_atmosphere_is_soup_again/   Change the physics values back to 1.0 its so much better.  http://www.reddit.com/r/KerbalSpaceProgram/comments/34l0l2/psa_the_atmosphere_is_soup_again/   I grew up in the south in the 2000s American Exceptionalism is proud and strong in the south.  You here it all the time about how the US is the Freest country in the world, best at this, best at that.  Most of the time these people have never left the country.   I made a gigantic fuel station out of orange tanks back in .20 it lagged so much.  Docking would take 10 minutes.  I didn't even realize how bad it was until I docked two normal Kerbal pods together it was so fast took like 2 minutes. I was like man that was easy what have i been doing?   My computer is lagging just loading that photo.   Yea i just found that video.   Do you have a link to that?  I didn't know about the Book 3 DVD extras   Does anyone have a mirror?  	138

 I hope it goes well :)   It's meant to be played in the background or while your doing something (e.g playing a game) and plus there's a visualizer so I didn't really think about transitions.   What do you mean by transitions?      It's up now :)   Lyrics:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o33Jfyxc-3g feature=youtu.be      Well I'm in the UK, so it's a bit different here, all of the people in my year/grade (year 10) have to take all the sciences, maths  religious studies etc and I take an exam at the end of next year which is our 1st important exams we do here. Thanks for the nice comment :) I appreciate it :)   Thanks :)   Hmm about careers idk, I'm pretty good with computers so maybe a computer related job, but I'm also quite academic so anything which interests me really (unless it's physics cause I'm terrible at that :p)  	9
          It is great that the university agreed to return this historic building to its original home.

 Buzzkill.  The second skit where they pretended to be a spring break shuttle for college students, then pulled over and pretended to rob a store.

I was busted at Trump in Toronto in the summer and it was not a pleasant experience - luckily I got off with a trespass fine and thats all.  Same cant be said for one of the others who was carrying a bolt cutter - I had no idea.  I may be entirely wrong about my assessment, either way it's probably not their first arrest!   lol, right??  Irony   www.freaktography.ca or www.facebook.com/freaktography   Thank you for posting!   I'm sorry /u/mapetitechoux- do you care to elaborate??  I did not find the house, nor did I ever claim to - but I did most certainly find the bag of cash.   abandoned since the 80's   hah - this is making so many people sad!!!  I'm sorry!!   inded   right?   hahahaha   well it is            close - but not quite!!   http://www.freaktography.ca/abandoned-time-capsule.html   http://www.freaktography.ca/abandoned-time-capsule.html   lol poorly made high school project   it likes you back!!   Husband died, then wife died - she then willed the home to her church instead of her daughter, which caused an estate legal process in which everyone forgot to check in on the house.   I dont think so, battery probably died long ago   this house was a library - so many books!!   thank you   This is not even the tip of the tip of the iceburg of things left behind in this house..  http://www.freaktography.ca/abandoned-time-capsule.html   no, I don't think that would work :P   lol   both :P            The quality really is shit - my originals are really nothing like what they posted!!   Thanks, I appreciate the sentiment!   lol            It seems that I have stirred up quite the healthy and passionate debate on the definition of "Abandoned" and the legalities of photographing abandoned places.  Yesterday, I allowed a story to be published in the Daily Mail about a home my friend and I explored in 2013 (we did not discover this house), a remarkable home that is a true time capsule. For whatever reason, whoever owns this house has "abandoned" it - meaning no one is caring for it, no one has stopped in to check on things, and whoever the last person out the door was - well they forgot to lock the door too.   It was eventually and inevitably discovered by those who seek to photograph decay and abandonment and it has been the topic of much discussion, debate and turmoil. It turns out that the home was willed to the church of the woman who lived there, and not to her daughter, causing some kind of legal battle. That would mean this home is in fact, not abandoned. Or does it?   Does any of this give anyone the right to enter it and photograph it....? No. However, had a handful of explorers not done such a thing, the treasures found in this house would have likely fallen into an even further state of decay.  The owner of a well known website contacted the elderly daughter and (much to the chagrin of many), the house has now been sealed and the valuable contents have been saved and boxed up. Had it not been for this group of "trespassers" this home and its contents would have been lost to time.  Everyone has an opinion, and they are entitled to that - I stand behind my decision to a) enter and photograph this house b) tell the fascinating story and show the world what can happen when your families treasures are not properly cared for once someone has passed on.  Thank you all for fueling such great debate on this subject -train_subject246   Hey All  Lets get things right  1 - I did not discover the house: this guy did https://www.facebook.com/LeftAheadPhotography   2 - I asked the DM to remove any reference to me "discovering" the house   3 - I also told them the house was abandoned in the 80's - not the 60's but they didn't make then change  It's been fun watching all of the reactions to this story, I love the many opinions and debates for and against it!!  I posted this last night on my facebook page  "It seems that I have stirred up quite the healthy and passionate debate on the definition of "Abandoned" and the legalities of photographing abandoned places.  Today, I allowed a story to be published in the Daily Mail about a home RiddimRyder and I explored in 2013 (we did not discover this house), a remarkable home that is a true time capsule. For whatever reason, whoever owns this house has "abandoned" it - meaning no one is caring for it, no one has stopped in to check on things, and whoever the last person out the door was - well they forgot to lock the door too.   It was eventually and inevitably discovered by those who seek to photograph decay and abandonment and it has been the topic of much discussion, debate and turmoil. It turns out that the home was willed to the church of the woman who lived there, and not to her daughter, causing some kind of legal battle. That would mean this home is in fact, not abandoned. Or does it?   Does any of this give anyone the right to enter it and photograph it....? No. However, had a handful of explorers not done such a thing, the treasures found in this house would have likely fallen into an even further state of decay.  The owner of a well known website contacted the elderly daughter and (much to the chagrin of many), the house has now been sealed and the valuable contents have been saved and boxed up. Had it not been for this group of "trespassers" this home and its contents would have been lost to time.  Everyone has an opinion, and they are entitled to that - I stand behind my decision to a) enter and photograph this house b) tell the fascinating story and show the world what can happen when your families treasures are not properly cared for once someone has passed on."  -train_subject246    Sluethy McSleuthenstein!!   lol   ya man - watching how hateful and angry people are is fun~!  Life's too short for these people!!!!   you have internet issues   Lets get things right  1 - I did not discover the house: this guy did https://www.facebook.com/LeftAheadPhotography 2 - I asked the DM to remove any reference to me "discovering" the house 3 - I also told them the house was abandoned in the 80's - not the 60's but they didn't make then change  You people are all very angry!!!!  -train_subject246            Thanks my man!

I know I know - but it is a generally used number and to do 21 pics of 21 senses would get old and people would lose interest at 6 or 7, so to keep it simple...I'll just do 5!!!!

When did I say those breeds shouldn't be handled the same way?  /u/lol_wat94 asked the question: "why are we spending all this time ganging up on one?" You replied that "those 20 other breeds rarely, rarely, rarely do when compared to this one breed." The implication of your answer is that it's reasonable to gang up on pit bulls and not gang up on the 20 other breeds, i.e., that those 20 other breeds shouldn't be handled the same way as pit bulls. If that wasn't the intent of your answer, then please clarify how you feel the 20 other breeds should   shouldn't be handled the same way as pit bulls.   But obviously, they are not the biggest problem.  How so? The data in the [Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf) suggest otherwise.

Your submission has been removed due to a sensationalized, editorialized, or biased headline. Please feel free to resubmit with a headline that adheres to the [Rules for Submissions](http://www.reddit.com/r/science/wiki/rules#wiki_submission_rules).    How is that not a problem?  When did I say it wasn't a problem? /u/lol_wut94 asked the question: "why are we spending all this time ganging up on one" when there might several other breeds (perhaps 20) that are equally or more dangerous? So far you've evaded the question rather than answering it. So if you   I agree that pit bulls are dangerous (/u/lol_wut94 might disagree), then what's your answer to their question: why do you seem to be only focusing on pit bulls?   While it is true that pit bulls account for the majority of dog bite-related fatalities (DBRF), that does not in itself demonstrate that they're more dangerous than the 20 other breeds mentioned by /u/lol_wut94. That's because in [risk assessment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_assessment), relative dangerousness is objectively measured not by fatality *numbers* but instead by fatality *rates*. Here's how it's described by the CDC in their [report on DBRF](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf):   Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the **relative dangerousness of each breed**. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.  When relative dangerousness is calculated in this manner, then fatalities by those 20 other breeds are not so rare when compared to pit bulls.

[According to the CVMA](http://c.ymcdn.com/sites/www.colovma.org/resource/resmgr/CLSD_Data_Presentation_Sept2.pdf), pit bulls account for 9.35% of dog bites (as opposed to fatalities), so about 75,000. [According to Merritt Clifton](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf), pit bulls make up 6.7% of the dog population, so about 5.5 million.  800,000 dogs attack per year out of a population of 83.3 million (1.0%). 75,000 pit bulls attack per year out of a population of 5.5 million (1.4%), which means that 98.6% of pit bulls don't harm anybody. Your sources are well   good but they only show that the 1.4% of pit bulls that attack are more dangerous than the 1.0% of other breeds that attack. However, your sources don't disprove /u/Schneiderman's claim that "the majority of pit bulls do not harm anybody."    Even if you take the pitbull stats and cut them in half- they are still by far the most dangerous breed  You make a valid point but seem to forget that this is not statistically how relative dangerousness is calculated in risk assessment. Here's how it's explained by the CDC in their [2000 report](http://www.cdc.gov/homeandrecreationalsafety/images/dogbreeds-a.pdf) concerning dog bite-related fatalities:   Ideally, breed-specific bite rates would be calculated to compare breeds and quantify the relative dangerousness of each breed. For example, 10 fatal attacks by Breed X relative to a population of 10,000 Xs (1/1,000) implies a greater risk than 100 attacks by Breed Y relative to a population of 1,000,000 Ys (0.1/1,000). Without consideration of the population sizes, Breed Y would be perceived to be the more dangerous breed on the basis of the number of fatalities.  When fatality *rates* are considered in a more statistically rigorous manner than simple fatality *numbers*, it could be argued that other breeds might be more dangerous than pit bulls (which just so happens to be the conclusion of the 2000 CDC report).    Total bite-related fatalities between 1979 and 1998:  I think that you mean *total dogs involved in bite-related fatalities* between 1979 and 1998. That is, it looks like you added up the 6th column in Table 2, which are the numbers of dogs, as opposed to the 3rd column in Table 2, which are the numbers of fatalities. They're not the same because sometimes multiple dogs were involved in the same fatality.  Here are the other numbers for comparison:  * Grand total (fatalities): 238 * Non-pit bull: 162 * Pit bull: 76  Top 5 as a percent of total:  1. Pit bull: 32% 2. Rottweiler: 18% 3. German Shepherd: 11% 4. Husky: 9% 5. Malamute: 6%  As an added bonus, here's how the top 5 stack up when comparing fatality rate, i.e., % fatalities divided by % population, as described in the first paragraph of the Discussion section of the CDC report:  1. Malamute: 6%  0.08% = 75.0 2. Husky: 9%  1.0% = 9.0 3. Rottweiler: 18%  2.8% = 6.4 4. Pit bull: 32%  6.7% = 4.8 5.

Keep in mind that the councilmen have suggested banning only pit bulls and not all dangerous breeds. It's possible that the problem is a combination of potential for injury and breed popularity, since pit bulls are the 2nd most common breed after only Labs. And according to a CDC report from 2000, Rottweilers were responsible for more injuries 20 years ago when pit bulls were less common. So, banning only pit bulls might not solve the problem if owners simply adopt other dangerous breeds instead.

According to the [Clifton report](http://www.dogsbite.org/pdf/dog-attack-deaths-maimings-merritt-clifton-2014.pdf), the fatality rates for Akitas, German Shepherds, Huskies and Chows are likewise disproportionate. Citing the Wikipedia page on fatal dog attacks certainly indicates that fatalities from pit bulls are disproportionate to the breed's population but it doesn't disprove /u/nomecks's point that there are other breeds with a similar issue.

Your submission has been removed because it is a repost of an already submitted and popular story.  http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/35z0uo/first_warmblooded_fish_identified/    The risk to humans during encounters with pit bulls far out-weigh their prevalence as a dog breed.  Thoughts?  The same can be said of wolf-like breeds (including German Shepherds   Huskies) and Chow-like breeds. According to your source, the fatality rate (fatality % divided by population %) is 9-to-1 for pit bull-type dogs, but it's equally disproportionate for wolf-like dogs (4-to-1) and Chow-like dogs (20-to-1). I would propose that your interesting   reasonable options should be considered for all three breed groups and not just pit bulls. Otherwise, if those options are only considered for pit bulls, then the data suggest that other potentially dangerous breed groups are being unreasonably excluded.

 I agree   Ahhhh.... I get it, that was a great twist at the end. Honestly I didn't see that coming, awesome!   Oh my, I have to admit, that was pretty good.   I love it, I didn't expect that twist and if certainly wasn't predictable like the other stories I've read.   Well I hope you the best on your plan.   I don't get it.   That was strangely sweet and sad at the same time.   Why don't you just hit the save button, so you can check on the story later?   Well.... yeah, I'm not doing that. But I am interested in hearing the rest of your story.   I'm pretty sure the artist didn't mind.   So.... mutant fly people?   It's okay the cops probably won't come before you get murdered, but at least locked the doors. And maybe if you got a knife to defend yourself, you might be able to hold off long enough for the cops to arrive in time to see you stab her. But hey, I'm just trying to be positive here, there are so many other things that could happen....   Umm..... you said titties instead of titles.   Probably not if she didn't know why she was in the living room.   With our deep dark desires of course.  	15

I hiked kokohead crater in flip-flops earlier this summer. My mom refused to tell me what it was. She just said "some people can do it in under 20 minutes" when I asked her how long it was. Little did I know she was referring to Olympic athletes and triathletes trying to get in shape. It didn't go over too well   I went on a cruise to Alaska one summer. One of the other passengers, a girl in her early 20's, packed only bikinis, short shorts, and tank tops. One of the landing party tour guides asked her why she didn't pack more warmly. She said it was because the weather channel always shows Hawaii and Alaska right next to each other. I gave up on the human race right then.    You sure it wasn't jesus?    I would assume only bots, mods, and admins. If other users could it would be anarchy.    I didn't mark it.

 Resigns on no reddit day? Does this mean the protesters won't know until tomorrow? Haha just kidding, they couldn't stay away    That's why we will lose    True, I was thinking performance. 1-11 of all blowouts    Commas are important here. Otherwise were talking about fisting.    2015 Colorado vs 2012 Colorado.    It got real awhile ago    I feel for FSU fans, a few kids with attitude don't reflect the team.    Maybe they'll go the way of Colorado following our accusations of the early 2000s      I used to fly Frontier a dozen times a year before the most recent buyout. I asked at the counter if there were "stretch" seats left before each flight. Roughly half the time I was upgraded for free   Wipes    Utah isn't much of a trap, they have good odds of besting Oregon   Nichols St    Colorado is hosting girls volleyball, soccer, lacrosse, and cheer camps this week.

Who would have thought?!   The millions of Facebook mom's that actually believe them    Milwaukee is one of the poorest cities with one of the worst education systems. This was true long before walker became governor. The twin cities were not at the level of Milwaukee.       Well, Minnesota doesn't have to deal with the poverty of Milwaukee    This will never get upvoted because the Sanders brigade makes sure bad press never surfaces    It would need to be a low fee otherwise traders will find ways around it    Or don't want a thousand page tax law    She's going to lose a lot of voters by fighting the NRA. Let's fight poverty, poor education, and bad home lives (the cause of violence) instead of people who want to responsibly handle guns.    I think it's because people associate silver with a shiny metallic finish    I'll call so you can work   Yes    And now we lose    I'd argue last year's game against Utah. We were so damn close and it would have been our only conference win      That's half useful, thanks    Depends how he plays post injury    Our rival picked GT? No way!       Results  http://bsndenver.com/poll-results-what-uniforms-do-buffs-fans-want-to-see/   Well it's OOC against a g5, you tell me   National champions but only by 1 vote in the poll and not even close in the other       What would you say it is you do here?   [Had it looked like this, I wouldn't argue] (https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2895502/kickerblammo.0.gif)   I love it. Lots of BS but I'm not in a cubicle, I work with my hands, and get to see some crazy cool stuff    To be very general, I work in healthcare    Let's get you a promotion    Similar to you I'm 6 4 and gained 30 lbs to hit 180, I look nothing like your pictures though    Was 6 4 and 150. Up to 180 now, original goal was 190 but now I want to break 200   Worked 7am to 7am yesterday.    I work 48 hours straight with nothing saying I get to sleep.    I can't tell what happened on these potatoe cameras    In the words of Michael Scott, keep it simple stupid    [I don't see the issue] (http://bsndenver.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/CUvid016.jpg)   I think we've paid out debts. Also 2/5 recruits so far are from Georgia    And here we have the first person without GT or CU flair, however with UGA flair I can't say you're unbiased    There is no true help, this argument will go on FOR CENTURIES!!!!   I'd like to see how teams for both conferences voted    Adding another comment for [this interesting ranking] (http://www.tiptop25.com/fixing1990.html)   Ohio State lost to VT, beat Oregon and FSU pretty bad. This would all be solved if Colorado played GT in the bowl game....   Do votes get casted one at a time? That seems like a horrible way of doing it    Playing in Nebraska is more than 3 points    Completely unbiased here.  The Nebraska common opponent doesn't work here. CU played in Lincoln, GT played neutral field.  I'll keep my overall argument simple, all voters knew about the 5th down and clipping call. That is the biggest arguments against Colorado but don't hold much ground when voters knew about it. Colorado only lost the coaches poll by 1 vote. They won the AP by very many votes. Colorado had a harder SOS as many other people here will discuss. If we emphasize conference play then Colorado wins at a perfect record where as GT tied North Carolina.   Edit- for SOS Colorado played 7 rated opponents to GT's 3.    Neutral for GT  At Nebraska for Colorado.  Not a good comparison, going off that any team that beat VT last season is better than Ohio State    I knew this day was coming, it's been an honor off seasoning with you.    Sorry about the fireworks, side question for you though, have you been following the trial?    Issue is this isn't a good comparison. You comparing average wage to elite schools. Better comparison is average wage to average in state tuition. Numbers will still show a huge increase in tuition without increase in wage       Ironically, many people commenting on this are at work.    You act like dems don't fast track stuff too, that's politics   Many teams share, that's low on priorities    Some of the harassment could be considered boys will be boys type stuff    Lacrosse    Lacrosse will gain a lot of those players since it's not as much contact    Isn't that in New York?    Well it's part of my job to ask every female of fertile age if they could be pregnant......  It's always fun asking the 80 year old woman as  a joke    I know all about the allegations. Sex and alcohol got recruits during that time. Was it the right thing to do? No. I'm tracing it all back to the source which is her. No trial was ever held against any of the players, Barnett even requested names. No other females pressed charges. There's nothing saying that they were innocent or guilty. Either way, no Katie, no accusations.    [this article explains it pretty well] (http://www.denverpost.com/colleges/ci_27041416/cu-buffs-football-program-tries-dig-out-deep)   Georgia Tech didn't join the pac so now CU And GT can't have an annual rivalry game where the winter gets both the AP and Coaches poll trophies from 1990    It's a shitty situation that has screwed Colorado over for nearly two decades, that's why she's the biggest mistake they made    It's applies to them whenever they're around the team, it's not just the physicality that's fueled by hormones, it's how guys act.    Exactly, Barnett told her in the 2nd year that she would have to compete for a spot and she didn't even tryout again. No one respected her because she was a bad player and didn't even try hard    She wasn't even good, no clue why she was even on the team. She never played a game.  Having a female in a sport fueled by testosterone is not going to work, especially back then.    No. Colorado is way better off in the pac. Have you heard how fucked the big 12 is? The pac south is the hardest division in college football. Put Colorado in the north and they go 500. Did you watch any games last season? We completely out gained ASU, multiple overtime against Cal, would have won against UCLA if sefo spiked the ball at the end of the first half but instead lost in over time. We have 4-5 games decided by one possession.  Can't wait to visit the big house next season, we won't even need a miracle this time.    Having a female kicker. She's not on the team, no accusations of harassment. No crackdown by the administration on recruiting rules. Colorado still relevant.   Edit- anyone downvoting is lying if they think a female football player would benefit the team.    [Even when spending doesn't improve scores] (http://object.cato.org/images/testimony/coulson-2-9-11-2.jpg) Howeve, [parental involvement does] (http://ideas.time.com/2012/10/24/the-single-largest-advantage-parents-can-give-their-kids/)   [someone leaving to avoid voting?] (http://www.npr.org/2011/02/17/133847336/wis-democratic-lawmakers-flee-to-prevent-vote)   Welcome to the PAC   Bikers should always be cautious regardless of who's in the right because getting hit by a car hurts.  Most bikers I see at night have no lighting or reflective gear. Cops don't enforce the law of needing lights.  I don't hate bikers although it's probably coming off that way, I just don't think this solution will work unless you get a huge amount of drivers to start biking.    I found it interesting the Bucks' worth doubled after going from worst team to NBA team, regardless of the conspiracy theory listed in the article.  Milwaukee and Wisconsin have a choice, build a new stadium to keep the bucks, possibly get an NHL team, and modernize Milwaukee. Or let the bucks leave and NBA owners profit off the $1 billion deal and lose and Milwaukee Bucks related revenue. The revenue will increase greatly over the next few years. The bucks have a lot of young talent. They can sustain success and get the city excited about something.       [this shit] (http://youtu.be/JQmNYPOgx40)   Just sibling banter here    [depends, do you support the military?] (http://youtube.com/watch?v=wRRsXxE1KVY)      Meanwhile the bucks have playoff team with an average age in the mid 20s.  NHL is considering Milwaukee for an NHL team.  A new stadium would do nothing but good for Milwaukee. Everyone is way too focused on the bucks. It's ok to fund a baseball stadium for a shitty team but funding a facility for diverse entertainment is a no go. There's a reason Milwaukee and Wisconsin are behind, everyone is stuck in the past and resistant to any modernization    Voat    Blame the skyrocketing population    Follow sports writers/teams as they post score updates, article links, and short thoughts    Same reason you can't change other games to ref error, shit happens    Wisconsin paid $290 million for Miller Park, a place that only hosts baseball. New stadium for the bucks hosts way more events with less state funds.  How are the brewers these days?       But a Miller Park tax is OK? How are the brewers now? Not near as good as the bucks.    Good for you. It's about more than the bucks. It opens the door for NHL to add a Milwaukee team, concert events, and overall entertainment. Milwaukee has nothing in the winter months and even summerfest is losing appeal. Milwaukee needs to modernize    And then goes any chance of Milwaukee getting an NHL team. You're stuck in  the past, Milwaukee needs new buildings in order to be appealing to anyone. It's a shit hole right now    Well that explains it   [you sure?] (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B6SsDTuIEAEpL02.jpg:large)   What are those?

I'm getting ready to move from the US to Thailand in about a month and I was wondering what would be the best way to bring some of my yarn stash with me. Could I use space bags to store the yarn or would that mess it up? Should I just have it shipped over? Anyone have any tales of moving to a different country and how they took their stuff with them? Thank you so much!   This has nothing to do with luck. It's hard work. And I plan on continuing to work hard. I want to keep building muscle and eventually become a fitness role model.

I run twice a day two days a week. And I take one day off a week. On my 5 mile day runs, I only run once.    I think it's a tad tight, but you know what I would do? I would keep it tight, and use that as motivation to make it looser by becoming more fit! (unless you are already fit, in that case I would just loosen it.):D  	20

 yeah 14.04, think I'll give 15.04 a shot, I was actually going to get 15.04 at first, but ironically chosen 14.04 so I could avoid the bugs...    But I don't like the NSA and all the third party anti privacy backdoor stuff that comes with it :(   Computer is all new. I've got to reinstall the whole thing now, simply because I can't login or open terminal, which means getting the ethernet cable out and going through all that pain again. All I wanted to do was install Ubuntu. I'll try again probably tomorrow... thanks for the tip! :P   I've ran it in a Virtualbox with no problems.   But dual booting it, it seemed to want to throw everything that could possibly go wrong at me.  Totally broken the OS now, like straight up broke it. Can't login, can't open terminal cos it goes black when I do. Fml.   The usb wasn't bad, it was another usb (LEDS.... some freakin lights....) that was causing the issue. Ubuntu thought the CPU had died...  Nvidia GTX 980, went onto the additional drivers menu, chose one of them (xorg), broke everything, selected another (532), partly works but buggy as hell.   A nightmare.  * - Spent 2 hours figuring out why it wouldn't boot the installer, it was caused by another usb. * - Spent another 2 hours trying to connect to the internet, I used an ethernet cable in the end to get the drivers needed for the adapter to work (WHY THE FUCK WEREN'T THEY FUCKIN INCLUDED IN INSTALLATION?!?! WTF GOOD LOGIC.) * - The wifi adapter kept going on and off, I fixed it finally though, somehow after half a day. * - Spent over 3 hours trying to get the freakin video drivers to work, I'm running on a GTX 980. * - Installed video drivers, buggy as fuck. Tried fixing the bugginess, broke the operating system. * - There is no logical method of finding out what video drivers you need. * - Couldn't login, would go black and return to the login screen. Opened the terminal and fix it that way. * - Ran some updates. Broke it again. * - Tried to login again, same thing as before. * - Me being super wise thought I'd just put the backup I made in earlier. There's no option to do so via recovery. * - Thought I'd repair broken packages in recovery, did literally nothing. Like enter ubuntu is now afk * - Currently uninstalling this disease.   And they call this Linux with learning wheels?  Rating: 2/10. Very shiny. Requires a degree in space rocket launch sequences to get it simply in a running state.

I don't see Whitney moving, Kaitlyn isn't ready for marriage, and Becca just doesn't have the chemistry/is too 1-dimensional.    I think people that commit suicide are completely pathetic. You should be able to help yourself before you get to that point.    Anyone here on r/aves also going to this show? I've read other threads on how Armin's live sets are amazing, and echostage has gotten good reviews on this sub. Anyone have any tips for tonight (this will be my 5th rave).   	3

 A word of warning if you purchase those GTX 970s from Amazon UK, don't do it. Take a look at the graph at the bottom of their page, the price is going up and down too often for my liking. I'm presuming however you're going to be buying them from Ebuyer anyway, but just in case.   She probably is still pregnant, in the last scene in the cafe she was about to tell the Doctor something before the conversation turned to Gallifrey. Besides, Orson Pink still needs to be born in the future with Danny and Clara as his ancestors. I'm surprised it wasn't revealed in this episode though.   After watching the preview of this episode, here is what I think will happen: Clara is pregnant, that is what she was calling to tell Danny before he died. Danny is going to die in this episode and be converted into a Cyberman. When converted into a Cyberman, something will happen that causes him to retain emotions and memories of Clara, they will then discuss Clara's pregnancy and have a heartfelt goodbye. Clara's baby will then be the ancestor of Orson Pink.  	3
 So I guess I'll ask. Why is there an Ankh in your chat box?   "Is that my belt?"

 Not good motivation for your team to tell them they cant win unless they hack DJ the whole first half.    Keep taking it inside to Blake or DJ. Make them defend you without fouling. Rockets got too many fouls too early.    This hack-a-DJ strategy is going to backfire bigtime. It's not really even working now. I'm convinced McHale doesn't really know what he's doing.       Going to have to read more of him.  apparent negativity doesnt bother me reflexively like it does many. Reading Heidegger now, "Building Dwelling Thinking", and there is definite Taoism throughout, though certainly not explicit.    this didnt happen today. it is a repost.    The guy was probably the worst president of all time. A sociopath to his core. Google what Billy Sol Estes said about him. Read the book "a Texan looks at Lyndon". read about the box 13 scandal. He never should've even been a senator. Google hitman Malcolm Wallace and his connection to LBJ. check out his connections to Brown and Root who funded his campaigns and profiteered from the Vietnam War. check out the video interview on youtube with his mistress Madeleine Brown, she implicates him in the death of JFK, as do many others.   The guy was a walking criminal all through his life, driven like an animal to dominate people.    Listen to Alan Watts lectures on Taoism on YouTube. Read his short book "Tao: The Watecourse Way". I would recommend *not* reading "The Tao of Pooh". Not a good book to start with. And I didn't think it was a good book anyway.   Essentially Taoism is the world behind words, the nature of reality, the way of harmony.   I distinctly recall him saying in the post-game press conf that it was a pass.    No. But i would like to see us go with a shiney silver helmet, instead if the dull silver we have now. and/or a matte black helmet with a shiney silver logo    at least as alternate helmets   He's such a poser. So conscious of the cameras at all times.   Only if Joey Crawford's crew is reffing is there a chance.    As much as Id like to see the Warriors go out now, we are better suited to beat them, because Blake and DJ match up better. They dont have Zach or Gasol. Also, the Grizzlies are more of a halfcourt offense. Like the Spurs. The Clippers play better against more flowing dynamic offenses.    Right. Better safe than sorry.    Like Kobe will play with him?   Must get rid of the police officers bill of rights.    Cowboys   Don't worry.  They're going to raise the toll fee to cover the expense of fixing the bridge.   Words are only tools and are abstract.  They aren't real (concrete) and aren't the things they represent.  The word "tree" doesn't help us understand trees.  Often words divide people even though they are used for communication.  We apply words and labels to ourselves and each other.  Maybe we call someone a Democrat, but that only limits - maybe prevents - our understanding of them as a person.  And it is using a word and category ready-made, handed down to us by the political system, which wants to divide people amongst themselves.  As just one example.  It seems in your second paragraph that you are making my point.  Why complicate it with more discussion and questions and words?  This will not help.  I'm not saying words or consciousness has anything to do with whether or not everything is one thing.  Everything is one thing *regardless* of words or concepts or consciousness.  We can talk about the complexities of language, but it will get us further from the point.  And that itself is my point.  A child doesn't know how to speak, hasn't yet learned the words....   Young Man Rivers Walk.    yeah baby yeah!!! crawford with another laser bounce pass to rivers!   Time to finish em off!   yeah and silly fouls   DJ gotta stick closer to Howard. Dont even let him touch the ball.    Is it true we passed over Ariza and got Hawes instead?   refs aint falling for any harden theatrics.    Because it isnt a philosophy or a religion. It is about nature, the way of nature, real reality. All others get abstract and reductive. It is about everything. It is profoundly simple and pure.    they appear to be on to him.    1. Anarchism 2. Everything is one thing anyway. Words and consciousness are problematic: Reductive, limiting, coercive, etc. We can be in harmony with ourselves and with nature.  3. Taoism  EDIT: Why downvote and not rebut?   Ive not been competitive. Dont understand why that is an actual trait in people. To compete with their fellow man or woman. It isnt a fight or a contest. I think it is mostly found in the choleric temperament. It is blended with jealousy and comparison and maybe insecurity.   That said, I was good at competitive sports like soccer, basketball, and especially track.    Man, this writer likes the sound of his own voice.     Why don't they just decide the punishment already?  Why didn't the punishment get released publicly with the report?  Why is everything floated through the public first?  Goodell is playing politician with this like he does with everything else.  But it's hurting the league to have this in the news so goddamn much.  And it makes it look like he's trying to gauge public reaction before anything is decided - which is what he is doing.   Wait until after Goodell is gone for that.      USA! USA! USA! WAR! WAR! WAR!   You will see why it was never released.    Thanks, Postscript. I suspected you could know this.       [He's our Kawhi Leonard](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Bl8NXnxCUAALprE.jpg).  All business.  Lets his play do the talking.   It is better to not try and not fail, than to try and fail because you failed to realize that your failure was a success.   Thanks a lot.  I'm going to dig into all of those.  Been into the Jung connection somewhat (The Secret of the Golden Flower).  Yes, I would put Schopenhauer on that continuum as well.  I find this all very engrossing and totally fascinating.     Government doesn't come from God, so it should be banned.   Tom Brady is a goddamn liar and a fraud.  This has been clear since at least 2002.   Any word on Ginobili, Parker, or Harden?   Wow. I am actually writing a paper on Taoism. Was working on it today, and thought I remembered this piece on consciousness from Kierkegaard that might help.   But knowing something about existentialism, I find its parallels with Taoism/Zen are quite poignant, though they aren't completely congruent. I want to investigate the connection more. Thanks for the lead.    Possibly.  I remember a chapter title something like "Consciousness is the Problem".  Thought it was SK, but may have been Sartre.  I'll try to check him.  Thanks.   You may want to see my comment below.   As long as views and perspectives supply the meaning then you can probably find meaning of some sort here or there.  But views and perspectives come after reality itself.  Existence precedes essence.  Artificial rites of man might have meaning, but like everything, it is ultimately in the eye of the beholder.  To look at meaning as a pejorative thing is problematic.  Meaningful is, in itself, no better and no worse than meaningless.    Trees don't mean anything.  Nature doesn't mean anything.  Meaning is artificial.         Joey Crawford is totally out of control.  I appreciate zeal, but he loses the big picture.  It's not about you, Joey.  It's the playoffs - let them play.  The fans don't want everyone not playing.  His crew called a lot of fouls in the Clips-Spurs game they reffed.  But not nearly this many.  Then this was severely imbalanced in the Rocket's favor.   your art should not need a narrartive explanation to accompany it. it should not be conceptual to any degree. it should speak for itself. existence before essence. make something that just is. no clever one-liners. they are the opposite of existentialism.   i would look at nature, found objects, etc. doesn't have to be beautiful. dont fear the ugly.    Pointless things are OK too. Most things are pointless. Life is not about meaning, etc.  Edit: In many ways college is pointless. If you are talking about a religious rutual that is another story. But graduation is more like a celebration.    It was an off night for Crawford. But I still dont get why we see so much Rivers. I dont get why Crawford has to come off the bench in CP3's absence.    Look at the bright side:  We won't have a Joey Crawford reffing crew the rest of this series.......Will we?   Lester did foul a lot.  But I guess everyone did tonight.   That's true, tonight he was.   Lester was real good.  He should have played more instead of Rivers, in my opinion.  Rivers isn't that much of a passing point guard.  He can't lead the offense.   He usually gets hot at some point.  They said Jamal was telling Blake to shoot more and not pass it.  These guys can't guard Blake (with the exception of Howard) any more than the Spurs could.   Yeah, not one of Doc's better coaching jobs at all.   Don't understand those coaching decisions down the stretch.    1. Why take Blake out with 3 minutes left, even if you put him back in with 2 minutes left?    2. Why have DJ sit so much the 4th quarter?  When DJ and Blake are both in there, they don't double Blake as much or as well, and DJ is a huge presence on defense.  Etc....  3. Why play Rivers so much?  We could have put Crawford, Reddick, and Barnes in there together.  They are all better shooters and better defenders than Rivers.  4. Why not intentionally foul Howard earlier in the possessions toward the end?   Lester Hudson: 10 min, 5 pts, 2 ast, 1 steal, 1 block, 2 TO, +9  Austin Rivers: 25 min, 10 pts, 2 ast, 0 steals, 0 blocks, 1 TO, -3  Play Lester more.   Dont get these coaching decisions at all.    Get DJ in there!!!   Taking Griffin out with 3 minutes left??? What?   That long shot at the end of the last quarter is what broke the shot clock.    Let Blake go to town!    Joey Crawford reffing = foul-o-rama.    Key to the game is DJ staying in there to guard Howard and get boards.    In a crazy way being without CP3 is almost helping us because we arent slowing down to the half court game much.    A transition game is perfect for us especially without CP3.    He is like Kawhi Leonard. Lets his play soeak for itself. Acts like he's been there before and will be there again.   Im my own worst enemy. Thats for sure.    Not really. He was overseen by Rooney and Mara.    Wow - you're obnoxious as all hell.   You're making the mistake of assuming I care what you think.  (I don't.)  You may only be concerned with your appearance, that doesn't mean anyone else is the same way.   "Salt"?  Am I only supposed to use words like "probable" to fit in here?  Do you think I care?  This is a reddit comment board.  Look around.   Brady and Kraft are goddamn liars and cheaters.   Kraft and Brady denied everything and say they fully cooperated.  We now know, what we assumed all along, that is false.  They also know that Goodell will cover for them as much as possible.  Goodell incentivizes their cheating.  Now we get a report of an "investigation" after four months, timed to be released after the draft, that concludes with words like "probable" and "generally"?  WTF!?      Goes to show how much fraternal means "frat house":  Insane brotherhood with all kinds of irrational bravado, etc....      Congrats on your solid BM!   Yeah Im hoping for Memphis. Dont like Golden State ever since that bogus game when Blake was ejected.       There are about 30 different sorts of "Vegas underworlds".   exactly. theyre the same goddamn word. like what does $#!+ mean?   Of Kobe was a part of that squad, they wouldn't have Dwight Howard (nor would they have Harden).   This is excellent.  Man gets caught up in form, which in nature is ultimately incidental (for lack of a better word).  Form can be illusion or disguise.  I am writing a paper on this, and other things right now.  It is quite timely to come across this post.  It is the flip side of the wu wei:  Natural order from within assumes a form that is determined from within, not from without.  I didn't know form was addressed explicitly in Taoist text this way though.  Thanks.       The control of crypto-currencies like Bitcoin are set to be tightened drastically.   probably translated with google translate      Yeah, cause they were black, right?   Exactly. I was saying the same thing. Anyone have a gif? It would be a tiny bit of redemption.    I was thinking that exact same thing today. So quiet in the media. Makes you wonder.    You can see it in his eyes. The dudes been dialed in these last few games. I love watching him play with this intensity. Great energy.    it is ok. im here just posting basic verifiable facts, not making any claims or choosing any sides. but people downvote me because they want to cling to their delusions about Bernie Sanders.    From zero to a tiny bit. Im done wasting time with you.    BPD deleted it from their feed.    No, Bernie Sanders is actually quite anti-Fed himself, though not as much as Ron Paul.  And he's against the big banks quite aggressively, much more than Ron Paul is (though Paul was against the bail-outs).  Of course the Fed and the big banks aren't the same entity.  The big banks are actually themselves different entities.  (My post didn't suggest otherwise.)  Though, in effect, the Fed and the banks usually act in unison, especially with regard to Congress.   It is not really "progressive" if one of your principal adversaries is the Fed (and the big banks). The Fed is one of the crown jewels of the real progressive movement.    Get with the program. The original story was errantly reported. Everyone knows that.    the cops themselves reported that a man was shot on their twitter page (as did non-fox news witnesses). since removed. witnesses were interviewed who said they were pepper sprayed.       One of those "reports" was from the BPD themselves, via twitter.  Why don't they tell us what *is* true? Why did the victim have to go to the hospital?    If you believe the cops.  It could be true, but why take their word for it?     Cops say he threw his revolver as he was running and it went off, and that he then fell somehow and hurt himself?  And that is why he was taken to the hospital?  Interesting.      Witnesses report the victim was unarmed, and was running away. A gun was found at the scene.    Cops also maced the witnesses at the crime scene.      Witnesses say he was unarmed.  Also that cops maced the witnesses after the shooting.   Break it down into smaller chunks.   Start doing something. Sometimes things will get done, and done well, if you trust your intuition and just go. Thinking can get in the way.    Soren Kierkegaard: Concluding Unscientific Postscript.    You might want to check out Taoism. Books like the Tao Te Ching and The Book of Chuang Tzu. Also 'Tao: The Watercourse Way' by Alan Watts. I have similar interests in existentialism and nihilism and religion - and Taoism even seems to go behind all that.    Have you heard of Mau Piailug? I got to meet him once very randomly in Hawaii.    I recken i'll hamme sumuda bigguns.    Just curious where u got 2.5 M? Thats less than 1%. Wiki says we are 1-2%. Not a big deal though.    This is why Taoism is so refreshing and rejuvenating to me.    UTF = UnTranslated French = Pardon my French.    You only felt exhausted because the book was so boring and you felt you had to persevere through it for some reason.    ....I just seen red.     could it be a fibroid? just a guess?   Kawhi is my favorite non Clipper in the league. Total stud. All business. No nonsense. Skilz all around.    They are mostly jealous Laker fans who see their franchise on a long trajectory down, and ours on the way up. It is also fans who dont like our posterizing and lobs and alley oops.    On the subject of CP3 drawing fouls:  He can force contact and exaggerate it. But, unlike Parker and especially Ginobili, he doesn't sacrifice the whole play. Meaning he doesn't loose the ball. So if the foul isn't called, he keeps playing, usually without picking up his dribble. Ginobli will initiate contact as his first option, then do his gymnastics, flail, then flop, the ball missing the basket by a mile. I have no respect for that.    he stepped up big last night. and always plays high intensity. great defending. reminds the team after the game that theyre not done yet!  no, they ain't!!!!!   Not really.  If he thinks the play was blown and it "absolutely" was clear to the Clippers what they were running, then he should have taken the timeout then and drawn up another play.  Teams would be finishing close games all the time with one timeout left if they always had to save it just in case they couldn't get the ball in.  Plus, trust your team to throw an in-bounds pass.   What about a recording of bagpipes?  Played loud.   Kilt?   If only he had killed him, he'd be on paid leave right now.    Relieved? Not really.    Portland shouldnt have got an automatic 4 seed.    It's been a changing of the guard baby!!!   yeah, i don't doubt what you say, you are clearly in the know more than i am.  i had a sense that we got too many LBs there.  Reg used to be one, so maybe that's why, and Ken Norton too.  i trust him - maybe too much.   That comment will be $40.  I'll send you a bill.   Send me a livestream link please.  Don't think about it.  Just do it.  Thanks!  :)   WHAT A FREAKING GAME!  What a series.  Much respect for the Spurs.  Especially Kawhi.     No DJ - the Spurs get boards.....   Another draft that couldn't have gone any better.  I was hoping for Amari Cooper all along.  And the more I learn about him, the more like he seems destined for all time.  Edit: Came out wrong the first time.    They can tie his contract to how much he weighs.  If he weighs too much, he gets paid less.  Give him some incentives that way.  If they need to.   You can see why he impressed the coaches in interviews. The more I hear about this guy, the more I like him.    And then once you pick the clown says, "Sorry you dont have a pick."   Take it to Antiques Roadshow.    I got a three-meal-a-day habit I just can't seem to kick.    Everyone saying they wish Gregory was taken:  Do a Google search.  You'll see he has something(s) "off the field" that is keeping teams from taking him this early.  For instance [this](http://deadspin.com/something-weird-is-going-on-with-randy-gregory-1701010088) and [this](http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/04/29/confusing-reports-emerge-about-randy-gregory/).  All kinds of speculation as to what it is.     No way do we need any drama.  And no way is Reggie the guy to roll the dice.  That said, I sure feel sorry for the guy. At least he will get to the NFL eventually.    In this series so far, 66% of the games have been won by the away team.   It seems Reg isn't into any player with any degree of risk. I don't blame him anymore. The risk these days isnt like it was in the old days. Lyle Alzado risk is different than Jamarcus Russell risk. There are guys without risk.    Exactly. Williams was too hyped and people bought in. We needed a receiver. No brainer. Etc. Etc.    Had some good reffing for a change. Jamal made his two free throws. Reddick was on. Taking care of business. We closed it out.    Bigtime Y.A.C.!   He only just got there himself. I think he's OK.    We've all heard at least a few people express skepticism about Leonard Williams, but *none* of us have heard the least bit of negative or doubt about Cooper. All positive.   And I think some got taken up with the hype about Williams.    He didnt suck in interviews with the coaches.    Back in Black!   Williams was hyped a bit. We need this receiver. Cooper is a solid guy too. Will have good synergy with Carr.    What evidence do you have that you aren't the Baltimore Chief of Police?      LSU is the prime place for super-talented underachievers.    sometimes.  but in this case, she has already committed verbally anyway.  if she's busy, she can say so.      Why would the FBI, an investigative agency, want MLK dead?  They were acting on someone else's behalf.  The FBI through Hoover was very close to LBJ, who also hated King.  King was against the war in Vietnam.  LBJ was for the war, as were war contractor buddies in Texas like George Brown, who helped start LBJ's political career.  Brown was one of the biggest war contractors of all time.    James Douglass is writing a book on the MLK assassination.  You may want to get it when it comes out.  His book on JFK is usually regarded as the best, or one of the best, among hundreds on the topic.   When you say court of law, you mean criminal court. Civil court is a court of law as well. But I'm sure you are correct about everything else.   There is a whole false narrative built up around Ray, just like there is around Oswald.  Dig deeper in your research.   The "big scary government" tried to get MLK to kill himself by threatening to disclose his affairs. Google the letter they sent him.   It is frustrating because we beat ourselves. Those two games were ours. Need to close games out.      	164

I call it the bat signal.    hey someone just posted that   I mean, if you want to play them, go ahead, but you don't have to play them to understand The Witcher 3.

I've never owned a Playstation console, so I'm just shooting in the dark, but I'm going to go ahead and say The Last of Us.   Barbara's suicide? I didn't really notice anything overtly violent/sexual or excessive use of swear words, so I am wondering if the game is rated Mature because it includes such a dark theme.

Uhhhhh, I meant if his music is any good. I don't care about what kind of person he is...   I would never forget The Phantom Pain, brah. The Phantom Pain doesn't forget me.   You forgot Halo 5, brah   You forgot Halo 5, brah   You forgot Fallout 4, brah   He's actually a really good actor. Have you seen The Place Beyond the Pines?   I'm 18, and I just haven't listened to him, but I've heard of him. Are there any albums you recommend?   Does it mean "smashing pumpkins" as in destroying pumpkins, or "smashing pumpkins" as in good-looking pumpkins?   I noticed the Smashing Pumpkins are touring with him. Is he any good? I haven't heard any of his songs.   Oh nice, it looks like I can just play mgs3 and peace walker to understand what's going on   He's black, so he doesn't fit the role.    Mads Mikkelsen won't lose his acting skills by working out...   Is Metal Gear Rising Revengeance any good?   how can he do that if he's dead?   eh, kind of looks like he just started lifting weights. he doesn't need to look like a pro bodybuilder, but c'mon   I always imagined him as pretty muscular in the books. I mean, he spends his time chopping monsters to death with his sword. He should have some muscle.   NOT THE CROSSDRESSING ELVES!!!!!!!!!!!   YES. But he would really need to bulk up.   Yeah, I thought that, too. Maybe in like 15 years or so.   what if I read/watched a story synopsis?   The HD collection doesn't have all of the previous games.   I think Ryan Gosling could pull it off if he bulked up a bit.  I'm comparing my covers of The Place Beyond the Pines and The Witcher 3 right now. They have very similar facial features.

Run out of an item?   YOU NEED TO EITHER FARM FOR IT OR USE YOUR CURRENCY TO PURCHASE IT.  If you dont like that then tough shit.   And a group of woman is called a "Gossip"   When you get more than 20 of the health items or bullets they go into storage.  So If you run out and die, rather than farming go back to the hunters dream and restock.  If you run out of both... Then yeah, you have to farm or purchase them. That's a simple gameplay mechanic present in most if not all games. Or do you expect games to just hand you what you need so you dont need to actually play the game?

Like Mike  Air Bud  Teen Wolf (1985)  Now, figure out if I'm serious or not.   No they are not, I have lost two accounts so far.  The first one I had since PSN first launched, I spent months fighting with Sony to recover it after it was hacked... I had over $2000 worth of digital content on that account, games for PS3, PSP, Vita, and PS4... Sony said they could not verify any of my information. I guess as it had been changed, the name, address and email had been changed more than 3 times... Apparently their system doesnt keep record of the original information if it is changed enough times. So too them I never owned the account, all the receipts of purchases were useless, all the information I could provide was moot, there was no way I could prove it was my account.  The second time it happened, within the same year I might add... I didnt even bother trying to recover it.  I have since cut back majorly on using PSN to purchase digital content, and if it werent for all my firends being Sony/PS4 users I would have switched over to XBOX or PC.

I just did a search and yeah, it is [rather big...](http://attackofthefanboy.com/news/final-fantasy-type-0-hd-ps4-larger-file-size-xbox-one/)  As others have mentioned, some PS4 games will download a part of the game, the intro, sometimes a prologue section that you can watch or play while the rest of the game downloads.   That seems to be the case here.   Well yeah, it's an up-scaled PSP game... Dont see how it would exceed 4GB regardless of the changes.

 Anyone have a clue when they're taping the new Batman. Get it because duct tape.  	1
 To use a hypothetical example, say that Myanmar finds its crops are suffering from heat-related blight and drought, so it decides to spend a paltry $10 billion (Weitzman's estimate) to spew sulfates into the air, reducing global temperatures by a half-degree Celsius, improving its crop health and making its dictator more popular. Meanwhile, those sulfates become acid rain falling downwind all over neighboring India and Bhutan, destroying forests there, while the lower global temperature also causes crop failures in Canada and the Nordic countries. How do India, Bhutan, Canada and Sweden then recover from Myanmar? The military dictator there knows he has more to gain from popularity at home than he has to lose from a bunch of pissed off far-flung foreigners.      The IMF has done extensive studies on both positives and negatives of warming, like [this paper.](https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2008/03/pdf/cline.pdf) Those findings are generally included in more recent reports. Unfortunately, where agriculture is concerned, the news isn't great. Warmer winters in Canada don't compensate for larger crop failures in the subtropics and tropics, where more than half of the world's people live.    This is what Weitzman and Wagner write about, and it's frightening. Their position is that geoengineering is simply so cheap that it is inevitable as a criminal activity, and must be treated as such by the global community.    Thanks for the nice reply, but, as the study says, in most cases these costs are born by local populations exposed to local pollution, which suggests greater accountability. The study identifies global climate damages as only about one quarter of the costs, while the rest are primarily localized effects of pollution.  It's just that those local populations happen to be concentrated in the developing world, particularly Asia, where recovering for such damages is nearly impossible. The basic trouble isn't how you or I define accountability or subsidy, but how courts do--and that varies tremendously by jurisdiction. This is less an economic matter than a legal one.  The IMF paper here simply identifies the costs, which, it seems to me, is as far as economics can go with this. Rather than quibbling over economics textbook definitions of subsidies, the real issue is how to enforce accountability in poor places with corrupt governance.   Shortest true answer: we don't know.   How so? Wouldn't a tax to recover for the damages both compensate taxpayers for their expenses and discourage polluters?   Why aren't externalities subsidies? If a given group of taxpayers shoulder cost burdens to benefit a specific local industry, it's a subsidy isn't it?   Well, no. Most of the damages detailed concern pollution and health costs, and 10-20 percent are direct handouts to encourage fossil fuel production and consumption, but don't let that get in the way of a good diatribe about traffic accidents.   Actually, direct subsidies (price supports, production subsidies, etc.) account for somewhere between 10-20% of the total.   Because insurance wouldn't pay out without a successful lawsuit in most of these cases, and most of the damages are in countries where that would be impossible. How does a resident of Guangzhou sue a factory or power plant for the death of an asthmatic child when there are so many factories and power plants spewing pollutants there? Which one was responsible? And how can the plaintiff win in a country with so many legal obstacles?  Even Union Carbide's killing of thousands in Bhopal resulted in nothing more than a modest judgement that hasn't begun to cover the costs there, where it was vastly easier to quantify damages and assign blame.     virtually all of it (outside say China, Venezuala and Saudi Arabia) are just tax deductions.  No, most of the [$550 billion](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/11/12/renewables-are-replacing-coal-just-not-fast-enough-to-save-the-planet/) in annual direct handouts to fossil fuel companies are consumption subsidies and production subsidies, and they are pervasive worldwide.   The *indirect* subsidies--the externalities detailed in this paper--are predominantly localized effects of air and water pollution, especially on health costs, and most of those are in developing countries. See the graphs here:  http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/05/18/act-local-solve-global-the-5-3-trillion-energy-subsidy-problem/   Here is a [blog post](http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/05/18/act-local-solve-global-the-5-3-trillion-energy-subsidy-problem/) on this paper from two IMF leaders.      [Here](http://blog-imfdirect.imf.org/2015/05/18/act-local-solve-global-the-5-3-trillion-energy-subsidy-problem/) is a related blog post by two of the IMF leaders vetting this paper, for those who want more detail.  Note that this is not the first time the IMF has issued a report like this. It's merely a large increase from the $1.9 trillion in subsidies and externalized costs that was the previous yardstick.      Sorry about the paywall. Here is the text:  WASHINGTONConsumers should be paying a whopping $5 trillion more a year for energy to cover the hidden health and environmental costs of using fossil fuels, the International Monetary Fund said Monday.  Vitor Gaspar, head of the IMFs fiscal affairs department, which produced the report, called the estimates shocking and one of the largest negative externalities ever estimated, referring to costs that arent factored into prices.  The fund said policy makers must start capturing those costsvalued at roughly 6% of global gross domestic productin fuel prices now to curb the damaging effects, encourage greater energy efficiency and prevent a mounting toll on human health.  The report said the costslargely fueled by the ballooning use of coal in China and Indiafar surpassed the savings gleaned in the past year as governments cut traditional energy subsidies.  Falling oil prices have given governments including India and Angola an opportunity to raise energy prices closer to their market values.  Cutting subsidies relieves a burden on state budgets and allows a government to channel revenue elsewhere, such as social services, health care or growth-spurring investments.  International Monetary Fund Fiscal Affairs Department Director Vitor Gaspar called a report on the hidden health and environmental costs of fossil fuel use shocking. International Monetary Fund Fiscal Affairs Department Director Vitor Gaspar called a report on the hidden health and environmental costs of fossil fuel use shocking.   But the IMF said the uncounted costs of pollution from coal, oil and natural gas also should be considered subsidies because economies are burdened with mounting costs resulting from their use. Based in part on new World Health Organization data, the fund estimates those post-tax subsidies will hit $5.3 trillion this year alone.  Around a quarter of that covers the theoretical cost of mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions.  The rest is from the health effects of local pollution as well as from traffic congestion, accidents and road damage.  It is important to put in perspective just how many health problems are linked to energy consumption and air quality, said Benedict Clements, a division chief in the IMFs fiscal affairs department.  For example, the WHO estimates more than one million premature deaths a year occur because of outdoor air pollution caused largely by burning coal, he said.  IMF economists acknowledge the figures are disputable, but say they provide some indication of hidden costs that should provoke debate.  They also accept that eliminating subsides by raising energy taxes would be costly for consumers, and so it recommends a gradual increase.  Moving to efficient energy pricing in one step would require very large increases in consumer energy prices, in particular for coal, with a global average price increase of more than 200 percent, the IMF warned.  Although higher energy prices generally tax an economys growth prospects, the fund said governments can use the increase in revenue to foster economic expansion, such as through cutting labor and corporate taxes, infrastructure investment and spending on education.  It also would create incentives for low-emission alternative energy.  The fiscal gains from subsidy reform are sizable and could be a game changer for fiscal policy in many countries, Mr. Clements said.   Apologies. This article seems to be paywalled for some.

That's part of it, but look at vote-by-mail states: turnout is better, but it's still heavily skewed by the elderly in most elections. High-profile presidential elections are the major exceptions.   These days, just a pinch.   Both. Fossil fuel companies get at least $550 in direct handouts each year, and very likely much more, but the price gets into the trillions when one adds the costs of health care, infrastructure and environmental damage. I don't know if this also includes the military costs of defending oil fields, transport routes and the like, but, if not, that would push the value of these subsidies still higher.    The article mentions a few, including Vitor Gaspar and Benedict Clements, head of the IMFs fiscal affairs department and one of its division heads, respectively.   How can hippy-crunchy Vermont be the most expensive?   About 5% of a gram.    It's a working paper, i.e. a preliminary report. However, it's already received public comments and support from several IMF leaders, so it's very definitely for real.   Yes, that is what a working paper is. However, this one has already been partially vetted by some of the IMF's fiscal affairs leaders, so it carries real weight.                The problem is that the older they get, the more often they vote.   Got a special election for your local school district replacement levy? They'll be there to kill it.  Time to vote on a new fire commissioner or local judge? They'll be there to ensure that he (and it will be a he) is a faithful Tea Party stalwart.    The rest of us sleep through these little contests and then wonder what happened.    I took it differently: as another example of how road funding is [a giant  subsidy for the trucking industry](http://truecostblog.com/2009/06/02/the-hidden-trucking-industry-subsidy/), as well as for the auto industry, rural residents and suburban sprawl.         Most fuel subsidies are price supports, exactly as you describe, and most are outside the U.S.. The rest are predominantly production subsidies.  Those are just the direct subsidies. Include *indirect* subsidies like health costs and climate damages, and, according to [this working paper from the IMF](http://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-estimates-trillions-in-hidden-fossil-fuel-costs-1431958586), annual fossil fuels subsidies top *$5 trillion*.   Right. I doubt that many of my graying host of Tea Party neighbors is going to tolerate anything like this degree of socialism as long as they can lift a pen to mark a ballot. The Age of Entitlement will have to await their passing.   Not coincidentally, we also heavily subsidize driving. Gas taxes now pay less than half the cost of roads, and the global oil industry gets around $500 billion in annual taxpayer handouts.          Not as many as are coming online. The [IEA forecast](http://mzconsultinginc.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/IEAWEONov2013a.png) is for nuclear generating stasis in the OECD but pronounced growth in the rest of the world.   And, just between you and I, the IEA is very wrong to think that coal consumption will continue growing as it did. The world will soon enough acknowledge that coal must go much sooner, and that gas systems release intolerable amounts of methane, so it's back to nuclear and renewables once again.   That was then. As you know, the numbers have been recently skewed by Japanese and German pullbacks. The world now has 435 operable civil nuclear power nuclear reactors, with a further 71 under construction. That will be quite a boost in capacity.   http://www.world-nuclear.org/Nuclear-Basics/Global-number-of-nuclear-reactors/         Nuclear [continues growing worldwide](http://www.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/UnderConstructionReactorsByCountry.aspx), but primarily in China, Russia and India. You're right about the US alone, however; nuclear is in a holding pattern here.  We can be sure that nuclear will soon accelerate again, however, because, as [these experts](http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/) correctly point out, we now have little choice but to pursue *both* renewables and nukes.       After all, where would *any* religion be without enemies of the faith to defend against?   Out of sight, out of mind! Much easier to dodge paying the true cost of fossil fuels, especially when that industry gives 90% of its political money to Republicans.      Much different in the States. Here, some drivers claim that bikes have no right to be on the road because they pay no gasoline tax. It's a shockingly common refrain--and completely wrong, due to the fact that less than half of road funds come from the gas tax (and the fact that nearly all American cyclists also drive).   All arguments against moral hazard go out the window when the major bank CEOs show up at Treasury, as in 2008, saying, "bail us out or suffer massive global depression that may lead to nuclear war".  The point is to better regulate banks so they can *never* back us into another corner like that again.   Minneapolis, Portland, San Francisco, Boulder...there are some decent bike towns popping up in the US now, but *none* even begin to approach the total commitment to bikes in cities like Copenhagen and Amsterdam, in my humble view.   "I don't care much about climate, but if you'll buy off my wealthy sponsors with gigantic tax cuts that benefit only them, while we shaft everyone else with a regressive carbon tax, then maybe we'll talk".     Truckers do *not* pay "trillions a year to operate on the roads". They pay about [$35 billion](http://truecostblog.com/2009/06/02/the-hidden-trucking-industry-subsidy/), or about a third of highway taxes, but because trucks cause more than 90% of road damage they effectively get a subsidy of more than $60 billion per year (as noted in the linked article).      It's much more localized than that, as Bishop and Cushing detail in *The Big Sort*. Over the past fifty years, Americans have moved increasingly to be among people like themselves: lefties in cities and righties in rural counties, with individual suburbs falling heavily one way or the other, so that now most US counties are political "landslide counties" where one party completely rules.   And, yes, that leads to violence: think of the attacks in Oklahoma City, Atlanta, Knoxville, Austin, Wichita, Spokane, Las Vegas, etc.. Notice that these places tend to be "border towns" where rural, right-wing extremists are in close proximity to small cities, which they assault whenever they see a hint of "tyranny" (a Federal office building, a Unitarian Church, a family planning clinic, a Martin Luther King Day parade, a Sikh temple, a liberal radio host, a couple of cops eating lunch...).  So one could say that we already have something of a low-grade civil war under way. We do indeed hate each other that much, sorry to say, and we've moved into opposing enclaves because of it.   The studies this article cites are merely a few of many, like [this one](http://www.uspirg.org/reports/usp/do-roads-pay-themselves), that show that tax money flows entirely the other way: from general funds to roads. Fuel taxes have never really paid for the roads alone. Forty years ago they paid *most* of the cost, but no longer. Now they pay less than half.    Add the fact that vastly more road damage comes from trucks, and it's clear that road maintenance is essentially a gigantic taxpayer handout to trucking companies. Then add the social cost of driving (carbon pollution, injuries, respiratory ailments, etc.) which is in the trillions, and we can see just how much road construction really costs us. Bikes, on the other hand, cause almost no road wear and they actually reduce health costs.    Another example of how Republicans and Democrats are no longer neighbors, but now citizens of two geographically separate countries.         Better TL;DR. (I'm not a bot.)  The 5 stages of climate denial:  Stage 1: Deny the problem exists  Stage 2: Deny were the cause  Stage 3: Deny its a problem  Stage 4: Deny we can solve it  Stage 5: Its too late   [The Harberger Model.](https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/367-gravellepdf)   Most fossil fuel subsidies have little to do with production cost: they are simply price subsidies to make oil cheap, or handouts to build more coal-fired generators, etc.. Nearly all are in developing countries with low living standards, where governments stay in control by showing their people that affordable driving and electric power are within reach.    Just as gay men did all over the Western world until a couple of decades ago.   Fair enough. However, if one wants to make sense of this, its seems to me that one has to look at both the rising share of women in the labor force *and* their rising income.   Stopped reading as soon as I saw that only US subsidies are mentioned. The authors undoubtedly know that the vast majority of fossil fuel subsidies are beyond the US, and that those foreign subsidies very effectively prop up American fossil fuel companies as well. No commodity is more global than fossil fuels.    Perceptions are not a useful test for reality.  I was just addressing Wumbotarian's question about the perceived value of employee benefits.   penetration rates have been declining for some time  And deductibles are not rising? Elective choices aren't shrinking? Let's face it: health insurance may be more costly, but it isn't adding extra value to compensation.   All these points are wrong; The value of retirement plans offered by employers is not declining...DB as proportion of plans offered has been stable for the last decade.  In 1979, [38 percent](http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v69n3/v69n3p1.html) of private sector employees in the United States had a Defined Benefit Pension Plan. By 2011, the number had dropped to 14 percent. That isn't a decline?  What makes 401's crap?  Oh, maybe the fact that they plainly aren't working, with only the well-off being able to save sufficiently? Or the fact that they shift market risk onto employees? Or that promised employer matches are vanishing, leaving employees even less able to save? Or how about the simple truth that 401(k) plans were sold to employees as *supplements* to pensions, but then turned out to be mere stalking horses for the killing of those pension plans? Or perhaps the plain fact that voluntary saving for retirement never has worked before, and probably never will? We now have tens of millions of workers headed for old age with almost nothing to sustain them. To call that a kick in the teeth is a vast understatement, but what would you call it?   [Day care has been] 7% of family income since the 70's.  [Wrong.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2014/04/08/rising-cost-of-child-care-may-help-explain-increase-in-stay-at-home-moms/)   The college premium has risen faster then the cost of college.  [Wrong again.](http://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-CU892_paydeb_G_20140515160642.jpg)  i'm not sure under what basis you can claim "many" folks are not better off.  See above.     Look at participation rates or labor force share: both show a rising trend over the period. Women definitely continued to enter the labor force in larger numbers well after 1980.   More importantly, women now [*make far more money*](http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/files/2013/12/SDT-gender-and-work-12-2013-0-03.png), which greatly amplifies the effect of their growing numbers in the workforce. That further disqualifies the use of overall household income as a point of comparison.  So why does the Booth School use such a bogus measure? Because it's the Booth School, of course. They have a conservative business agenda at stake. You're right: this *is* basic stuff.   The issue is the *shift* of the tax burden from corporate taxes, which are paid largely by shareholders, to carbon taxes that are paid mostly by consumers and which slam low income earners the hardest by far.   One can't argue to switching from a progressive corporate tax to a highly regressive carbon tax is anything but a dumping of overall tax burdens from the rich onto everyone else.  Also, let's just say that Econlib is not the least biased source for opinions.   Women's share of US workforce:   1972: 38%  2014: 47%   What's more, women have moved into [much higher income employment](http://dpeaflcio.org/professionals/professionals-in-the-workplace/women-in-the-professional-and-technical-labor-force/) than they used to occupy, further skewing household income as a point of comparison. As "Creamyturtle" says, this obscures the fact that wages have been stagnant and men have seen real wage declines.  This article is simply another Booth School attempt to paint a rather gloomy economic trend as sunny, in order to blame the victims and obscure the long trend towards inequality.   All I'm seeing in that graph is population growth and a fairly stable workforce/population ratio.  Look closer. The graph shows that most women were *not* in the workforce in 1970, yet most *are* in the workforce now, and the trend has only recently begun to level off. This isn't exactly news, is it?   [This](http://www.gallup.com/poll/1720/work-work-place.aspx) may provide some insights. Declining health and retirement benefits are the chief complaints among employees.   Yes, the employer's cost for health benefits is rising, but the perceived value to employees is *falling*: we all face higher deductibles, we're all being pushed into HMOs with fewer elective options, etc..  The retirement benefits picture is even worse. Defined benefit plans are vanishing altogether, being replaced with lousy 401(k) plans, and even the employer matches for those are disappearing.  Add the sky-high cost of daycare for children of working parents, and the skyrocketing cost of college for one's kids, and it's safe to say that many folks are *not* better off, no matter how much they may enjoy playing Angry Birds on their phones.   First, household income is a poor point of comparison due to the rise of two-income households over this period; this hides overall stagnation in wages, and declines among men. Median wages would be a better measure.  Second, inequality has gone through the roof, followed by the financial elite committing gigantic debt fraud and extorting massive taxpayer bailouts, which leaves most Americans feeling very, very screwed. Trends in perceived wealth and income *always* relate to the general sense of fairness in the system, which, it's fair to say, is now deep in the toilet.   Few surprises except Hawaii. If there is one place in America that should be bike friendly, that's it, but no...   Who the hell is upvoting this garbage? 'Fess up.   Most of the jobs are "indirect", meaning with suppliers, subcontractors, etc.. And that 22K probably doesn't include even broader spillover employment effects in nearby stores, restaurants, personal services, homebuilding, and so on.      From the article:   "In March, he released a new policy brief, "The Conservative Case for a Carbon Tax," which argues for a steadily rising "revenue-neutral" fee on fossil fuel producers. Aside from a small portion set aside to cushion low-income households, all the revenue would be devoted to reducing other taxes. Taylor has in mind a deal that would impose a carbon tax in exchange for the removal of other climate regulations, notably EPA carbon rules and state renewable energy mandates.  Taylor is one of several renegade Cato/Heartland regulars who have spent several years beating the drum for a carbon tax as a means to cut progressive taxes on the wealthy--mostly the corporate income tax--as well as to hobble the EPA.     Actually, it sounds like he's pushing for a carbon tax "in exchange for liberals agreeing to cut other corporate taxes and eliminate federal fuel standards and greenhouse-gas regulations".  Sure, Taylor's position is "cut corporate taxes and regulations and then we'll talk". Given that corporate ownership is heavily in the hands of the wealthy, this is a clear ploy to benefit those wealthy shareholders--who happen to keep Jerry Taylor in luxury. That's the *only* reason why Jerry is interested in cutting corporate taxes and regulations.   George Shultz is a much more worthy spokesman, precisely because he is *not* making his support of carbon taxation conditional on handouts to the wealthy at the expense of everyone else. Shultz advocates for fee-and-dividend while Taylor only wants tax and regulatory cuts for his rich sponsors. That is a very major difference.    Yes, but Taylor isn't arguing for a fee-and-dividend approach, which would counteract the regressivity of a sales tax on fuels. Instead, he would use the revenues to cut taxes on the wealthy, leaving lower and middle income people to shoulder more of the overall tax burden.  He isn't alone in this. A [growing number of conservatives](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/how-to-tax-carbon/) are beginning to see the need to price carbon as a chance to extort lucrative favors for their wealthy benefactors. Essentially, they've realized that they are losing the fight to ignore the climate mess, so now they are demanding payment for cooperation: "I'll support a carbon price, but only if you pay me while sticking it to everyone else".    And many of those students are [returning home after graduation](http://www.kauffman.org/newsroom/2012/07/foreign-national-students-in-us-plan-to-return-to-native-countries-post-graduation-kauffman-foundation-survey-shows).   Yes, and there are plenty of other conservative arguments for action: economic prosperity; personal accountability; protection of future political freedom; protection from high future taxes; stewardship of God's creation.  However, none of those seem to have been enough to move Jerry Taylor. Instead, it was the lure of shifting taxes onto the poor that drove him, because *that* will earn him a salary from conservative political sponsors. Ick.         "Would any member of the Bush family, whose ties to the fossil fuel industry resemble the mating embrace of the vampire squid, suddenly decide to kick that industry in the teeth by acknowledging the need to completely quit fossil fuels?"  Let me think...   Obama is expressly *not* targeting the mining of coal or tar sands. As the article says:  That paper, in particular, showed that the coal reserves in the Powder River basin in the West and the oil in Canadas tar sands had to be left largely untouched, and that there was no climate-friendly scenario in which any oil or gas could be drilled in the Arctic.  And yet Mr. Obama  acting on his own, since these are all executive actions requiring nothing from Congress  has opened huge swaths of the Powder River basin to new coal mining. Hes still studying whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, though the countrys leading climate scientists have all told him it would be a disaster. And now hes given Shell the green light [in the Arctic].  In other words, Obama caved in to the oilcos despite pleas from scientists to ban Arctic offshore drilling, completely contradicting his professed concern for the scientific consensus on climate, which says we have only a few precious decades to quit fossil fuels altogether.     I guess facts and progressives only go together when it ideologically suits you  Look who's talking. You misquoted cable stats, radio stats, newspaper stats. Your whole argument is merely a vague rage against "liberal media" when the fact is that only broadcast repetition really matters, and only rich conservative activists have the money to fund that. Face it: American media is now split between a beige, apolitical, old-school mainstream owned by giant corporations, and rabidly conservative propaganda channels run by activist billionaires and *their* giant corporations. The consequence is hatred now so intense that conservatives are bombing Federal buildings and Martin Luther King Day parades, assassinating liberal media figures, gunning down liberal church congregations, killing cops, and shooting up immigrant community centers, Jewish museums and medical clinics. All while calling themselves "patriots".     The most expensive part of running a business is personnel.  No longer. Each new industry seems to employ fewer than the last. Facebook is worth nearly as much as Walmart, yet it employs only 10,000 against Walmart's 2.2 million. When Facebook purchased Instagram for $1 billion last year, it got a thriving business with all of 12 employees plus the founder. That's the new world we're in.    First, the vast majority of Americans get their TV through cable  The "vast majority"? No, just [slightly more than half](http://www.tvnewscheck.com/article/47812/cable-penetration-hits-21year-low).  Second, CNBC has several liberal commentators.  Heh. As fiercely liberal as Santelli and Kudlow are stridently conservative? Are you sure you want to go there?   you completely ignored, ABC, CBS, NBC, and PBS.  No, I simply pointed out that none of those have a dedicated political following as Fox does. And, for all the conservative crap about whether Scott Pelley or Ann Curry is more likely to raise a left eyebrow while delivering a conservative political story, it's just that: crap.  Yeah, liberals watch PBS, but not often for politics: its big shows are Downton Abbey, Nova, Sesame Street, Ken Burns docs and--saints preserve us--Celtic Fire. Its news is radically vanilla. Moyers is the only show I can think of that's truly leftist, and he gets just a single late hour a week (if that; many affiliates refuse to air him). Most importantly, the PBS audience is small, ranking well behind all commercial networks, including Fox. Only Fox is all politics, all the time, all over the place, and all from one heavily slanted point of view.   just about every major newspaper, and thus their online newspaper as well, is biased to the left.  You must not be familiar with the Chicago Tribune, The Wall Street Journal or many of the other conservative rags that populate the US landscape (yet in shrinking numbers, like liberal papers, because, as I say, newspapers no longer count for much).   And radio? It's huge and growing, and the whole medium is incredibly, one-sidedly political. It's also an especially popular medium in the rural and suburban areas where more conservatives live, and among heavy drivers, which conservatives tend to be. In my town we have no less than five rabidly, hatefully conservative stations without a single voice from the other side, and that's rather typical.   Yes, it is. Particularly if you are enjoying a tax break that others are not.      Nope, "Funky Groove" is pretty accurate in hard numbers terms. Those unbothered by rising inequality are overwhelmingly conservative, and conservatives have been steadily inflamed since the legalization of one-sided political television and radio networks after the 1987 shredding of the FCC fairness Doctrine. Yes, this allowed the rise of a few weak, underfunded liberal counterparts like MSNBC, but they lack anything close to the money and reach of News Corp ($67 billion market cap) or Clear Channel ($4 billion). For example, MSNBC features only 8 hours of political programming daily while Fox News's is 24/7; MSNBC is available only on cable while Fox News is both cable and broadcast; MSNBC is available on only some cable systems while Fox News is on nearly all; MSNBC is difficult to find beyond the US while Fox News is global; MSNBC's parent corporation, Comcast, also owns stridently conservative CNBC (Santelli, Kudlow, etc.) while Fox News's parent corporation is Rupert Murdoch's personal, conservative crusade. And so on. It's not too much to say that the United States is now ripped in two, with a third of Americans (older, Christian, rural/suburban) making right-wing political venom the primary ingredient in their media diet while the rest of the country more or less ignores politics.       In other words, this conservative fellow Taylor denied climate science completely until he saw it as an opportunity to shift still more taxes from the rich onto everyone else. Now he's a believer. Scumbag.   Mooney is usually right on target, but this article leaves out a critical fact: elevated CO2 [benefits wheat](https://books.google.com/books?id=LUSC9lT5Q8IC pg=PA524 lpg=PA524 dq=co2+to+raise+wheat+yield source=bl ots=k-Dtrrx1pz sig=EyHR793ByERIgOkIIxERxxC2WMI hl=en sa=X ei=WSpSVbX2JILpsAXd_oCoBg ved=0CEYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage q=co2%20to%20raise%20wheat%20yield f=false) more than most crops. More heat and drought will certainly counteract this in hotter, drier wheat regions, but not in cooler ones. In other words, wheat farmers have much to fear in Texas but cause to celebrate in Washington State.      The better question: when are we going to notice that every national scientific academy on Earth now says we must leave half of present oil reserves forever unburned?         The other 36% was too busy voting.   Or, roughly the same share as thirty years ago.   Screenplays have taken over the niche. Television has replaced magazines as the dominant mass story medium, and writers who can create vivid, short-form tales have followed. If they're lucky, they make it into movies, although all too often posthumously (looking at you in the ground, Raymond Carver and Phillip K. Dick).               Smile and ignore the [fugitive methane emissions](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/05/08/3656343/fugitive-methane-on-the-loose-on-public-lands/).      Welcome to a vicious cycle: technology creates inequality; which raises the share of low-wage, low-skill jobs; which are most likely to be replaced by technology.            Your first questions you can easily answer with a few searches, so I'll attempt to tackle the last.   How long will global warming continue if we stop carbon pollution today? The answer is generally [a few centuries](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2005/03/how-long-will-global-warming-last/), but no one really knows because we don't fully understand the role of feedbacks that may continue to release carbon from natural stores like forests, peatlands, tundra and seafloor methane hydrates. Based on paleoclimate data, there appear to be tipping points at which these feedbacks could even accelerate warming into a runaway excursion that may take millennia to subside, but, again, we don't know where those tipping points are, hence the global agreement that 2C warming is the most we can reasonably, somewhat safely tolerate (and many leading lights warn even that is too risky).      The researchers aren't saying that solar is the only solution, but merely an important one.   No, there are ample reasons for Oz's high prices beyond minimum wages. From the viewpoint of a fond visitor to your topless shores, you get the best of both worlds: high economic growth plus a distinct lack of despondency and desperation.   Beer is cheaper in the States as well, thank God. Still, the median Australian wage is far higher than the American, and your high minimum wage must have at least a little to do with that.     Visit museums, and spring for a guided or audio tour. Nearly every country has a good museum or two that showcases its ancient art, culture and history. You won't get the whole story, but you'll gain some understanding of the area's roots.                  Vote. And organize to overcome the political power of global fossil fuel money. Individual changes among rich-country citizens in energy use, meat consumption and reproduction are valuable, but they don't begin to  substitute for the force of law to reduce and then ban fossil fuels worldwide, which is what every national scientific academy on Earth says we must do within our lifetime.    Sez the Senator from Big Oil, whose snowball melted.       they just care more about having a new car.

Here is text:  Even as oil rallies back above $60 a barrel, obituaries are being drafted. Oil majors face questions from shareholders concerned the threat of climate change means some of the reserves underpinning the companies will never be produced. In a recent report, HSBC urged investors to plan for this risk of stranded assets.  The risk is realand doesnt just boil down to efforts to curb climate change.  One warning: Saudi Arabias decision to keep pumping despite the drop in oil prices. Apart from taking market share back from higher-cost rivals, the countrys oil minister has indicated concern about long-term demand in the face of technological and regulatory threats.  Almost 1,400 climate policies had been enacted globally by 2013, according to the International Energy Agency, up from less than 200 in 2005. Meanwhile, although electric vehicles remain a tiny part of the global car market, they have grown phenomenally from virtually zero only five years ago.  One argument against such concerns is that oil-company valuations largely reflect the value of proven oil-and-gas reserves, likely to be produced before any serious disruptions happen.  Such thinking only holds, though, if you assume future cash flows will be distributed rather than reinvested. That is plainly not the industrys way. In the past decade, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron collectively reinvested 66% of operating cash flow, according to data from S P Capital IQ; buybacks and dividends equated to just 46%. Reporting first-quarter numbers last week, Exxon and Shell barely covered capital expenditure with cash from operations while Chevrons free cash flow was sharply negative.  In addition, more than half the last decades capital expenditure was spent post-2010. While producers test project economics under different scenarios, much of that investment was made at a time of triple-digit prices and the sector was clearly blindsided by oils collapse.  The dynamics of this drop, coming amid a massive investment boom, bring the threat of stranded assets much closer to today. Surveying 37 large oil companies, Citigroup estimates as much as 40% of the current investment cycleabout $1.4 trillionmay have gone into or be going into projects that struggle to generate acceptable returns at oil prices below $75 a barrel. Oil sands and liquefied natural gas projectswhich require large upfront investments and long schedules before generating positive cash flowslook especially exposed. Right now, Brent crude futures for the next five years average about $74 a barrel.  Ultimately, the mismatch between those prices and project economics set up another cycle of investment falling, supply tightening, and prices rising again. But in this cycle, there are two added risks.  First, the shale boom, which helped generate the excess supply weighing on prices today, represents a deflationary force. Productivity gains have reduced break-even prices for U.S. oil output, making some shale basins more competitive than traditional sources such as the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Russia. And the recent rally on signs of U.S. production flattening out also enables exploration and production firms to finance future drilling.  Second, Saudi Arabias decision to prioritize market share is also deflationary. If Riyadh is genuinely worried about increasing regulatory and technological curbs on long-term oil demand, it has an incentive to keep pumping at high rates. Cheaper oil helps to deter or delay efforts to limit consumption. More important, if you produce a commodity and suspect its days may be numbered, then it is far better to get as much out of the ground now rather than wait.  This is the dilemma in which Big Oil finds itself. Having sunk billions into the ground in recent years, several majors are banking on a rebound to triple-digit oil soon. Such an outcome would offer relief initially. But it would also enable rival supply from shale producers with much shorter production cycles and spur greater efforts to make Saudi Arabias deepest fear a reality. Oil demand doesnt have to disappear altogether to leave a producer with stranded assets; they can just be sitting on uncompetitive ones.                  Big Oils Disruptive Climate Change: Oil majors face a real risk of stranded assetsand not just related to efforts to limit carbon emissions.  By LIAM DENNING May 6, 2015 1:48 p.m. ET  Even as oil rallies back above $60 a barrel, obituaries are being drafted.

Naomi Oreskes nails it again.   Or automation's owners could just cut rich-country consumers out of the economic loop, selling to the rising middle class in more populous poor countries instead, while fomenting bitter political divisiveness among rich-country voters in order to neutralize their ability to interfere.         The difference would be that no one is *paid* to espouse atheism, but every one of these whores depends on the fossil fuel industry to keep them in office.            Wha...? The last time atmospheric CO2 exceeded 1000 ppm, 56 million years ago during the [Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaleoceneEocene_Thermal_Maximum), the climate cooked by 6C and species changed dramatically, including a mass extinction in the oceans. Sea levels rose hundreds of feet, the oceans turned acidic and semi-putrid, storms were horrendous. And that was during a warming that occurred over tens of thousands of years, when life had time to adapt. Today, we are on our way to reproducing these effects many, many times faster.               [Extremely unlikely.](http://www.epa.gov/climatestudents/documents/temp-and-co2.pdf) (See table on p.8.)    There are many degrees and related jobs that don't make enough money to warrant spending 10's of thousands or even $100k on a degree. That's why we've seen so many stories of Liberal Arts degreed people ending up working in low paying jobs  Agreed, a diploma is no guarantee of a career, but most smart young Americans of middling means reasonably see their choices as: A) A costly degree that *probably* leads to a good job and social status; B) Military service that *certainly* means personal debasement, physical hardship and celebration of violence, or C) A long struggle in limbo as a low-wage earner trying to train for something--anything--better. Given that choice, should we be surprised that most at least try to choose Option A?    We've beating it into people that you need to go to college to make a decent living.   In the US, one *does* need to go to college to make a decent living. That's the driver here. The cry for public assistance follows. I admit, it's a chicken-or-egg problem, but the root cause has to be the undeniable *need* for a diploma to get most middle class jobs now.   Trade schools and apprenticeships are good too.  Rarely. The US lacks three things that other nations depend upon to educate most workers: 1) Free, high-quality, universal trade schooling that begins in high school and continues beyond; 2) A dependable track to employment for trade school grads; 3) Job security and benefits for skilled labor.  For all intents and purposes, the US military is the nation's technical school, but it's a poor one, never mind the outrageous inequity of telling the poorer half of young people to go dodge IEDs in occupied countries if they ever want a decent job.                     Great comments from others here. I'll just add that I think it unlikely that future tax changes are much of a threat. Installing more solar is a state, national and global priority that will only grow stronger, and California has a huge number of existing solar customers who won't stand for being reamed.         Nothing new here. Let's face it: religion itself has been the leading cause of tribalism and violence since humans emerged from Africa, exterminating long-established populations of Neanderthals, Denisovans and likely other near-human strains across Eurasia. Every effort to move beyond that bloody history runs into yet another backward band of tribal, religious agitators.               That's because the political party that's been running the country for most of the past forty years--the Republicans--may as well call themselves the "Cheap Gasoline Party". It's part of how they buy the loyalty of their rural/suburban base.    NYC may be the greenest central city, but it actually ranks number four among American metro areas for lowest per capita carbon emissions, although metrics are tricky, as [this list](http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0530-footprint.html) shows.   Not surprising to see Honolulu number one, due to its density as well as its low needs for heating and cooling buildings.    I generally go with the experts on issues with cost/benefit analyses this complicated, and [here](http://thebreakthrough.org/index.php/programs/energy-and-climate/top-climate-scientists-urge-support-of-nuclear-power) is what many of the world's leading climate scientists are saying: we cannot dependably solve the climate mess fast enough without nuclear power as part of the solution.   Paywalled    My wife's employer organized bike-to-work-day rides from several areas surrounding their suburban campus. Groups would form for each neighborhood/area and ride in together. Very popular.          Meanwhile, the quarter of US Congress members who are Catholic appear likely to listen to [fossil fuel industry money instead](http://insideclimatenews.org/news/01052015/pope-francis-unlikely-sway-catholic-republicans-climate-change).            If there's any doubt about why the world's richest, most-polluting folk are indifferent, look at the list of Climate Vulnerable Forum members: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Barbados, Bhutan, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Kiribati, Madagascar, Maldives, Nepal, Philippines, Rwanda, Saint Lucia, Tanzania, Timor-Leste, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Vietnam.            [So is this.](http://grist.org/climate-energy/these-teens-are-taking-their-climate-lawsuit-all-the-way-to-the-supreme-court/) And, better yet, [this](http://web.law.columbia.edu/climate-change/resources/us-climate-change-litigation-chart).   Think of it this way instead: 80% of Americans are not hardcore climate deniers, and at least occasionally listen to reason. If you had told me twenty years ago that the US would now have a black president, with most states legalizing gay marriage and several legalizing weed, I would have called you crazy, yet here we are.   And this is what makes arguing with an entrenched cynic like *you* pointless. Even your example table shows the nat gas share of generation slumping over the next two decades while renewables increase. This is from the highly conservative, fossil fueled EIA.  As for their longer-term contention that fossil fuel use--especially coal--will remain steady into midcentury, fuggedaboudit. Climate reality is biting us all, even the carbon bureaucrats at the EIA.    A country? Four countries, actually. Some would say five or six.   In other news, Republican politicians are [nine times](http://grist.org/politics/heres-why-the-gop-just-loves-fossil-fuels/) *more* likely to accept campaign money from fossil fuel companies.    I discovered a wonderful cure for that feeling: fight the fuckers. The more they hurt, the better I feel.   Very old news.  Still, I can hardly wait until they repeal the law of gravity so I can finally get my flying car.   "Coal and natural gas (both fossil fuels) are just as important in power generation in 2015 as they ever have been"  [Check again.](http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/steo/images/Fig25.png) Coal has fallen from 55% of total US generation to 36% today, and it's now dropping faster. Gas picked up most of the slack, but its share is forecast by the EIA to begin dropping now as renewables take up more of the total. Nuclear's share will grow soon after.  One needn't be a starry-eyed idealist to realize that when the entire world scientific community unites to warn that all fossil fuel burning must end within our lifetimes, that inevitably means trouble for fossil fuel companies.    Again, the point is not that solar and wind are wonderful investments but that coal is death itself. If you had invested in BTU, the largest US coal supplier, four years ago and held on, you would have lost roughly 90% of that money, including a 4.65% collapse today.    And where did those four chains come from? From underdog status, of course.   This reminds me of those who said the US grocery market would soon be a Walmart monopsony. Didn't turn out that way at all.    Because shorting is a matter of choosing a narrow window of time, and fossil fuel prices will continue to wildly fluctuate while trending downward. Pick the wrong time period and you're screwed.  The MSCI and Aperio studies merely show that a slight but steady delta is opening, suggesting that just generally avoiding fossil fuel companies is profitable in itself, not to mention more morally conscionable.    Okay, but how many Americans actually *view* climate as a moral issue? How many Republicans do?    Air leakage is a biggie. Energy loss through windows, doors and roofs is another. Both are easily measured. Pressure tests can quantify air leakage, while heat imaging can pinpoint energy loss trouble points.   Any firm that does building energy audits should be able to handle this.     They'll be the ones buying up renewable firms/developing their own renewables once it becomes profitable to do so.   The few oilcos that tried diversifying into renewable energy have all backed away, often after locking up patents that could threaten their core business.   Coal is now a dead man walking, and oil is next. That doesn't mean that overweighting solar is smart; it merely means that staying with fossil fuels is stupid (not to mention destructive).   It's all good. Very sound and solid.    Do you realize how many older investors in this sub *wish* they could have had $10-20K to invest in stocks at age 25? Don't wait.   Also, don't forget foreign indexes. Be bold with 20% of your money, putting it into a hot sector fund that backs useful, growing industries (biotech, renewable energy, internet, etc.). If you can, avoid fossil fuels; they are a drag on the wider indexes, and will only become more so.  	200
 It's absolutely incredible out here. We're on a big road trip, and we found ourselves adding a lot of days here just to take in all the sights and trails. We leave for Breckinridge tomorrow.

 Ha I'm a victim of that I'm afraid. I was at a job making 40k but I was capped at 40 hours a week, no nights, no weekends. Then I got job for 50k which I jumped at...but which also had nights/weekends/and 50+ hour weeks.   Overall quality of life outranks salary by far.   The Benny Hill theme should be playing in the background...   Like look at Liv Tyler and then Steven Tyler...she's hot and he's a goblin.    Man that was a whole other level of war.    As a fan of cyberpunk and cats, I'm loving this picture.    I don't have to sleep much...like 4-5 hours and I'm good to go. I'd say a good chunk of my success in life has been because I'm always up at the crack of dawn.  Coins: I'm shorter...face nothing to write home about.   Any idea if this affects the reserve opportunities at all?    Those guys will come in handy when you have to go through the Mines of Moria.    That's the best thing I've read on here in a while.

Totally agree. I work for a consulting firm and we see this problem a lot in the private sector too. Companies take their best computer programmer, who loves what he does, and say "Hey this guy needs to be a manager!" Then they promote him to a job he hates and force him to deal with paperwork and HR issues instead of programming.   If you have great technicians, reward them for being great technicians, don't try to wedge them into a role they don't want or aren't good at.    That explains why their insignia goes back to being gold like a 2LT...   That is actually pretty helpful, thanks.    Most of the places I've been to don't have a min, unless it's a really small independent store. Even then I can just use a debit card.    I was about to say the same thing. Here in the US the only time I ever have actual cash is if I'm going to a farmer's market. Other than that, everything I buy is on plastic.    100% agree.   100% agree   I'll admit it, I'm kind of jealous...    Not exactly the same, but there was a Time article a while back (that I can't seem to find now) about therapists specifically hired by the CIA for their staff, since they would rather have them working with cleared staff employed by the Agency than private providers.   It was pretty interesting, a lot of issues unique to that community like constantly obsessing over security details, like a guy who would drive all the way home and then worry "Did I lock my safe? Did I log out of my computer?"  and then drive all the way back just to make sure he did.    Ha I was thinking the same thing about Sudan and the DBDU.   Well Moldova is fucked if that happens.   It might be cool to get him a marlinspike pocketknife engraved with his name. That would be something he could carry throughout his career.   Or video games. All guys love video games.    The only Coastie to win the Medal of Honor, Douglas Munro, did so helping to evacuate Marines during Guadalcanal. One of the men who was evacuated was Chesty Puller, one of the most decorated Marines in history.    Wow that was really interesting, thanks for posting.    100% agree. Can you imagine playing through that world like it was Skyrim?    Ha I'm having the same dilemma...I really just want it for P5. I guess it's a bonus that I can play some other awesome games too...I plan on trolling ebay/Craigslist/Garage sales to pick up as PS3 right before P5 comes out.    wow, awesome   Wow, so pretty   Really in-depth relationships. Not just "oh I maxed out this social link, time to ignore this girl and find another"   Congrats fellow American!    Reminds me of Quint from Jaws.    Crazy that videos from these events are now released in almost real-time.    I lived in Chongqing for about 6 months and then in Beijing for a short while a few years later. I think there are definitely a lot of cool elements that you can find around the country, with as big as it is. My biggest impression was that growth and change are so fast that you'll see brand new buildings built right in the midst of old hutongs and a mix of old and new everywhere.  So it ends up being pretty cool to eat noodles from a street vendor cooked over a little charcoal stove, and then walk across the street to a neon-lit club blasting techno and k-pop.   I'd definitely recommend it, but you may want to visit first or study there before taking the plunge and actually moving there for work.    Woo, Tifa FTW!

That pilot must be pretty badass to stick a landing like that.   Wow, cute!   Totally agree. France was quick to "officially" chide Russia for the Crimea invasion, but "oh, they still want to buy warships from us? No problem!"   Very true. It happened before with Korean Air Lines 007 which was shot down by a Soviet MiG. The pilot even said he could tell it was a Boeing 747 but just said 'fuck it' and shot it down anyway.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Air_Lines_Flight_007    jesus, that shock wave...

I had a friend who liked the book "Hornets Over Kuwait" but I never read it, so I can't really comment. I think it's more about the author's experiences rather than a larger overview of the war though.     Dude that's really awesome.   Wow that's really great to see. Thanks for posting!

Cheap, lightweight, and comfy. I don't really recommend one brand over another, I usually just look for whats on sale and have gotten some great Nike or Adidas on clearance.    One thing I would recommend is getting a pair that's reversible. I've got an awesome black/white pair that looks totally different when I flip them, so its essentially 2 shorts in one.   Ha, maybe it wasn't as dire as initial media reports led me to believe...I can't even remember the last time I played badminton :)   100% agree. I actually kind of liked the idea of assuming I was just playing as the main character, and having to work with my allies in battle. It made a seem a bit more "real" if that makes sense.    	68

    For instance, my geology course clashes with my reshapping environments class so, I need to make changes?   *GHOOOSTT CALLLOORRRIIEESSSS~~~ OOOO*      Should I be using a laptop or my pen and paper? What are the pros and cons of each?       Haha, my college has around 40-50k students which I find baffling! I was in a school with around ~150 students prior and to be thrown into a school with 50,000 students just boggles my mind. I'll definitely be joining cubs but if i'm entering mid-year, will I be at a disadvantage? Will social clicks be formed already?          I've been playing for a month and have 100...   Really want to take Mapping but i've heard only negative things about the lecturer so far :(      Hey! Ex-Foundie here! Don't worry about the first maths exam, it only counts for like what, 25% of the overall grade? You should definitely focus on getting a better score on the other test which is going to count for ~70% so it can definitely pull your grades up.  Also, try to focus on other subjects! Economics especially starts to get significantly more difficult later on when you are introduced to SAQS/LAQS which makes the first MCQ exam seem like a joke. Other subjects like HOI and Lit/Drama are really easy to score in if you follow the guidelines and ask teachers for help and participate (very important, it accounts for grades) in your classes. All in all, just relax and work harder! Good luck. PM me if you have any other questions.   Finally, while it's awesome to respect your parents wishes and dreams (and I totally respect that and can relate) you should also come to realise that College is a time when you realize that at the end of the day it's YOUR life. Not your dad's, mum's or whatever but YOURS. So think carefully about what you want to really do. It may feel nice to honor your parents wishes in the short run, but after you've graduated it would really suck to be filled with regrets.       Let's just hope that in the future the professor - who's probably backed by the dept.- doesn't start going against you and intentionally gives you unfair treatment in tests and assignments that would mess up your grade.   How about constructing environments?      Pretty sure it'd dead already      If it's the building next to a church then yes! :)   Melbourne Central sorry!

 That spot is apparently really popular now, thanks to the movie.   I don't think I have ever watched a chiller movie. The dry humor of the narrator fits perfectly. You get to experience other cultures and locations around the world. I just think the movie should be studied as how to make something laid back. The music, the people, the story, The Endless Summer.   Enough Said. Just go watch it and wind down.   It's gonna be a good Tuesday.   All I see is hate and anger towards the dialogue,but there must be some light for these films.    	4
 I got all my nephews their first piggy (coin) banks for their first bitthdays.  Each one I got at things remembered and had their name and birthday engraved on it with "from (my real name)" on it   Extra gym class.  Detention as a kid was usually some hard core punishment in gym after school.  Now, in my 30's, gym time is time to zone out and improve myself, accomplish something and feel like a badass.   Excellent, thank you   Does anyone know of any clinics that offer immunizations and testing at a low cost.  I know low is a relative and undefined term.  I have no health insurance and am applying to EMT school and need to have a TB test, tetanus (TDaP), two vericella vaccinations, Hepatitis B, Flu and Menigitis.  Anyone know of the best options to have these done?   I was going to join in, but I think this thread is dying.  Time to jump ship on all these puns.   Y'all my car is slowing down! I must be out of.... carburetor or something.   I live in the U.S.A.  I'd have to say ours is Ground Hogs Day.  The commissioner of the ceremony dresses as if it's the early 1900's and places a ground hog (large friendly rodent) in the tree stump.  When he pops out, his reaction to his shadow determines whether or not we continue to have winter or move onto spring.   What day does your country celebrate and what do you do on that day, that really, to an outsider, would seem completely absurd?      He was so damn fast I had to rewatch it      I'm sorry, but your authority is not recognized in Fort Kickass  FTFY   Me Too!   I'd she were a president she'd be Baberham Lincoln   Or his series of children's books   Normally I'm very opposed to government over reach, but... ya know   Watched it on demand, Mike delivering a lightening fast throat punch was the best thing I've seen on TV this week   At least he would have gotten the Nobel prize for something   Your right *tear* sometimes dreams are all you have   Burn the house down and GTFO   Something happen with my dvr.  Not sure what, cable may have cut out.  During the commercial breaks it skips from when Chuck calls HHM to the scene with Mike actually running the protection job.  I never noticed the skip since I fast forward through commercials.   In The words of Bam Margera Fuuuuuuuuuuuunck this   I'm a little sleep deprived and have had 3 drinks on an empty stomach to Fall asleep.  I know it's probably bull shit, but I'm not thinking straight   Please dear God let this be.  If this is a April fools joke or satire site I'll kick somebody's ass I tell you what.   Howdy   Sure, go ahead and set up a profile, send me the link to it in a pm and I'd be glad to give as much feedback as you need   I don't know how your approaching online dating, the site your using, or anything else about what your doing.  So flying blind, here are some tips. 1) Take your time but be confident.  Forcing a meet up too soon seems aggressive. 2) Avoid talking about sexual topics before the second or third date, also seems aggressive. 3) avoid using snapchat and the like for anything until after a few dates.  You basically want your prospect to feel comfortable with you while still being confident to actually make it too and past the first date.  It's kind of a balancing act between social pace setting and taking the lead.   Reached this time on demand.  I don't know if it was a glitch, but my dvr missed the entire second act.  It also missed the scene at HHM where Jimmy is offered the deal.  Everything makes so much more sense, glad I rewatched.   I dont know, don't really care, got the info I needed   S1E9?   Okay, I'm thoroughly confused.  I saw the teaser last week which included shots of the parking garage scene and I've seen people post screen shots or stills from that scene on this sub?  I watched the episode and fast forwarded through  it twice and never saw it.  Wtf is going on   Seriiusly, wtf, how did I miss this whole scene, is it in the pimento episode?   Agreed, documentaries are for education, films are for entertainment   Agreed.  The special effects were entartaining for the first half of the film, then that wore off.  The effects remained good, but that's not enough to hold my attention.  The movie should have been called "Oh Shit Oh Shit Oh Shit"  or "Everything that could ever possibly gone wrong.... in space"  the movie itself wasn't horrible, but not worth they hype it got.   No, stay!   I know this is probably an unpopular opinion on reddit, but I think James Franco and Seth Rogan are starting to slip.  I really felt that was the weakest of all their films and a little too predictable.  The jokes are starting to just run from movie to movie.  Rogan started out great with all his other films, but unless they spend a little more time writing and a little less rushing movies, they won't turn it around.    So do I assume the parking garage scene will probably been in next week's episode?   I'm seriously confused.  I saw the parking garage scene teased last week in "scenes from next week's episode" and I never saw this parking garage scene where someone pulls a gun on Mike.  Also the descriptor write by the cable company says "Mike's ability to complete a job is questioned."  What the hell am I missing?   My physical trainer had me do something like that.  The laws of physics were a little tougher on me.   ...really?   Bowser.  He's a 8 foot tall, spike shelled fire breathing dinosaur that commands his own army with a pension for kidnapping.  Not to mention a 10 foot vertical leap.  No good comes of that.   That's just realy depressing   Agreed, shorter and lighter pipes would make a big difference   I recognized the low end set up.  My first bike was an 04 ACE   What's the up and out on the frame.  Also, does the design obstruct your view, how do you see around your tank?   Honda shadow?   Too many sexual partners (one of them left me stunned and speachless with her number)  willing to do sexual things first date.  The other texted me dirty photos unprovoked the night before our first date to "get me ready"   If you're not really going to post a real question here, just don't post   If you can follow directions, Steak au Puave.  Why, got a date tonight?   I am and I have.  I was on it years ago.  Oddly enough, the trashiest girls I ever met while dating online were from catholicmatch.com.  I'm not saying they all are/were, just 2 of the trashiest I've been on dates with were from that site and said yes to 7 of 7 ideologies (including contraception and premarital sex)   It's shorthand for "redditor for redditor"  it's essentially a personal ad.  There is one for all of reddit.  I know some major cities (mine for sure) has one for their cities.   And if not why don't we.  The structure would be to connect and promote safe dating for catholic redditors.   You mean gloves like these right here?   What color is it?  Black?   I can actually hear you getting harder   I really think we need to reconsider bringing back the "phrasing" thing, guys.   There's not enough liquor and therapy in the world to erase this.   Did you ever think that when Bugs Bunny dressed up like a girl Bunny that he was kind of hot?  Me neither.   I really wish there were more unique HD'S on here like this one   Ew, this coke has gone bad.   Oh, thanks   Naw man, you just tell her the reservation or event is earlier than it actually is.  For example, if you have a table booked for 8:00pm on a friday, you just tell her the reservation is at 6:30..... on Thursday.   I do was with conditioner about every other day and cut back to washing hair with shampoo once a week.  Was cinitioning the beard with the same frequency.  What exactly do you mean by CO-washing?   Well I think it's gotten better. I think towards the beginning of cougar town she went overboard on the facelifts, her skin was frighteningly tight and unnatural.  I've seen her recently and she looking great.  True she's not the perky fox she once was, I'm just more for a more natural graceful aging, such as stated above with Jennifer Aniston   I've been there, I've worked for him.  As far as sexual harassment, yeah, it happen.  And I can speak for the fact that the ownership did  know right from wrong.   And maybe not sexually harass employees, practice illegal payroll policies, not steal from investors. You know, maybe not making bad desicions that get you in legal trouble in the first place.   I was really hoping for a topochico episode myself   I feel weird saying this, and I don't really know why, but, agreed.  She is holding together pretty well for someone her age   Not gonna lie, hope this makes a comeback   You're not trying to day that BB fans were over analyzing things... are you?  That's a stretch.   The increasing number of obvious face lifts.  It was most obvious at the end of friends and the first few seasons of cougar town.  She's let up since.   Your grandma is Dolly Parton?   No but I'll ask for one at work and see what they have (I work at a whole foods)   Well Chris Jones left and moved onto new horizons and kitchens a while ago, so did Ben Roche.  Richie is now the principle leadership.  I don't know if he will stay or not.  Cases like this, many times the principle leadership is promoted and offered a chance to buy into a piece of ownership.  If this is the case I think Richie would be a great fit and it would be an exceptional opportunity for him.   Do you ever rep up near Dallas or stick to central/south Texas?   What brand of shampoo do you use.  I use the main and tail conditioner but every shampoo I've tried strips it dry   You're in the wrong neighborhood   I interned in the kitchen and worked as a server there in 2010 and 2011.  At that level of restaurant the executive chef owner many times (as in this case) is a public figure head who is rarely in the kitchen.  The day to day leadership when I was there was Chris Jones, and Richie Farina.  Cantu spends most of his time working on other ventures.

We are a state of people who in our history fought our own war for independence, then survived tough years until we were accepted as a state.  Hell or high water (and given the climate here were see both frequently) no one's taking that from us.    I also feel sorry for anyone who invades Michigan or Illinois.  It would be the equivalent of invading Russia in the winter, there's no success their.

From being in the service industry and bartending for so long, people who are generally thankful, gracious, and just nice to complete strangers   CD anti theft protection?   Simply enough, it's a selfish response knowing you will never interact with that person ever again.  I've felt it.  You just know you're never going to see or speak to that person ever again after spending so much time building a relationship   There is a lot of warning signs people can look out for.  Whether you are looking for yourself or someone else  they can be spotted by knowing the list and being a little self aware.  In my case I noticed it when I was choosing to always stay home, sometimes in bed, instead of accepting my friends invitations to go out.  Staying in and solitude can be beneficial, but I was turning down every invitation so I could be alone.  Search signs of depression and you can find a list, just keep in mind what sources are credible and which arent.   I don't know of any science or studies behind it, but I've noticed the same thing.   The only explication I can come muster is the more people, and more good times equals up to more distractions from just drinking.  If you focus on drinking you notice how tired or buzzed you are.  The bigger the party, the more you are focused on having fun.

 I'm from a bygone era, so I suppose it was appropriate.  I do have have nice posture, though.   I'm not sure, but I've never seen it.

My grandfather liked a particular story about when my dad was dating my mom.  My dad would sometimes walk to their house to see her and hang out or help my granddad around their place, just do whatever came up.  They lived down a long, dirt road with tall pine trees on both sides and they could see him coming.  One day my mom was sitting on the porch watching him walk towards the house, when my granddad burst out of the screen door with a gun, yelled for my mom to get inside, scaring her to death.  She saw my dad, then the gun, and started yelling, "No, daddy, no!" because she thought he was going to shoot him.  Grandad pushed her inside while holding the door open, when all of a sudden my dad started running as fast his legs could carry him.  He raced onto the porch just as the gun went off, but turned his head just in time to see the big black panther stumble behind him.  Grandad saved my dad from the jaws and claws of death.   Because I pay my internet bill?  Variety is the spice of life.   I'm one of those weird people that likes working on Black Friday.  I always volunteer to work and pocket some extra money because of it.  Not a single one of my coworkers opted out of working that day because we schedule time with family around our work hours.  My community benefits economically from the holiday season, as I'm sure most due.  It's crazy to make a big deal about this and blame the retailers for somehow being unjust to employees just because it's a holiday.  We work all the other holidays too.  Not everyone works in an office Monday-Friday.    The absolute best decision I've ever made that I'll never regret or second-guess was to have children.   Nothing else, just football.

Older retirees will still have bills to pay, so no they won't.  They'll stay in their jobs until they die just to be able to live.  Utility bills and rent won't go down just because of Obamacare.

Did your girlfriend dump you, is that why you're so angry at women?  Or is it because you can't seem to keep the attention of one?  No?  Did mommy treat you mean so you've decided to do the same?

Some people, I'm sure you know some, feel the need to be right and on-topic 100% of the time.  Their opinion is always more highly valued than those of anyone else.  Wisdom takes a long time to gain, as does seeing the patterns and cycles in life.   Who do you think propagated this trending towards medical use?  Wouldn't it be the very people who knew the long-term benefits of it?  Wouldn't those people have had to use it long-term to know this?  Long-term implies older people, does it not?   I can guarantee I have more personal experience with marijuana than you or most people you know.  Should you choose to take a random survey over the anecdotal experiences of someone who's been directly involved for decades, that's your choice.   Smart tv, Xbox360, bluray player or other device with Netflix app or connect a computer to your tv.   You're so tense for a teenager.  Go to college and learn how to interpret results and how to make friends.  Let us know how that goes.   You're so contrary, that I suggest you go smoke a bowl and aim for a more pleasant attitude.   I'm not an idiot, son.  I'm a 50-something that's been smoking it with many, many people for decades.  I stand by what I said.   Put some pretty food pics in the local newspaper.  Browse /r/FoodPorn for good ideas.  I want to go somewhere and spend my money for people to cook beautiful, tasty, makes-me-want-to-eat-it-right-this-minute food.   You spelled that wrong, it's d-**o**-l-t, and I think you're there now.   Marijuana use isn't on the rise, we just admit it more freely these days.  We grew up in the 70's, what else would you expect?   Aww, she's beautiful.  Congratulations.   It's not the "poison that is Christianity" that caused this man to be the way he is anymore than it was the cause of why you are the way you are.  I'm a lifelong Christian and I hope he rots in prison.   "I know God has forgiven me and my soul is in good shape. I can live at my cousin's house in Nebraska forever out in the middle of nowhere if that's what it takes," Ratigan said as he faced a judge. "Prison is hell. I know I deserve 15 years. Fifty years? I don't think so."  I don't think he has a soul and 50 years is just enough.  He's 47 now, so he'll never again see that cousin's house in Nebraska.  Forgiven?  No way.   I'd be the lunchlady for kindergardeners.  Kids that age are hilarious and fun to be around.   You wasted their money when you quit college so now you get to waste your own.  Seems fair to me.   Nothing.  I already pay too much in federal and state taxes to take care of my "burden" on the highway system.   Don't delete her, she can still be your friend.  Speak to her when you run into her, but don't search her out.  Be cordial, be cool but don't act like you're all that into her.  Keep your options open and keep looking.   The hint is, she doesn't want a relationship and doesn't want you to get attached or to depend on her.  She has zero emotional investment and wants to keep it that way.  Just let it go, she isn't girlfriend material.   If they didn't there wouldn't be as many divorces as there are.   "which makes me think she is using excuses or trying to hint at something."  Take the hint and back way off.   You're treading on dangerous ground here and you know it.  You say there's nothing sexual about it, but you know there is, even if it's just a little curiosity.  I wouldn't tell your husband since you;ll end up holding his feelings against him.  On the other hand, you shouldn't have to hide things from him either.  My advice would be to let the past stay in the past and for you to stop chatting with this married man.  You two have a history together, but your husband is your current commitment and your future and he comes first.   I'm not concerned in the least with setting an example for the world from a website.  But, I wish you the best of luck with it.   I'm not a member of that group so I really have no opinion.  I like to look at some of it, but that's about it.   I'm not catholic so I don't pay much attention to him or any other religious leader in the news.   There's nothing wrong with me, but my current issue is, I can't find a damn house to rent in my price range that takes pets.  They'll take my son, but not my dog? My dog is much better behaved.   Attitude and the level of responsibility they exhibit.  As the saying goes, "When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things."   Classism, since I see far more of that than racism.   Their ingenuity.   Yes, you don't worry about money so much and can save more.   I could probably get to about ten words before I hit backspace.  Nope, just did twelve.   Why grandma, the dog, their fish, etc., aren't coming back.   She attended one in a southern coastal city, but there are several along the entire east coast.   250,000 miles away.   A decomposing body pulled from the ocean after having been out there for weeks.  	107
 Maybe I just suck but it was a 6 star Naz that was spamming his passive like crazy. First it goes wolf then it's passive. Or it was a 5   Do you think toast would do something about that? Most of my losses come from this :(   I've tried anut and it seem to work or I just killed naz fast enough.   He keeps spamming his passive every second, is this bugged? If I don't get the right blocks or kill him fast enough my team just gets knocked up every second and just melt.   Oooo thanks, I just randomly use all my bread       Doing bread dungeon, boss at like 100 health or so, accidentally hit two three chains in a row......... instadeath everywhere. EoG and RNG why... (Was doing the 2-chain one)   I think if you take the gift at max you don't get any?    I had full meat when I started, got free 30 meat in the mail. I'm expecting it to just go over but nope, meat didn't change. Is this the new feature?  	9
 dan is het iets verbeterd maar kan me toch ook herinneren dat een groot deel niet meezong voorheen.   Vind het trouwens vrij ergerlijk dat 80% van het Nederlands elftal het niet mee zingt op zo een wk maar semi-boos voor zich uitkijken.  Het is altijd gepast om mee te zingen ongeacht of je het wel of niet kent, proberen is nog altijd beter dan niks doen.   Everything better then watching Bruce Jenner, Job wel done! Edit: Got some down votes but would like to make clear that i'm not against the whole transgender thing, i'm just sick of the whole Kardashian family in general.   bubbleshooter classic   Pagani Zonda RS 760.   Watch the documentary, they did much more awful stuff.   You could make a tosti gives you a bit of a variation lol, Finding a good meal for 4 to 9 euro's is pretty difficult especially during lunch times.  Why don't you try to take your sandwich with cheese or salami(not preferred by your co workers) etc. to work for lunch and get your nice big meal at the end of the day during dinner time? You have a lot more choice then. And for the long run you get used to the eating pattern we have here in Holland.       Daarom betalen ze met hun 5de deel toch ook meer als een minder rijken?      Hetzelfde netto-bedrag zou het eerlijkst zijn, alleen is het dan onmogelijk om als land rond te komen. Dan vind ik persoonlijk het meest redelijke dat iedereen hetzelfde percentage moet betalen.   Vind het eigenlijk niet zo een super raar idee dat iedereen hetzelfde percentage betaalt. De rijkere betalen hier ook nog steeds meer.    Is she hot?   Ze heeft gelijk, tourisme gaat echt de spui gaten uitlopen, het is nog niet eens op het hoogte punt. Dit is volgens mij al zo in Londen.   Thanks for you very detailed reply!   Thanks for your explanations!  Sounds to me like it would be ideally to invent something like a left ventricular assist device only with internal batteries so you wouldn't get infections that easy.  To me also the cloning part looks very interesting.  Either way thanks for your clear information!     Thanks for your response!  Well I was wondering why they last so short, because I know it's a highly complex organ, but it is still a pump the only thing it has to do is pump blood around.   My GP once told me that those people most of the time die from severe skin cancer and stuff like, also what you mentioned because of infections.  Are there any cases where people didn't needed immunosuppressants? If so, did their transplanted hearts last longer?        can confirm, not the escort part but the Brazilian girls I met go absolutely haywire for blonde and blue eyed guys.   haha precies hetzelfde gehad, meneer ik heb een mac, nee u heeft een windows. Huh?   Ben ik de enige die de Rotterdam echt totaal niet vind passen bij de omgeving? Reed er laatst langs en schrok er toch wel van.  edit: de Rotterdam in plaats van de Rotterdammer.   wow everything looks perfect! The cheese is perfectly round the other cheese is in a perfect triangle, the grapes have a very nice and full color, the bread is cut very nicely, the chicken looks absolutely well cooked, and the ham looks nice two!  9/10  Can I join?   Inception.   Sowieso enorm kansloos die lijstjes.   Bij donatie krijgt niet zomaar de eerste de beste je organen, hier gaat een lange selectie procedure aan vooraf, hier word onder anderen gekeken of je rookt en dergelijken en word er een uitgebreid psychologisch onderzoek gedaan om te kijken of je in de toekomst niet onverantwoord met het gedoneerde orgaan om zal gaan.    Personally I think it's a huge thing for free publicity, why on earth would you announce for the whole press and crew that you are gonna lower your salary to compensate for all your personal.  And does he still own stock? If he still owns stock you get the same thing like Steve Jobs how had a salary of 1 dollar a year.  That being said it is a great thing that he did it but i'm doubting the real reason behind it.   [Martin Garrix   Tiesto - The Only Way Is Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1lfUnQZ1M8)  [Martin Garrix feat. Usher - Don't look down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQfgW83kY0E)  [Kygo - Stole the Show ft. Parson James](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNq1mY7AAMY)     Jammer dat de ontdekhoek weg is in Rotterdam! Vroeger erg vaak geweest als kind en was altijd heel leuk!   Same problem here.    So they have their spaces at the big motor shows for free?    Ongelofelijk, ze ontslaan iemand en ze laten het een stagiair opvangen waar gaat het heen.   Hier heb je een link van de overheid: [Wat is er wettelijk geregeld voor mijn werktijden](http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/werktijden/vraag-en-antwoord/wat-is-er-wettelijk-geregeld-voor-mijn-werktijden.html)  Overgens zou ik of een andere stage plek zoeken, of het voorleggen aan je stagebegeleider. Je stage hoort leerzaam en leuk te zijn en niet het goedkoop verrichten van arbeid, dit is niet goed voor de arbeidsmarkt en niet voor jou.       Ze hadden al 6 weken de tijd om vrijwillig het pand te verlaten.   Het zonder toestemming van de eigenaar in gebruik nemen van een onroerende zaak in de vorm van een ongebruikt terrein, gebouw of ruimte daarvan noemt men kraken. Dit is sinds 1 november 2010 verboden.     Alleen is wat de bezetters doen geen kraken   Ongelofelijk dat ze eerst nog even een festival gaan houden voordat ze eruit gaan. Wat mij betreft de bezem er door, het liefst vannacht nog.  	33

of all, there's a difference between power users and moderators.  Oh boy yes. All I want to do is (in order of preference):  * kill spam  * enforce subreddit rules  * submit relevant content that benefits a specific subreddit   conforms to those rules  I would suggest points 1   2 put me squarely in your 2nd category   hello mate :) I have to (politely) disagree with you. I don't "run" subreddits, I enforce their rules, made by THEIR mods. When I ask to be taken into a subreddit it's (historically) generally been to gain access to the modqueue, to the spam, for the purpose of stopping spam REDDIT-WIDE (random example: I spot a spammer in /r/creepy, I can see that he's also spamming /r/wtf, because I mod both places,   I can put a stop to it, but I can't always see if he is spamming /r/gore, because I don't mod there). The goal of /r/reportthespammers was always,   only, to benefit reddit site-wide, which required us to be mods in as many subs as possible to network spam awareness.   Disclaimer: in some subs (/r/funny for 1) I like to weigh in on policy, I've been there a long time, in other subs, I have zero rights except post removals (/r/amisexy for example, I was added there after answering an ad for someone to monitor their spamqueue, I don't even see modmails to that sub). And I "own" a few small subs (software-based mostly) where I do my own thing, but have great mods as backup who I always listen to    He's literally about 35~40% of the total mod actions for /r/funny each month, and most mods in the subreddit do their fair share of work. Taking him away from any subreddit would be disastrous.   past history, I went from my 11+ default mod-slots to my current 3, I doubt I could ever get that kind of coverage for spam again, especially since /r/reportthespammers went dark   my relationship with admin is not what it was               :P       The only limit is that no user can mod more than 2 default subreddits.  4     I lost one of the best moderators on this website due to this rule and am still very bitter about how it was handled. /u/kylde was originally going to be allowed to stick with us and then was told otherwise. He's a spam killing machine who had access to such a large portion of reddit, that he's able to make very quick decisions across the website.   I'm flattered, thank you   nosuh, we're open to suggestions. 2 suggestions were:  Does dragon ball z have the over 9000 thing.

During the glory years of the Alliance for Progress and the New Frontier, he fought the holy war against communism by bribing politicians and journalists, forging documents, tapping telephones, and reading other people's mail.  But it was a faraway event which seems to have disturbed him more. Lyndon Johnson's invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965 was an overreaction Agee couldn't accept. In 1968, he resigned with the conviction that he had become a "servant of the capitalism I rejected" as a university student"one of its secret policemen."  --------  (begin Philip Agee) When I joined the CIA I believed in the need for its existence. After twelve years with the agency I finally understood how much suffering it was causing, that millions of people all over the world had been killed or had had their lives destroyed by the CIA and the institutions it supports. I couldn't sit by and do nothing and so began work on this book.  --------------  Even after recent revelations about the CIA it is still difficult for people to understand what a huge and sinister organization the CIA is. It is the biggest and most powerful secret service that has ever existed. I don't know how big the KGB is inside the Soviet Union, but its international operation is small compared with the CIA's. The CIA has 16,500 employees and an annual budget of $750,000,000. That does not include its mercenary armies or its commercial subsidiaries. Add them all together, the agency employs or subsidizes hundreds of thousands of people and spends billions every year. Its official budget is secret; it's concealed in those of other Federal agencies. Nobody tells the Congress what the CIA spends. By Law, the CIA is not accountable to Congress.  ----------------  I grabbed a sandwich at a blind stand and then took the shuttle to the Executive Office Building. (Those blind standssandwich bars operated by blind peopleare in practically every building. I guess it's a good thing for the blind people to have that work, and the company can let them in the buildings because they can't read secret papers. Everybody wins.)  ------------------  The interrogator announced that I had reached the final phase of the security clearance procedure necessary for access to Top Secret material and, of course, for employment with the company. He assured me that all employees of the company, even Mr. Dulles, submit to the polygraphnot just once when they're hired, but periodically throughout their careers.  ----------------   DoD: "I know we can't account for [$8.5 TRILLION](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2015/03/19/85-Trillion-Unaccounted-Should-Congress-Increase-Defense-Budget)--but *TRUST* us on this one!!!   Synchronicity is always good. Do you remember when Bush-Cheney first got into office and Cheney was being so secretive about the Energy Commission? After a year or two a few pages of what they were working on finally came out thru a FOIA lawsuit--one of the only pages which was released was an analysis of Iraq's oil/gas fields.   Another thing that I think may have happened is the U.S. most likely had Iraq sign up to supply U.S. forces with gas/oil as part of the security agreement to have U.S.-led forces remain there.   I would think Iran is off the PetroDollar. The PetroDollar is why the U.S.-NATO took out Gaddafi, too. Now look at what a mess Libya has been since.   China and Russia have signed agreements to use their own currencies in energy deals. China's President was in Moscow over the weekend with Putin for the 70th of VE Day--most likely forging deeper military and economic ties.      WOW...surprising difference all those years and Hollywood films made!   is this that awful NYT mini-comedy wanna be documentary? (I hate the *NYT*)...when I first joined reddit someone posted it and I got in this 2 hour argument...i basically dissected it as propaganda with some funny piano music at the end...the *NYT* is one of the CIA's mouthpieces--even when they tell you the truth, it's not the *whole truth*   you can go to r/TSBD and find a free pdf of it...(see if you like it)...  one of my favorite books...info about the Marshall Plan is in the second or third chapter--like pages 30-50...short 10-15 page chapters--each one with great quotes...   The Marshall Plan was certainly important but the CIA also hijacked at least 5% of the funds to set up political slush funds which were used to alter the natural course of sovereign countries--Greece, Italy, France, Japan. This had a very negative impact and the CIA only let this be known to the public about 50 years later. (source: *Legacy of Ashes: The History of the CIA* by Tim Weiner)    Thanks for posting the TPP link--hadn't seen it although I've had a critical eye on the TPP since it came up last year. I've picked up sound bites on Bernie--Good Luck to him, but I just don't know if the system will allow him (or any other politician) to alter things.    I certainly don't want or think it will, but the expansive inequality is becoming apparent more and more everyday. Last fall (?) Target in Canada laid off 10K or 20K workers when they folded--but the President walked with $22 million which was equal to or greater than what the workers received as compensation.    Fully agreed.  The Iran-Contra hearings may have been the last chance to try to reign in the Cabal--everyone knew it was crooked and vile, but somehow the media just slept. Americans acted like they had just got done watching a 3 1/2 hour movie.  Then they elected "The First Ever Civilian Director of the CIA".   I have some relatives that are selling their house and moving to Costa Rica next year...they have visited there 3 times--gorgeous.   Hopefully NOT like this:  "The last capitalist we hang shall be the one who sold us the rope."  --Karl Marx  ------   My cousin was a Marine and went over for the Gulf War--he was a solid 180. When he came back he was sickly--maybe 145. They couldn't figure out what was wrong with him. Still has physical issues to this day.   Thanks...absolutely shocking.   Thanks!  I never heard of this...SHOCKING.   WOW. As a Anti-Corporate News Activist (ACNA) I was wondering if you could copy/paste this?  I refuse to read the *NYT*...   I've even heard that the U.S. trained Russian pilots in Alaska during WWII (not sure if it's true).   the SYSTEM IS BROKE...which is why I wrote this essay!   I hope people think about it--maybe even pass it on!   Saudi Arabia has financed CIA projects since the Iran-Contra days--they coughed up $25 million for the Contras in just one year. To be clear--Porter Goss was formerly the head of the CIA and must be cleared by the government to work as a lobbyist for another country. Turkey has also been leasing drones from the U.S. for years (you can read the U.S. State Dept. memos on wikileaks)   NICE!  WWII in under one dozen words!  "ww2 was won with American material, British ingenuity, and Russian blood."   The decline of the PetroDollar could be why the U.S. is so hungry to overthrow Syria. At this point I'm sure there's much of the infrastructure there that needs to be rebuilt. I also think the thought of a pipeline going from Iran-Iraq-Syria is seen as threatening to corporate America (et al.).   Rumor is Turkey along with the Saudis are amping things up to take care of Syria--and former CIA director Porter Goss just asked for permission to be a "lobbyist" for Turkey.   4 words: Trans Pacific Trade Deal...can't believe the public is going to let this slide by...but then after 2 illegal wars, secret prisons, legalized torture, NSA scandals, CIA scandals and DoD looting--nothing surprises me.   In fall of 2000, Saddam Hussein took Iraq off the PetroDollar in the Oil-for-Food program (he switched to the Euro). Alternatively, [Scott Ritter](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003) claims the U.S. was out for regime change in Iraq after the Gulf War ended--so the PetroDollar may have just been Saddam's final middle finger gesture to a determined pack of neoCons. (video link is 15 minutes of C-Span with Seymour Hersh).   must've been before the private contractors took over security!   very interesting--have never heard of Glubb or Todd...thanks for sharing the pdf--I will check it out...  Hopefully you're RIGHT and I'm WRONG! It just seems to me that the USG is focused on short-term solutions and in a downward spiral of overthrowing countries to take advantage of their natural resources (and let the corporations LOOT).   FYI: if you scroll to the bottom of the article there is a link to the **1 Page** NSA document the entire article is derived from--it is actually from an internal NSA history...how many pages are there that are still NOT released? (this was volume 1 of a 3 volume set)   For some reason I have a feeling it may start this summer--most likely in Syria-Iraq...if this happened I fear it could easily spread like wild fire in ways the generals and the think tank consultants haven't properly thought out. Paul Craig Roberts (who is the last link in my post) worries about Russia going nuclear...pretty alarming when neoCons like Dick Cheney are walking around grunting about it, too.   I would urge you to watch some [Chris Hedges](http://www.c-span.org/video/?303072-1/depth-chris-hedges)      I can easily see lists being drawn up of those who dare to speak dissenting words or ideas--this would most likely would be done by the intelligence corporations which are paid premium dollars (with our own tax money).   The info likely is spread upwards into the official government lists--to be used when convenient. We know the FBI-NSA spied on peace activists in the 60's. They also spied on U.S. politicians, journalists and high profile figures. Among the politicians was Sen. Frank Church--who was on the Intelligence Committee looking into the abuses of the FBI-NSA. This was only revealed in 2013.  http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/09/25/secret-cold-war-documents-reveal-nsa-spied-on-senators/   imagine if suspects were allowed 10 days before being questioned and allowed the luxury of being told the charges and seeing who was making the claim...   Definitely agree--I have posted quite a few free pdf files of books on [r/TSBD](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/)--many of which focus on the CIA since WWII.   As per the homegrown resistance--one of the most shocking things I read was in Daniel Ellsberg's bio where he stated that within the Pentagon Papers he read that there were a few generals at the Pentagon who knew, from the start, that the US would need 500K to 1 million troops to properly control Vietnam. These generals kept this from the public--and from the President(s).   often it seems as if the Corporate press will report a story, then 2 days later there will be a retraction.   the HEADLINE is often all people read, so the original (false) story accomplishes the goal: propaganda designed to instill fear or hatred.   For example, at Stalingrad:   ------------  The Axis suffered 850,000 total casualties (wounded, killed, captured) among all branches of the German armed forces and its allies; 400,000 Germans, 200,000 Romanians, 130,000 Italians, and 120,000 Hungarians were killed, wounded or captured.[95]  On the material side, the Germans losses were 900 aircraft (including 274 transports and 165 bombers used as transports), 500 tanks, and 6,000 artillery pieces.[2]:122123 According to a contemporary Soviet report, 5,762 artillery pieces; 1,312 mortars; 12,701 heavy machine guns; 156,987 rifles; 80,438 sub-machine guns; 10,722 trucks; 744 aircraft; 1,666 tanks; 261 other armored vehicles; 571 half-tracks; and 10,679 motorcycles were captured by the Soviets.[96] An unknown amount of Hungarian, Italian, and Romanian material was lost.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Stalingrad  -----------  Kursk:   ---------   Karl-Heinz Frieser, who reviewed the German archive record, calculated that during Operation Citadel 54,182 casualties were suffered. Of these, 9,036 were killed, 1,960 were reported missing, and 43,159 were wounded. The 9th Army suffered 23,345 casualties, while Army Group South suffered 30,837 casualties.[9] Throughout the Soviet offensives, 86,064 casualties were suffered. In facing Operation Kutuzov, 14,215 men were killed, 11,300 were reported missing (presumed killed or captured), and 60,549 were wounded.[295] During Polkovodets Rumyantsev, 25,068 casualties were incurred, including 8,933 killed and missing. Total casualties for the three battles were about 170,000 men.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kursk  ----------  Moscow:  -----------  Both German and Soviet casualties during the battle of Moscow have been a subject of debate, as various sources provide somewhat different estimates. Not all historians agree on what should be considered the "Battle of Moscow" in the timeline of World War II. While the start of the battle is usually regarded as the beginning of Operation Typhoon on 30 September 1941 (or sometimes on 2 October 1941), there are two different dates for the end of the offensive. In particular, some sources (such as Erickson[82] and Glantz[83]) exclude the Rzhev offensive from the scope of the battle, considering it as a distinct operation and making the Moscow offensive "stop" on 7 January 1942thus lowering the number of casualties.  There are also significant differences in figures from various sources. John Erickson, in his Barbarossa: The Axis and the Allies, gives a figure of 653,924 Soviet casualties between October 1941 and January 1942.[82] Glantz, in his book When Titans Clashed, gives a figure of 658,279 for the defense phase alone, plus 370,955 for the winter counteroffensive until 7 January 1942.[83] The estimate of 400,000 German casualties by January 1942 reported in the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, published in 197378.[70] On the other hand, Wehrmacht daily casualty reports show 35,757 killed in action, 128,716 wounded, and 9,721 missing in action for the entire Army Group Center between 1 October 1941 and 10 January 1942.[84]  Regardless of these disagreements, the Battle of Moscow is considered among the most lethal battles in world history.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Moscow  ------------             Obviously, Russia was wrong in invading Finland and Poland--but they did fight for 2 or 3 years before the Allies hit those beaches...The U.S. gave Russia Billions in military aid to enable a large percentage of the German War Machine to be destroyed--thousands of tanks and hundreds of thousands of soldiers.  ---------  Edit: Another important consideration should be all of the resources which Germany had to use to take their War Machine to Russia. Oil, gas, transportation resources for all the weapons and soldiers to go deep into Russian territory...    Thanks for the thoughtful feedback--I think you're definitely right about the USG primarily serving the upper class. The only book I've read so far that has exposed me to the history of socialist thought in the US was by Beverly Gage, titled *The Day Wall Street Exploded*. Gage is a Yale history professor and gave some backstory of the socialist movement in the US as she proceeded to tell the story of the [Wall Street Bombing of 1920](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_bombing).   I found her categorization to be a little dismissive of the possibility that the US industrialists had ostracized the socialists because they were attempting to keep the unions from demanding higher wages (etc.).   One of the most interesting aspects of the book was that she was unable to get the USG to release any files--even though the incident happened in 1920. She provided an appendix with notes on sources in which she expressed frustration.  It does seem like the US population is beginning to understand we are being misled--hopefully the Chris Hedges of the world will have a farther-reaching voice very soon.   I'm definitely open to that possibility...Scary to think the USG is but a puppet! It's obvious the politicians are...any good docs/articles you've seen lately?   Thanks...I stand corrected...I might need a pair of glasses!

I see what you mean...IMO the U.S. funded a great deal of Pakistan's military/intelligence (the U.S. gave Pakistan up to $3 Billion a year from 2002-2011)--it is also well-known that Pakistan is aligned the Taliban (Mark Mazzetti's *The Way of the Knife* covers this...pdf in r/TSBD)...  I still think its a somewhat useful observation because of the vast cultural differences between the U.S. and Russia. The U.S. has hundreds of years of embedded racial inequality and a much more diverse population which has, until recently, not been allowed to be seen as equals.  I see the statement as an exercise in how countries misjudge what they can control when they invade another country.          If this is the main reason for the Operation--then the DEA-FBI-NSA obviously have the means of capturing the central dealers by spying on the phone/emails/texts of those involved. The U.S. has literally spent Billions upon Billions of dollars for the technology.  I think its completely unnecessary to run an Op which clearly is targeting a very wide population base.      another GREAT article by PCR--here's the Meat of it (but I would urge you to read the entire article--especially the MLK quote at the end!)   ------------  ...in the cop culture that is America today, the Bill of Rights doesnt amount to much. Unless, that is, its the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBoR), which protects police officers from being subjected to the kinds of debilitating indignities heaped upon the average citizen.  Most Americans, oblivious about their own rights, arent even aware that police officers have their own Bill of Rights. Yet at the same time that our own protections against government abuses have been reduced to little more than historic window dressing, 14 states have already adopted LEOBoRswritten by police unions and being considered by many more states and Congresswhich provides police officers accused of a crime with special due process rights and privileges not afforded to the average citizen.  In other words, the LEOBoR protects police officers from being treated as we are treated during criminal investigations: questioned unmercifully for hours on end, harassed, harangued, browbeaten, denied food, water and bathroom breaks, subjected to hostile interrogations, and left in the dark about our accusers and any charges and evidence against us.  Not only are officers given a 10-day cooling-off period during which they cannot be forced to make any statements about the incident, but when they are questioned, it must be for a reasonable length of time, at a reasonable hour, by only one or two investigators (who must be fellow policemen), and with plenty of breaks for food and water.  According to investigative journalist Eli Hager, the most common rights afforded police officers accused of wrongdoing are as follows:  * If a department decides to pursue a complaint against an officer, the department must notify the officer and his union. * The officer must be informed of the complainants, and their testimony against him, before he is questioned. * During questioning, investigators may not harass, threaten, or promise rewards to the officer, as interrogators not infrequently do to civilian suspects. * Bathroom breaks are assured during questioning. * In Maryland, the officer may appeal his case to a hearing board, whose decision is binding, before a final decision has been made by his superiors about his discipline. The hearing board consists of three of the suspected offenders fellow officers. * In some jurisdictions, the officer may not be disciplined if more than a certain number of days (often 100) have passed since his alleged misconduct, which limits the time for investigation. * Even if the officer is suspended, the department must continue to pay salary and benefits, as well as the cost of the officers attorney.  http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2015/05/06/32141/  -----------       (from article)  ------------  ...in the cop culture that is America today, the Bill of Rights doesnt amount to much.

Does your agency target based on race?  Deputy Sheriff: I wouldnt say target based on race but is is, you know, um, it is much easier to do this on a black person because they have no credibility anyways. The charges stick better to blacks than to a rich white guy that can afford a lawyer. That is one school of thought. Then you still have the deputies who like doing it to the rich white guys because they say it removes the smug look from their faces. They get their kicks from the power like its a game. Most cops though, they, um do it to get bad guys off the streets. The last group of deputies do it for personal gain.  Jeffery Schultz: Personal gain? Like what?  Deputy Sheriff: Sometimes a deputy will use the threat of planting, you know, dope on a person to get some cash or something from the perp. Uh, like a few hundred bucks can make the problem go away. Its pretty rare but it happens. Usually its the deputies that live large and need supplemental income. They tend to keep it really quiet because thats like, you know, really bad stuff. We even had a guy put the suspect in the back of his green and white [patrol car]to drive him to an ATM machine. We were all like what the hell is he doing?

We owe it to those who have gone before us who executed that same oath, and who are doing the same thing in Iraq and Afghanistan right now. Those of us who joined the military and faithfully executed orders that were given us had to trust our leaders.

They collectively LIED the US into war in Iraq--and they will be happy to take us to war again very, very soon.

The corporate media can spin any story upside-down in 3 minutes--complicated issues take in-depth coverage to even begin to fully understand. Until the population Turns OFF cbs, fox, cnn, nbc--we will continue to be fed Sh*t-On-A-Stick.    I thought there was a video after 9/11 in which bin Laden had mountains in  the background...then they went to audio because "bin Laden" didn't want to be located   The CIA knew there were at least 2 Al Qaeda members in the US--yet they failed to notify the FBI. In fact, they ended up staying with an FBI informant in San Diego.   The US defenses were lowered by having so many War Games being run on 9/11...Fighter jets were scrambled 100 miles away from DC instead of over DC.  An embassy official in the Middle East turned down several Saudis from being allowed entry into the US--the CIA overruled him and forced him to OK their entry visas.     You could be right about the Israelis--but I think for the 9/11 Operation to be successful the US had to have it's guard down and there had to be someone inside making sure the Cover Ups worked.   I think the US set it up using the CIA or the Pentagon to do it...the Saudis helped find the patsies (the hijackers), the Saudis and the Pakistanis helped fund it (wasn't very expensive)...and the Israelis set up the WTC...  But most of that $4 Trillion just went to make rich men even Richer.  Spreading Democracy was a sales pitch.   I'm surprised the US didn't fabricate the evidence--the US and especially the NeoCons had [regime change in Iraq](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4499540/scott-ritter-claims-regime-change-us-policy-goal-towards-iraq-1990-2003) as their #1 goal since the end of the first Gulf War.      you can just watch the WTC parts=2 hours  how do you get symmetrical collapse from asymmetrical damage?     I don't remember that interview, but it doesn't surprise me that cbs would stoop that low. I remember the Freedom Fries and fox and nbc having on Scott Ritter for 3 minutes--so their hosts could tear him to shreds with insults. Funny how all those fox interviews seem to be missing on youtube.    100% WRONG. The U.S.A. has gained the most from the attacks--$4 TRILLION spent in Afghanistan and Iraq Wars (plus even more to the MIC)...  The US didn't attack Iraq for oil--the US attacked because in the Fall of 2000 Saddam had switched off of the PetroDollar to the Euro (and because Cheney is a bloodthirsty, greedy motherfucker).  As for the complete incompetence--YES--not one person even lost their job or was demoted. George Tenet held onto his job for another 3 or 4 years.    The day a cbs executive allowed their advertisers to affect the reporting of Edward R. Murrow...There is a scene in *Goodnight and Goodluck* where the president of cbs tells Murrow "my Wednesday night program costs half as much and I don't get complaints from sponsors" (paraphrasing).   Highly recommend that any of you who truly want some answers on the corporate media, Occupy, and the Iraq War should watch this [**C-SPAN interview with CHRIS HEDGES](http://www.c-span.org/video/?303072-1/depth-chris-hedges**).

Until the population Turns OFF cbs, fox, cnn, nbc--we will continue to be fed Shit-On-A-Stick.     There is no direct evidence that the USG had direct links, BUT...what do Criminals do? They hide evidence, they try to disrupt the investigation...  Footage from 89 security cameras was immediately confiscated from around the Pentagon by the FBI...Still, to this day, the USG has only released 3 frames of footage. (what are they hiding--its 14 years later).  9/11 Commission: [Our Investigation Was Obstructed](http://www.salon.com/2008/01/02/obstruction/)  Sen. Tom Daschle: [Cheney Asked Me NOT To Investigate 9/11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePOIhhd9Jr0)  It also took more than 400 days--and pressure from the victims' families, before the 9/11 Commission was allowed to proceed.  Criminals also try to stay out of the spotlight--which is why Bush would NOT speak to the 9/11 Commission in public--or UNDER OATH...what is so hard about putting your hand on the bible and swearing TO TELL THE TRUTH?    Any honest detective would be suspicious.     Here's a great example of the rubbish the corporate media fed us (9/5/2002):   http://www.cbsnews.com/news/lawsuit-iraq-involved-in-9-11-conspiracy/  http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/09/05/ar911.iraq.lawsuit/index.html  Obviously, it's easier for the media to teach the viewers to hate than to ask real questions about 9/11 and get real answers.

I thought I heard about some kind of Stratfor leak which showed that CIA madman John Brennan was cracking the whip like a stormtrooper on reporters.   CORRECTION: Only Giuliani commented on the temperature.  At 1hr 12 minutes of the *9/11 Exposed* documentary Rudy Giuliani states: "There were fires of 2000 degrees fahrenheit below the ground." (The source was nbc/today show)  At about 1hr 26min Gov. Pataki states the concrete was pulverized (fox news with bill hummer)   Thanks for posting...  Mayor Rudy Giuliani and NY Governor George Pataki even acknowledged the extreme temperatures...(I think their quotes can be found in the latest ae911truth documentary *9/11 Exposed*)...   I've read quite a bit about gov't committees and hearings--I think you'd be better off reading Russ Baker's *Family of Secrets* (if you want to get closer to the Truth). The gov't will rarely allow any real facts to come out--better to look into the Deep Politics...you should be able to find a few of Russ' chapters on his website: http://whowhatwhy.org/2012/05/07/watergate-revelations-the-coup-against-nixon-part-1-of-3/   Number 3...*Hitler's American Business Partners* covers this--Standard Oil let the Germans have a patent for synthetic fuel  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMKnH2BlkBA   *Evidence of Revision* Part 5 (1hr 49min)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nus9mnbvflM   you should be able to get the full transcripts at archive.org    -----------------  "Were the Soviet Union to sink tomorrow under the waters of the ocean, the American militaryindustrial complex would have to remain, substantially unchanged, **until some other adversary could be invented**.

[**118 FIREFIGHTERS**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZ4dVo5QgYg) reported EXPLOSIONS at the WTC...some of them even specifically refer to **DEMOLITION CHARGES POPPING OFF**   hmmm...wonder if they show Ol' Henry getting his nazi awards?  or the FACT that Ford owned a plant in Europe which supplied the nazi war machine with trucks.  Hitler's American Business Partners:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMKnH2BlkBA     the CIA-FBI still hasn't released 1,000's of JFK files--it makes no sense to think they would tell us the truth about 9/11. I fully understand Paul Jay's argument, but it is extremely naive to think the CIA-FBI will ever release files.   Paul Jay and Kiriakou also get it WRONG about what the CIA knew before 9/11...One part of the CIA knew at least 2 members of Al Qaeda were in the US--but didn't tell other parts of the CIA or, more importantly, the FBI...  in the interview Jay and Kiriakou act as if the CIA didn't know--this is false because the CIA arranged to have pictures taken of the Kuala Lumpur meeting--then they found out at least 2 members went to Los Angeles after the meeting.   I think John Brennan took his ass down by either listening to Patreus' lovey-dovey phone calls with Broadwell--or he honey-trapped Patreus (in which case it is possible she is a foreign agent).         you can also browse the pdf links at r/TSBD...there are also tons of [used books](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/2hw8i0/list_of_cheap_dirty_conspiracy_booksmany_for_one/) at amazon--many for just one cent + $3.99 delivery (US). (no, I don't work for amazon--but if I can get a very hard to find book for $4 I'll take it)  I generally like to read the actual book, but use the pdf to see if I like the author's style/content.   The post would definitely confirm my suspicions about the mods in the larger subs (and many of the comments/voting patterns)--but there is just hearsay with no actual verifiable source.   If the user could provide info, like next week South Korea will be pushed hard or a specific example of their work--at least then we'd have something to base the claims on.   Issuing a citiation at the hospital and releasing him for a DUI involving an accident with a parked car?  If his family wasn't prominent he'd be slapped in cuffs and hauled off to the clink until bail was provided and he had slept off the moonshine.   Russ Baker is actually quite conservative in his investigative reporting--that is, his research is generally very meticulous. He strains not to make any gross leaps of judgment, building fact-upon-fact and clearly notifying the reader when he does attempt to fill in the blanks. Most important in all this is the sources--the interviews he personally made for the book and the extensive list of books/articles which he cites.   If your personal background has been very trusting of the government (and the republicans-CIA) the book can definitely have some shock to it. If you read something in there you question, then read the sources for the chapter in the back of the book.   *Family of Secrets* is actually quite conservative compared to [Webster Tarpley's earlier book on GHW Bush](http://np.reddit.com/r/TSBD/comments/2culc7/ghw_bush_unauthorized_by_webster_tarpley/). It was actually the first book I read about politics, too--I have moved on and now have read quite a handful of authors and can judge what level of trust I can have in their words by comparing it to other books and sources.  Hopefully you will keep reading more books and learn what level of confidence you can place upon different authors as well--but the Source (the document or testimony) is always the most important aspect to analyze.   I think the failure of the corporate press has much more to do with the cozy relationship which developed during WWII. The US press became subservient to the military during the war--the relationship between the OSS/CIA/FBI became interlocked. The agencies began to demand the press hold stories and omit facts. NBC was owned by RCA--which produced radio equipment the soldiers/pilots used.  During the Gulf and Iraq Wars this became more pronounced due to the Billions the Pentagon was spending on advertising to get more recruits. The corporations completely lost their will to be the Fourth Estate and gave up their right to a Free Press. The corporate press no longer print stories--they check with the DoJ or the State Dept first, then they print (or not) after the USG has ok'd the article.   I think it has become almost worse than the propaganda Russia often feeds its citizens because, as it is now, the citizens of the US THINK they are being fed the TRUTH--when its actually just press releases from the State Dept or the Pentagon.   more like [1895](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propaganda_of_the_SpanishAmerican_War)   ----------  I've never looked into whether this doc is fake or not--but Oswald being CIA seems beyond doubt. His work at Atsugi AFB in Japan required a high level clearance because that is where the CIA's U2 spyplanes were flown out of...Oswald affording the money to go to the USSR via Europe...Oswald renouncing his citizenship, then 18 months later coming back to the U.S. with a ticket for him, his new wife and his newborn--all paid for by the U.S. State Department--highly unusual to say the least...Oswald NOT being immediately arrested by the FBI upon return from the USSR...Oswald with George de Mohrenschildt (CIA) as a handler (his address is in Oswald's address book)...Oswald working at a High Security photo lab upon return (????-Stovall)...Oswald being seen with David Atlee Phillips (CIA-Latin America) by Antonio Veciana (he finally ID'd David Atlee Phillips before his death)...  Much of this is covered in these articles:    http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/Weisberg%20Subject%20Index%20Files/B%20Disk/Brussell%20Mae/Item%2025.pdf  http://www.storyleak.com/lee-harvey-oswald-proven-innocent-victim-of-cia-plot-worked-for-rfk/  -------------  How many times is r/conspiracy going to upvote bunk to the top?  I've seen this happen 3 or 4 times in the last week alone...WTF...   FYI: Politico actually changed the title after their original post...I have reposted the submission with the new title...      I fully agree with you that Obama has been quite vicious--definitely not the peacemaker everyone thought they were voting for!!! Over 1,000 drone strikes--not exactly anything Martin Luther King, Jr. would approve of. Obama used to quote him often--but obviously forgot all about his "Beyond Vietnam" speech.  80,000 deaths in Pakistan since 2001 (even though we are not at war with them). You're definitely right about Libya, too--another country turned to chaos just because Gaddafi was switching off the PetroDollar.   I think Syria has a lot to do with stopping a possible Iran-Iraq-Syria pipeline. 210,000 deaths in Syria since 2010.  I no longer see this as entirely a republican-democrat problem--it seems the CIA-Pentagon get their wars one way or the other.   Short Answer: Oswald was set up by the CIA to be the Patsy--to take the fall. Many think Oswald worked for the CIA when he defected to the USSR in the late 50's. When Oswald came back to the U.S., the State Department paid his airfare--quite odd considering he was a defector (but not so odd if he was CIA)!  Then he passed out pro-Castro leaflets in New Orleans and was recorded by a tv station getting in a fight with anti-Castro Cubans (most likely a staged event).  All of these layers made him the perfect Fall Guy, some even think the CIA/Pentagon wanted to go to war with Cuba and get revenge for the Bay of Pigs (Oswald's commie background seemed to fit this possibility).   The chemical/bio weapons Saddam had were EXPIRED--no longer usable (they have a short shelf life)...Saddam was truly evil--but that didn't keep Donald Rumsfeld from shaking his hand just a year or so after he had gassed the Kurds.   At least we agree that there were no terrorists in Iraq before the U.S. went in and created chaos. ISIS has a large percentage of Saddam's Ba'ath party and the Iraqi Army (which the U.S. broke up). I think one U.S. general even said what a huge mistake it was at the time...  The most recent death count in the Middle East is 3 million killed since 9/11 (includes Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Syria and Yemen).  Yet the republicans still want to bomb Iran--I guess they haven't made enough money off their WAR, INC stocks.   YES--exactly...the Wall Street-CIA mob.   Interesting--the whole Lindbergh kidnapping case always stunk to high heaven...any links about his father and his books?   if you are just starting on JFK there are three great docs--all of them are ~~pretty~~ very long:  *The Men Who Killed Kennedy*, *Evidence of Revision*, and *Everything Is A Rich Man's Trick*...you can find them all on youtube...i would say it's best to see them in that order (which is chronological by release date)...   It's just crazy--if you look at anti-war.com they still list everyday dozens or hundreds of deaths in Iraq. the corporate media is rarely ever bothered with those body counts.   makes you wonder how many journalists, editors and publishers have investments in WAR, INC.    the corporate media certainly does make more money when the US is at war--the Pentagon spends billions to recruit, the defense corporations have to expand...   88 years old and the CIA **STILL** can't outsmart him.   He's 88 years old--but the CIA **STILL** can't outsmart him.      Mark Lane and Joachim Joesten were early on the trail, too...but no denying that Mae Brussell and Jim Garrison led heroic efforts as well. I think Joachim Joesten wrote *The Dark Side of LBJ* just a year or two after the assassination (printed in Europe).

 The Lego Movie.  Everyone Praises it for being the "Best Animated Film" of 2014.  Although it was visually stunning, I thought the movie was boring, stale, and I did not really connect with the humor.  I do understand the movie's appeal to others, it just is not a good film in my eyes.  	1

 It's nice to see Austin hasn't changed much. lol   how is someone (sort of) an animal murderer?  seems like the poor boy needs help :(   LOL I had chipmunk christmas and some kind of snap crackle pop rice krispies promotional album both of which I played over and over and over again   I like that they never play the same thing twice.   it seems to me they just play the same 3 songs over and over. I heard one song and then changed the station and the exact same song was playing on TWO different stations. :(   Thank god I'm not the only fucker cursed to dye since my early teenage years. It's either that or yank them   for real West Virginia is my home state but honestly the first thing I'd do if I won the lottery? Move the hell out of West Virginia.   haha smooth ;)   I was guessing it had something to do with marriage? but honestly have no idea   I keep seeing this bumper sticker. It is a white oval with 21+1 on it in black ink. And I know it has some .org website url at the bottom of it but my hubsand drove away too fast for me to see the damn thing. This is the second time I've seen it and I want to know what exactly it means. I tried google but it's bringing up absolutely nothing relevant. Thanks!   omg I have always wanted a ragdoll! they are very sweet and tend to "flop" around on their backs which is why the breed got the name   dhc cleansing oil is awesome.   gah I shaved mine completely off. and drew them back in. it looked awful.   So sorry for that poor little kid :( It probably broke his/her heart   That's devious. I like it.   I tried buying some lactose free cat milk from petsmart but my cats turn their noses up at it   I am one of those people who feels weird making someone else bag my groceries, I know it's your job but I like to help or do it myself. Of course it's not because I'm in a hurry I just don't like people having to wait on me hand and foot.   ugh at what point can you say fuck it, bag it yourself, psycho?   Bread and eggs get their own bag and I take that bag in the car with me unlike the rest of the groceries which go in the trunk.  Because otherwise cat litter/food or soda will squish the fuck out of them by rolling around in the back   I do when I am having a bad day, am in back pain, etc   Why would you buy a plant of something NOT knowing whether or not you like it?   Yes, the fax machine is magic and it eats your paper and then spits it out somewhere across the country   you want the $1.00 off? buy the $1 off pack. asshole   because customers never lie.    oh no they left, now I can leave on time! whatever shall I do   if she REALLY NEEDED that cooker than she would have accepted the delivery.   I always want to lock them in. Sorry I'm leaving but I have to lock the doors so.... bye      safeword   I think you rinse cleanser off with it or use it as toner   Sorry but it seems like you'll be better off rather than having to find out years down the road   :(   Uh I would say do it slowly and gradually. I have never experienced anything worse than cold turkey effexor withdrawals.   could he be hearing things?   Gizmo   Also while most cats generally LIKE milk, most cats are lactose intolerant. So the milk will probably give him diarhhea.    Leave cat food out regularly. Eventually he will get used to your presence and let you get closer to him. Assuming he is not feral he will start to trust you and eventually let you pet him.  I have had several neighborhood cats decide to "move in" in this fashion.  Just wanted to add this process may take weeks or even months so don't worry if it doesn't happen right away   I met mine on livejournal.   My husband does stuff around the house. I didn't have a problem cleaning when I was unemployed, but he has always done all the cooking so I  have always cleaned up after dinner and washed dishes. I figured that was fair 50/50.   But recently I have started working, so since I am cleaning all day at work, I don't really want to clean when I get home, too. So he will usually wash dishes and do cat litter and make the bed on the days I work, and I will do it on my days off as well as catch up on doing any other general house cleaning that needs done (vacuuming, mopping, laundry, cleaning the bathroom)   ALSO just wanted to add that sometimes I have to rewash the dishes since he doesn't always wash the bottom of plates or get all the grease off, etc. so you are not alone. lol  I don't think it's unrealistic to expect men to do their fair share. If they were living alone they would have to do it anyway. Also if  their wife/girlfriend is sick or just had surgery, they should know how to do it.  I just had surgery and couldn't do anything for two weeks.  If it was up to him he would probably let stuff pile up but I am slightly ocd when it comes to cleaning standards.   Damn :(   I love dsw. But mostly I'm lazy and buy online   So confusing!   Congratulations! You are a dick. Here's your prize *hands overzealous customer a half-eaten sandwich*   lol I will move the sign but somehow manage to not read it   I don't get it either. On my day off I am sleeping in. I haven't even had coffee at 7:45. I am still not dressed. And yet these people set their alarms for 5 and are up and ready because SHOE SHOPPING.    is there any way you can go on vacation or something for a week or two?   hmmm I'm going to guess this would make you shit?   no no no  you are either together 100% and having sex or you are broken up and not having contact. he is taking advantage of the free sex imo   lukewarm coffee is the worst.   oh well in that case I have no idea what went wrong lol   the coffee machine is off. the power is off. your coffee will be cold. GO AWAY   *I MUST BUY SHOES AT 7:59 AM*  BRAINS   Working retail has convinced me that people can't/don't read signs. Park here? Oh ok I'll park way the hell over here where I'm not supposed to.  Wet floor? bathroom out of order? well I'll just move the sign out of the way and go pee anyway.   ("Well can I get chocolate? NO!? NOT EVEN CHOCOLATE SHAKES!?!? Well... how about vanilla? WHAAAT!?")   When the shake machine is down that means ALL flavors.  =0 Yes, even strawberry.      my mom used to do that all the time. I tried explaining it's bad but she swears by it   would a kid drink black coffee? As a full grown adult I still won't drink coffee black   Accio espwesso!   I so would have fake died   oh man I hated the taste of coffee until I was like 16   baby bottles full of mountain dew.  and they wonder why their teeth are fucked up by the time they are 3....   ok well I am an adult and I want to make a wand/get a stuffed owl plush`   tbh they look/sound pretty gross so.... yeah   I bend over sweeping/mopping all day so I have similar back pain :(   doesn't it hurt your back?   uh....   does that horse have down syndrome?   waffle fries and wedges are not the same!!! damn you pizza huttttttttt   same here. and I *lived* in texas   got one of these at big lots. it was awful.  also. poor, lonely carrot   well, that is mildly infuriating   like fiberglass?   Personally, I love the way it turned out :D  hilarious   was it any good?   yummy   that looks delicious   uh, next time spoon the batter into individual cookies   I can't stand them.     Also: people who park in the handicapped spot because they're "just going to be a minute."    what card shufflers or drugstore.com lol      Mama OOOOOOOooooo  And... if/when the check gets returned at least it's your manager's ass on the line now and not yours   I swear to god sometimes I conceal my undereyes and it just makes them look *worse*!   weather= decent  traffic= sucks     insert racist comment here. no seriously I couldn't park at the gas station because two different people were parked diagonally, taking up two spots.   the squirrels on my campus would do this too, I guess the students gave them snacks.   omg she looks so much older! better start chasing boys off with baseball bats   let him in!   concealing    well next time tell them they can buy them on drugstore.com, for some unexplainable reason....   card shuffler? I can't imagine that's a big seller   couldn't they just... rip the spanx? I don't understand this, at all   uh..... what?    I do it but I tie all the handles into knots so the groceries don't escape the bags in my trunk   lol audiobooks + deaf people = ????   Then it sounds like you are already trying to compromise. You are willing to do some things to make him happy but crossing the line at what would make you feel violated. That is perfectly ok.    I straight up told my ex-boyfriend that bdsm was important to me. If he wanted to try it, good. If not, well I will probably end up leaving you for someone who will.  It was heartless for me to say but I was being 100% honest. I did end up leaving him for someone else, but it was years down the road.    In my mind, sex isn't the most important thing in a relationship, but it is important.  Not only was the sex bad but we had other problems as well. So it would be simplistic to say that I left him because of sex and the lack of kink.  But he could have at least had enough consideration to try.  It's not like I wanted to tie him up and use a strap on with him, but a little role playing isn't too much to ask, right? lol    As far as the kidnapping though, the state would have to prove he kept her against her will and I doubt they would throw resources into a scenario like this.     *HUGS* I guess I have to keep in mind that not all people have the same experiences. Everyone has their own valid way of reacting.   The best approach would be getting involved in the local bdsm community. Usually they have munches and you can get to know everyone.  They usually don't let just anyone in off the street and have known each other for years, making sure shit like this doesn't happen on their watch.   Your mentality disgusts me. What if this was your daughter? Wife? Mother?  Yes, meeting strangers off the internet can be dangerous. I'm sure she has "learned her lesson".   If the rapist truly knew what the fuck he was doing he would have made her sign a contract. While she may have agreed to having sex involving rape play, she did not consent to being held prisoner for three days. She did not consent to being anally raped. BOTH people were not going about this the correct way. A detailed discussion of hard limits should have been conducted beforehand and a safeword so that when he crossed the line she would at least have the opportunity to signal her distress. Whether that would have stopped him or not.   At the very least, jail time or not, this guy needs to be labelled as a sexual offender   It may take years to fully process. When I was raped I believed for years that I deserved it.  Of course years later it was interfering with my having a healthy sex life as I would have flash-backs in the middle of sex and freeze up, start crying, etc.  Whether you feel guilty or not, it's still going to be a psychological trauma.   YES. When meeting someone online you need to have a friend who you call to check in with who can then call the police if you do not keep in touch with. Obviously since this was a rape scenario they couldn't meet in a public place but for anyone who may be reading please get to know the person in person beforehand and make sure they are not going to abuse your trust.   Please get her to a counselor as well. This is a trauma and may take years or even decades to stop hurting her psyche.  	104
 Yes, senior members of UKIP think so too. UKIP failed to convince 600,000 voters who actually did vote for UKIP at the Euro election to so again at the general - losing support throughout the campaign.  While the figure nationally is impressive, but it failed to win the seats it had a good shot at. Even Carswell lost support.   12 months ago UKIP were competitive in 11 seats, in February they hit a poll high of 17%, and fell to 12% at the end of the actual campaign. By any reasonable standard thats a failed campaign, more people wanted to vote UKIP at the start of the campaign than actually voted UKIP at the end of it. UKIP supporters would do well to think about why that was.  Interestingly their polling bounced briefly on each debate, but fell sharply in the week afterwards.      They did lose 600,000 voters compared to the European Elections.   Also doesn't require 6 buses of riot police to escort rugby fans to the ground!   Admittedly its taken 24 years for an active F1 driver to compete in Le Mans, but Hulkenberg just finished the race [not mentioning the result].   True. We're just as bad though. England fans have [sung anti-IRA chants at Scotland supporters](http://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2014/nov/19/england-fans-anti-ira-songs-scotland-match-audio), Celtic routinely sing [pro-IRA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82MXTJrJtTY) chants and sectarian songs.  If you offend easily don't go anywhere near an old firm derby in Scotland and avoid Millwall fans like the plague.   I suspect he's in the running to replace Kimi if Ferrari don't pick up the option in July. Ricciardo's availability is uncertain, Williams almost certainly have an option on Bottas, so Hulkenberg would certainly be in the frame.   Having a driver with long experience of the Mercedes powertrain would certainly be attractive to Ferrari, which might swing their thinking away from Ricciardo.   The BBC reported the story as it affects the UK and none of the victims were British - the problem here being teenagers becoming radicalised, not waves of suicide bombing victims.  I really don't see the issue with their take because the greater tragedy is that he's not alone and others are being groomed as we speak and that will only result in more victims.     In law the licence fee is a tax and because of that the BBC has the same prosecution power HMRC does.      What she was alluding to was power structure and privilege - the currency of distribution and decision making rather than overt racism or gender discrimination. The two are very often confused, but also often intertwined.  I'll give you a real world example this goes back to the 80s.   My father belonged to a village golf club near the large town I grew up in. The golf club wasn't open to female members unless signed in by male players and there were no BME members despite the nearby town being highly diverse. It was in modern terms actually sexist and functionally racist even if the latter was only partially intentional.  My father was not wealthy, upper class, nor were the other club members, but his job involved the distribution of public money into building projects. All the work went to other club members, while deals were not done on the golf course the relationships that drove the decisions were made there and only there. The councillors who made decisions on projects were members too - all very cozy - not actually nor intentionally corrupt but functionally so.  Over 30 years that meant that enough public money to build around a quarter of a million housing units went to the denizens of one very small village golf club and seven or eight businesses located nearby. Those relationships persisted for more than a quarter of a century. That was just the way things were, and are, done.   Basically there was a privileged power structure around the club which was both racist and sexist in some form and completely exclusionary.  This wasn't some well known gentlemen's club for the super rich, or a parliamentary cabal controlling the country, it was simply how things were done everywhere. The vestiges of that power structure remain - they are far less overt in the 21st century but they absolutely exist.  In short form all she did in a professional context was make a poor choice of words on a university twitter account 'white trash' which she admits was wrong, and ask white people not to attend a meeting specifically BME women. There were some additional tweets, but those were on a personal account, unconnected to her work and are indeed how that community expresses itself.     That's a straw man argument you've constructed around what *you* think her job is. As a white male I'm not offended nor am I injured by being *asked politely* not to attend an event specifically designed for BME women, its actually a very reasonable request.  As to her comments in the video response she's completely correct - it's a highly academic view and few will understand it expressed in the way it was, but it is accurate. In my society I am not robbed of opportunity by my race or gender - many people are and without good reason. Many right wingers will argue that isn't the case because of positive discrimination and what they see as reverse racism, but they don't exist in a society where the appearance of their name on a CV causes it to be removed from consideration, nor do they exist in world where there is debate over the validity of their Englishness because their parents were immigrants or they were born into a given religion. What most right wingers complain of is actually perceived loss of power.  His job is to teach and mentor. Half his student body is female, as are many members of staff and colleagues on his advisory panels. Expressing this opinion is utterly disabling to that work and basically means he can't do that work without concerns over his partiality.   Yes, its referred to in the original guardian piece.   What he said was not merely controversial, it was absolutely wrong no matter the context, it is an outdated and thoroughly incorrect gender stereotype for which there is no justification whatsoever. He accepts this.  Had, as he now claims, his remarks been intended in a jocular, ironic way, one would imagine he was attempting to start a discussion over the role of women in science. Instead he dismissed the contribution of his female students and colleagues summarily and now complains that he has been dismissed equally summarily, even going so far as to suggest labs should be segregated.   No they weren't. He didn't conduct a discussion on the matter with the audience, he didn't invite questions, he simply made his speech and left.   He is now claiming the greatest hits - moment of madness - remarks were meant to be humorous - not sexist etcetera.   We apparently believe as a nation that this kind of treatment has been warranted for politicians or other public figures for more than 30 years - this treatment is the raison d'etre of the tabloid press.   Nobody raised an eyebrow over the countless people the Daily Mail or the News of the World did this to - celebrities, we are told, deserve it because they have 'chosen' to be public figures. Social media has allowed that standard to apply to every walk of life. It might be wrong, but the way you're applying it, is a double standard.  The point is that it's obvious to any reasonable person, in the light of his comments, he is unable to do his job with any credibility.   Bahar Mustafa isn't a senior academic and doesn't have a role in educating and mentoring the next generation of scientists. Its not the same thing at all - and her words were met with equal derision and scorn.   Turned into?  Where have you been living all these years - have you seen the way we operate the criminal justice system let alone the tabloid press?   You missed the part where he called for a sexually segregated workplace. He made it very clear that women have no place in *his* lab.  He seems unaware that he summarily dismissed the habits of every female scientist at his academic institutions and the workplace behavior of every woman he has ever practiced alongside in two sentences. His female cohorts were not given any quarter or any right of reply - so why should he receive different treatment?    There was no ambiguity in his remarks, he left no room for doubt about his opinion of female students or women in the workplace. How can he possibly operate in any 21st century workplace having said what he did?   There is no justification for his remarks - he admits that himself.   His complaint is, in essence, that he has been denied due process and the speed of his dismissal was cruel.   He seems unaware that he summarily dismissed the habits of every female scientist at his academic institutions and the workplace behavior of every woman he has ever practiced alongside in two sentences. His female cohorts were not given any quarter or any right of reply - so why should he receive different treatment?  He cannot, having said what he did, have any shred of credibility in the classroom or as an adviser.  The problem, he proposed, was that men and women fall in love in the lab and that this was disruptive to science. Moreover, he said, women cry when their work is criticised. For the good of science, he suggested, labs might be sexually segregated.       Its funny that the more people know about what's actually happening with the car the less happy they are with the racing.  Pretty much all of these arguments were deployed each time we've had a major engine shift since the 90s - I heard some of the complaints made in the first turbo era! The whole point of shifting the technology platform *is* to slow the cars down. The speed always comes back.   Yes, the racing has become dull, especially this year, but its simply a need for closer racing.   In the 80s and 90s everyone was going nuts because engines lasted 5 minutes and the cars were held together with tape. Now everyone is getting upset because the engines and cars do last. Having whinged endlessly because hard tyres made dull races, fans apparently want them back. The same goes for refueling and whole host of other things.   The world and its wife is wishing mortality would catch up with Bernie whilst lionising the age when he did actually have full control of the sport - in this era the teams are in charge but the problems are all Bernie it seems.   Everything old really is new again!  Murray Walker talking about the 1986 Spanish Grand Prix in 2013:-  It was a race that was all about fuel management and tyre wear - don't let anyone tell you that the current era is the first in which drivers have had to take care of their cars during a grand prix!   Remarkable how quickly Cameron has turned into Major.          I don't disagree, but I was referring to the period following the election.   Given the only budget areas not affected by Osborne's latest cuts will be Education, Health and International Development the plan seems to be to cut so hard and so deep everywhere that no one knows what the hell is happening.   The plan, such as it is, appears to be the Teapartynomics pioneered by Bobby Jindal in Louisiana and Sam Brownback in Kansas - ultra low taxation and spending on the grounds that allowing the super rich more wealth means they will invest more. It has unsurprisingly failed spectacularly and killed growth stone dead.   Interestingly Kansas actually has a law requiring a balanced budget, similar in nature to Osborne's blatantly political Mansion House idea.   I grow more concerned with the policy ideas of the atlanticist faction of the Tory party each day.   It depends on the system but under most forms of PR UKIP would have gained 80 or so MP's and the SNP 30. You can argue about the electorate, but ultimately 35% of the UK electorate *chose* not to vote including  29% of the Scottish electorate, despite the stakes involved. The gap between the yes vote and the general election vote is more credibly explained by lower turnout and a divided vote among the Unionist parties.  The fact remains that the SNP would *still* have a majority in Scotland in any Westminster system you choose, and the Scottish Parliament elections yielded a similar result to the GE even under PR. My libertarian friends would describe that as the tyranny of the majority (I think they're nuts) but that's where it is.  If you take the Indyref and general election results together with one eye on the manifestos then Scottish voters voted for either DevoMax or Home Rule - certainly the latter is what is being sought by the SNP and the polling on independence since Indyref shows a narrow majority in favor of separation. No credible observer of politics doubts there will be another referendum in the next decade, but the SNP need to build a credible fiscal case and solve the EU membership issue. My bet is they will seek a federal setup and then argue for independent membership of the EU.  You can't sit there and ignore the size of the victory based on a felicitous argument about PR whilst pointing at the 29% of Scottish voters that gave up a say in the matter as if that proves something.  Personally I favor PR with mandatory voting and a none of the above option.   I haven't argued that the FPTP system isn't unrepresentative - in fact I've been a lifelong supporter of PR and would rather have had AV than FPTP even if the electoral reform offering was the worst form of PR.   Its certainly the case that this election was the most unrepresentative result in British electoral history - but that doesn't make the SNP's achievement any less of a success - it certainly is a vote for some form of independence. No matter if they achieved 59 MP's or a more reasonable 30 MP's it's still a landslide any way you look at it.   I really don't see how you can argue that with growth down, recepts down, debt, borrowing and deficit up, employment growing but only at the bottom end of the job market, and facing a guaranteed period of economic uncertainty driven by the referendum that the UK is well placed to handle shocks.   Well, in actual fact you're the one choosing the goal posts. Since your original point was that the FPTP is easy and that's why the SNP won - you've since gone on to argue that FPTP is easy for the SNP and difficult for UKIP.   My point was that the Scottish result is a massive achievement - a landslide victory for the SNP in every possible way. If you really wish to contrast the two the SNP removed a manifesto commitment it has had for 20 years and moved to home rule agenda driven by the result of the referendum. UKIP moved further right than it ought to have (according to their own people) and, riven by internal schisms, failed in 9 places where it had a very decent shot at victory. In essence, buoyed by fleeting successes, it tried to compete everywhere and split its focus. Basically UKIP tried to run before it could walk and would have done much better had it pursued the SNP's more focussed strategy over the last 5/10 years.  You also can't argue that the SNP benefited from the referendum and not acknowledge that UKIP benefited from the Euro elections and two by-elections in a similar fashion.  The SNP has sought PR throughout its history, UKIP having had a campaign failure, has suddenly seen the light on PR and I have little sympathy for its position for that reason.  Clacton wise Carswell had 53.0% of the vote in 2010, 59% in 2014, and *fell* to 44.5% in 2015 - still a massive result, but it has a great deal more to do with Carswell being a trusted MP than it does UKIP policy, given that UKIP had no national manifesto at the time. Indeed Carswell, having failed to become UKIP leader seems poised to leave the party.   I don't disagree that the election system is unrepresentative for small parties, but you're attempting to use this fact to argue that the SNP vote is not a major achievement.   UKIP won the votes of just under 7% of the English population, whereas the SNP won the votes of just under 30% of the Scottish population - the SNP's success was far larger than UKIP's.    So you're arguing that FPTP is an easy electoral system for the SNP, but a difficult one for UKIP.   No it isn't. You need an extraordinary swing 8% to move the needle especially when there are two strong parties in the same spectrum. As a result of the Tory and UKIP position at the last election Labour would need at 10% uniform swing to gain office, just as the Tories have complained of bias because the collective strength of Labour and the Lib Dems has meant they would need a similarly large swing to gain a serious majority.  The SNP managed a 30% swing - unprecedented in the history of British politics.   No. All of the polling conducted since the referendum shows greater than 50% support for independence, even among unionist party voters - it really is quite extraordinary.  It would appear that many in this sub can't accept what is happening in Scotland.   Nonsense. Last quarter's growth sank to 0.3% from 0.6% in the previous two quarters - the reason was the construction sector shrank by 1.6% again! Despite weak growth in services. Construction seems to be Osborne's bte noire.  The employment market is recovering but at the bottom end not the top end, which is affecting treasury receipts. More minimum wage jobs are being created than well paid jobs, and youth and graduate employment remains disasterous.  Borrowing is up, spending is up, debt is up, growth is down, the wrong kind of jobs are appearing. I can't think of a single one of his promises he's actually kept to! I don't see how you can possibly claim that Osborne is either well regarded or vindicated.   The downgrade in outlook is really a warning that the UK is very poorly placed to absorb any economic shocks. The uncertainty over a Brexit would form a potential shock, and a Brexit itself would be a giant economic shock.         Arrivabene has said there are [no guarantees](http://www.crash.net/f1/news/219831/1/arrivabene-we-have-drivers-that-can-jump-into-a-ferrari.html) over Kimi's seat because there are other options.          Its normal globally, and the UK has relatively low levels. Social housing, major infrastructure like crossrail - those two alone amount to around 20 billion in government spending during the last parliament.   All major housing developments have a social housing component and to make that affordable for developers each receives some form of government assistance (profitability and cashflow on development is narrower than people think).  This is one of the many reasons government spending isn't like household accounts - if your home stops spending at Tescos you don't have to worry about Tesco going under.   To be honest most of the people I speak to think the nation has an overdraft and a credit card. Its embarrassing.   Default is unlikely but not impossible. The rating directly affects the amount of interest paid on the national debt - lower ratings = more interest.  What made the credit rating agencies look foolish was using the argument you outlined as a reason not to downgrade, and that was a very large part of the causes of the 2008 recession.    Osborne cut infrastructure spending to the bone which immediately caused a collapse in the UK construction sector, at which point he started pouring money into it all of a sudden despite his pre-election and 2010 promises not to.   There were external problems as well, as you say, but no serious economists thought Osborne's initial zeal was wise in the circumstances.   Basically Balls was correct - Osborne cut spending, particularly infrastructure spending, too quickly in 2010 which tanked the construction sector and nearly tipped us into a second recession. He spent 2011 and 2012 backpedaling and the consequent rise in the deficit and spending hurt his targets badly. The 2013 credit rating downgrade caused a further rise in debt interest - these were among the reasons that he couldn't meet his deficit reduction targets. 'Plan A' went out the window very quickly indeed despite his rhetoric to the contrary.  The downgrade in outlook is really a warning that the UK is very poorly placed to absorb any economic shocks, and a Brexit would be a giant economic shock.   A very large part of the 2008 recession was that the ratings agencies didn't downgrade their outlooks or credit ratings so there was, in effect, no warning of the coming storm.   Wiping out the [deficit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Sector_Net_Cash_Requirement), officially known as the  Public Sector Net Cash Requirement, isn't the same thing as wiping out government debt - [debt vs deficit](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25944653). Osborne intends to wipe out the former (around 80 billion) but won't be able to do much with the latter (1.36 trillion).   Removing the deficit brings down the interest paid on the debt. The economic discussion is about how fast you can do this without destroying parts of the economy because that affects growth (low or negative growth increases the deficit). For reference government spending is around 46% of the economy down from 55% in 2010.  The credit rating applies to government debt bonds, if the rating falls too low then banks are not allowed to invest in them and it also directly affects the value of the interest we pay on the debt which is currently accruing at 2 billion a week thanks to the deficit - the lower the rating the greater the interest. There is a decent explanation [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_credit_rating).  This is very bad news as it indicates low confidence in the financial stability of the UK and its ability to meet its obligations.            You could make the same argument about virtually any policy area you care to mention.   The point of a democracy is for those in power to make a case to the public for the policy direction they wish to take (I don't believe this is done enough anymore). The public won't accept a direction they don't agree with and it will just end up in a giant fight, just as climate change has.         The grand prix there is going ahead in 2016 according to the site that cannot be named.   God I hope not. We need a clean break from the Blair/Brown governments.   I agree - but I'd also point out that the grey generation are some of the largest users of medical weed out there - and that's resulted in opinion changing among that age group significantly too.  Tipping point is almost there, we'll see it in our lifetimes.   Have a look around - most of the recent polling hits the same notes. I chose that particular link because it was the most detailed I could find - there is wide support for cannabis policy reform but little else.  My point was there is too much variation on the issue. Most of the polls on reform come out around 50 - 59% - not solid enough ground *yet*, but it's coming. Once the polling moves up an order of magnitude and the 2010 intake become senior then the main parties will change their approach.   You'd have to get the public to vote for a manifesto commitment to *really* change the core approach on drugs policy and there just isn't enough public support on the subject for real change.  You can fiddle with it a little, I'd much prefer an evidence based approach, but it's simply too controversial. Just look at the debate on prison reform. We can reduce recidivism by 90% with proper community based sentencing for non-violent offences, but the public don't want to hear it and the debate takes place over rapists and murderers just as the drugs debate focusses on dead teenagers, gangs, and evil drug lords.  For the LD's and Greens who have absolutely no influence on major policy its the easiest commitment in the world because there is no chance of their implementing it.   You can blame the main parties all you want to but the reality is it's [50/50 or very close to that](https://yougov.co.uk/news/2011/06/16/drugs-policies-dont-work/) across most public polling on the subject - which basically makes it a lose-lose issue. Until public opinion on the whole canon of drugs policy moves beyond 60% in regular polling governments won't touch it.   Regular polling on Gay marriage hit the tipping point at around that mark. Drugs are well on their way to an evidence based approach after the 2020 general election thankfully.      Such is right wing thinking on drugs I'm afraid.   *Only* 50% really?   We haven't had a national government with more than 41% of the vote since Major - according to the commentary three of the victories since 1992 were landslides and they had at most an 8% swing, 30% is unprecedented. The last time a national election turned out a 50%+ result was Stanley Baldwin in 1923.  The SNP discovered that talk of independence or another referendum were indeed a turn off for voters and removed it from their manifesto, they were given a mandate instead to fight for greater fiscal autonomy, their manifesto commitments essentially add up to home rule.  As I said earlier the Indyref and general election result taken together with the independence polling since the referendum appear to be a rejection of the timing and the plan for independence, but an endorsement of the idea and of moving in that direction and attempting to answer the key fiscal questions whilst resolving the EU membership debate. I would be very surprised if the SNP don't attempt to move for independent membership of the EU during this parliament.  The SNP are already moving toward fiscal autonomy, and the national government will either be forced into a federal approach or Scotland will move toward independence once there is greater evidence of Scottish national solvency. Any way you examine the outcomes it is a vote for independence or effective independence.   Thats not the case, this is just their latest prototype. They admitted a while ago that their dyno wasn't correlating with the track work and they couldn't figure out why.   The trade union conversation has really become about money more than policy. Labour members were asked during the last election to donate (a bit too frequently in my view) to fund the campaign. I certainly did - and that's what it comes down to.   If we are going to decry the influence of money in politics be it left or right then we, the membership, have to be prepared to put our money where our mouths are.    They achieved a 30% swing and took 50% of the Scottish vote with 1,454,436 - double the vote share of Labour and fully half of the electorate on 71.1% turnout. In any electoral system thats a landslide.   Personally I favour PR but you can't sit there and pretend this wasn't a landslide and a clear statement of intent from the Scottish Electorate. If there is a majority in Scotland for the Union it's an extremely narrow one 50/50 at best. Were the voting trends we've seen since 1997 to continue there will be independence in a decade or less.   What on earth are you talking about?   The SNP won all but three Scottish seats under FPTP - one of the hardest systems to achieve that under!                        I think you may be underestimating the amount of switchers.   Perhaps unionist voters stayed at home, but if they did it would have to have been in small numbers, some Scottish seats saw 80% turnout! I really think you can't look at the Indyref and general election results together and not see them as a vote for home rule and eventual independence. The result also matches a trend in SP elections that has been going on since the first Lab/Lib coalition post 1997 - declining unionist votes.  Even looking upon what the unionist parties have to offer Scotland kindly I can't see a resurgence for them in Scotland without a very big screw up from the SNP that forces the electorate to look elsewhere for leadership.   16% lower turnout in the GE than Indyref easily explains the gap.  An overwhelming landslide in favor of a party that has had Scottish Independence at its core for 20 years might also be an indicator of intent.               The level of population in remote areas has nothing at all to do with the expense of maintaining and delivering infrastructure to those areas.   What's amusing about your statement is that the eras many people in this sub think fondly of are all eras where Bernie had more power over the sport than the teams did collectively.   Interesting to note that the modern conservative party logo bears a striking resemblance to the [Tory Party](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/89/Royal_Oak.png) logo   If you believe GE was not a vote for future independence then I have some beans you might be interested in purchasing.   The argument (as its made in this sub and elsewhere) is that Scotland receives more money from Westminster via the Barnett formula than Wales or Northern Ireland and therefore is well off. England is, in essence, a generous parent and Scotland should be happy with what it has because it couldn't do better on its own. It is as patronising and paternalistic of an argument against independence as exists.  The point of the remaining statement, as is quite obvious (because that's what the barnett formula pays for), is to serve as an example of why the basic infrastructure required in Scotland is quite different to that required in the majority of England.  If you have an opinion on what I've said state it plainly, I'm not playing the quoteback/leading question game.   The GE and Indyref results taken together suggest the people of Scotland were convinced of the idea of independence but not the timing or the details of the plan presented for it by the SNP.   The fact is that if the referendum campaign had run another month or two Scotland would be independent now - that cannot be ignored.   Its rather like the Eurosceptics that argue that we must repatriate powers from Brussels. Ask them what powers and the response is "all of them", ask what problems this causes the UK and the response is "big ones" or "we must free ourselves from the EUSSR" - its a definition free debate.  So Cameron has said he wants treaty reform, but hasn't defined what that looks like (same situation for Thatcher and Major), allowing him to get what he can and either claim its the path to treaty reform which is a slow process, or claim that this is the best deal we could get, and declare victory. My bet is the latter.  Arguably this is what Thatcher did with the rebate and Major did with the Social Policy exemption. Thatcher regretted her decision and 1970s support by the end of her premiership.  Ultimately we want the trade and military support without the federalism and don't see that as a lack of reciprocity - just a recent surveys have suggested the British want free access to Europe without Europe having free access to the UK. Its a very tiresome position.   Its wealthier per head only because some wag created a self serving argument that allowed the English people making it to paint themselves as generous and superior. As an Englishman I'm embarrassed to hear such an argument made.  Anyone with any actual experience of living in Scotland realises that nothing could be further from the truth. Not least because England doesn't have to deal with the realities of getting emergency healthcare to a community 4 hours from the nearest hospital, or delivering education and utilities to villages so remote they are closer to Oslo than London.   Independence is inevitable.    The UK broke up in 1914, everything done since then regarding policy towards Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland has been part delaying tactic and part nation building.   During the referendum campaign no major party leader could articulate a single sentence answer to why the Union is important, or a positive vision for the future of Scotland within the Union. The people of Scotland saw that and voted accordingly.   Precisely what Thatcher and Major did when confronted with the same problem - get some kind of concession and declare victory.   That is exactly what led to the FOCA/FISA war, the rise of Bernie from team owner to leader of the sport, and the invention of the modern FIA.  What the teams wanted was a team led sport, they got it, could not agree on anything and so left it to Bernie.   The teams wanted control again in the early 2010s and that led to RedBull effectively ending FOTA, the creation of the F1 strategy group, the current financial settlement, and the present demands to leave it to Bernie again.  Past is prologue, especially in F1.  Bernie will give you exactly what you want and merrily watch it burn down around you whilst playing both ends against the middle. The object lesson being be careful what you wish for - you might just get it.     There is every chance of his going full Schumacher. The reason that Ferrari are the only team to support refueling's return is they know there is more to running a big team than the car - data is key - and to win again they not only need to improve the car but also disrupt the rules in a way that affects Mercedes ability to calculate strategy.         To both you and /u/Kingy_who/ i'd point out that those nominations add up to only 162 of the 232 parliamentary party so there are still 70 MP's left to declare an allegiance.   If past is prologue those members will declare for Corbyn and Creagh in order to ensure a debate.   The 7 most marginal seats have Tory MPs but with a collective majority of 900 votes. The next 20 have a majority of less than 10,000 collectively.   It wouldn't take a dramatic improvement in the fortunes of the second place parties in the most marginal seats to wipe out the Tory majority.      Only 31 of the 137 F1 teams that have ever existed have won races, only 22 of those have won more than two races, and only 13 teams have won more than 10.  Even Porsche only won 1 Grand Prix.  Top 5 most wins in the history of the sport:-  - Ferrari 221 - McLaren 182 - Williams 114 - Lotus (58' - 94') 79 - Red Bull Racing 50 - Brabham 35  Only 5 of the 22 teams that have won more than two races are still active in the sport.   Get the election results spreadsheet and have a look at the bottom 100 seats. Even under FPFS the shift in the second placed parties combined with the change in electoral landscape make the loss of 100 or more Tory seats likely in any case.   That's the real message behind this election - the Tories played well and scored a majority they didn't expect whilst everyone else fizzled out and arguably fear won the day - but the electoral landscape over the next two election cycles look very poor for both of the main parties as neither can count on their core vote in the way that they used to.      For the reasons stated above - in all the permutations of voting systems the Tories won the last election in terms of seats. However 7 of those seats are based on only 900 voters, the next 20 marginals less than 10,000. Their win is razor thin and they know it - 10,900 voters actually decided a Tory majority rather than a coalition.  They may actually need the additional votes nationally to count going forward. If the LibDems were to improve in only 2 seats, and UKIP in 5 and Labour 5 their majority is gone. Electoral reform might actually offer a hedge against UKIP depending on the system.   Rosberg to Ferrari  Bottas to Mercedes      I think the Tories are about an inch away from going for electoral reform themselves. What the Tories like to call the 'bias' in the FPTP electoral system - two strong left of centre parties meaning they would need an unlikely swing to win - has now reversed with the collapse of the LibDems and the rise of UKIP.   The implementation of boundary commission's review is now not so attractive as it would create new and uncertain marginals and cost them 8 of their 12 seat majority at a stroke.  The inherent risk in the referendum is that it shatters the internal Tory coalition and does for UKIP what the IndyRef did for the SNP - creates a 'neverendum' situation with the added perils of defections to UKIP.   The only way they might cling on were UKIP to become stronger is something like STV.   Well, they charge the traders, not the bosses. What we actually need to do is go after the people at the top - only then will the poisonous culture in banking change.   In the USA, Canada, and Australia illegal immigration is the serious problem. While we also have an illegals problem it's nowhere near as big as it is there. But we realise that interrupting commerce with draconian searches is a much more costly problem than the immigration.  We already have a points based system, it's based on the Australian system with the addition of tiering, and it works well - it's just a byzantine nightmare to navigate and it's very expensive to the user.     Cameron's embarrassment is twofold - you can't crack down on non-eu immigration (which is the largest part) without hurting the economy, and open borders is a red line for the rest of the EU even though in many respects they have a larger problem with immigration than the UK does.  The bigger problem, from my perspective, with the amount of oxygen the ludicrous debate on immigration is sucking up is that the global economy is weak, the banks are far from under control, and if the pattern holds we are three to five years from another recession.   Wasting time on a referendum and its attendant crowing will do nothing but put off businesses investment and allow the tories to ignore the economy whilst tearing the hair out in public.      Depends on the timing. If you could get it into a period along with several other big events, Pride for example and the Hyde Park concert series, Formula E, and maybe resurrect the British Empire Trophy as an LMP race, all while sharing logistic support, routes and facilities there could be a way. Having it around the British Grand Prix weekend would also cut shipping costs.  I've often thought staging the European Grand Prix as a series of events on road courses and moving from one capital city to the next - London - Paris - Madrid - Berlin - each year so the cost isn't entirely on one city might work. There are promoters who would take it on.   And yet their system often prioritizes unskilled workers - and the fact remains that the points system is only one of several systems!  The second study was one I mentioned, from the UKBA Migration Watch Committee because it's conclusion is complimentary but focusses on only A8 data. If you actually read the study rather than the hyperbolic press reports it too concludes that:-  We find no association between working-age migrants and native employment: (i) in buoyant economic times; (ii) for EU migrants; (iii) for the period 1975-1994. By contrast, we find a negative association between working-age migrants and native employment: (i) in depressed economic times; (ii) for non-EU migrants; (iii) for the period 1995-2010.  So outside of recessionary periods (Q2 2008 - Q2 2009) when there is positive growth there is no link, and looking at the wider dataset, as the first report does rather than just considering A8 data, there is also no link.  Youth unemployment has been a problem for some time - especially since the credit crunch struck in the mid 2000s. Looking at the geographic data it's mainly focussed in inner cities where educational attainment is poor. The shadow economy is also a factor - those employed in illegal enterprises still show up in the figures along with gap year students and young people working in the voluntary sector or caring for relatives.  Companies are less willing to train staff, less willing to hire younger people, and often have young people working in internships who are entirely supported by the benefits system or the bank of mum and dad. Public sector job cuts also disproportionately affect young people as the public sector is more willing to hire the young.  My good friends daughter was forced to work through four years of unpaid full-time internships prior to finding a job, another friend's daughter went for one of this government's much vaunted apprenticeships only to discover it was a complete con and she was stuck as the tea girl for a year both received JSA and were classed as unemployed throughout.  The reality is the majority of young people with good educational attainment are not competing for the same jobs as migrants.   My original claim was that the ''Australian' style system actually prioritizes many professions that UKIP considers to be unskilled and unworthy.' The points system doesn't consider skilled or unskilled it simply prioritises the professions the economy needs more of to expand and fast-tracks those, there is also a secondary general immigration system in place that takes 18 - 24 months to complete, and a third system dealing with de-facto partners and family. At the moment you'll get very high points if you're a general labourer or hairdresser because those are in demand.  Your point was that 'Points systems are designed to bring in skilled workers, not just to make up the numbers.' And that simply isn't the case - skills are not the issue, demand is, and you can still immigrate fairly easily anyway.  Odd that the highest periods of youth unemployment were between 1992 and 1998 and between 2008 and now. Quite how a quote on Labour's early 2000s immigration policy supports your argument on youth unemployment is as mystifying as your *highly* dated view of what working class is.  The Major report on the subject by National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) is entitled Examining the relationship between immigration and unemployment using National Insurance Number registration data.  It concluded:  Our results seem to confirm the lack of impact of migration on unemployment in aggregate. We find no association between migrant inflows and claimant unemployment.  Overall therefore, our results indicate a lack of any significant correlation between migrant inflows and changes aggregate claimant count rates, in line with the general message emerging from previous research that migration has had generally negligible effect on unemployment rates.  In fact studies by The Borders Agency Migration Advisory Committee, NIESR, and a review of the data by Oxford Universitys Migration Observatory all found no significant link between immigration and youth unemployment or employment in general.   They had talks on this in 2014, Westminster Council is actually running a consultation on it this year - there are serious moves afoot.   You very much mis-understand the post war landscape and economy based your commentary. Especially the Blitz, London was the worst hit city with over a million homes destroyed, but that amounted to less than 10% of the housing stock, in Coventry only 2,306 houses were destroyed and all of that had been rebuilt or replaced by the end of the war - not in the post war years.   Given your quote on points based systems "Points systems are designed to bring in skilled workers" you have been proved wrong - the point of a points based system is to focus on the economies *needs*, not to differentiate between skilled and unskilled.   Youth unemployment is always high after a recession, it has zero to with immigration. Kippers do love to have it both ways - we're allegedly awash with unskilled migrants and they're competing with educated British youngsters for the same jobs. Hmm. No serious research substantiates this and no serious economic thinker believes it - the same thing happened post 1992    Yes a great deal of people had been killed in the war, but we still had to embark on the largest national housebuilding programme ever completed to accommodate the returning troops, refugees, and foreign troops that fought with us - in excess of 1.5 million European people including 180,000 of the 500,000 German POWs who chose to stay despite being used a slave labour after the war.  But the fact remains that we had 16 working people for every pensioner in the UK in 1948, by 2000 that number had shrunk to just 2. Far from 'maintaining industrial productivity' we were desperately trying to rebuild industry of all types - everything had been repurposed for the war and the country was virtually bankrupt.  Right now our working age population is 32.7m out of an estimated population of 63.7m, fully one half of the population are financially supporting the other half.  Points systems are designed to bring in skilled workers, not just to make up the numbers.  Points based systems are in fact designed to flex with the needs of the economy for almost all of the 2000s Australia's most sought after skills in the points catalog were hairdressers and general labourers. Since the majority of net migration is non-eu and our system is already points based that would suggest that UKIPs assumptions about the needs of the economy are somewhat out of step with reality.   Our birth rate had sunk so low that we were a decade away from population shrinkage, and our pensions (75% of the welfare budget) had become perilously unaffordable. We needed more working age people between 25 and 45, there is only one way to achieve that.  Filling the population gap with immigrants is exactly what the 'Australian' points based immigration system was designed to do.          Probably around the time Farage stops dismissing losing manifestos as drivel, and stops making NHS policy, and other policy on the hoof.  But UKIP does have ideological ground based on its recent manifesto - authoritarian, statist, neoliberal-ultranationalist-conservatism.  Actually what bothers me about the UKIP manifesto is the ignorance of it. We already have in place a points based immigration system based on the Australian one and we have had since 2008, all non-eu migrants on a 3 month or longer non-tourist visa already pay a 200 annual fee for health insurance prior to entering the country, in addition to being required to have travel insurance with repatriation and medical expenses cover. Those from the EU are covered by a reciprocal system - presumably Farage is aware of this as thats how he's covered when working in the EU.   Apparently UKIP is seeking this 'Australian' style system, even though a whopping 23% of Australia's population is foreign born and their system actually prioritizes many professions that UKIP considers to be unskilled and unworthy of in work qualifications like hairdressers, general labourers, stable hands, and horse groomers.  The list of policies in the UKIP manifesto that are already in place is actually very long indeed. Having read the document it seems to be entirely based on what UKIP supporters think is happening in the country as opposed to what is actually happening.  In general UKIP places, morally, what the UK taxpayer pays for, what UKIP considers to be foreign citizens, above what EU governments pay for our citizens, even though the number of UK citizens claiming benefits in the EU outnumbers the amount of EU citizens claiming benefits here and our system is less generous. The party also gives not a moment of thought to the stresses placed on EU government systems by the 2.1 million UK nationals living in the EU even though 400,000 of those people are pensioners and the population we've acquired in return is 98% of working age, but lionises the alleged stresses placed on our systems by migrants. In other words UKIP likes to present itself as a party of fairness, balance, and reciprocity for work but is nothing of the sort.  Its also deeply amusing to me that under UKIP's manifesto if Boris Johnson or Daniel Hannan were prosecuted for speeding they would be deported - both being foreign born citizens - no matter their immigration status.    I should have added 'fear' - it seems to be the strongest motivator for UKIP supporters. Just exactly what are you afraid of?  There are 2.34 million EU Nationals living in the UK, and 2.1 million British citizens in the EU (400,000 of which are pensioners). Our age dependency ratio has finally recovered to a point where we can actually afford our pensioners and that wasn't the case in 2000 when we had two working people for 1 pensioner (in 1948 we had 16).  Of the UK citizenry as a whole 11.9% are foreign born (a group that includes Daniel Hannan and Boris Johnson). That's a lower percentage than the USA, Canada or Australia.  UKIP supporters keep jumping up and down and claiming the world is on fire and the surest sign of that is apparently immigration, not the state of the global economy. Frankly the gut-wrenching small mindedness of the party's platform as a whole makes me weep.      Fundamentally I agree that we need to be fairer to people, but thats not the rhetoric UKIP is famous for.   That experience includes several hundred hours of online debate and 70 hours of doorstep campaigning in Croydon Central during the last election. So yes, it is solid evidence.   What he actually said was:-  "motivated to some extent by racism," while others voted for UKIP out of "despair," believing they were "some kind of anti-establishment party".  Having debated with UKIP supporters for some time both of these statements are entirely accurate. Many of the UKIP supporters I've spoken with fixate on the notion that someone, in essence 'less deserving, is getting something they're not. It often appears that the heart of their arguments is an unfocused feeling of loss of power.  Many UKIP supporters - particularly those on the DT - refer to 'The Establishment' in a negative context and claim their party is funded by its membership. They're often upset to discover that the party's major donors are all members of 'The Establishment' and all donate to 'LibLabCon' - you might be forgiven for thinking that those donors are only after a peerage.        I think if he's consistently qualifying the car below its potential and not challenging Seb regularly in the next few races then Ferrari will give more serious thought than they appear to have at present to replacing him this year.   Personally I believe they already wanted to replace him at the end of this season, but it depends who they want to go with next, and what's in the way in terms of that driver's contract (Seb is also a consideration). Bianchi obviously put a crimp in their long term plan.  If he can't get his qualifying sorted out then, were I Ferrari, i'd go find a younger driver with good speed and hire them on a short contract. Hulkenberg has the speed, Ricciardo or Bottas would make excellent long term replacements.   If they wait a year Rosberg would be out of contract (it's *so* hard to challenge Lewis in the same machinery - I wonder if he's sending a message), and Verstappen or Sainz might be ready for the big time - both have been very impressive.   The point is that other drivers could deliver more in that seat than Kimi has this year and do so more reliably - Ferrari drivers generally leave the team when there is a large gap to their teammate.   Massa for example was consistently earning points, but placing 6th in the WDC when Alonso was turning in 2nds or 3rds. Kimi's situation isn't that bad yet, but it is moving in that direction, and his qualifying is a serious problem - it might easily make the difference between 2nd in the WCC and 3rd.   So the question is twofold - Is he justifying his salary, and is he helping the team more than hurting them? Right now Ferrari could acquire a driver with more potential on vastly less money and still achieve the same or better results.  Disclaimer: I'm a huge fan of Kimi's, I'm not saying he's a bad driver.         Hamilton on Vettel in 2012:  "I think hes a true champion,"   "Hes polite, hes never in trouble, hes squeaky clean and a genuinely nice guy. He speaks incredibly well and carries himself really well. And at the end of the day you have to do the job even if you do have the best car."  The most dominant car/driver combos in F1 history are (in order of percentage of victories in a season):-  - Ascari's 1953 Ferrari 500 (75%);   - Schumacher's 2004 F2004 (72%);   - Jim Clark's 1963 Lotus 25 (70%);  - Vettel's 2013 RB9 (68%);  - Fangio's 1954 Maserati 250F A6GCM (66%);  - Schumacher's 2002 F2002 (64%);  - Jim Clark's 1965 Lotus 33 (60%);  - Vettel's 2011 RB7 and Hamilton's 2014 W05 (57.89%);  - Fangio's 1955 Mercedes W196 (57.18%).  So right now he's tied for 8th on the all time dominance list with Vettel. The distribution of those dates says quite a bit about the history of the sport.   Its a more complicated calculation than 'is he delivering on track' - he's a great driver no question, but is he delivering results and experience at Williams another driver couldn't? Not really.  Williams (have said publicly, indeed Massa himself has said publicly) that they've hit the point where money is more of a drag on the team than driver experience.  Massa is also 34 and at the end of a three year deal, from his point of view he remains marketable in other series with his current results (but knows that won't hold forever), from the team's point of view they could hire a driver on a third of his salary and still deliver the results they're getting. So it might be good timing for both to part ways.  Younger drivers also tend to come with sponsors that could help the team (I don't mean pay drivers), and are generally more attractive to sponsors. Its equally possible Mercedes might cut them a sweetheart deal on engines to take a Merc young driver - they're making a play for Verstappen.            Singapore + Melbourne + Monaco       It won't hurt either, that's a fifth of their losses last year - 10 mil is not pocket change.   Totally awesome!   I've been wondering if the reticence at Lotus over the Renault sale might be an early sign there is an investment coming from Mercedes or a Mercedes aligned business - they will be wary of the Ferrari/HAAS effort and need a guaranteed seats for their young driver programme.  Ricciardo would make a great choice for a resurgent Lotus.   I agree - its a much more complicated calculation than just results.   Every time Rosberg says it's hard to race Lewis in the same machinery I wonder if he's telegraphing a message to Ferrari. If they did keep Kimi for another year Rosberg would be out of contract at the same time that they would be looking for a replacement.   Really unlikely though, as you say.   I think thats what they'll probably do.   But it's possible for them to make a calculation and take in a youngster now who has potential, or a cheaper driver that could produce reliable results without challenging Seb.  When you consider Kimi is on $26 million a year including bonuses, Rosberg on $14.8 million and Hulkenberg is on $4 million and Bottas $1.1 million there are considerable savings to be had.   Might be fun for Ferrari to make a play for Rosberg!!   Its a more complicated calculation than 'is he delivering on track' - he's a great driver no question.   Williams (have said publicly, indeed Massa himself has said publicly) that they've hit the point where money is more of a drag on the team than driver experience.   Massa is also 34 and at the end of a three year deal, from his point of view he remains marketable in other series with his current results (but knows that won't hold forever), from the team's point of view they could hire a driver on a third of his salary and still deliver the results they're getting.

Its equally possible Mercedes might cut them a sweetheart deal on engines to take a Merc young driver - they're making a play for Verstappen.   I totally agree, they owe him for all the development work he's done. But they've reached the point of diminishing returns on the development and, at this point, its the money more than the experience holding them back.   Equally on track Bottas is starting to overhaul him more regularly and overall, they could get better shopping around. That wasn't true last year.   All true. Really I'm saying that he isn't extracting the maximum benefit from the car for the team reliably enough and that's what generally does for Ferrari drivers. That spin allowed Bottas within 20 points of him in WDC, which is a big deal (as you say though, not 100% his fault, but it does beg a question).  Equally Ferrari could hire Bottas, Hulkenberg, Ricciardo or Button and likely achieve more reliable results for less money.   I think it's mainly the qualifying performance for me, along with a few too many avoidable incidents like the spin. Really if Kimi still had the *reliable* pace he used to then he'd be worrying Seb for third on the grid in quali every time out and I just can't see that happening on a regular basis.    Senna had 162 race starts, Hamilton is on 155 as of yesterday and Vettel 146.   So, no, they have not had more 'chances' than Senna.    Seb to equal it first, Hamilton will surpass it first.   Plenty on eBay and Gumtree - also check out the coach trip packages from nearby cities.   Kimi is one of my all time favorite drivers and he deserved three WDCs (Damn you McLaren reliability).   But even I think that he isn't performing well enough for Ferrari after the last few races - what changed my mind is that, looking at Seb's racing, other drivers could do more in that seat than Kimi.   Same thing applies to Massa. Williams would be foolish to keep him in that seat much longer.      Couldn't agree more.   I get that the candidates are 'taking out the trash', jettisoning and disowning anything that proved to be poisonous or that we lost the argument on, in order to allow the party to build a new platform but we're beginning to sound like the Conservatives.   I can't help but think that the leadership candidates all come with the word 'interim' etched all over them.  We appear to have lost more than the economic argument.      What has Red Bull gained from its media 'war' with Renault - nothing but bad publicity, loss of faith in the team once it was clear that the chassis was also a problem, and the regular embarrassment of its senior team members when they were caught out blaming everything on Renault.  So I'm with McLaren on this one. Honda will get there eventually and its not worth blowing what will likely be a fruitful partnership once they get the engine working.         I don't see how its unfriendly - all the race data (and an amazing amount of it) is within a couple of swipes and thats a very tricky thing to handle UX wise. The menus and the rest of the app are quite annoying, but the in race stuff works very well indeed.  They even have text *and* audio commentary and allow you to download and replay the race. I used it a couple of weeks back to follow the race whilst taking the kids around Comic Con.   Both at the same time!   This is available in the current F1 app.      This places him 5th in the all-time list and less than 400 laps adrift of the 4th spot which is held by Vetell. If the season carries on the way it has so far he'll surpass Prost and possibly Senna in this record.  Hamilton had 49 entries in the driver record books at the start of the season and he now has 57 - the only people ahead of him are Vettel and Schumacher.         These are 5th components so I would assume additional   And about a dozen radio stations.   This went out on the RBR twitter feed just now - which is where the link is from.         I'm a British fan and Sky F1 is British channel with a British audience - there is plenty of non-British commentary to choose from.   Last year he definitely did, as I say he kept locking up. This year is a different story though.   It depends on what country you're in. I paid 20 quid for the year mainly for the live timing during races. You can also pay monthly. The app itself is free so you can download and have a look.                  They get taken out as time penalties - so he's gotten dropped to the back of the grid and has a 10 second stop go at his first pit stop.   Look none of what you've had to say so far is at all correct - especially what you've written above. I strongly urge you to read up on the *actual* history of the sport, especially the concorde agreement, the formation of FOCA and the FOCA/FISA war, again.  You'll note this year that FOM has launched a social media effort, which is actually pretty good. What you don't appear to have understood at all the complexity of the commercial rights behind it. The point Bernie was making last year - was that social media, while desirable, is expensive to implement, staff, and isn't going to make the teams the kind of money necessary to enhance the sport and it is therefore very low down on the order of priority for FOM.   You are right of course - ultimately businesses that are friendly to the community will have to advertise that is the case instead - there is already such a scheme for B B's.   I don't think anyone is really arguing that people should be forced to do things they are uncomfortable with. After all the fundamental of the LGBQT marriage debate is that people who disagree with LGBQT marriage don't have the right to force that opinion on other people's lives through the state or the church.  But if you're not a gay friendly business then you *should* advertise that fact to avoid embarrassment for both parties - but bakeries, just like B B's, don't want to advertise that they're not LGBQT friendly because it might hurt their business.  Therein lies the rub - those unfriendly to the LGBQT community are well aware that their views are outside the mainstream and that once this becomes known it could damage their business even amongst the straight community. Not only that but several of the bakeries have said that they have no problem with LGBQT customers, they just object to wedding cakes - that is a perilous line to tread - your money is only good for some purchases, but we won't tell you that unless you ask.  A little over a generation ago people were refused service by churches and many wedding businesses because they were divorcees seeking marriage - interestingly that was treated as an absolute wrong and the debate surrounding it was a lot less angry than this one even though the fundamental issue is identical.   I used the official F1 app to listen to the race commentary whilst taking the kids to Comic Con London the other week - stream cut out frequently but it worked very well indeed.   The teams needed to be incentivised to improve reliability.   Because when any driver does that much overtaking it always ends up being labelled a demolition derby - happened to both Hamilton and Rosberg last year.  Points mean prizes.   Craig Scarborough is suggesting its been an ICE change.      You're thinking of gearboxes - thats a five place penalty.   No, if they are fitting a new unit and Eric Boullier used the word 'new' then he'll have to take a penalty (assuming this is engine 5). If Eric misspoke and they're installing a reconditioned unit then he'll get away with it.   I have a feeling we're watching the early days of a Hamilton/Rosberg style duel that will be fought out over a number of seasons in the future - something that may suck for Ricciardo.  Totally agree though I'm not questioning Verstappen's natural talent, but he'll struggle to get anywhere with the attitude he's been displaying, just as a certain Spaniard has. Many have pointed to this attitude being displayed by other champions - but they had established themselves first.     Honda confirm its the 4th on twitter + Mclaren's account using the word engine - assume they would be more specific if it was just the turbo or MGU-H  https://twitter.com/McLarenF1/status/607170579037343744   10 for a new engine isn't it?   It turns out they are fitting a new engine and I guess that means a grid penalty - no FP3 for Alonso https://twitter.com/LauraLeslie23/status/607170597853007872      Or a demolition derby.  I've been very disappointed by his reaction to the Monaco crash, and it's not lost on me that Sainz is beating him hands down right now.   You only get to a position like Bernie's by being constantly successful at cutting deals allowing you to build a power base. He made it from a driver to team owner to the de facto leader of the sport. No one else in professional sports has been able to achieve that while managing the complex politics surrounding sports management, which is why no one else has a comparable record.  Bernie became powerful because he's very good at what he does and that makes his record all the more impressive.   It would be a 15 place drop, if he doesn't qualify high enough a time penalty too.        	197
 I like single lane roundabouts. Once you add more lanes, the idiocy of the population kicks in. Most people just ignore the lanes in those.    What should I use to clean it?    /r/wtf has actually been making me say wtf. Thank you, reddit, for finally putting out weird shit again.    Suspensions have interested me since I first saw them, and I'm interested in doing one (or more if I like it), but I'm wondering if there's an age requirement (or an age you'd suggest) for it.    [These are probably what you're looking for.](http://www.sickplugs.co.uk/product/blue-snowglobe-plug)   I think 15-16 is the minimum. At that age, you have an okay scope of a job, college, and the rest of your life. At 10, you're hardly out of elementary school (if that). I also think that piercings should be fully the decision of the one being pierced. Pierced babies always frustrate me. I understand that the school and parents are okay with it, but I hope she was given a talk about how future employers might not be okay with it. I've wanted stretched ears when I was younger, but I didn't even know how people wanted to do it; I thought you needed some type of surgery, which my parents would never allow. Once I got a bit older and a bit more educated on it, along with showing responsibility, my mom allowed it. I definitely think 10 is too young to start stretching, but I don't think there should be any laws or regulations on it.    With my first piercings, the 18-14 jump wasn't happening at all. My second piercings, however, went from 18-14 seamlessly. It ultimately depends on your ears/piercings. If it feels like you have to force it through, it's too big of a jump for your ears.    I keep my stuff in a transparent blue lock box (from Walmart, so it's not far from pickable; just enough to keep it from popping open) and I have each pair in a labelled 'drug dealer' baggie. I would do the tackle box system (which I really like) but I don't quite have enough plugs to have a system for that, and I find the labels a bit easier.    I think I'll be doing that. I'm diligent about keeping only steel in fresh stretches, and I'm planning on getting mostly glass, steel, wood, or other non-acrylic plugs and tunnels in my goal size. I have one acrylic pair, but I'd only be wearing them for a day at most. The spirals I would wear over night and such, so sleeping on them probably didn't help.    Morgan Joyce/ilymorgannn is pretty reputable when it comes to piercings and the advice that comes with them. I would give that link as advice myself.    BAF has fossilized mammoth tusks for over $1000.   From my experience, Wal-Mart does better piercings than Claire's. My first holes were done by Claires, and I needed a taper to go to 16g, but my second holes could go up to 14 right away. My first holes have also been extremely sensitive. This is also problematic for me because I want to stretch to 2g, but I don't want my ears funny looking with the outside being the larger hole.    bodyartforms.com all the way. I've had completely good experience with them, and you get free o rings and a sticker along with a gauge card with every order, and who doesn't like free things? They also have a huge selection (with decent prices) and excellent service. Their shipping rates are also decent, and it's only $1 to add insurance to the order.    I read on BAF that Kaos is discontinuing their o rings. Is there anywhere else that sells clear silicone? With my recent BAF orders, I've been choosing the clear o rings as the freebies since they're not like the standard black ones that come with everything, but since they're being discontinued, I might need a new source.    So I started wearing some 14g acrylic spirals in a healed stretch, and I noticed that a really small area around/in the piercing was a reddish pink. I didn't know if this was just dye coming off of the spirals, or a reaction to them. My ears don't feel irritated while wearing them. I clean the spirals with rubbing alcohol and a q tip and they usually turn the q tip pink which is why I thought it was maybe the dye.    In what way does the stretching speed effect the shrinking? Does faster stretching mean faster shrinking? I'm kinda in the same boat as OP with stretching, and I'm only at a 12 so not too worried yet.    I pictured the entire scene when I saw that. Bomb jacket and everything.    [Accept my selfie.](http://i.imgur.com/3ObI9oY.jpg)   Build underground.   klol   Doesn't the period stuff get taught in 5th-6th grade? Or at least health classes?

Painful to behold   If exercise is easy, you aren't doing it hard enough. Before you all downvote me to oblivion, this only holds true if you want to build visible muscle or lose lots of weight.   While the body is ticking over, for example if you are jogging at a relaxed pace, your heart rate is slightly above average and your muscles are using slightly more oxygen. This is okay if you are simply trying to stay in shape, but not if you are wanting to drop weight etc. If, however, you carry on working until your muscles grow tired, your heart and muscles will be working so much harder in order to keep them going. So if you are running for a while and quit when you get tired, thats okay as you are getting fit and healthy, but not okay if you want to lose weight. It is people who can keep going through the pain barrier and force their body to work when it feels like it cant anymore that really will lose weight and tone up. The same is true for muscle building and weight training, if you are doing 3 sets of 12 reps, for example, the muscles for the first 8-10 reps will function normally until you really start to strain, when the muscle is working so much harder because it is tired. Again, it is people who can push themselves to do the extra 2 or 3 reps when their arms are tired who will build muscle most efficiently.  TL:DR - If you want to just stay healthy then exercise should be fun and easy. If you want to lose weight and build muscle exercise should hurt like a motherbitch.   would've   FTFY.

What upsets people about the recent NSA scandal is that there seems to be a great deal of evidence appearing the ordinary, law-abiding, tax-paying people are have their phone calls, emails etc bugged or recorded.

The crux of the argument is most people would agree that this level of spying is good when it is potentially dangerous individuals who represent a danger to innocent people being spied upon, but problem seems to be that  the NSA does not limit itself to that, and seems to have spent a great deal of time and effort spying on the American public en masse, as well as (according to recent news developments) various international offices and embassies.  This obvious does raise larger arguments such as the problem of deciding who represents a significant enough danger to society to warrant the level of privacy invasion the NSA seems to have wielded with such indiscrimination, and it could be easy to get drawn into a debate regarding racial, religious or social profiling.  So in answer to the question at hand: no, even if the NSA had successfully intercepted and stopped multiple terrorist attacks, this does not justify indiscriminate and Orwellian-like constant surveillance by the, or any, government on the population at large, as a whole. Personally I find the distinct and traceable rise of totalitarianism in American politics a lot more disturbing that potential terrorism.   I don't get it, or rather I don't get why that's good.  EDIT: Having read the poem I get it, thanks for posting it.    So every time you pass a beggar you take his name and social security number to do a background check? That's dedication to charity right there!   Here in NZ the smallest currency we have is 10, yet things are still priced like that! The total is always rounded to the nearest 10, so if my total bill is $2.34, I pay $2.30 etc.   Statistically 7 out of 8 people enjoy gang rape.     Actually, the first time Harry has Butter Beer is when he sneaks out of Hogwarts using the Marauder's Map and the invisibility cloak in book 3. He, Ron and Hermione go into 'The Three Broomsticks' to drink Butter Beer when Hagrid, Professors McGonagall and Flitwick and Cornelius Fudge walk in and force Harry to hide under the table. Harry never drinks Butter Beer in 'The Leaky Cauldron', only in 'The Three Broomsticks', 'The Hog's Head', Hogwarts and No. 12 Grimmauld Place.  Boom.   ...you meant to say 'The Three Broomsticks' right?   So this one time I was playing russian roulette with Nicole Simpson and Ronald Goldman...   "*After I killed them I dropped the gun in the Thames, washed the residue off my hands in the bathroom of a Burger King, and walked home to await instructions. Shortly thereafter the instructions came through: 'get the fuck out of London you dumb Fucks! Get to Bruges!' I didn't even know where Bruges was.*"  "*It's in Belgium.*"   Partially agreed. I felt the film was *in general* very well made and Henry Cavill did a great job, there was just far too much time spent where the film seemed to be saying "look how awesome all this CGI is!", the fight scenes went on forever and were thoroughly disengaging after a while, as well as the fight scene at the end. It just went on without development, i was actually bored by the end. The plot was a little weak and Zod's character could have been much better developed with a little more time, instead we just got a ton of special effects and endless destruction.  TL:DR: **Great CGI Great Film**   Mirrors. You all know which scene I'm talking about.      Yes, because all the problems in the country are because of one single person. Things would be totally different if someone else was in charge. A liberal government is totally different to a conservative government. Sure.   [Another picture](http://imgur.com/RdmPWqI.jpg), there were hundreds of the buggers.      Pastor, I hope you got a worthwhile response to your question, 134 replies to a post is pretty good! I would like to ask you why you asked Reddit this question, are you curious and testing the waters for overall opinion, or performing some kind of analysis? Did you find any answers interesting?   Just for the record, I'm trying to open a reasonable conversation here, not an argument!   You need to read your Bible more carefully methinks. Reflect on the fate of the Egyptian first born, the Caananites, the *total genocide of all life on Earth* save two of each animal (how does one have an evil Giraffe exactly?) The concept or Original Sin, the punishment of children for the crimes of their parents, the concept of an eternal, everlasting hell, Lot's wife, the citizens of Jericho, the list goes on and on and on.   No, *Merciful* or *Just* or *Kind* are words that do not fit your God.   "*If triangles had gods their gods would have three sides*"   Totalitarian.   ...You don't eat the whole thing!   Just a little more information on this: The horn of a Rhino is considered an aphrodisiac in Chinese traditional medicine. Some species' horns are worth more than others: an average size Black Rhino horn could fetch as much as $300,000 US on the black market. That is why they were hunted to extinction.   It was a shitty job, but it if you worked hard you could really clean up!      Henry VIII had someone to wipe his arse for him. The title given to the job was "Groom of the Stool", Henry VIII had four of them during his reign, all of whom were knighted.   They usually aren't that hard to buy, if you have the Benjamins!    And blackjack!   If I grew up in a place like that, I doubt I would be indoors much either! Where is it?      Not strictly true and a bit over-simplified. It was actually Socrates who was instructed by the Oracle of Delphi to become a philosopher. In a completely separate story Socrates defined an intelligent person as '*someone who knows only the extent of their own ignorance*', which anyone has to admit is a beautiful turn of phrase.   Beautifully put. Have you read Hawking's 'A Brief History of Time'? I'm sure it would fascinate you!   The perfect response to this cop-out of an answer, as it is essentially just another form of the 'stacked tortoises' argument.   This is the only sensible answer I'm afraid. Humanity will continue to search for the answers and maybe one day we will stumble across a new theory of everything. Due to the unlikeliness of physical evidence being found to explain the universe, it may remain a theoretical problem forever.  The only thing that is really certain as that as we continue to research the origin of everything the more amazing and incomprehensible the world around us becomes, but at least we know less and less about more and more.   why...why do you think about that??

When Hendrix performed Watchtower for the first time Dylan was in the audience. After the performance Hendrix rushed up to Dylan (he was a huge fan) and asked him what he thought.

He editted his comment to use my picture, which doesn't really illustrate his point very well as only the summit of Everest is visible on the left   Correction: Everest *is* the most prominent mountain in the world, as 'prominent' means to measure from the base to the summit. Some mistakenly think that Mauna Kea in Hawaii is the tallest, however this isn't true as to measure climbing prominence you measure from the base, ergo the part you start to climb at.   The moutain in your picture is not Mount Everest, it is an entirely seperate mountain called Ama Dablam. It is in the same range as Everest, but hugely smaller. [Here is a photo I took last time I was there of Everest, Lohtse and Dablam.](http://imgur.com/B4HWHCN.jpg) Note: Dablam was a great deal closer to me in relation to Everest and Lohtse when I took the picture, they are a lot further away than they look. Only the pyramid summit of Everest is visible, and from some angles Everest is roughly pyramid shaped, especially from the east, assuming this picture is a sunrise.  **EDIT:** u/skatelinsy has edited his comment using my picture. This doesn't illustrate his point very well, as only the summit pyramid of Everest is visible on the far left.

Hmm, are you sure you aren't a poisonous viper?    All of it.   in this case, BPD isn't a good acronym, which one are you talking about? As someone with a family history of Bipolar, I can vouch that her symptoms are nothing like Bipolar Disorder, as /u/you_areso_goodlookin said, Bipolar is characterised by gradual peaks and dips in mood, not sudden swinging back and forth, which is a common misconception. Many Bipolar individuals are manic for a few days or weeks, then will become depressed for days or weeks.   I know, someone already posted the video and I already said the direction of Kennedy's head was consistent with an exit wound. The Penn   Teller video I found painful to watch, I usually enjoy there material but that particular video was incredibly insensitive.   You're right, this does seem to be a little pedantic. The point here though is that some conspiracy theorists (not necessarily myself, as I say I am undecided) make the argument that Oswald didn't take the easier Houston Street shot because if he waited for the car to turn onto Elm (where Kennedy was shot) it placed the Presidential Motorcade in a 'triangulated fire' position, ergo Kennedy would be trapped between the Book Depository and the Grassy Knoll.   No worries, someone made a similar point! [here is my response comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1ectu8/what_great_mysteries_with_video_evidence_remain/c9z7f47)   That was an interesting read, thanks for your input! The story is still full of holes though. From everything I've heard Oswald insisted outright that he was "*just a patsy*" etc, completely denying being involved in the assassination. So my point is this, yes the fuzz may have had a very small and circumstantial case against him for the murder of Officer Tippit, but what evidence did they have that he had anything to do with the assassination of Kennedy? I highly doubt he confessed and they only tied him to the Carcano Rifle *after* he himself was shot by Ruby. The only evidence seems to be that he worked at the book depository. Yet it seems within minutes of his arrest he is booked with the assassination.  As for the shooting itself, I have also heard the theory that the first shot hit a traffic light and ricocheted (hitting James Tague, who was standing by the overpass) and it seems convincing. Frankly, the easiest part of the story to believe is that the shooter was on the sixth floor of the book depository, although there are still loose ends here. The fatal shot does seem to come from behind Kennedy, although over fifty witnesses did report to hear shots from the picket fence, and (although I believe the 'Magic Bullet' theory to have been disproved ad nauseum) I have heard a slightly convincing theory concerning the Zapruder Film, which shows Kennedy clutching his hands to his neck while Connolly turns in his seat. The theory I have heard is that the shot that took Kennedy in the neck came from the front, while Connolly was hit seconds later by a separate bullet from the Book Depository. The evidence for this theory being that Connolly himself identified the moment he believed he was shot on the Zapruder film as several seconds after Kennedy has already raised his hands, as well as the Texas autopsy identifying the bullet wound in Kennedy's back as an exit wound.  As I say I don't find all of this convincing, these are just theories, but I do maintain there is a lot of strange and conflicting evidence.   I have no definite source, but from some very brief research I found that there is a theory that [this is the Babushka Lady's photograph](http://imgur.com/pQl91RQ.jpg). If it is, I'm amazed it isn't a bigger deal, and it's taken me this long to see it!   As much as I enjoy Penn   Teller's usual material, that was just painful to watch. Yes a lot of those people were mad as a bicycles, but what a terrible way to handle the subject matter.   I haven't seen that one! Just in case you (or other people in this thread) don't get the reference, it is from the film '[JFK](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MLc0udf_74)'   Is you're last name Oswald, because you just blew my mind!  EDIT: [Ladies...](http://imgur.com/0jFtE4S.jpg)   Back, and to the left.  EDIT: There are several aspects of the assassination that still don't add up for me, the direction of the fatal headshot being the least of them (as many of you point out, the movement of Kennedy's head is consistent with an exit wound). Some point's worth considering:  * Oswald's Arrest - There is considerable confusion around Oswald's alleged murder of Officer Tippit and his subsequent arrest. Oswald was arrested in a cinema only a few hours after the assassination with over a hundred officers present. Oliver Stone comments on this as "the greatest display of police intuition since the Reichstag Fire".  * Kennedy's brain has disappeared. Seriously.  * Why not shoot Kennedy as he drives up Houston Street, its a far easier shot.  * There are several secret files apparently being withheld from the public concerning the assassination. If there was no conspiracy, what are these secret files about. I need citation for this, can anyone help me out?   I am not laying blame at anyones door as that would require more evidence than is available. But I am of the opinion, because of many of these discrepant facts, that some more than what meets the eye was happening that day.   I have long and very thick curly hair. It knots up easily but I just washed it with water every day (well, every day I could get running water) and kept it clean. Got very many compliments!

 Wait, do they really grow rice in California? That's insane. That cannot be true.   http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/10/20/last-tree-cut/   It's not just California. The fastest growing urban areas in the US are all in the Southwest. That's why the drought is so bad, in a nutshell.  (Well, that and climate change and drilling and agriculture.)   Is it possible to put in a graywater system quickly? That should cut your water usage.         LOL. I hope you love 'em as much as I do - I'd hate to have steered you wrong here.                                                YOU ARE MISSING OUT.  Seriously, the expression on his face as he eats it is the same as the one on my face when blintzes are half price at the supermarket! (And those aren't even really *good* blintzes!)   You can get them in the freezer aisle in a box of 6 for $3.   Oh, man, you've never had? Okay, get some applesauce and some sour cream to eat with them. Gonna buy them frozen or try your hand at making them? (I've never made them myself - scared to!)   Blintzes are delish, aren't they?   Looked like a blueberry blintz to me.   In the late 60s.  Well, let's look at the crime stats. These are national - your own area may be more or less safe than this.  http://www.disastercenter.com/crime/uscrime.htm  In 1969 there were 7.3 rapes and 18.5 "forcible rapes" for every 100,000 people. In 2013 the numbers were 4.5 and 25.2, respectively - and there's some serious evidence to suggest that rapes haven't increased, but reporting has. (Certainly, the FBI numbers on rape will start to change now that they count rapes of males instead of just of females.)  In some areas, the numbers are slightly higher than they were in 1969. However, they show a marked decrease from the highs in the 1980s and 90s.   The truth is that the US has been experiencing a decrease in crime for the past decade and a half by now. There are many ideas for why this might be. Me, I favor the lead hypothesis - an increase in leaded gasoline caused low levels of led poisoning in crowded urban areas, which cased an increase in violent crime 20 years down the line, and when we removed lead from gasoline we saw a corresponding decrease 20 years after that.   And it's funnier if she doesn't.   And then JKR is going "Oh, that's just, you know, innocent stuff!"  Like when you're 12 and realize that ANOTHER word that "starts with f and ends with uck" is "firetruck" and insist on making that joke all the time because, after all, it's "not dirty!"   You know, clean? So it doesn't smell bad when you, you know, fuck it? And it's "horn-y"?      Bread, a centrum, and also your entire daily dose of sugar in one serving.      Yes, good point.   Well, the stereotype of rural types is that they, um, screw their livestock. Aberforth keeps goats, so....   Maybe, but wouldn't that take some time to set in, much like the peroxide look?   Probably because you're utterly wrong. The average age for marriage in the middle ages in Europe was in the early 20s for both men and women. That's the number that's *everywhere*.  Aristocratic families often married earlier... but they didn't consummate their marriages right away, so it's a moot point.   Oh gosh, yeah. The movie was great!    Simply "struggling to speak in social situations" isn't autism, it's social anxiety.  Mind, social anxiety is common among autistics (and it's about 50/50 the disabling attitudes of society - being bullied for 12+ years of schooling will do that to a person), but they're not the same thing.   Now that you're better, feed yourself and not the troll.   Okay, I ask again - do you have a *source* for that?                                       Ah, well, don't let me harsh your squee. If you love it, more power to you :)   How/why would they *lose* blood?    Aaaaaaand then she skipped merrily away from the cop shop and into her DOOM on the advice of a *text message*.

He's fighting the good fight, him against the world! (I've never been so tempted to cram the word "whilst" into a sentence in my life omg.)   Well, I do know that our knowledge of how to treat autistics has improved.   All I know is that the first one was in much worse shape than the third one.  And there could be many possible causes for this, yet you concluded there was exactly one cause and you knew what it was.   Definitely the latter.   And it all started at the same age for each of them? And in the 14 years between the first child and the third, therapies didn't improve at all?   And did none of them have any treatment or therapy?   It's both.   Mostly in wealthier areas, where the cops have loads of free time and the neighbors can spend hours sitting at their windows waiting to call them.   Geez that's a long-ass trip.   When were you a kid?    Putting a 10 year old in charge of a 6 year old is definitely neglect.  You can babysit - like an actual infant - at 12 in nearly all jurisdictions. Why not watch your own sibling at 10?   From dusk to dawn? Were you vampires?   Yeah, it was looked at. Google "refrigerator mother". It's no longer being looked at because all the evidence shows that it's utter bullshit. We don't need to retread old ground here, that hypothesis is as dead and buried as the MMR hypothesis.   Interesting that you didn't even think of /r/autism :)   Thanks :)    Haven't humans traditionally had their first children as teenagers in most cultures?  I don't know, HAS this been the case?   It seems like I see a lot more children diagnosed with it now days.  That's because you do. However, an increase in diagnosis is not the same as an increase in incidence.   To paternal age, and to the age of the paternal grandfather.   Your comment is predicated on the false idea that autism is primarily a *social* disorder.   The diagnostic criteria for autism changed, significantly, between the DSM-3 and the DSM-4. That's all. If you use the modern criteria and look at adults, you find the same rates among adults as you do among children, it's just that many autistics 20 years ago either got NO diagnosis or got an inappropriate diagnosis such as "mental retardation" or "childhood schizophrenia".   Is that the only thing different? Or did she, perhaps, have her children diagnosed earlier each time around, and get them therapy and assistance sooner than their next older sibling had? And that therapy and assistance, over 14 years, was bound to be better as we know more than we did then.   Yes, that hypothesis was brought up in the article.   You think that "lacking male role models" leads children to have speech delays? Or to be unable to wear clothing with tags or to be unable to be in a room with blinking lights?    How do you know none of their kids are autistic?   It's not completely random, in fact. We know already that autism is highly hereditary.   Almost certainly, but we don't know that from a single family.  That single family, for example, could have all been exposed to something in utero, or it could just be a freak coincidence.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5  Indeed, they do diagnose it as ASD nowadays.   You're not going to be able to get an Asperger's diagnosis. It's not in the DSM anymore.   Yes, and I know a guy who says the secret to living to be 95 like him is to drink like a fish, smoke like a chimney, and never wear a seatbelt.  I'm not taking his advice.    So does that mean that in the medieval era where the average bride was like 16 and the groom was like 50 there were higher risk of autism?  Do you have a source for this factoid?   No, actually, not only is it not lower in the UK but studies conducted in the UK show that numbers of adult autistics mirror those of young autistics.  However, when you were a child, more "low functioning" autistics were more likely to be institutionalized or at least taught separately and more "high functioning" autistics frequently didn't get a diagnosis of any sort.   Yeah, but no. Wakefield didn't have any statistics, he made up the numbers from whole cloth.   It is extraordinarily unlikely that at this point autism (discounting Fragile X) will be found to be caused by a single gene. Evidence is pointing to autism, like height, being a multi-gene trait.   I once worked teaching Autistic kids and most of the parents seemed pretty... uh... off.  Kanner made that same observation, and came to the same conclusion.    What does "correct for multiple testing" mean, if you don't mind explaining?    Calling everyone an "actor" doesn't sound inherently male, because Actor/Actress isn't Male/Female, it's Vague/Female.  I don't know about that. I wouldn't be surprised to find that some people do find "actor" an inherently male word - not a "vague" word.   My mother tells me the story of her first catechism class (which apparently is the initial root of her eventual departure from Catholicism) where the earnest nun told a room full of Puerto Ricans, Italians, and one Walloon girl (my mother), all of whom were bilingual, that history was from "his story".  She was six years old, sitting there looking at the other classmates thinking "No it is NOT", but she didn't know how to tell Sister Whoever!  Folk etymologies are actually really fascinating sometimes. That's what I tell myself, anyway :)   Many people think that. Some of them argue quite vehemently when you point out that they're incorrect. "I heard it from a guy and it's just common sense" always seems to trump "historical evidence" in their minds.     Oh god, he *is*. I don't want to ever see him taken out!   Boy, it sure would be nice if we had some grenades, don't you think?  OH LOOK HE HAD SOME GRENADES.   A cure he was in control of. This ain't it.   Let's see how *you* react when your ex-fiancee, who has been lying to you for months, turns you into a zombie without your consent despite knowing you hate them.  He didn't even have a chance to process.   Thanks :)            First the hooded hostage, and then she doesn't even have the decency to tell Major "Hey Ravi is working on a cure, so we just need to be patient and wait and keep eating dead people brains for a little while and everything will be alright."  That would mean fessing up that Ravi's been lying to him as well.   Holy shit, suddenly everyone thinks only you can save your brother, yet only you know that you CANT. How is she going to explain that she can't give her blood?  Fess up that she has contracted the sort of disease that prevents you from donating blood. She hasn't told anybody because she wanted to handle it herself. She doesn't have to state that it's Zombieism. She could easily hint it's HIV, that can linger in the body for ages (especially with treatment) before it manifests as AIDS. There are other disease that preclude donation, such as hepatitis or TB, but her mother would probably recognize that she doesn't have those symptoms.   Except they have some leeway between healthy and raging. How many zombies can there even be in Seattle? If most of them are wealthy, as Blaine preferred, then they could easily simply decamp to other cities, one or two zombies per city, and make use of local morgues.  This would involve getting their own hands dirty, which I'm sure they wouldn't like, but I doubt many of them would really prefer to go on a rampage.   The freezer that's been bombed and has a broken window, that the cops will be swarming all over in a few hours?   Does eating zombie brains actually work?  Plus, this eating brains thing isn't like google.   Major is, indeed, dumb as a box of rocks, but his heart is in the right place even when his head isn't.                  I got an abortion last month, and I *wasn't even pregnant*! It was fun!  /sarcasm   Ditto, except I'm pretty sure this afflicts NT teens as well. Not the literalism per se, but the literal-minded grammar snob behavior.                                                                                                      That must have been quite a while ago. The earth's population as of 2013 was ~7.125 billion. We hit the 7 billion mark sometime in the middle of 2011.  I find it hard to accept too.   A culture without money isn't unworkable. Certainly, such cultures have existed.  The Federation *as written* doesn't seem to work very well without money, probably because the writers simply tranplanted American culture and said "oh, yeah, but no money!" rather than planning out how it functions.   I learned something new today. I'd thought "meteor" referred to the whatever-it-is before it falls, and was about to out-pedant the pedant, but apparently:   Most of us probably have seen meteors or shooting stars. A meteor is the flash of light that we see in the night sky when a small chunk of interplanetary debris burns up as it passes through our atmosphere. "Meteor" refers to the flash of light caused by the debris, not the debris itself.   http://hubblesite.org/reference_desk/faq/answer.php.id=22 cat=solarsystem  So I learned something new! And also, meteors aren't the things that are falling, although I'm never, ever going to say that again. When is that ever going to be helpful to a conversation?                        Perhaps they should be.   It's not political correctness. It's *manners*.   If that makes you happy, why not?   So? We're not talking about math. We're talking about interactions with human beings. The kind path is *always* the correct one.  And I happen to like squirrels. Cute little things! I mean, they're territorial as fuck, and they're not as vegetarian as people believe, but they're clever.   You're not asking questions in good faith, you're JAQ-ing off.   Strangely, not. While we don't know exactly what percentage of the population has mosaicism, some studies show that it's more common among transgender individuals - they literally have some cells xx and some xy.   And there are a surprising number of people out there who present externally as female but are xy. Nobody does a gene test before naming the baby. They just glance at the body and move on.  Not to mention the fact that there are some differences in brain structure from male to female, and transgender individuals have brain structures more like the "opposite" sex than their assigned gender.   Science shows us that transgender is based on real, provable things.  Regardless, I fail to see how your argument has merit. Let's say they were absolutely making things up. Does it harm you to say "she" instead of "he"? Of course not! So why spend over an hour on reddit commenting about it?   Science actually doesn't have an opinion, which is good, because science shows that a surprising number of people with external genitalia that appears to be female are male, and that there are a large number of people with two sets of genes in their bodies. We're only just now finding out how common mosaicism is, and the answer to that is "more than we thought".   Mmm. Transgender acceptance is lifesaving, literally. Transition is the accepted treatment for gender identity dysphoria, and is associated with a reduction in suicide and all sorts of other bad things.    People can believe whatever they want to do. It just doesn't make it true.  Indeed. You, for example, believe that somebody's genetic makeup is more important than their self-identification. You believe that something you say you don't care about is more important than good manners. You believe that this sort of argument is more important than other people's happiness and general well-being.  I believe you're a nitwit. One of the two of us is right in our beliefs. It's not you   Look, if you came up to me and said "squeek squeek I'm a squirrel", all I'd say is "You want a peanut?"  This is not the hill I'm willing to die on. If somebody tells me they're a man or a woman, it's a lot easier - and certainly more polite - to just go "yup, okay" than to argue with them. Because they care and *I don't*. So why not go with the flow? It's not important to me, after all.  Edit: Peanuts and sunflower seeds are not good for squirrels. Do not give peanuts to squirrels. Excessive consumption of peanuts is linked to bone deformities in squirrels. If you want to feed the squirrels, tree nuts are a better choice, along with lentils, seeds, and dried corn in moderation. Some fresh fruit will also not go amiss. I use the term simply because it is more euphonious than "You want some pecans and maybe a small amount of lentils?"   And why do you care? Seriously, if I decide to call myself Emperor of New York, so long as I don't levy taxes what business is it to you?   So it does bother you. It bothers you enough that you would rather call somebody by the pronoun you've decided is correct rather than the one they prefer.   Surgery is not a common option. For one thing, it's apparently not terribly effective, and for another you can't exactly show it off like a tattoo. It doesn't accomplish her primary objective, which is to have the general public see her as a female rather than a male. Nobody does that by ordering folks to drop trou, they just eyeball it.   *You may call him crazy to discredit his comments but you can't deny his forthright conveyance. *  And when the drunk on the corner starts ranting about how 9/11 was an inside job by the Swiss, should I respect him as well for his "forthright conveyance"?   Not really. Our opinions are formed by a lot of factors. Ethnicity/religion is just one of them.   If being Jewish made you rich, Kiryas Joel wouldn't have the highest poverty rate in the US.   They're Jews, not Borg. They don't have a hive mind.   Could it be Sea of Trolls?                  It wouldn't do for us to get confused about which show we're watching when.   Or an entire species dies and everybody just lets it happen.   He had a number of traits that, in real life, are red flags for a potentially abusive partner.   Reddit code is a little opaque. If you click the link that says "formatting help" on the right, directly under your comment, it gives you a cheat sheet without causing you to lose what you were typing.  (It took me an embarrassingly long time to see that when I first started commenting, and I still can never remember how to do links.)   You use your own best judgment. By the later series of Star Trek, the Prime Directive had become a crutch so that Star Fleet could wash its hands of having to use *any* judgment at all. "Too bad, so sad, prime directive!" It's morally equivalent to using "zero tolerance" to expel kids for playing tag.   And yet, in a way they revisited the idea later when Tuvok was in that accident that wiped his memories and skills. When the Doctor found a cure, that Tuvok wasn't 100% behind losing his *new* personality and going back to the way he had been either.  And nobody ever mentions this episode, as near as I can tell. Well, that Tuvok was slightly more willing to go with the procedure than Tuvix had been. Why the heck did Voyager do the same plot twice with the same character?   They were already dead, like this horse we're beating.   Somewhere before you cure cancer for everybody, but after you save a species that otherwise would be completely doomed, to the last child.   "If we screw this up, those people might become... *religious*". (Not an actual quote, but man, that's the vibe I get sometimes from Federation humans. Religion, it's like some embarrassing disease that everybody else has to pretend doesn't make you stinky.)  Okay, Rodenberry, I get that you're an atheist. I'm an atheist. We're all atheists... or we will be in the future, anyway (I'm actually an atheist today and have been my whole life). Atheism is awesome! But can you stop being a snotty *jerk* about it? Sheesh.  (Of course, I find it hard to believe that humanity just tossed religion en masse. I just can't see it.)   To make italics on reddit, you have to surround the word or phrase you want italicized with asterisks.   In real life, of course, I'd always advise you to date Duncan over Logan. In fictionville, I want my couples to be as *miserable as possible*.   Just remember me when   On the one hand, you have to feel sorry for Sebastian. He ate his Aunt Edna, and he was clearly *really* broken up about it.  On the *other* hand, dude could stand to develop some introspection. Liv didn't do this to you, YOU did this to you with your creepy blood licking, you jerkface! Contract killing is one thing, but that is just *gross*.  Well, I don't suppose it's a profession that benefits from too much naval gazing.  Also: Band chick is an idiot. Irredeemably stupid.  Also: Major is also an idiot. Irredeemably stupid. Cute, and sweet, and dumber than the proverbial box of rocks. I'm not sure cute and sweet is enough to explain why Liv hooked up with him in the first place. Is he, like, really great in the sack?  Also also: Clive isn't stupid. He's going to figure out that something's up, sooner or later.   One ep, I think - the promo calls next week the finale.   Plus, by rendering those two planets uninhabitable by their respective enemies, Sisko effectively removed them from the gameboard. The relocated Federation colony was guaranteed not to be troubled by Cardassians again, and I bet even the Dominion left them more or less alone (at least when they were playing at being friends with Cardassia.)  Likewise, their Cardassian counterparts had no fear of reprisals by the Maquis for anything Cardassia did.   More disastrous than genocide???   The explosion of the Romulan sun. Definitely, 100% tied up with that, unless we declare all of Enterprise out of continuity with New Trek.       The first mass vaccination by the way brought about the spanish flu after WW1...they used to call it the vaccine disease back then.  Citation?   I actually know somebody who got measles three times. Didn't stick. Natural immunity is not as foolproof as you believe. The only way to know if you are still immune to measles is to get your titers checked.   As a *person*, he's great. As a *character*...? No fault of his, nor the actor, but the writers never bothered to do much with him other than set him up with every not available chick in the Delta Quadrant.   Incorrect. They could go and have their titers checked at the doctor, and then selectively have a booster shot of any disease they are no longer immune to.   A dozen comments down the line and *now* you don't want to "pollute star trek"? C'mon! Star Trek is all *about* modern day social issues and heavy handed messages. You can't pollute it with more of the same!   You know, I never got that episode. I mean, if you accept the premises it's a great ep, but the premises don't make any sense.  Crazy cult leader talks about how "we have more supporters than you think", and indeed, *somebody* (who didn't deign to travel with them) invented that device. (And a different group of people with broadly similar aims sabotaged Risa that time - really, I'd love to have seen Star Trek tackle its malcontents more.)  There must be billions and billions of humans in the Federation, and god knows how many other biologically compatible (you know, fertility-wise) species. Even if her actual number of supporters was a ludicrously low percentage, she surely could have gotten actual *volunteers* to live in her low-tech colony in the boondocks. Even if they couldn't get an official Federation charter, they could've still "crashed" the ship in the usual way, except they all would have been more prepared for roughing it.  Even for a crazy cult leader with delusions of grandeur, she certainly doesn't seem to have approached this logically.  	200

 Monaco is very fun.  It's also something like $12 for a 4 pack right now on steam.   I think I'm old enough where I can say "sorry guys, I had no idea what I was getting into."  But some of the younger kids might just be to brazen or daft to realize they are way out of their league.  It would be nice if there was a place for lesser skilled players who are serious and want to improve.  But I guess that would just get ruined anyhow.   I went on cevo once,  I'm a silver and I hold my own in regular pugs.  I get sick of being queued with the one guy who's afk, one guy who's playing music, and one guy who is yelling in Russian.  I don't really care if I win or lose, but I like a good game.  Although winning is better.   I joined a cevo round because I figured maybe there would be more teamwork, people making calls, people who understand eco vs buy round, etc.  Long story short,  I got put in my place.  No one really treated me poorly, and I apologized for my 5 and 20.   I think lesser skilled players, especially ones with no friends that play cs like myself feel stuck pugging with brand new players, Russians, and general assholes.  Some people just want the full experience of what cs has to offer, experience the comradery team players and pros experience.   Sorry if we ruin your day.   Oh my blades   Almost any other game I use a standard placement.  CS stresses me out so I decided to play 100% of the time like that, rather than switching back and forth.

The APR isn't a huge deal to me, just wondering how its all calculated.  I figure I'm getting a new card for X features, but having a lower apr would be a nice bonus for the few "oh crap, next month" moments.     I carry a balance once a year, during the holiday season.  Generally I have that balance payed off by Jan, and pay it in large chunks rather than minimum payments.  Wasn't aware that keeping a relatively small balance once a year would hinder me that much.  Thanks    I got a form from Discover today, and was thinking about getting an it card anyhow (at the moment I only have my cap plat with no rewards and a high apr) after a 14 month intro APR of 0% my APR will be 10.99% to 22.99% based on my creditworthiness.  Would that be determined based on my discover account, or numerous things including my discover account?  Is there any calculations I could do to estimate what my apr would actually be?  I have a mortgage with only about a 25k balance, roughly $200 balance on my cap card, and my credit score is ~725 Im just sick of my cap apr being about 24% and them refusing to drop it, despite being a customer for about 2 years, and never missing a payment. 10.99% sounds real good about now. thanks if you can shine any light, or if you have any other cards I should consider getting other than the it card.   I mean I do agree it isn't a true mmo,  But in a true mmo you are grinding gear for hours a night months on end.  The Destiny grind isn't that bad, but I can see it being perceived as bad to someone with no experience in the genre.   People have never played an mmo I guess..   I think the whole idea is not to inform so players don't have currency saved up to be level cap the second it releases..  don't see a problem.   3sixteens are a solid choice, love mine.

Since then I've gotten a few $2-3 skins and a whole LOT of nothing.  The house got me hooked.    See if the arcade sticks work on pc?  Depending on the games specifications it could save money if your group goes that route rather than buying ps4's, sticks, and games.   Law and Order whatever subtitle..   Depending on the specific skin.  Less desirable stay about even or raise by a few cents.  The more desirable they are the more potential they have in raising.  Ie if you got a 20 cent skin it's not going to make you rich in the future.   Sports games via there respective apps, or the are a few games designed for the chromecast like pirate dice..  you wouldn't want to send an actual game to the chromecast even if you could, the lag would be unbearable.   It depends on your opinion of Microsoft exclusives.  The majority of games will come out on both.  I love my vita, but unless you really want remote play or have a long commute it might not be worth it.  Assuming you have psplus you are already involved in the sony ecosystem.

I soak my pants once a month just to keep the denim healthy and avoid blow outs.  Either way they will air out after a few wears anyhow if you're really against soaking.  If you do decide to soak, make sure the water is cold and your jeans are inside-out   Give em a soak and use some detergent.  Or just wash em.   I wouldn't doubt it.  Japan in general plays more fighting games, while the us plays more fps's   2hood   No pc gamer is going to buy a bioware rpg on console, and no console gamer reading a review on ign is going to run out and buy a high end pc because Dragon age looks good.  Clearly it was some sort of mistake, or it's how the game looked a week before the day one patch.     Maybe the early build ign received was missing certain video settings?   Gradually.  If they are selvedge jeans make sure they taper the inseam.  If they are regular trousers then it shouldn't be a big deal however they normally taper.  Find a pair of jeans you really like and measure the foot hole, it will help to tell them how much you want the pants tapered.

Just figured I'd throw in my 2 cents on twitch donations.   There's a lot of scam artists on twitch that will make large donations, then contact their bank and cancel the payment.  It also takes the bank quite a while to notify the recipient that they are liable for the money+ fees.  So if they took the money out of PayPal and spent it it leaves them between a rock and a hard place.  I've heard it's actually quite common, which is why a lot of streamers won't accept donations or at least not abnormally large donations.  It's pretty sad and messed up especially leaving the streamer to take the blame.  Edit: source /r/twitch   Illegal drugs   Your home wifi doesn't have a cap unless you set it.  Ie. Transferring data from one computer to another computer on your network wouldn't effect the data set by your isp.    If you are streaming on your phone from your wireless provider. The only way to send that to the chromecast would be to set up you're phone as a wireless access point and connect the chromecast to it that way.  The data used wouldn't be much different whether watching content on your phone or on the chromecast.  The easier way to do things would be to use wifi on your phone and you'd only be using data from your home data cap. Sending the data to your chromecast that way wouldn't effect your isp set data Cap at all, but if you have a really low cap then I'm not sure it's your best option.    What is your home data Cap of you don't mind me asking,  it's really strange to see a lower cap on your home internet than on your cell.  Although I guess it depends on what country you live in.   Wait. Your in home wifi has a data Cap, you're home internet has a data Cap, or your phone has a data cap?   The article is actually pretty interesting, and it seems to shine light on both sides of the argument.  That headline is rotten though.   I'm assuming the fcc is going to throw Obama's statement in with the rest of the general public.  The only real difference is I'm assuming they will actually hear Obama's statement.  The fcc is a private organization, and in the end they can just do what's in their own best interests.   You can sure as hell pay for a good one though.  Education fast lanes..   One pair of wide leg jnco pants.  I sure as hell don't wear them ever. Just to remind me how much and how fast things change.   Weird, I'm assuming a patch will clear up my problems.  Or maybe the hours I'm playing I'm getting put on west coast servers that are more populated, which could account for some lag on my end.  Glad to hear it's working well for most people though. On consoles at least haha.   Game runs bad but playable for me on ps4.  Freezes every few hours or so, random lag spikes.  I also think the ping reading is fake it jumps all over the place for no reason.  100/10MB internet and a wired ps4.  Not the best internet in the world but solid by us standards.    No other ps4 multiplayer game has run this bad for me yet.  Again it is playable, just not great.  (Normally I play 12am-5am est so network congestion shouldn't be a problem)   Dunno about that..

I Guess we were all youths at one point.  Some of us just didn't have the luxury of growing up with the internet..heh.   Spark notes: game gate edition.  Some bullshit angsty youths came up with to make themselves feel better about threatening every woman in the games press.   True statement!   *Activision won't listen.  I'm sure the devs at bungie would have loved another 5 years to work on the game, and make it perfect. Again it is all about the Benjamin's.  I like the game personally with 70 hours on I got my money's worth, and am anticipating the dlc/expansion.  I also hated halo.all of them.  And what I liked of halo was the crazy physics and multiplayer.  I wouldn't say the multiplayer was all that deep, but I guess sticking grenades to warthogs was pretty satisfying.     I don't have an interview yet, but I'm thinking about applying to a few places around town.  Really I'm only looking for a few part-time hours a week,  I have a full time job.      I'd like to make a good impression, in general.  Especially if they really like me and happen to offer me something better than what I have going on right now.  In the past I have worked retail jobs, but never at a small boutique with a very clear demographic.  I feel a suit would be too much, plus I work in manufacturing at the moment.  Any suits I own were last minute funeral suits.  On the opposite side I'd feel really weird showing up about a job in denim regardless of how much I may spend on denim.      As a rule of thumb do you normally dress in clothes one step more formal than what the store generally sells, or how the current employees are dressed?   Thanks, I must have remembered wrong..  haven't used it in a bit.    Did something change? I used to be able to use my vita with my Japanese and US accounts so long as I changed my memory cards.     Not always.  usually it's a mix of crappier stuff and last season store markdown type stuff.  Usually the actual good stuff is a small percentage, but it can be found.   Seriously everyone I know is leaving the bay area..they make 40-60k a year and can't afford it.   Thanks so much, didn't wanna get my girlfriend jeans that look like capris. About your height.   Looks great, do you know what the inseam is by chance? Not listed on their site.   Take 2 years to train, and learn your limits.then you will be 18 and can rent a hotel room if needed. Camping with an injury 500+ miles away from home would be horrible.  You also can't ride on highways.   Those sufu kids are pretty shady.   The left one controls the right side of your body.  Keep that in mind if you're right handed.   I agree with your idea, personally I could care less about resolution/fps (to an extent)  I would rather have a fun game.  I enjoy subjective reviews, having the ability to "get to know" the reviewer while consuming their media.  But 900p is worse than 1080P technically, 30 fps is worse than 60 fps technically.  There is nothing subjective about it.    objectivegamereviews.com does a pretty good job at ironically objective game reviews.   	72
 "This is not a test."   Was hoping for nsfw...   I ask because it seems like every woman takes serious offense to the c**t word even if its not directed at them, and I honestly can't think of any male counterparts.

Ideally someone else would put in all the leg work, carry this idea through to fruition, then get super rich off of it so I can send them a screenshot of this post in a few years and try to get a couple million dollars in sympathy money from them, all without leaving my beanbag.      The safety is always useful, regardless of whether the gun is loaded or not because it provides an unambiguous indication of the weapon's condition to anyone, and secondly we are not talking about weapons with organic safeties we are talking about a MK17.   Yeah true. I guess that's why they don't put safeties on guns, they just assume the gun owner just constantly checks the chamber instead of flicking a pesky switch, amiright.   That's exactly my point. If you rack it and put it on safe, then you know 100% its safe. Then when you're done taking pictures of it to show people on the internet, then you can again visually clear the chamber, put it on fire, and release the firing pin to relieve spring tension for storage until the next time you want to take it out and take pictures of it.

 Indeed:  https://www.vox.com/2015/4/30/8518681/protests-riots-work  Violent protests, including riots, and then full blown revolutions, are just part of a scale - the scale of "how much you're inconveniencing the government" with the "protest".  It's the *government* that should be listening to peaceful protests - such as let's say Occupy Wallstreet - but they don't, and then leave people no choice, but to "escalate" the protests. And when violence and window breaking starts, it appears to be "sudden", when in fact it's just the people letting out their old frustrations that are bubbling up.      [Halo](http://www.catholictradition.org/Saints/patrons-halo4.jpg) authentication. Calling it!      Along with an 8k resolution.         Great point.                  Wasn't France the one that broke international law and stopped the Bolivian president plane just on the *rumor* that Snowden might be on board?  http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-23174874   Or it could be a Mexican drug cartel using Chinese botnets. How do they really know? My guess is that if it *was* a Mexican cartel trying to get info on US government employees that they can blackmail, then the NSA wouldn't say it's them anyway, and would probably still blame it on China. There's nothing to gain for the NSA from saying it's a Mexican cartel that did it. What would they do about that (politically) - start *another* war on drugs?  Either way, it seems the US government is taking absolutely *zero* responsibility for the hack "well, because China...and they have good hackers" - or something.  It would be even worse if say Nigeria or hackers from Moldova got all that info. Because that would make *them* look like the main people to blame for it, as they would look completely incompetent.  Also, Recorded Future and I'm sure other security companies as well, have found that this info is [all over the web](https://www.recordedfuture.com/government-credentials-report/) already. So it really doesn't matter if "China has it" anymore. *Everyone has it* (interested enough to pay for it).   So when is end-to-end encryption coming to Hangouts?            All SF86 forms were leaked, not just the data of OPM employees.  http://bigstory.ap.org/article/d842d757851b4a59aca2aecf2f31995a/union-says-all-federal-workers-fell-victim-hackers             Will 4.0 finally bring end-to-end encryption as well (both chat and video)?                                                      What about TextSecure's multi-party protocol?   Apps authenticating with the OS means significantly stronger "sandbox". It seems even the current mobile sandboxes (which are kind of state of the art among *mainstream* operating systems) are still rather vulnerable to hacking/malware:  http://www.macworld.com/article/2937239/zero-day-exploit-lets-app-store-malware-steal-os-x-and-ios-passwords.html     OpenDNS will provide some security against *known* malware domains.  For privacy/anti-censorship it might be better to use something like https://www.opennicproject.org/   Because people are completely clueless about:  1) how much data they are willingly giving to web services that they can make public  2) how much those companies track them  All they need to do is get that data from those companies. Many people say "I don't have anything to hide" - until something like that actually happens to them, and *then* they realize just *how much* they care about privacy.   I'm perfectly fine with this sort of limitation. Give 5GB a month at full speed, and the rest at 300-500Kbps.   Only if 500 million of those are pirated.      The Enigma Machine, Part 2.               Great, the MPAA has infiltrated both the ICANN and the [W3C](https://www.defectivebydesign.org/dont-let-the-mpaa-buy-the-web) now.   Apps that are authenticated with the OS seems to be all the new rage now. I want that.   CYBER CYBER CYBER!  And you know how we can improve cybersecurity? By asking all the major companies to put backdoors in their encryption and by collecting even more of everyone's data, which will be kept "OPM-safe" in the government's "cloud"! What's not to like?  -- US Government      That's interesting - wouldn't this ruling nullify the "Third Party Doctrine" as well then?   The story of the Obama administration, pretty much. No one is ever responsible for anything and there are never admitted "abuses".                     Usually it takes about 10 years (8% density improvement year over year) to *double* the capacity for the same price (and size).  I really think we're going to see *at least* a quadrupling in density for batteries over the next 10 years. The first doubling is going to come by default as mentioned. The second doubling will come through a combination of Tesla's Gigafactories significantly lowering the price of batteries (so you can add bigger density for the same fixed price) and new "breakthroughs" such as this new manufacturing process, or by switching to solid state batteries, or whatever else will become reality in the next 10 years.  A quadrupling in density would mean even $15,000-$20,000 cars with 300+ mile ranges will become a reality over the next decade. Even if on paper you'd get a $20,000 EV that has the same specifications as a $15,000 gas-powered car (so $5,000 more expensive for the same specs, because of the battery cost), you'd still be better off in the long term because of much less maintenance, much cheaper charging and so on. So even if people intended to buy a $15,000 car, they would still try to buy a $20,000 EV because they'll know it will cost them much less in the long term.  When 300 mile batteries will be only $5,000 of the price of a car, EVs will start replacing cars *at all price levels*.            But that's not the only thing. It's also Moore's Law. 1440p LCDs displays these days probably use about as much as 1080p LCDs used 2 years ago, too. The problem is when companies like Sony use those  2012 1080p panels to tout energy efficiency.  However, there's also the issue of needing a more powerful GPU. New Adreno GPUs are only like 30% more powerful than last year's high-end generation. Same goes for other GPUs more or less.                              I thought it's at least a little relevant here, because I know there have been some discussions in the past about whether to enable encryption on Android by default or not. Although I think most here would do it *as long as there's hardware assistance* to make the performance impact negligible.   Hopefully with Android M and beyond all OEMs will enable encryption by default, as they should all have hardware that support it by then, even at the low-end (Cortex-A53 chips).  Besides the given reasons in the post, there's also that whole other issue of scrambling your data so that when you sell your phone, you don't let others recover your pictures, or Google accounts and so on.               But that would ruin the "nation-state villain" profile the US government is trying to put in Americans' minds when it comes to hacking.  It's much easier to pass new surveillance laws when "China is attacking us! We NEED THIS!" than "China, but also Russia, and Bulgaria, and South Africa, etc are hacking us...but also tons of random hackers and criminal organizations....and also that's mainly our fault for thinking encryption is literally Hitler so we shouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole and for securing our stuff so poorly because we invest 90% of our "defense" budgets on *offense*...oh, and we're hacking others much more than they do us, too, and we want to give the same powers to the FBI and the US police to hack anyone in the world as well."  I mean that already paints a much more complex and confusing picture about hacking and would make passing laws to give themselves more powers and strip away more of the Americans' rights much more difficult.  So "China is hacking us!" it is.   I agree for the same reasons. It's so much easier to "make it" in the US, because the market is almost completely homogeneous, making it "easy" to sell products for millions of dollars, and for the same reason to get investments of millions of dollars in your startup. It's a zillion times harder to do the same "in Europe", because Europe is so fragmented, and English not being an official (at least second) language hinders things as well.   So? That doesn't explain why the subsidies weren't cut let's say 10 or 20 years later. Subsidies should only be used in the early years of a new technology or industry to give that industry a "boost". Otherwise you could also make the argument that renewable energy should get subsidies for 100 years as well, until we're all using 100% renewable energy (which seems to be the rather weak goal of the G7 countries right now).  Yet, in countries like Germany subsidies for renewables were already cut after about 5 years only, and in the US they are about to go down from 30% to 10% in a year and I think completely gone by 2020.  The problem with leaving subsidies for much longer than 10 years or so is that the industry gets accustomed to that money from the government and doesn't invest in increasing efficiency as much as it should when they are forced by the market to drop prices below a certain price level. Or they simply pocket that difference in profit.   The oil companies are some of the richest companies on Earth and have been for their entire lifetimes, yet somehow we *still* need to subsidize them - why?! Do you really thin that if their subsidies were cut, they *wouldn't* bring down their prices and cut into their own profits? Of course they would. Because if they keep prices at say $6 per gallon instead of $4, then many more people would be interested in buying an electric car.   Seriously, probably the best way to drastically increase the security of its systems is for the US government to switch to its own distro of Linux.  And no, I don't just say that because "Linux is more secure than Windows" or whatever, but because the fact that 90% of the world's computers run on the same OS means a TON of people are invested in exploiting it, which means it's not just a top priority for *many* governments to hack it (not just China or Russia, who would focus on breaking the US gov's Linux distro anyway, but others with lower budgets as well) and it's also much easier for them to buy exploits from the black market.  If the US gov alone used say a distro called "Gov-X", it would also be much easier to track those who try to exploit it and hack it. The same thing is futile with Windows hackers, as there are always thousands more waiting in the shadows.   Condoleezza is a real material girl, isn't she?   Because it can be abused.                                          My favorite part is how they say they only spy to catch terrorists, yet actively try to break "commercial security software" that would only ever be used by *enterprise customers*.                   Not sure if Uber fits in this so well. It's not that cheap...  Also, if Uber "wins" we're going to have one mega-corporation owning 50-60% or more not just of a country's "taxis", but of *all* of the world's taxis. That is the opposite of decentralization. Do we really want one company to be the "Google" or Windows of taxis? (in terms of market share).                           It seems like Microsoft would like to benefit from all the PR of "giving Windows 10 away for free!" - without actually really doing that, except perhaps for a very small number of users.         Upvotate de r/romania, un subreddit de calitate.  I know, truf hartz.   A glass/metal Nexus 5, better design, 3,000 mAh battery, 1080p (modern) panel, Snapdragon 820 with Sense ID and this hybrid auto-focus, along with 13MP camera with 1/2.3" sensor would be sweet.   Nvidia? Intel has been doing it for years by bundling its CPUs and GPUs *even if the notebooks already came with a GPU*.   In theory, it should be better. It has both laser focus and phase detection, that's the whole point of this video.   Sony has been using a 1/2.3" sensor for quite some time, and it's quite thin (Xperia Z3+ is only [6.9mm thick](http://www.gsmarena.com/sony_xperia_z3+-6878.php) - just because Apple puts smaller sensors of 8MP that are thicker than that, doesn't mean everyone does that, too). At least I'd like to see more 13MP cameras use a sensor that large.                        This is why when the media says "the attack came from China!" you shouldn't immediately believe the attack was done *by China*. It could be anyone in the world using any of those tens of millions of zombie PCs to do their attacks - including people from the US.                     It's actually a smartphone that *looks* like a camera, not a camera that has smartphone functions. But Panasonic being a camera company, I guess it preferred to go with the "camera" marketing positioning (a mistake imo).   So the answer is yes.    How do you propose a tax like this and still come up trillions short in revenue?  Who said you're coming up trillions short in revenue? Are you referring to that article/top comment on r/politics from a few days ago?  That article and top comment were only referring to the 14.5% tax on income and touting how then the government would come up short on revenue. But as this article here says, the 14.5% VAT tax would bring twice as much revenue as the 14.5% income tax.                              How is the security compared to ChaCha20? Does it obtain its extra performance mainly by reducing the security as well?   And by that do they mean giving yet more billions of dollars to ISPs and carriers based only on the promise that they will expand their networks without actually see if they've followed through on that promise?                                                                                                               The US gov just lost a big trove of spy database (which likely included connections to UK spies, too) to Chinese hackers a week ago - and now they blame Snowden's 5 year old documents for this? Yeah, what's not to trust?!         If only they focused on actually mandating strong security and encryption in government agencies instead of trying to pass more surveillance laws.  The NSA is promoting the lie that it can "protect the networks" by acting as an anti-virus. From recent Snowden docs we learned that the NSA was already illegally doing that, yet it didn't stop the OPM hack, and it couldn't have. Security tools like anti-viruses and even firewalls don't work as well anymore.   What they need to recommend is strong *end-device* security, not strong network security. So when a hacker tries to breach a network, with strong end-device security, he would have to basically hack every single device, rather than the network gateway and then easily get access to thousands of PCs. Google is doing the [same thing](https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en/us/pubs/archive/43231.pdf)(pdf) with its networks now, and it's what everyone should be doing.   But of course the NSA doesn't want strong end-device security, because that would mean stuff being harder for them to steal as well. So the US government needs to decide once and for all if spying is more important, even if it means getting all of its data stolen as well, or actual security and protecting everyone.      The US gov just lost sensitive data for intelligence personnel in a hack and now they're trying to put the blame on Snowden's 2+ year old documents, but they are getting the UK government to do the propaganda for them on this. If you may have noticed the US and UK governments have quite coordinated public campaigns when it comes to stuff like this.  http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/06/13/standard_form_86_data_breach/   They're trying to put the blame on Snowden now. Yeah, the US gov just lost sensitive data of millions of federal employees including military and intelligence people, and somehow Snowden's 2+ year old document leak is to blame for putting spies at risk.   AKA "more cyber".   1) ISPs can insert ads (on top of the regular web-based ads)  2) you can actually get [malware](https://citizenlab.org/2014/08/cat-video-and-the-death-of-clear-text/) this way    Start harassing them everywhere you can about it: Twitter, Facebook, comments.

 have you paid your dues?   come on man! I'll admit High Life isn't the best song, but beneath Night Vision?   Nothin' or double   May I ask what fanfic? it sounds familiar to one of my favorites.   OP should quit being a wussy!   yeah but have to realize those remakes were 2D. I can see turning [this](http://ps3maven.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/final-fantasy-iv-super-nintendo-snes-064.jpg) into [this](http://i.imgur.com/vdCcz.jpg?1), but [this](http://snackedup.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/final-fantasy-7-cloud-model-up-close.png)? With something like  FF7 which is in 3D they would have to create new character models, create all-new non-prerendered backgrounds, and new animations to match.   I think they should bring back the battle system from 10; It was so good I can't believe they took it out of 10-2. But make the battle party 4 people instead of 3 and set the game in a setting like IX. That's how i think Square can make a comeback.   My bad, I meant 15 not 14   why its take on the "rag-tag group of rebels fights evil empire" cliche is so special  I think it's because at the time that type story wasn't cliche yet. Besides Star Wars i can't really think of another example like it. Also at the time, and I emphasis time, this was still a new idea. It's like Citizen Kane. If you compare it to modern day movies most would say it's average. But you need to realize when it came out no one told stories in a flashback/interview way like it did, no one did make-up like it did, and no one used that style of cinematography (with it's use of deep focus lens and low-angle shots).   In FF6 we had a large group of at least 14 main characters with their own personalities and we would switch to different parties at certain parts of the game. No one did that, at the time.   So I'm saying If you compare it to the later entires like FF7 it's not going to like look a masterpiece. But if you dial back the clock and look at what came out before it and around it, the game is great.   It was goin' good in the beginning... but they had to do the drop.    "annoying FF7 fans" that never actually appear...  Yes they do appear and I think that's whats making people mad. Don't get me wrong I love FF7, but ever since the PS3 tech demo came out people have begging for a remake. I want a remake too, especially for the rest of the PS1 Final Fantasy's. But it's not gonna happen. Square is no longer Square Soft, it's Square Enix. And since the merger things haven't been looking up for the series. They can barely develop the games they're already working on, aka Versus 13/XV.  So yes those fans do appear. And it's not that people think the game is overrated, it's just that people are tired of hearing people beg for a remake.  *edit 1  I meant to say 'XV' not 'XIV'    Thanks for the vid :). At first I wasn't too fond of Oliver but he's grown on me, especially when he took over the Daily Show over the summer. I heard he might get his own show so that's good.   I was hoping XV would go back to roots like IX did. IX is my favorite game in the series and that's because, like you said, final fantasy works best in a setting without ultra-futuristic technology. It can work with that setting, but not at it's best.   You're right there was nothing memorable. For example in most of the other Final Fantasy's we were given a, I don't know how else to say this, memorable villain. In 13 we were given fal'Cie and even after playing the game I still don't know if they're good guys, bad guys, or just guys.      original DragonBall or Z?    What did you think of the new remake?   Happy Cake-day!   Happy Birthday!   [Big Trouble in Little China](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HEitZ06oRY), an awesome 80's movie that's nonstop fun (seriously there's like no boring parts)   Growing up.

That's why I need to become Peter Pan, so I can stay young forever :)   A jumped-up pantry boy, Who never knew his place :)   I would go out tonight, but I haven't got a stitch to wear     http://i.imgur.com/AmPUHgu.jpg?1  found this a while ago and really liked it   Same here :)   When I first read it I really liked it and I still do. But after rereading over the past couple of years I just feel really sorry for Holden. That's because if you really get down to it he's lazy and cynical to the world around him, and it's saddening knowing he lives with that mindset. That's while I don't understand why he's such an ideal. I'm not saying he's a bad character, I'm saying he shouldn't be looked at as someone you inspire to be or put on a pedestal.   Don't give up on skateboarding. I just started doing it the past couple of weeks and it's hella fun.   Holy shit! AP calc! What did you take in middle school?

 I thought it was very well done, though i thought it could've ended a few minutes before it did. I think about 10 or so. I also liked it's production design. If it weren't for that clam-shell e-reader (What's the meaning behind that?) I would've sworn it was set in the 80's.     	2

 As a person that lived in Yugoslavia,nah Titos death was a pretty sad moment.   Its an amazing dark themed rpg,if you like those types of games and havent heard of it before,you should check it out!   Aye,I guess i could tune in tommorow morning,but i could also use some help with campaign,killing the Chef in particular is taking me too long.Even when i use spears and knives.   Its a tactical squad shooter.If you played Ghost Recon before then theres your explanation.If not,well youre basically in a squad with a couple of other people,and you get objectives(Take out other squad,capture locations).Its based in Vegas(duh) spec ops teams and it uses cover systems like Mass Effect(if you played it).Yes,yes it is fun but its an old game nonetheless.   Guess we were all wrong in the prediction thread.Well played microsoft,well played.   Any of the mass effect series,all the games are awesome and are generally pretty cheap pre owned   I think youre thinking of /r/datgap bro   dear god this is awesome      Ok,after playing the game all i have to say is that it aint that bad guys.Yes,for some reason i think the first one looked better,played better and all in all just WAS a better game.The problem with this game is the same with DmC:Devil may Cry.It would be a great stand alone game.But as a long awaited PvZ sequel?Meh.   Also a Mass Effect game would be god given,I have played the 2nd and the 3rd,with Mass Effect 2 being one of the best RPGs ive played in a long time!   To be honest,I only heard of Defense Grid over steam and never really knew it was on other platforms.That said,its not that bad.Well atleast the PC version i played   Hi!As we all know,the two games they gave out this month were based on being open world(ish).So what bundle do you think they might give next?Im rooting for a Witcher+Dragons Age title,which would make sense.Or something like a Oblivion(lets be honest,we aint getting skyrim) + Fallout 3,which are both fantastic titles.   Anyway,i want you hear what you guys think!    EDIT:Well its magic the gathering 2013 and rainbow six Vegas.Seems like none of us can predict for shit.Well,see guys later this month in another Predictions thread!   Was it ever considered to be added in the future?I know we arent that much big of a deal,but the question always bugged me,probably since i played my first fifa.   ammo?I passed the whole game with a super sledge   Or some reason,I read this in Treant Protectors voice(cant link now,on my phone,will link in the morning if it means anything)   Eh djoka in serbian is a slightly humorous name for penis,still we call him either that or nole   Old riki had a moving death ward for his ult   Leshrac is an amazing mid if run right,though hes preffered in a support combo   When i started,i thought it was derived from Assist,and i would constanlty go to lanes to help those poor guys out,and then get confused by why they need assistance when they are alone   Us Serbians recognizing Kosovo seems like the least likely of those to end up happening soon.

Female Thor, Mrs. Marvel, black Captain America, Miles Morales as Spider Man. Just curious.          I would start with Drown, his first collection of short stories. His second book is a novel called The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao. This won a Pulitzer for fiction, but is usually the least liked of his books. I loved it, but I would read Drown first. Finally, This is How You Lose Her is his second collection of short stories and was released last year. He's apparently working on a Dominican Apocalypse story now, which will be amazing. If you Google him you can probably find a number of his stories online. He publishes in The New Yorker every couple of years.    Junot Diaz will cure that for you.    Go home, you're drunk. That's how we say it in the biz.   That's what got me too.   Not fucker, but he definitely had his moments.   He was awesome.   	23
 Good job. That burlapp app is junk.    I'll contribute by starting tonight. How many other users we need for the lead?   ugh, thought it was too good to be true. it wasn't my primary residence either. oh well.  thanks for the info.   Checks out.   To make it quick and hopefully easy to understand (and I REALLY appreciate any help):  1) Sold real estate in August of 2013. The sale was a part of a divorce settlement. 2) The divorce is actually finalized in 2014.  My understanding is I won't be taxed on the profits of that sale since it was a settlement (the money is ultimately going to the ex wife).  Is this correct?  Thanks again for any help.

Population isn't growing as fast, but it is not declining: http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/50000.html  This isn't much different than overall U.S. population.

In many states you don't have to be married to be awarded this as long as you were together for at least a certain number of years (typically 7 I believe).  Ironically, the same number of years to be considered dead if you haven't been heard from.   Because you need to know the exact right moment to say "that's the epitome of a team win right there". Too early and it's chaos.   I hear he's organized...   So much feels.   I was high on Philbin. Now, not so much.

It's his pride, and he should only deliver what is acceptable to him.   The way I see it, what Incognito did was stupid, what Martin did was downright devious and manipulative.  If he wanted to leave, fine. Leave but support your friend, who was trying to support you. Come out and say "Incognito is not the reason why I am leaving, he is my friend."

The first amendment doesn't allow you to say what you want on a privately owned website. The owner of the site, tumblr, has rules and they can remove you. Removing you from tumblr does not impact your right to free speech.   Yes.   It's clear these people are so unhappy with themselves that they perceive any attempt at helping them recognize their unhappiness as a threat, and so they resort to knocking down the individual as a way of propping themselves up.   They feel so low that they hold refuge with the idea that they are "good people", singularly attaching that to themselves as their value, but then don't see their own behavior through a realistic lens for what it is...being very rude.  I feel for them on many levels...but wake the fuck up.   Why does it seem like there can't be a real discussion without it quickly deteriorating with insults?  I'd really like to have a thoughtful conversation because I am legitimately interested in their philosophy and its foundations, but it's like every question to probe their thoughts is taken as an insult and so is followed by an actual insult.   That actually explains a bit what's going on here.   Happy to help.   Well my tweet would be "@J_Martin71 choke on a dick you fucking Jets fan."  Who's mature now, eh? WHO'S MATURE NOW?

Thanks for those tips, you gave me some things to think about.    Hi Reddit DIY,  I'm not that handy...so help with this is appreciated.  I want a speed bag (you know, boxing...) but I don't want to drill into my wall or buy a more expensive free standing one. I do, however, already own a Bowflex Body Tower (http://www.amazon.com/Bowflex-BodyTower/dp/B006353HCE) so I thought it could be possible to add one to it.  Note that I am 6'2" and the Body Tower is just taller than I by about 2 inches, so I need to account for that when adding the bag.   Another requirement is that I want to be able to remove the speed bag appendage when I want to use the tower.  Ideas? Probably a weird request, I know, but I really appreciate any help.   You know, that WOULD work.    I don't give a crap about the comments that he's "flat" or "unemotional", agree with you that there are successful coaches who aren't the "ra - ra" type.

I think one of the reasons Belichick is routinely successful is all the teaching that happens.   Yep.   There's not enough tequila in Mexico...   Please this.   I guessed Gore Verbinski.

 Me personally?  I like to use the search feature to see the 300 other times someone asked those question.   That's basically my line of thinking   No idea it's probably something custom.   Nope hood was closed otherwise I would have.   None, the guy can't have passion projects?   I am thinking a lot about this in my current job as well as how I want to run my startup that I am working on launching and when I think about what if it becomes successful and I employ 10, 50 500 people and will the business thrive based on certain ideas I want to implement.  A lot of the ideas I have gotten come from 37 Signals which puts out a blog with some very interesting work practices.  Some of the things I would like to implement are:  * Unlimited vacation  * Unlimited sick days * 32 hour weeks * Remote working, where I would encourage employees to move not just to different places in the country but live in different countries. Team and single person projects where people could pursue different ideas that interest them.    The last thing I would want to implement and probably the most difficult is a sliding job description is the best way I can describe it.  Basically I am bored and sick of doing the same job for the past three years with no promotion and hardly any raises.  What i would want is the job to evolve with the person as they learn and grow.  I see this being difficult because I think finding managers who not only can stay on top of employees and how they are improving but also seeing their skills and where they fit in the company will be really difficult to find.  But if you can keep a job fresh and give a person the feeling of moving forward both monetarily and career wise will help keep them invested in the company.  The other issue too is if you offer too many perks like the above, will they be abused?  Will anything get accomplished or am I overdoing it too much?  It definitely would be a balancing act.   That is not true for every industry, such as programmers coders and software engineers.   Negative    Agreed, and the best way to incentive employees to want to share your company in social media, is to create an awesome work environment that makes them want to share.     He isn't wrong but the success of the movie greatly benefits him and his brand for future roles and comedy specials etc.  But hey do what you want.  I don't think a company should make it mandatory, but depending on what you are asking and how it could benefit you in the long term should also be taken into consideration.      I'm not convinced yet that Kane's the real deal.  He had a great season but really struggled toward the end of the season.  He doesn't look like he should be good but he defies expectations and keeps scoring.  I'm really curious to see if he'll keep developing.  	12
 The great thing about it going to Netflix was how much creative freedom was given to the show itself. Normally, we'd assume it'd be a complete risk to take a show to a streaming company, but Kevin Spacey and David Fincher didn't even hesitate.   I really hope Netflix grabs more projects like this.          The Dawn of the Age of the Rise of LG   you can do anything you set your mind to         Nah, I just put that there as a draft. The logo's meant to be standalone when it all comes down to it. As for the monochrome, that's the big thing I'm trying to solve right now.   Edit: by standalone, i mean that I'll have 'Art   Politik' written and placed differently to complement how the logo is sized and placed itself.   Awkward. That is a P...   Thanks for that.

It definitely needed work on keeping consistent with how emotionally ignited the opening scenes were, but the script still managed to keep people seated with what it offered.  But damn, they really should have utilized Cranston and Watanbe more.  Thanks for the feedback!   He did. The context is that he started realizing he was losing heart for it as filming was taking place. There's a quote by him from a biography cited on my page if you want to read exactly what he said.          I'm with you on that. As much as I'll criticize that movie, The Lost World is an irreversible staple in my childhood. I just watched it again a few weeks ago after finishing the book, and I still love it.   The movie's got its glaring flaws, but it doesn't mean we can't enjoy it for what it is. That scene with Julian Moore was pure classic Spielberg. From all the summer movies that come out these days, I found myself appreciating scenes like that a lot more.      MACHINE SHOP^SHOP^SHOP^SHOP   Ha! I'm laughing myself now, too. Shit gets rough in the suburbs...   For the record, I didn't mean for it to come across like that. I've kept that car since then, and I love it. I don't consider it a hardship in the slightest bit.

I completely agree with you. I hope I didn't come off as otherwise. I didn't mean to say that photographers shouldn't act like that because it endangers rights; I was only writing about how it does.  When I was writing it, I used the paparazzi as more of an example to remind us that we need to watch how we act when we shoot in public. It was to show that we need to remember to be respectful because doing otherwise just makes us look bad and hypocritical. I pointed out the danger it has to rights to show a secondary consequence of it as well; that's why I had the title include that the activities of paparazzi are dangerous for 'photographers *and* their rights'.

So from now on, when something goes wrong in Halo, be it lore, MM, general problems the Chief will face. We say ***Thanks Del Rio***  Flood? *Thanks Del Rio*  Character death? *Thanks Del Rio* MCC broken? *Thanks Del Rio*   With part of the game being set before HTT. I'm really thinking we'll be playing as chief when he rocks those SS at the embassy   I don't think he will. Even Joseph Staten was extremely reluctant to get involved with halo   Guise.

It's unfortunate, and isn't an indicator. But that was the thought process back in the day, and reverence to god *does* generally help build good men as a foundation for quality character, I think that's the main thought process.   I straight up told them I wasn't sure about religion or god, they told me that's fine you're young. 9 times out of 10 they will find an excuse to pass you as long as you aren't callus about it. They know it's kind of a stupid rule, but religion is integral to scouting.    They already are private.    I had mine a month ago. Class of 2015! Fuck yeah. Made some of my best friends from my years in the sticks.   In regard to Atheists, it's easy to get away with it. For example, the rule states you must believe in a *higher power*. You can claim your higher power is The Universe as I did, or whatever. Most of the time they won't deny you entrance based on that as it's handled on the troop level.    His arms remind of Anchor Arms from Spongebob.   I've been apart of it for the better part of my life. I can say with absolute certainty that scouting is one of the last true bastions of youth development and citizenship in America. IMO it undoubtedly trains and equips better and more honorable citizens and well rounded men.   It's a shame all of that crap the organization has been put through in regards to sex abuse and gaining a bad rep. They are caught between a rock and a hard place with funding from both human rights organizations and churches, both threatening to withdraw funding if they don't get their way, and right at a time in history when young men need scouting the most.    We'd literally do that after a Board of Review lmao   Damn babey, you're HOT!   I can't agree with that. I blame the UEG government being set up wrong in the first place.

I want more.   But Jun thinks Six is dead :/   He's alive. There is absolutely no concrete evidence he is dead. We never see the last few moments and Bungie specifically did that, we're meant to assume. I get it's implied he's dead. But it wouldn't be hard to bring him back, and state that Jun simply didn't know.   Well, Chief was designed as that "vessel" character as well for the games. He had development in the books, but it was always second to the game. They could develop Six or Rookie more if they wanted too. They were in the same boat chief was in 2001 without the book.    Dat halo 5 guardians. Can't wait.   He won't get the nomination unfortunately. He's too far away from the Fox news/establishment wing. I can almost guarantee they will give it to Bush.

If Rand gets nominated however, the Republicans have a serious chance of winning. It's sad how they don't realize this    You were the one that betrayed our sacred alliance...    He still shouldn't get subsidies at all. No corporation should.    He had like 100 patents. And without him or JP Morgan, homes wouldn't have electricity. He did invent it.

These exact graphics and art. Beautiful.   I usually enjoy gaming parodies. That was just awful   Stop right there.    Yes. But there is a big difference between halo and destiny lore. Halos lore is much more expansive and frequent, tons of new posts pop up on /r/halostory. Its just a place for in depth discussion of the lore and where it can be the front page thing rather than clips.    Perfectly put   More pics. How tall are you?   That's actually hilarious   This is essentially it. Bungie went for fun. During the h1 commentary, they said "we tried to think what weaponry would be like 500 years from now, and it wouldn't have been fun, so we had to use conventional bullets."   WHERE DOES IT END.   Not sure honestly. I'm not mad either way. It would be nice to get some confirmation though.   Sapien Sunrise      If anything, he did what was within regulation. He did what he always had done, no huge risks. But at the time he was looking out for his ship. Huge mistake   John D Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie worth well into almost 1 trillion dollars. Decided it was time to give back to society in their later years, Rockefeller by himself ended up giving 585(?) billion dollars to philanthropic causes and leaving about 200 billion for his family. Carnegie gave just as much.    Then they get older and maul you.   I don't support subsidies of any kind. But he is like a modern day JP Morgan, Vanderbilt, and Rockefeller rolled into one. Only not as rich because his tech hasn't taken off yet and become mass market viable.    3 means heart.   He ruined halo with his sprint nonsense.

 It's truthful, though, which to some people is the highest thing a film can aspire to be. It's okay not to like it, but that doesn't make it bad.      Hard core truegaming answer time. In film and narrative theory, there's a school of thought that **meaning** is found in **excess**. Basically,that means that the bare bones of story have a limited ability to *say* things, and that the substance of a work is in what you layer on top of the story--the excess, if you will.  The literal textbook example of this is the work of a director named Douglas Sirk: he almost exclusively made melodramatic "woman's pictures" with fairly basic stories, but he's commanded a cult/academic following for the decisions he made in terms of color, pacing and composition--innesential to story, but crucial to how his films are interpreted. A more modern example is Quentin Tarantino, a filmmaker who's essentially made a career out of excess: broken down to their narrative elements, *Pulp Fiction* and *Inglourious Basterds* are fairly simple stories. What makes those movies memorable are the things that have nothing to do with story: the visuals, the side conversations, the allusions and music cues, *that's* where the personality, the meaning and the substance is--in the excess.  With Nintendo: at this point, the Mario template is an established narrative: jump on bad guys, power up, get coins and save the princess. The meaning of a Mario game then, is in how it delivers and diverges from that formula. I make the case here for *Super Mario Galaxy*: the plot is the same as every Mario game since the 80s, but the *excess* is a bizarre, sublime and surprisingly thoughtful abstraction of human exploration of the cosmos: gravity, our Newtonian rock in every Mario game ever, now varies with context. Representations of infinity are introduced: if you run forward in any other Mario game, you'll eventually hit the boundary of a level; run forward on a sphere in space and you'll just keep running. In terms of narrative excess, we have nothing less than [a living universe of star stuff lovingly experiencing itself, transforming, and being born again.](http://www.mariowiki.com/Rosalina's_Storybook) The Mario template is the means of delivery; the meaning is the stuff of *Tree of Life* and/or a particularly poignant acid trip, and it's a particular Nintendo brilliance that so much of this cosmic exploration is conveyed through the ever-evolving game mechanics.  All of this is to say, I couldn't care less about "new IPs." If new characters and settings are the best method to convey a new game idea then that's wonderful, but there's something enormously powerful about allowing beautiful games to draw from and engage with established stories and settings. You can overwrite Mario through a convoluted narrative arc, you can give him a dark backstory and complex human emotions, or you can tell a different story--a universal story--by running, jumping and coin-collecting through a whole new universe.   Don't forget visual design, not great with that either.   with all due respect, that's why preorders are dumb.   [Here's a post-RBF Scotty song called "The Hilarious,"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHdUaxsccTo) well worth checking out. Also, his side project album *[Better Bookends](http://grooveshark.com/#!/album/Better+Book+Ends/285653)* was a formative one for me--Scott's still one of my favorite voices, I'd love to see him record more.   I loved *This is the End*. The last scene was funny, but it didn't really match the tone of the rest of the movie--it would have worked better about thirty seconds into the credits, with the "official" ending being the ascent, that way it could still be included and get laughs without detracting the darkness of the rest of the movie. I guess that's not a question. Anyway, great job, I'm looking forward to your next directorial work!   Well, that's pretty obviously not the point. Printing guns with intent to sell or supply to others is the far more logical territory covered here, and I think regulating that is perfectly reasonable. If you print a gun off the grid for hobby or sport, and someone else, with or without your permission, uses it to kill people, you should bare some legal responsibility.   Hey guys. I'm sure that we can all agree that whatever value the correction above may or may not have had, everything after it including this was a waste of time.   This site looks like awesome, I just bought a sample poster with my own design. I play in a few bands and work on independent movies now and then; if this works I'll definitely be back for some big orders at some point.   Yeah, that's pretty characteristic of the site. Less emphasis on decimal point review scores, more thoughtful long form analysis--very much in keeping with the /r/games and /r/truegaming ethos, I think.         It's exactly that sort of equivalency that is fueling much of the Obama criticism, I think. Many on the left are eager to appear fair-minded and non-partisan and such, so they're attacking Obama with the same vehemence they did Bush. That certainly doesn't apply to all Obama critics or all liberals, but it is a phenomenon that I'm noticing in my personal circle. While this sometimes results in some silly comparisons--most of the administration's failings fall short of 9/11 and the Iraq war, in my opinion--I generally respect the impulse.  That said, the OP's point stands that people should be engaged in legislative races if they want to change anything. I think that a really good presidential candidate could get a lot done by consistently reminding people that there are other big races, and spreading awareness of platforms and records in the legislative arena. The old, statistically borne out adage is that American's hate congress but love their congressmen; I think people on the national stage who really care about change should address that as much as possible.   [Drink it up?](http://youtu.be/RKQ3LXHKB34?t=40s)   That's pretty much the point of the subreddit, isn't it? if you come in just looking for an excuse to change positions for ulterior reasons, you're not really operating in the spirit of the challenge.   Sometimes I'm pretty puzzled and surprised by what *really* makes me laugh. This is one of those times   I love Arrested Development and have enjoyed David Cross's other work, but he really comes off as a bit of a douche sometimes.   Exactly, we're all adults here.   That's an oddly succinct portrait of me as a ten-year-old   Don't have one.   I just want him and Jay-Z to play the [Grey Album version of "99 Problems"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2l-dvU9tOw) live. Just once. It would be awesome.   I mention this because I was just thinking about Edgar Allen Poe's "The Raven." When you're a kid, the prospect of a talking bird who only says one thing is at best creepy and at worst silly. As an adult though, the prospect of the answer to every question being "nevermore, never again" is kind of terrifying: at some point, "never again" applies to everything in life and everything beyond it; it's pure, true, universal horror, and the more you think about it the scarier it becomes. Are there any other things like that that become scarier with maturity?   Having just moved here, this will help me feel a lot less generally clueless. Thanks!   Expressing clear regret and dedicating the rest of your life to personal and political improvement certainly helps.   I have to say, I have very little sympathy for this point of view. Appreciate your life.   i said. good day.   It's either other individuals or the very idea of crowd-sourcing, but *certainly* not Reddit. Right.   The more this joke gets downvoted, the funnier I find it.   *shhhhh*   Gather ye black toner while you may.   Oh my fucking god you are impossible. I am sorry I try to avoid getting angry on the internet because I know it's stupid but I don't even know what the fuck point you're trying to make. You've switched your wording from "personal" to "private" information, but that was never the fucking conversation, Jesus *Fucking* Fuck.  **HIS *PERSONAL* INFORMATION, INCLUDING NAME AND FAMILY FACEBOOK PAGE, WERE SHARED AND UPVOTED IN A THREAD ABOUT TERRORISTS, DIRECTLY CONTRADICTING THE RULES OF THE [THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1cmtub/fbi_released_photos_of_suspected_boston_bombers/), THE [SUBREDDIT](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/), AND [REDDIT AS A WHOLE](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO SUBSTANTIATE A CONNECTION, AND IT DIRECTLY LED TO HIS FAMILY BEING SAD AND CRYING FOR NO REASON. THAT IS BAD AND THE PEOPLE WHO FACILITATED THAT SHOULD FEEL BAD. THE END. GOOD DAY TO YOU SIR.**   [The Boston PD did no such thing](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/04/it-wasnt-sunil-tripathi-the-anatomy-of-a-misinformation-disaster/275155/)--please read that article before proceeding. There is no evidence that the Boston P.D. ever named him as a suspect in public or private; please let me know if my objection is within the bounds of your comprehension now. :P  Incidentally, one of the users running the live update thread was actually banned from /r/findbostonbombers for his vocal stand against Sunil. When some random sourceless twitter user fabricated the Boston P.D. accusation against him, the anti-Sunil O.P. released that information instantly, accompanied it with the [Ron Paul "It's Happening" gif](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vpE6uMJ37dk/UOScrne47aI/AAAAAAAAEL4/Ki-4IWO-SoY/s1600/ron-paul.gif), and left if up for at least 20 minutes or so. The information spread from there, and the brave new instant crowd-sourced media became a joke. In case you couldn't tell, I was very disillusioned with the whole process.  As for the rest of your objections, you still seem like you're just trying to be difficult, but I take you at your word that you are not. It seems obvious to me that appearing in an unrelated news article a few months ago does not exempt Sunil from Reddit's privacy policy, that his tangential brush with journalism is no substitute for concrete evidence before tying him to terrorism, and linking to that article rather than naming him in plain text is not an acceptable loophole by any stretch. I don't think that a suicidal missing civilian is a sufficiently public figure for the purposes of this conversation, nor do I think his family should ever have had to suffer the accusations they did, but if we simply disagree then I won't belabor the point.   You, my friend, are driving me nuts right now. Literally every single point you made deliberately ignores context in some crucial way. Rather than type swear words at you, which is what I did three times before arriving at this draft, I will use your point by point rebuttal system against you, albeit in service of a coherent larger point rather than a bunch of persnickety semantic objections.  Reddit publicly releases names all the time. Almost every article has someone's name in it. A mere name is not in and of itself personal information.  **Context Ignored:** This was not an article submission. An article submission uses the names of **public figures**, as vetted by the journalistic standards of whoever published the article. Linking to an unrelated article about a civilian in the comments, particularly implying some connection to the submission subject "FBI released photos of suspected Boston bombers - Can you identify them?", is the same as naming them.  **You're Demonstrably Wrong Because:** Naming a civillian is and always has been a violation of [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette), and it's somewhat baffling to me that anyone would think otherwise. This is why, for example, facebook screenshots are required to blur out names, and violators are subject to immediate account deletion.  I am arguing that they are not responsible for the actions taken by other people when following provided links. They are responsible for their own actions only.  **Context Ignored:** Their own actions were wrong. When they linked to the Tripathi's family-run facebook page--Rule III of /r/pics outlaws links to anything hosted on Facebook's servers, by the way--they enabled hostile traffic.  You seem to be arguing that they simply enabled *all* traffic in an entirely neutral way, but come on man. They routed a whole bunch of people *trying to identify murderers* to that page. Best case scenario, nobody does anything. Likely scenario, people will be dicks to a grieving family. In this context, they risk putting a great deal of unhappiness in the world for no particular good. Regardless of whether people are good or bad in that situation, that risk is a moral net loss in any sense, utilitarian or deontological.  No, you're misunderstanding my intention entirely. I used Google because it's an algorithm, not a person. If mere linking is the crime, then the algorithm should be banned because of the results it produced.  **Context Ignrored:** I am not, to be fully clear on an entirely obvious point, saying that neutral linking carries the same moral weight as linking with an agenda or linking in an intrinsically hostile **context**.  An algorithm lacks intentionality in the traditionally human sense, and therefore can't be be held responsible in the same way. I never said "banned," but a faulty algorithm could certainly be altered if it were suggesting irrelevant personal pages to universally hostile audiences.  Honestly though, that's a pretty terrible example. It wasn't an algorithm that submitted and upvoted links to the "Come Home Sunny" facebook page on the "FBI released photos of suspected Boston bombers - Can you identify them?" thread, it was members of the Reddit community--people. That's why I used people in my example.  Again, it's really weird that you think I'm opposed to "linking" on its own. I mean, seriously.   Here's another way to put it. If you can find a torrent link using Google, is Google responsible for copyright infringement? Your argument is that the source of a link is responsible for the actions that third parties take when visiting that link. That philosophy would have an incredibly chilling effect on the Internet.  **Context Ignored:** Algorithms lack intentionality and therefore can't be held morally responsible, people can. Why are we talking about algorithms again? Pure obfuscation?  That's not anywhere near comparable to what occurred. It's more like your search term is "some guy who's whereabouts are unknown and kinda looks like a person who might be a terrorist".  In order to make your position seem reasonable, you had to completely blow things out of proportion. That should tell you something.  **Context Ignored:** I'm going to allow myself one swear word here, and call that an unequivocal load of bullshit. The thread that Sunil Tripathi's name and family-run facebook page were posted to was called "FBI released photos of suspected Boston bombers - Can you identify them?"  **Everyone on that thread was literally literally *literally* searching for the most wanted murder terrorists in America.** They were not searching for some guy who's whereabouts are unknown and kinda looks like a person who might be a terrorist. You're being ridiculous.  What are you talking about? Reddit isn't a court of law. We share web sites all the time, and the rules are clear: no personal information. There's nothing about "evidence" at all. There isn't a higher standard just because this was a story about bombings.  Setting aside the fact that Reddit's prohibition of personal information *was* violated in no uncertain terms, I'm asking for people to use judgment that extends beyond  the letter of a terms of service checklist. Naming Sunil Tripathi as a Boston Bombing suspect with no evidence was **morally** wrong. Reddit users went public with bad information, real people were affected, we can do better next time.   I believe the line drawn was initially no publicly released names, which is entirely appropriate in that case. There was a secure tip line for providing relevant names.  You seem to be arguing that the people who linked to this guy bare no responsibility here, and that blame lies solely on rude commenters. Let's put it this way:  The thing is, there's a huge difference between linking to a site and making rude comments on that site. Is Google to blame if it helps rude people find your blog?  If a group of people at Google, however well intentioned, link to my blog at the top whenever you search "most wanted murder terrorist in america," then yes, that was irresponsible. Not to be a dick about it, but those people should be fired and the rest of Google should clearly condemn their actions. And if my family is inundated with hate and harassment, Google will have to bare some of that blame.  Edit: To be clear, yes, all of that stuff you listed was clearly and explicitly off-limits by virtue of naming someone without evidence.   Not his personal facebook page, but the "come home sunny" facebook page that his family had made for him. Just a collection of heartbroken photos and memories from the people who loved him--about an hour before Reddit linked to it they were posting about how they hoped he would come home to bake and eat ice cream with them.  So yeah, all that those consistently upvoted links accomplished was the facilitation of a bunch of hostile traffic, a bunch of demands for that poor fucking family to speak out if they had nothing to hide. And the funny thing is, there's *no fucking way* that posting that information on Reddit could *ever* help in the investigation--certainly not when the anonymous FBI tip line was available. It doesn't even matter that he was innocent; if he had been guilty then the FBI could have just investigated the accusation in private. There was nothing to gain from that bullshit, only a bunch of pointless sadness for his heartbroken family. Fucking shameful.   I feel so bad for that family. They had just put up something earlier today about how they hoped to cook food and eat ice cream with him, and now all this. The heartbreak must be be unreal.      [Here's some more info for those interested.](http://www.crutchfield.com/S-27S12WD9cpx/learn/learningcenter/home/antenna.html) I'm always a little surprised that more people don't realize this is an option, but combined with a Netflix-like service it pretty much covers all the bases.   Exactly. It's HD, completely free, and probably uses less compression than cable.   Jesus what a shitty novelty account.   You're basically right. If that's all that you were looking for, then stop reading now.  What's way more important than being right, however, is how you use those skills you're talking about. Your immersion in film should allow you to craft a more coherent and better-supported argument about a film's meaning, and your argument should therefore rule the day. At no point should your "qualifications" enter the discussion; if you're truly a "better" cineaste than your friend then your skill will speak for itself. When you make the conversation about yourself or your subculture, you're being a pretentious, insufferable snob and making the rest of us high-functioning, tolerable snobs look bad.  I would also say that film immersion does not automatically make your opinions superior--anyone who's been through film school knows that--nor does casual cinephilia make someone's subjective reaction to a work of art any less valuable. Again, substance of argument trumps personal background.  Being a good cinephile in the real world means showing your friends stuff they might not see otherwise, sharing perspectives they might not have considered, and having something interesting to say when they turn to you and say "but I want to know what [group film dude] thought of it." I doesn't mean we're better than anyone.  **[TLDR](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQl5aYhkF3E)**   nice try Quantel guy   Well, I think that'd be a stretch, but do what you want.   [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) dictates that one should, quite simply, not be rude. The all caps, and particularly the addendum about sucking his dick, detract from the value of his post.   Oh shit, Novelist Jason Bryan has spoken. Back off motherfuckers, he's an 80s analog soul!   I'm not sure where I'm going here  Yeah, there's the rub. You're attributing the jokes to racism and anti-drug sentiment, you then provide a list of counter-examples to your own unsupported premise, lose the plot and call everybody hypocrites.  I don't hate Lil' Wayne, I clearly don't wish death on him, I don't much admire him either, whatever. If that "lil' seizey" crack is what's got you bothered, then get over it, it's a joke about a pop star on Reddit. If you were looking to gush about Tha Carter II and III and the Dedication mixtapes with other casual fans who have listened to everything Wayne ever did, then bummer dude, it was jokes this time.  Honestly, I'd much rather see a Modest Mouse repost every once in awhile than these whiny self-righteous teenager "disappointed" posts.   Red State   Sorry, whenever someone says "sick for the future" in any context, I stop listening.   This is the number one joke in my life that I insist on repeating without the slightest bit of recognition.   I used to play around with a much older version of Gamemaker several years ago, and I remember it as a very accessible GUI for coding pretty much anything you want within the confines of a 2D environment. That was well before the days of smartphones though, haven't kept up since then.   I often downvote simply because a comment is too safe and obvious for any interesting conversation. "Maybe it's just me, but the Beatles are a really good band"  I agree, fuck you, downvoted.   I'm sorry, what is the purpose of posting your Facebook argument in this subreddit? If you're simply looking for an online community of atheists to take your side against a religious stranger who argues poorly, then I think you know where to go.   Here's the thing: I was born in 1989, so I will never have the same experience listening to his vinyl collection as he does. Love the movie, but this kind of thing always leaves me cold--especially when everybody's going to get it on CD or MP3 anyway.      While the extent varies, I'm reasonably sure that some component of divine inspiration is central to all mainstream Christian denominations.   I can confirm it is totally legal and 100% safe, just a loophole that will probably be fixed soon but is great for those of use who can get it whilst it lasts.  Nope, doesn't clear up much at all. For my money, I'm completely unwilling to send personal payment to a stranger for an unsanctioned service upgrade, particularly if they're unwilling to offer information about who they are, their relationship to the company, and how this process supposedly works.  At best, I would guess that you're a Spotify employee exploiting your benefits for personal profit. At worst, you're scamming people out of $15 and/or their personal payment information. With all due respect, I remain justifiably skeptical and give your offer a downvote.   Hmm. It does indeed sound sketchy. How are you able to do this?   Ah, Reddit's featured content is based on user-submitted links and votes then. Just checking.   And where does putting /r/atheism on the front page fit in with the Zionist agenda, precisely?   "You came on the scene just as the plot is thinning" is an Apples in Stereo lyric, so "thins" is not unprecedented.   Thanks!   Thanks!

Ah, cool! I like the idea of putting the required dialog line in a fortune cookie; well done.  I had a similar experience, actually: this competition broke a very long string of unfinished works in progress for me.

Still though.      I was extremely tempted to downvote you because you are wrong, but I'm replying instead so good for me.  Bioshock does not "present" objectivism in the way that, for example, Atlas Shrugged does, but it is inarguably commenting on it, so there goes your first sentence. If Atlas Shrugged-style objectivism "worked" intrinsically, then there should be no dystopia like Rapture possible--by creating a scenario in which strict adherence is observed but everything goes to shit regardless, Bioshock proves that objectivism is at best impotent, and at worst destructive--I'd argue more for the latter.  Because you think Rapture is unobjectivist, I assume you're taking for granted that the ideology was not strictly observed by the characters in Bioshock. If you're assuming they're different simply because things turn out differently from Atlas Shrugged's positive spin, then you're not really engaging with either work. I'd be interested in hearing where you think they diverged.      NO interest in new instruments, and it is in fact crucial to me that my old instruments work after a console upgrade. Gameplay-wise I think it'd be cool to see some sort of story beyond "become famous," and perhaps something a little more experimental/creative in terms of song performance.      dude you fucked up your time to shine with racism.   Come on now. It's 100% possible to have a principled vote based on policy stance parallel to appreciation of a very unique and sincere display of presidential emotion--this man has literally put up with more bullshit than anyone in the world over the last four years, and it's gratifying to see that he's still committed to the stuff I believe in. If you want to write off 61170405 votes as "pshhh guess they're all just *in love with him*," then that's your business, but it seems like a bizarre and sweeping generalization with no supported link to liberal values.   Here's the thing though: they *did* take their name from the Boston Tea party, right? As in, time for a revolutionary war against tyranny? And unless I'm mistaken, they surfaced shortly after Obama was elected, but before he had accomplished much? Bush enacted the bank bailout--why does Obama spark a call for revolution?  I honestly believe that there are well-meaning libertarians who got swept up in the Tea Party, but it's always been a radical fringe group with fear at its core--fear of change, fear of Other, fear of brown people, take your pick.

 http://imgur.com/bkByl9J   I think you just solved the homeless shelter crisis   3. Prize description isnt that vague if you check out our contest rules. Well be flying 5 winners to join us in celebrating National Reddit Meet-Up day in San Francisco at the top of the pyramid for what were calling a Meat-Up hence all the meat puns. Music, food, fun and free t-shirts. Seems simple.  If it wasn't vague you wouldn't have a bunch of people asking what the details were.    If you think the cost of this is $5,075.00 then youre simply adorable and we wish you ran the big networks.  I was referring to the total cost of all the prizes listed in your contest page.  A comment is not a lead. A lead would be someone giving us their personal information and raising their hand saying that they want more info or to be contacted by us.  Good point. Looks like your cost per actual lead then is a lot higher.   1. This isnt a PR contest.   I know I'm right when people start arguing with me on semantics. As you've stated you sunk a lot of money into this... a lot more than the $5075... so either you're hoping to generate leads from this contest (which seems pretty expensive now based on your definition of a lead) or it's a goodwill gesture to get your company's name known.     Meat apparently    If you're a large corporation and want to cheaply and effectively run a contest, simply purchase a low CPM Reddit ad asking for entries, and then declare that the winners will be determined by the comments with the highest upvotes.  This ensures quality entries reach the top and saves you thousands of dollars on labor as the hivemind is doing your job for you.  You effectively can crowdsource your own PR contest.   Also, ensure that the description of the prize is as vague as possible. Make it sound exciting without promising anything specific.... This avoids you commiting to expensive prizes and allows you to get away with cramming everyone into a rented ball pit at an Oakland Best Western and calling it a grand prize party.  TLDR: You can get a few thousand underemployed college grads (that have no money to invest with you) to know your company name for roughly [$5,075.00](http://blog.transamerica.com/transamerica-san-francisco-meat-up-contest-contest-official-rules)  If 3000 Redditors take the time to comment and/or read the thread that's $1.69 a lead plus whatever you paid for the advertising.

Now let's say I want to move somewhere that the cost of living is doubled... i.e. California.  Isn't it a far better option to live there vs a low cost of living area if my salary would also double? It seems that while all my local expenses (mortgage, gas, food) would go up... my other expenses (fancy car, big tv) would be a smaller portion of my income now since they cost the same everywhere.  Edit: if it's not a 1:1 scale from Ohio to NYC or California... is it for say Ann Arbor MI (expensive tech hub in Michigan) to Rural Kentucky?   I guess I'm overwhelmed as to what language to choose.  What language/school do then guys gentrifying Silicon Valley have?   Intj yes    U of Mich?   Why would it be looked down on? What if I accomplished impressive feats at my job? What if I worked for a well known large company?   I was already leaning toward this. I'm very analytical and logic based. What languages should I learn, what schools are suggested i.e. get recruited from for cushy gigs and what else should I be doing?   If I make 50k a year working 40 hrs a week I make more per hour of work than if I made 60k working 80 hrs a week.

My actual income is in the low 60s Because I have other sources of income that would follow me even if I want back to school but my day job is salaried at 48k.  I have room for advancement at the company I'm at but I'm trapped in a stress full position I can't stand. Also there is no clear path here to success. The job doesn't utilize my analytical talents and our dept is set up for failure.   The only work I enjoy is not working. Therefore I want the maximum return per time spent being bored.  I promise that even if my job was to get blowjobs while playing skyrim all day I'd get bored of it and want to play GTA V instead while getting a handjob. But if leadership insists on draugrs and deepthroat then I'm going to be unhappy at some point.  Due to my personality I will never enjoy working so I want as much as I can make Even if the job sucks... as long as it isn't downright miserable.... but even that has a price.   I already looked into law school. I have a decent shot at a top school but the lawyers told me I'd end up making what I do now with a lot more debt and a lot less time unless I was really lucky   	23

He's talked multiple times about not wanting to discuss his private life on the show.  Also, the whole "banging chicks" thing IS a part of his CHARACTER'S persona! Danny Sexbang and Dan Avidan are two different people (one is fictional, if that gives you a hint)  Lastly, why would "not having a significant other" make him gay? Are only gay people allowed to be single? Or are gay people not allowed to have significant others?  This is a big reason he wouldn't want to discuss his private life.

 This seems like the porn equivalent of the "safe" /r/whatsonthisthing            Thanks for the answer folks.

I'll see if I can find a pic of something similar. Thanks peeps.   Naw I'm just intrested, so much money goes into a project like that and I've heard that some of these cars are owned/ bankrolled by super rich burners. A system like RH must cost a boat load so I was just wondering.   I'm trying to find some general info on robot heart, is it a community owned art car or does a single person own it a . Does any one know how much the system costs and what the sound specs are? Thanks.    Its also a part of the character development, it allows the audience to se that cooper is super smart, he has the knowledge to hack into this drone, possible someone who has designed stuff of this sort, he's not just a farmer he has a past.

 The same glitch that caused the c9 second place   MPen is more important then AP. Kog has low AP ratios but pretty high bases. My general build goes tear, Guise, Sorcs, Rylais, Void, Ludens. You can take a death cap over Ludens if you want more consistent DPS over higher burst (this is only if you consistently hit every ult), or Grail instead for more spammability. I'm not a fan of a defensive item as you can duel basically anyone who dives you in a 1v1 with your exhaust up, but if there's more then one person you mispositioned badly and you'll likely die anyways.   For advice just farm as safely as you can until 6, and from there just afk farm until level 11. Once you hit level 7 you can basically perma shove the enemy laner into their tower as a E + ult clears the caster minions. In team fights just spam ult for the most of it, don't get greedy and try getting into  auto attack range unless you're cleaning up or duelling a diver. You can basically duel anybody that isn't a mobile assassin late game if you have your exhaust up.    I think everyone is still too hard on him. He's no longer the top adc NA, but he is still solid. NA actually has quite a bit of adc talent, and he's still in the upper end of it. I doubt they'll find anyone that is stronger then him without resorting to importing a Korean or Chinese person, which is quite risky compared to the potential reward IMO.   Essentially they either got nerfed (Alistar, Fizz), reworked (Zilean, Tristana), or the meta game shifted into a position where they're less useful (Twitch, Rengar)   Pro tip: auto attack it first so it starts fleeing, and then Q in its path. You'll likely kill it before it leaves dust trail. I agree though, letting it have a trail would be nice.   Terror capacitor    I have two selfish halves. One wants to see the classic c9 roster stay together forever, and the other wants them to pick up incarnati0n and become a truly world class team.    Just pick a snowbally bruiser like Irelia, Hecarim or Riven. Proceed to smash lane, and hard carry the game. I climbed out of bronze this season with a 90% Irelia win rate.   cloud 9 has a pretty nice setup.   I wouldn't call Irelia a 'lane wrecker'. She's actually fairly weak early lane   Then it's perfect! 10% CDR on ghost blade and 20 on Black cleaver. Best of both worlds    People point out c9 as showing that friendship works, but in their dominance they also had the #1 jungler and top laners, as well as very strong mid/adc/support.    I'd say Lustboy, Xpecial, and Aphro all are stronger supports overall. Then its between him and Bunny IMO. Lemon is slightly weaker mechanically (especially with bunny's thresh), but has superior vision control and game knowledge.   If anyones underrated, its Lemon. Everyone talks of him like he's a trash support with only a good brain. He might not be a mechanical god, but he's still quite solid. I'd argue 4/5th best NA?   Bjergsen has too in NA   You must not have ever watched a single c9 game back in s3 then. Sneaky was the 'utility adc' who played Ashe in the majority of his games. If you look at any reviews/game threads of c9 back then, they would all say the same thing. Meteos and balls were the hard carries, Hai was a strong secondary carry, and the bot lane was seen as 'the weakest point' of c9.    I wouldn't say that. Historically sneaky was the person known for doing the most with little. Only in recent times has sneaky really had to be the main carry, due to hai and balls slumping early this split. Plus if you look at the fold distribution, it shows that meteos is actually the one with the highest gold priority in respect to other roles. Sneaky is dead even with the average gold alloted to an adc.   Turtle is underrated, however it is still hard to justify him over sneaky for best ADC NA. Sneaky is just stupidly consistent, while turtle is known for occasionally positioning wrong and getting caught. Plus he is still able to hard carry games just as often as turtle does.   He's been playing on his smurf the most. It's called BIG HUEVOS or something like that. It's in masters and has seen a lot of play   A big thing people forget is how Lucians passive and BOTRK work. You do 16 percent of a enemies current health with it because of the double-shot. This actually lets him melt tanks fairly well in this meta   The thing about Irelia Darius matchup is that she can still stagnate the lane by maxing E and disengaging when darius tries anything. You will end up losing lane and everything, but it's survivable.   I thought the same thing, but he's just on his different accounts. The main one seems to be called something like BIG HUEV0S or something like that.   He already is contracted with a team.   If he was going to retire, he wouldn't announce it until after playoffs. Even then, I still had a mini panic attack. No matter what happens, I just want to see the roster hoist the trophy at least one more time before somebody leaves.   If Hai leaves, it will be from his choice, that he believes it will benefit c9. They've made it pretty clear that everybody on c9 will have a spot until they choose to leave (excluding extreme circumstances). Especially the captain who founded c9 in the first place.   The thing about smitevicious, or regi's blue cards, or anything like that is that they are clearly fun jokes. It's something that you can laugh at yourself about. Insulting somebody about a physical feature has nothing to do with that   Sneaky always looks strong even when C9 was at its worst   So you mean aggressive?   The one thing is that crit still wouldn't affect damage abilities. So while it would make your auto attacks hurt more consistently, it won't effect a Lucians Q, or a Jinx W. It also would likely have a cap still.   Because that definitely happened when people posted Lemon's Veigar and Naut   Yo   A friendly team doesn't automatically lead to success, it just makes it easier. Assuming equally skilled teams, the team with a good team environment will have MUCH more success then the team with a bad environment. A good team environment leads to better practises, more improvement,  and a lesser chance to tilt. However, a skilled team that doesn't get along the greatest is still better then a bad team that are best friends.    0/3 the dream   I'm pretty sure he was considered *the* best Zed at some point.   It is slightly satirical, but in a playful way    I'd still personally put Vi over rek'sai for solo queue. It feels like rek is too team dependent, and doesn't have the same 'solo carry' potential that vi does.   Taco Bell can though, or at least that's what my butthole tells me after.   That was arguably c9's worst game in their entire competitive careers. You can't base a persons play style off of a single game where the team decided to try to cheese a win with a completely different play style.   The problem with Meteos and Rush being compared is they play entirely different styles. Rush is high risk high reward, leading to him either snowballing the game or falling way behind and being useless. Meteos is low risk medium reward, meaning that he rarely will snowball a game out of control single handedly, but he  will slowly gain a gold and vision lead over the other jungler, with the downside that he won't pressure the lanes as hard unless he's guaranteed to get a kill out of it. Both junglers styles suit the styles that their team relies on, with TIP being a team that relies on snowballing and then forcing team fights, and c9 focusing on outrotating the other team until they suddenly have a 8k gold lead despite being even in kills.   Pretty decent article altogether. The only mistake I see you made is that you said pepi was relegated to the challenger series. MYM was the team that got auto relegated, not Giants.    I'm curious, who would you consider the best western jungler then? It's fairly close, with plenty of arguments for the best. Meteos is definitely near the top of the pack though, so saying he's the best definitely isn't laughable. It's not like adc where calling someone who isn't forgiven or sneaky the best is laughable.   He's being picked a good amount in competitive/high elo right now. He's actually pretty decent, not OP, but still an all around solid pick.   Ap Kog is a monster though. Your ult has a .2 second cool down, with a massive range level 11+. You can bully anybody out of lane with your E spam too.   That tweet is meteos trolling. The account put in the games with them isn't actually incarnation   Meteos does a lot of c9s shot calling in recent times though. I would have faith in him to keep it near the same level, especially if hai is a coach   The sneaky lemon bot lane is doing great though. The last thing you would want to do is break it up, especially with the way sneaky has been playing in recent times.   AP kog is stronger IMO late game. He has insane poke, decent burst, (you can actually one-shot squishies mid-late game with your full combo), your autos hit for 11% of max health, and you are surprisingly a very strong duelist, especially if you have exhaust up. (I've dueled late game Jarvans, Vi's, Nocturnes, and pretty much any other diving champ). The problem is that it takes so long to get to that state. You're near useless until level 11. Once you hit 16 though you're a god.   Ad Kog is much stronger early on, and still scales very well. You trade poke and burst for higher single target DPS (even though AP Kog is still no slouch at that). He actually requires more teamwork as you have to be in auto range to do damage, requiring more peel. He's safer in lane due to having a support as well. His item powerspikes are much more defined (a kog'maw with a early Triforce is always a threat), while a fed AP Kog is still mediocre in comparison until he hits 11.  It's really a matter of preference. AD Kog takes less time to scale up, while still being a late game monster. AP Kog is oppressive post-16, and safer if you have an inkling of proper positioning. I personally prefer ap Kog, as he's a blast to play, but it's truly up to you.   When the announcer says "an enemy is godlike", in that whispered tone. It feels like she's saying "gg ez"   Especially if you look at how the team styles are +lane match ups. TIP is great at snowballing, but struggles at catching up. I trust XWX to go even with Bjergsen in lane (as long as he doesn't try to force yasuo again), and Adrian/Apollo consistently have a even lane down bot. This leaves top lane, where they leave dyrus out to dry. Rush will camp that lane, and put dyrus way behind, and snowball impact. Impact is one of the only carry top owners left, which works perfectly with dyrus tending to feed recently. As long as XWX just farms up and doesn't do anything risky early on, I definitely think TIP should win.   The problem with Corki is once late game hits, you won't be able to kill a tank at a decent speed compared to basically any adc. Triforce procs fall off, your Q and R won't do any damage to tanks with some MR, and you have terrible attack speed scaling + no real crit. You're all gambling on snowballing mid game against a hyper tank with Corki   All jokes aside, he has a amazing lvl 2 powerspike as support.   I have a gut feeling that TIP will upset TSM, and C9 will win the finals 3-1. But maybe I'm just crazy   The thing about meteos is that he is the most efficient jungler in NA. Rush plays a high risk high reward style, which means he either snowballs the game or falls quite behind. Meteos might not gank as much, but pretty much any gank he ever does is successful, and while other junglers might be trying to force ganks, he's slowly gaining a gold and vision lead over them. He's a low risk medium reward style. I'm not saying one style is better then the other, both are effective and suit their fellow teams. It's just hard to rank one jungler over the other purely because they are polar opposites.   It was a 27 minute game. I wouldn't call that 'rather slowly'   Jarvan is specifically picked as a counter to liss in lane. He can just jump on her and out trade her every time.   To be fair, that's exactly how Hai plays, and it works for them.   It's CLG nearing playoffs. That's all you need to know   I'm pretty sure I saw a porno titled that as well   He's still a pretty strong pick. He's just not in the meta right now. His damage output is fairly low, and with the resurgence of tanks it's hard for him to really do too much.    This game is huge for c9 though. They can get a playoff bye by winning, and also they have the chance to shut up anybody who says that they've fallen off.    Lux's snare needs to be slow. She can 100-0 any non-tank that she hits with her snare mid-late game, from an absurd range away.    I found it really boring tbh. It was 60 minutes of Anivia wave clear.   Gleeb played pretty damn great. So yes, #keepgleeb   Props to Gleeb, he played great   Ever since he has gotten the wrist braces he has had a massive improvement tbh. The last few weeks he's been solid, not a Bjergsen or XWX, but he does his job (which isn't to 1v5)   His Mao is pretty good to be fair   It's a skill matchup more then anything.    His [passive picture](http://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/lol.gamepedia.com/6/6c/RelentlessAssault.jpg?version=6567cf34537ff3b07e62f76c9a8d2209) is actually him catching a fish.   1. He doesn't speak English  2. He's not good enough to break up the chemistry + language barrier for  3. Cloud 9 hates imports   I'm so hyped for meteos to bring back the Zac. The return of the 27 KDA?   It's been mathematically proven that a phantom dancer will outdps a last whisper in like 99% of the time for Kog. The usual build you end up seeing is Triforce, Botrk, Infinity edge, phantom dancer, with a defensive item picked up at some point in there.    Lane eve has some pretty decent trades actually. Get a couple points in Q and max E. With good positioning you can Q through minions for free harass, and once you get a sheen your E chunks. You're no lane bully or anything, but your lane is still decent.   They have to place first in the challenger series playoffs.   The position with the most talent in NA imo is support. It'll be hard for him to beat out the existing members for a spot on the remaining teams. I agree that WFX is really the only place open, but Gleeb isn't really *that* bad and it would make sense just to keep him   Reddit bitching at its finest. They've done it for every champion, and are compensating you sufficiently. Shit happens, sometimes you just got to suck it up.   I'm not a fan of Zhonyas tbh. There's two situations that occur. The first is a single diver, which you can exhaust, and burst/kite out. If there's two or more divers, the Enemy team either got a good flank, or you positioned wrong. Either way you need to GTFO, and staying still for a Zhonyas is the exact opposite of it.    Xiaoweixiao second best mid laner NA (if he stays off yasuo)  Impact top three top laner in NA  Rush top three jungle in NA   It's a low risk/ high reward thing. Odds are you won't need the 1AD, the worst that will come out of it is a missed CS very rarely. While the upside is that very rarely you can win a lane on one lucky crit.   XWX is known for his massive champion pool. Yasuo is just his favourite champion and he got cocky and wanted to play with him.    Let's try this shit   I really enjoy the item on Ap Kog, it really synergizes with his kit. The only thing is, you shouldn't be building pure ap on Kog. Magic pen ap because of his bad ult ratio. I find that Archangels, liandries, Rylais, sorc shoes, void staff, Ludens is the best overall build.   Ezreal wouldn't have a chance to get past their tank line. Same with Corki (past midgame). It's pretty much a lose-lose for any ADC against that comp. Wayyy too much Cc for anyone to handle.   Kassadins still 'viable' IMO.    Jarvan scales so well with every stat on warrior that I wouldn't give it up. If you want extra damage I would honestly just get a second brutalizer. Cinder hulk isn't really the greatest on him anyhow, as you're not building full tank, and your clear is fairly strong as is.    They were both watching the fight by baron and lost focus on where they were   XWX on yasuo is a beautiful thing    I feel bad for c9 recently. They have the highest expectations of any NA Team, so if they win people treat it like its nothing special, but if they lose everyone talks about how trash c9 is recently, and they need to roster swap everybody. Like they aren't at their normal form but they're still 3rd in the LCS.   It truly is champion/role/situation dependent. If you're an ADC/APC, it's best to just play it super safe and get your damage items. As a top laner usually you will go tanky if your behind and damage if your ahead. Purely because building tank means you will survive longer in lane, which means you'll have more gold to catch up. Or since jungler are already gold starved, it's best to build tanky when your behind as one of them. It is really situational though, just because I'm 0/2 on irelia doesn't mean I stop rushing the triforce and start building a randuins, the spike from the completed triforce will give me a better chance to come back in the game then a bit of tankiness.    That's the thing. Anybody who has ever been on a team environment knows that you never throw a teammate under the bus. You can confront them, but you don't get your teammates possibly kicked off for something that won't directly harm themselves or another person.   He is a person who legitamately wants to run a e-sports organization, and has shown he is willing to put his time and effort into making a successful team. I hope he doesn't end up being vilified    1,2 get a first round bye for playoffs  3-6 play In the playoffs. 7 misses playoffs but doesn't go to relegations. 8,9 play relegation matches, 10 gets autorelegated.   It honestly depends on the jungler and laner. If I have a zed mid, and I'm Amumu jungle, I will take the blue buff every time. Sure, it helps him, but it helps me even more.    Xin Zhao, Pantheon, Rammus, are all relatively cheap and very easy to gank early on with. Xin and Panth you can pretty much point and click somebody level 3 for a kill. None of them require any skillshots either.   He's definitely in the top 3 though. Udyr and Jax could beat him most likely though .   Sorry, but I doubt that Xin can deal with a late game Jax or Nasus. He's very auto attack dependent, and both of them have direct counter to auto attack duelists in their kit. Plus they are both naturally tankier and have higher damage outputs in their kit. I agree that he destroys all 3 of them early game, but once irelia grabs her triforce, Jax gets a couple items, or nasus hits a couple hundred stacks they can all easily 1v1 them. Xin is still a very good duelist, just that the three you mentioned are arguably the strongest in the game at some point.   Try nocturne. He has amazing waveclear, shreds towers with all of his bonus stats, a great duelist, plus decent escapability. Ideally, you want to ward the enemy jungle, and wait for someone you can 1v1 to pass through the jungle to defend your push. You ult onto them, pick them off and either have a free turret, or give your team a 4v3 advantage.    Actually blame yourself for split pushing against a team with hard engage that is ahead enough to dive 5v4   Yeah. The bottom placed team (Coast) will be automatically relegated and replaced with the #1 challenger team (likely NME). The second and third last (likely DIG and Winterfox) will play a Bo5 against the second and third challenger teams for the LCS spots. The rest of the teams will be safe until the summer split starts.   Cass is a fairly common pick IMO, but yorick and naut support? Not so much    Also, picking someone like Jax/zed and just relentlessly split pushing against them can help. A downside of their comp is that they have zero strong duelists, and they will be forced to bring lulu up to prevent them from getting anything. Without lulu this comp can't really do too much so it should be an easy 4v4   Shiv gives burst and an earlier powerspike + waveclear. PD gives superior DPS and a better kiting passive. So you usually go Shiv on people like Graves or Lucian, and PD on Jinx or Cait (who are auto attack focused instead of caster focused)  	101
 TIL base turrets have a slow ;__;   i don't know which is more surprising, the freeze mage win vs warrior or the fact that warrior doesn't have at least 50 armor by now.  	2
 The mirror scene in 25th hour and the "Dead N-Word storage" scene in Pulp Fiction.  In both scenes, our awareness of the directors' personalities breaks immersion.   Just watch the Directors cut. It adds some excellent scenes that are missed in the theatrical. it also adds some silly bits, but overall its the better version of the movie.  The ultimate cut is neat, but don't watch it for your first time.     Duly noted.    Thank you,  It does bug me that he cites "too dark" as his reason for distancing himself from Temple. When I think it is more likely the other, like you said. the movie is just a case of Spielberg sticking a bit too close for comfort to the adventure serials he loves so much without finding a way to subvert or update their more questionable tropes for modern sensibilities.    It doesn't drastically change or improve the film. But it's nice to watch if you want to see more mutants doing mutant things.    I find it strange that people seem to have more of an issue with the silly bits in Crystal Skull than the troublesome xenophobia and sexism in Temple of Doom.  I think they're all varying degrees of good, though.    He falls out of a plane in an inflatable raft and doesn't get hurt. You go try that.   Wes Anderson  Organized Crime film.   Simple Plan   If I'm remembering right. Yojimbo was sort of a response by Kurosawa to critics saying he was too "western" in his filmmaking. Kurosawa was "I'll show you western!" With yojimbo.    It seems like it is going to be similar to Jumanji or Zathura   Your use of "boring" confuses me.  	12

 Incredible? slow down buddy   he also had a wide open dunk if Steph had made a fundamentally sound pass where it needed to be. you know he hasn't been hitting jumpers so as a PG, lead him to an easier shot.    They had to switch every screen because Delly was so gassed. Couldn't stick to him like he did the rest of the game   6 TO's doesn't equal efficient.       Anyone care to speculate what Lebron's "secret motivation" is that he won't tell anyone? I originally thought it was the MVP race and finishing 3rd this year, but he conceded to that last night but said that wasn't the secret motivation.       If we hold Steph and Klay under 50 combined points, we win the game.  Bold prediction: Lebron finds his touch, shoots over 50%. JR and Shump combine for 40, Mike Miller scores 9 points, Lebrons final stat line is 42 points, 16 rebounds, 13 assists.     only difference is, I'm never gettin mad when somebody checks out my dick cleavage.    ahhh, I see we've found the founder of Edible Arrangements   yes, I want him to be treated the same way everyone treats Lebron so everyone can realize how insane it is.    be held accountable by people outside of the team. aka us, the media, etc. MVP's don't get a pass. ever.    yes, I realize. I'm not stupid. But, when you can't hit a shot, maybe stop shooting for a while and get the ball in the hands of the guy who was shooting lights out in the first half? Instead of chunking up 15 3s, find the hot hand instead. that's all I'm saying   But not to this extent. No one has ever experienced the criticism and just general hatred from fans and analysts everywhere like Lebron has. It's insane   ...he says now that Lebron isn't the one getting ripped to shreds. When it's Lebron, no one bats an eye. Curry? Everyone loses their minds   well, you can't. MVP's are held to all-time standards. fall short, accept the consequences.    No, actually you don't. As a point guard you can, ya know, pass. Create for others. Run an offense. I don't know. But if you're gonna throw up 15 3s and miss 13, you have to be held accountable. If you're going to air ball a go ahead jumper, you have to be ridiculed. That's how MVPs are supposed to be treated. If Lebron James can score 44 and miss a game winner by inches and get roasted for it, Curry most definitely can when he air balls it on top of a god awful night. This isn't even a conversation.    if the refs are gonna magically start calling post man travels then they're gonna need to call Steph for carrying the ball every time he dribbles when he brings the ball up from behind half court. literally puts his hand completely under the ball every time. but no call, bc fuck that call. just like that travel.    me too. heard he is actually really good in it   "LOTTA ENEMIES, GOT A LOT OF ENEMIES. GOTTA LOTTA PEOPLE TRYNA DRAIN ME OF MY ENERGY. TRYNA TAKE THE WAAAAVE FROM A NIGGA, FUCKIN WITH THE KID AND PRAY FOR YA NIGGA" -Official Lebron James Playoffs Anthem.    Jay-Z like "nigga what the fuck? is you Jesus? shit"   I got that fuckin iron man shit keepin me alive right now   probably right. mikes barely played all year. but those 4 fouls on JJ weren't worth the risk   if Mike woulda splashed that... consider my shit officially lost.    you don't have to establish hustle. you have to establish shooters.    hahahah no it's not!! not when you're wide open with a layup! he has to convert that.    WHY THE HELL IS TT STILL IN?! HE'S DOING NOTHING   TT MY GOD.    What the fuck   TT and Moz gotta learn how to catch somewhere in her too   no they're getting in the lane and instead of taking the easy shot, they're trying to make one too many passes and it's always a turnover. so stupid. just shoot the shot   TT playing like absolute shit   I would love it if we would stop airballing floaters. And put backs by our bigs. that would be friggin fantastic.    OH MY GOD SHUMP. MAKE A DAMN LAYUP HOLY SHIT   I did it with listerine mouthwash. it was delicious. but probably awful for my body.    worth it   that commercial had me dying   my body is ready   YEAH WHERE?! HELP PLS   Add "U" in there and you're good. Too real of a song not to make the list   Yes. just imagine how much better Lebron would be playing just by having KLove's presence on the floor. He wouldn't take 35+ shots and he wouldn't be missing more than half of them just bc there would be great spacing even if it is ISO heavy.    Gotta take a page out of the Warriors book and player manage better. From Lebron to Kyrie and Love to Varejao. We're playing for the playoffs, not the regular season. Gotta have them healthy for the playoff runs.     Totally agree   But just imagine what this team could be with an entire year together and hopefully with health on our side. This team has been remade and remolded every 2 weeks the past 50 games. Think this team could be dominant with health and a year together   http://i.imgur.com/qh56qoH.jpg   Parks and Rec!   I didn't mean he didn't have any plays at all. I just meant that his motion Princeton offense that they threw out in December doesn't work with a ball dominant guy. so the sets he does draw up are to get Lebron a mismatch on the post or a shooter coming up off of down screens. nothing that involves all 5 guys in positions to score like the Warriors have. that's all I meant. Lebron definitely needs to chill on the ISOs tho   No, you're clearly not understanding what I am trying to say. I'm saying the Cavs bench played as piss poor as they can and the Warriors got 35 from theirs. What I mean is, if the Cavs would have had a mere 10 points from their bench, they win the game assuming no Warriors score. Just showing how terrible the Cavs bench played and that it was still a winnable game regardless. asshole   Yeah for real. TT had 2 points. He doesn't usually do that. He missed some bunnies that he usually makes. JR won't shoot that poorly again, Shump won't either. JJ will knock a couple down. even Delly could hit something. I'm extremely disappointed about the Kyrie situation just for Kyrie's sake bc the dude plays so damn hard, but I still think this is a very winnable series. Lebron just has to go back to that "get everybody else going first" role he's played in the past and we got these guys. Keep the faith everyone   Yes, 100%.    Blatts offensive system doesn't work with a ball dominant guy. so when you don't have an offense, you run pick and rolls or post ups with your best player. they have literally no sets that involve 5 players at once. I don't understand why you're blaming Lebron for that though. coaches draw up and teach plays, players run them.    He took that because he's made it from the same spot with the same move in the same building while being guarded by the same guy before. It was a comfortable shot for him. I don't like it as much as the next guy but I understand why he did it   If the Cavs scored 10 bench points instead of 9 in regulation, we win. Don't get so blinded by the Warriors bench. ours played like shit, but if they just play bad we win that game.    I didn't like the shot from Lebron either, but I think I understood what he was thinking. He's made 2 game winners from that exact spot in the same building before. I think he was just going for what has worked in the past. and he took it early so TT or Shump, like what happened, could get a tip shot or something. I would prefer him to drive obviously but I wasn't mad at the look because he has made it before with iggy on him too.    Yeah but if the Cavs bench scores 10 points instead of 9 in regulation, they win the game. Could have been out scored by 20+ on the bench and still won. If you get 12 from JR and maybe 6-9 from James Jones next game, who knows what happens   Seems like the only option at this point.    Do your own research Mike! Aren't you calling the game tonight?! You had like 8 days to find this stuff out!   perfect song choice   Teams don't usually have Lebron James either.    LUHBRAHHHN JAAAMES was obviously the best part   I think the Cavs will have Shump on him to start. And he can more than handle his own. Then Delly will take some minutes and he can be a pest and stick to him pretty well. So I disagree with the notion that Steph will "roast" the Cavs.    That's just incorrect. Go watch that Bulls series again.    No answer for their shooters? So Shumpert, a top 10 wing defender in this league, and JR Smith who is an incredibly underrated defender as well dont count? matthew "shut down derrick rose" dellavedova? Lebron fucking James? bruuuhhhhhhh   the JR comment is just wrong. he's been consistently hot basically since he put on a cavs uni. and the warriors walked into the finals just like the Cavs did. Just because they played teams with better records, doesnt mean they played better teams. The Pels wouldve sold their souls to just win a game in that series, the Grizz never had a real shot bc they couldnt guard steph and he was just off in the games they lost. also, bigs-focused teams are a good matchup for them. and the rockets had a 37 year old spot up shooting guard playing the point and guarding steph curry. and josh smith, JOSH SMITH, started.   Also, Cavs defensively are better without Love in the lineup. So him being out favors the Cavs defensively. This will be a much better series than 90% of people think.  Cavs in 7.    bruh. this is nothing. go watch some 80s tape   asshole. lets have some maturity   Cleveland is that... Cleveland is the...   But they weren't though. They were a 60 win team. The Cavs just destroyed them because they're hitting their stride at the right time   so were the cavs bruh. Varejao, Love, Irving. Lebron with 2 sprained ankles, Shump with a groin injury....    I don't buy it. Now, him to the Knicks to play with his buddy Melo in New York City with a brand new 4th overall pick in a weak eastern conference... I see that as more likely. However, I think him going home to Chicago is the most likely. Bulls let Butler walk on a max contract with LA or whoever pays up for him, get Wade on a discount for a run against the Cavs next season with a new coach... I dont know. just dont see him as a Clipper at all   I agree with everything you said. Good job   i just meant cuz you said "then your leg cramps up and HE'S like...". just pointing out the pronoun usage haha. nothing meant by it   Oh okay. Thanks for clarifying! I just hadn't heard that before so I was curious   Lowry is a much better shooter. Dame is twice the scorer Wall is and can pass just as well. TP is a proven playoff performer. Wall is an immature speed player who is an exceptional passer and extremely streaky shooter. so yeah, i'm taking the first 3.     Hell yeah to MSG. saw the heat play there last season and that place was incredible.    really good bathrooms in general. the mirrors that have tv's playing the games in them. but they arent actually tv's... really hard to explain unless youve been there   fuck that stupid ass bull shit. still makes me mad to think about.    I only know Dentlef from Parks and Rec. I need to brush up on my basketball knowledge.    too far   Curry, Kyrie, Paul, Westbrook, Lowry, Tony Parker, Dame, i would take over Wall.    damn brodie. spot on   you hear that verse on "M's" yet tho? sheeeeesh   i fucks with earl heavy.   so harden cant be him because fuck harden   exactly why he is a perfect kobe comparison   hahahah youre so dumb. people who dive hands first and get arm locked arent going for the ball the right way! youre supposed to secure the ball and shield it from the opponent. delly dove on it and rolled to shield the ball from the opponent so there wouldnt be a jump ball. he made the perfect play and if korver hadnt gotten hurt, literally no one would be saying anything about it. this viewpoint is idiotic at best   hahahah no. so so wrong. if you grab the jersey and nobody sees, good job. if you get caught, it's a foul. not a dirty play. that's the dumbest thing ive ever heard   haha stupid. Delly was attempting, in basketball terms, a box out. just like every other play in basketball history. gibson just didnt take the contact well, gave him an extra shove down. got his leg tangled and freaked out. get outta here with your bull shit    Was it necessary? No. But dirty? My God that's a stretch. Dirty plays are things done with malicious intent. I think he was just trying to get under his skin. and it worked.    All Cavs fans seeing that Playoffs graph http://imgur.com/PNGoOMo   Anthony Davis is not currently better than Lebron. That is ridiculous. More athletic and in the prime of his body? No question. But a better player than Lebron James? That's insanity.    You're tellin me you wouldn't try to capitalize on 300K? Really? Even if it was chump change for whatever economical bracket of pay you're in, you're not going to turn down and even seek out extra coin.    cant tell if female... or homosexual male...   hahahahahah oh wow, tears man. literal tears   What do you mean by "age as gracefully as Curry and Durant"? Totally agree with the old man game portion tho. Those guys who are smarter, have better footwork, and have an unblockable jumper are the guys who can play for 20 years in the league and still be effective   Totally agree. He actually answers the questions given to him and answers them intelligently.    People act like no coach has ever done something unorthodox before. Spoelstra did the same thing a couple years ago. Literally took the team bowling and they went on a hot streak. Shane Battier started his "Battioke" Karaoke night and it was always in like March so they got a night off and got a break and came back with a hot streak. This stuff happens all the time. You just dont see it reported about because Lebron isnt on every team and every coach isnt coaching Lebron, putting his every action into the spotlight. These kinds of moves and very strategically done and typically end with a positive result.      I honestly don't like Kyrie on the floor at all guarding their starting group. I guess him guarding Barnes is the best option, but Kerr is smart. He'll just post up Barnes and work Kyrie 5 possessions in a row until we do something about it. Hopefully Ky can hold his own for 8-10 minutes before the Delly sub can come in and rotate everybody back in place.    Hospital was supposed to blow when the Joker hit the trigger the first time when he was walking away from it in The Dark Knight. It legitimately malfunctioned and he stayed in character and improved the whole scene from then on out. It turned out way better than the original would have in my opinion too. Showed how great Heath did with that role. Also, there was a camera rigged in the bus (not sure if they thought of using that footage or not) but he stayed in character the entire ride. Thought that all was pretty awesome   Dumb college kid? You don't get that pass as a nationally recognized student athlete. He was 21 years old. If you have NBA aspirations then you can't act like that and he should have known better. Don't give him a pass just because he's on your team   hahahaha oh man this dude is an idiot   But wait! THERE'S MORE! http://imgur.com/rZ2SBSZ   Bruh. Draymond too small. Lebron said it himself. And Iggy? Dude can't handle him in the post, which is where he'll be 60% of the time. Barnes will get out smarted on the post and if you guys are dumb enough to double, Kyrie, Iman, Delly, JJ, and JR are gonna give you the pipe and splash back side 3's. Get outta here with this nonsense.    I remember watchin this game. I got hyped as hell  	102
             because the fighters quickly descended into irrelevancy   I remember I had to pull a ton of strings so that I could check out Rampage v. Jardine a few years back.  Funny how important it seemed at the time      It's a brand new imac that had OS X yosemite 10.10.1.. I updated to 10.1.2.  I ran the diagnostics test (said everything was okay), repaired disk permissions.. and its still happening   iMovie, Pages, Safari..Chrome...Preview... every app will intermittently crash. Is this common? Any fixes? Should I take it in?         You are correct sir. That was well worth my time!

Extra $ is better spent on more RAM or an SSD drive         Based on some of Jose's answers, I wonder if the translator was keeping some of McGregors quips to herself   Man, it's like Dana is just trying bait them into an on-air altercation at some point   Trigger's what? What's the outcome of clapping?   Who are the fools downvoting this? UFC has a golden opportunity with mcgregor/aldo and they're going to push this bad boy for months on end.   That's some Chael Sonnel level disrespect right there.. surprised this hasn't been discussed more widely      Not sure why this is being downvoted.. one of the better Also/Mcgregor articles out there?!            Unintentional "feature" I'd imagine.. just giving folks time to do Touch ID, no?                                       40% of iPhone users interested in Apple Watch? Seems encouraging for an entirely new product                                 Hahah great premise      Wasn't this a collaborative effort with many other companies?                                              15 hours??                  iPhone 5s might very well be the best electronic device I've ever owned               Rousey looking gaunt... Zingano looking good!!   Bellator , putting on the fights FANS WANT TO SEE!      In other words, for just browsing the web and watching Netflix, does a Retina display provide a noticeable advantage?   I suppose technically, but they just added a low-end model with a slower processor.. the 21.5 imac with the core i5 2.7ghz has remained unchanged for 18months now!      I suppose if Apple is waiting for Broadwell processors, we'll be waiting a while, right?   What about an imac refresh?      Last update was late 2013         With Broadwell seemingly about power efficiency (ie more benefits for laptop users than desktop), what type of benefits will Intel Skylake bring to the table?               yeah, that's been my main question.. are there noticeable improvements jumping from the i5 to i7   Did you think going with the i7 over the i5 was more beneficial than going with more RAM?   Seems like the iMac hasn't been updated since late 2013. Is getting a new iMac today essentially getting a machine that's 1.5 years old?                I took a picture with him last year at Comic Con, same price, definitely worth it! He even held a box cutter to my neck.  Sold!       So he's an elite offensive player who can put up points.. if that doesn't help translate into wins, what's the appeal?    Ticket sales? To have a star on the team at any cost? Deluding themselves into thinking he could be a leader that makes other players around him better?                        What's frustrating is that the UFC has all the pieces in place to be AMAZING.. but they're dropping the ball.  To wit, Anderson Silva -- steroids aside -- back a few years ago was THE best fighter anyone had ever seen. And yet, from 2009 to 2013, he fought just twice a year. We can't even get the champ fighting 3 times a year just once?    Disagree. There can be a happy medium. 45 fight cards in 2014.. It's not outlandish to argue that it's a smidge too much and ultimately leads to watered down fight cards.      Everyone getting popped for steroids, champions fighting just twice a year at the most, over saturation, weak cards are the rule and not the exception, not many new emerging stars.. Seems like UFC was so laser focused on "Expanding" into markets like China and Phillipines that they neglected the core product.                 That's kinda bogus.      I wonder if every 5 years is average or not               I believe the mid 2014 iMacs are not user upgradeable      And if so, for what?   I remember watching this live and wishing the fight would keep on going just to witness more brilliance and matrix like maneuvers from Silva                 	150
 Big Mac and fries for me.      How old are you? If 25-30 (even younger), what rock have you been living under?    Trololol?      Good writing is good writing. Period.  Agree 100%.    Same here. How deceiving!      Same here. Every time this question is asked, this line is one of the most common answer; but how can it not be?   You're right, the combination of Eccleston, the episode's tone, and the line = fantastic!   Fracas is the BBC word of the month. Belated April Fools.         Lucky you, and yeah WHY NOT?   Sh#t just got real. Here we go, Spurs, go!   Love this dude!   I was a student finishing my thesis and working as an online English teacher to Koreans. I had some time on my hands and was looking for a side job online when I found a listing for "content writer" for a travel web site. It paid pretty well for a student and got me hooked on freelance writing.      I'd have this for breakfast - or any time of the day.      It would also be a good thing to mix your tweets - share relevant articles and something your boss would like to share (his own words). The latter can be pre-determined during your "hashing out of clear objective". You can also make this a topic during your regular meetings.  One more tip: if you need to reply to a tweet, and the reply is not merely a "thank you for sharing", it's a good idea to consult your boss first.         "He's certainly no angel, nor a role model in my view, but that doesn't mean he's a monster."  Couldn't have said it better. The BBC had to sack him, but there's no point in beating Clarkson up about the whole thing now.      Never thought about this before. Playing with my phone now!   For me, it's not so much of a "comfortable issue" than simply not feeling the need. I do use Siri just for fun sometimes.   Didn't think of this...but it was a personal bet - a jest - so it shouldn't count?      Well, obviously we think differently. In this case, I think it's both wrong and WTF material.   I've never had that issue, actually.      You're probably right. It's just the best configuration of the living room right now, with the weird shape this place has.      I've always thought that kids born in the past 5-10 years will see (smart) mobile as part of their lives and not merely as extensions unlike us older people who experienced the advent of this new technology.   Nearsighted here - sees things better on iPad Mini in hand than on 51-inch TV 2 (maybe 3) feet away.      LOL. Does this mean writers=hipsters?   Am I?      Am I your mummy?         Best thing I've seen all day!   HODOR!   Where you huff and puff in secret?   You don't think that the Weeping Angels are remotely scary???  Awesome piece, though!   I hope she loves it. It's a beautiful name!   "There are so many horrible writers trying to make a go at freelancing that all you really need is 1 decent piece and someone will hire you for 10 bucks."  Indeed, and there are even sites which have levels for writers. X amount for 'poor writing', XX amount for 'good enough writing', etc. I don't remember what site this was, but when I saw it some months back, I was appalled.  The market is that bad, that yes, you can earn as a "writer" even if you can't write.   Or [Dylan Thomas](http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night)   I think it's more realist than pessimist.   Good God, no!      Thanks!      I have to disagree with "never working for free". There are cases when working for free has its own rewards.  When you're new, working for exposure can help - but not too often, and you have to be picky about where you write.  If it's a non-profit or a charity, working for free helps with exposure AND you get to help others.  There *is* something to saying "don't work for free", but "never" is too sweeping a statement in my opinion.   Yeah, beware of dogs.      Manly chic?         Probably a temporary glitch, sorry.      Thanks - I totally forgot Banshee (I used to watch it all the time but stopped lately). I also just remembered Justified.      Kill me now, but Star Wars.   Not too imaginative, but not dreadful.             Calling Sheldon and Amy!   Awesome indeed. And I would take "might" out of the question. At least I want to believe that that the rest *will* do him good.      Now if they only had an automatic sushi maker.        	75
 No, we don't need their f'ed up policies, We already have enough of our own here.   ^ Ridiculous things that Sun deniers say.   Well, it can't get worse than climate change models.   Unless it has to do with climate change. Am I right?  	4
 Bless nintendo and wanting touch screens on their shit 3   because we're desperate and people take advantage of that   Help a Blind man out, NA code for a couple of steam games I'm willing to offer because I can't play cause I'm blind   I'm trading some steam games for NA demo code, pm me if interested in trade   codes? :D   ayyyyy lmao   Haha I guess that's what I'm trying to get at, what in the game is considered a projectile and what's not.  Also it says in the description for RBAY "Reflects **most** enemy projectiles during tornado" so I figured there were some exceptions.  I'll add the clarifications on my original post   EDIT: I guess what I'm trying to ask is what is considered a projectile in Awesomenauts and what's not, also in the description of RBAY it states   Reflects **most** enemy projectiles during tornado  	8
 Not the maker of the videos.  Though Thomas and I floated the idea before he started his. (he has a way better setup than I do)    Swap the front left and right motors + endstops.  "Z" should be at the rear of the machine.  "Y" should be your front right, "X" should be your front left.      Measure the ohms between the coils too.  If it's not 2-4 ohm, it's not likely a stepper that you want to be using.  If it's like 10-30ohm, you _certainly_ don't want to use it.   Print something with a flat top layer, and post a picture.  Looks like you're over extruding, but it's difficult to tell with that print.  Over extrusion can cause some of the weird layer lines, stringing, etc.  Also, I'm familiar with that model.  You've got your X axis backwards it looks like, unless you mirrored that model on purpose.  When you home your printer, your nozzle should touch the front left corner of the bed.  (Bed should move away from you, nozzle should move left.)   http://www.matweb.com/reference/deflection-temperature.aspx  The important column to look at is the 1.8MPa column.  PLA, Nylon, and PET are all terrible materials to use.  (You'll reach 1.8MPa under a screw-head, and things will loosen up over time)  ABS _might_ do, but it's a bit easier to break in the non-glass filled form.  Instead of straight polycarb, PC-ABS is a really nice alternative.  Here's a [review from whosawhatsis](https://plus.google.com/+Whosawhatsis/posts/LWUi17dojhk) and [the place to buy it](http://www.proto-pasta.com/shop/pcabs) but it's _EXPENSIVE_.  dichloromethane is a good polycarb solvent, can you can do PC-slurry much like ABS slurry.  You've already got the E3Dv6, which is perfect for PC.  Taulman Tritan may be a suitable substitute as well, as it has a Tg of 100C   Seriously, this is _MASSIVELY_ useful to have!  If a business is just starting manufacture, etc - it makes your job a lot easier having someone that speaks mandarin.  So much easier to source parts, get contracts made, etc.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ruJBKFrRCk   You guys see the 2 that he put in there?   So, smash everything with colorful spikes, protrusions, etc.  Leave the fur-less ones alone.  Got it.  I fucking hate moths for some reason.   http://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/2kcwyq/delta_vs_cartesian/clkv85x  This is enough I think.  I've seen so many people get a delta as their first printer, against recommendation, fuck with it for 6+ months, and then use a cartesian and have everything dialed in completely within a day...while still not being able to get their delta working correctly.  I go by what I see.  I work with all types of 3D printers on a daily basis, and help people repair theirs constantly.  It's my job.  I wake up every weekday at 8am, and do _this_.   Running direct drive on a delta is a bad idea.  You can get away with running a really short bowden, and mounting a motor like this: http://i.imgur.com/uGvywHb.gifv - but putting a motor _on_ the end effector is a terrible, terrible idea.  Liquid cooling, not so much.  Run thin enough tubing and it wouldn't add much weight to the end and you'd have plenty of flow left to keep things majorly cool.  I do liquid cooling in my PCs and the surface area of 1 side of a CPU is a lot lower than being able to spiral around a hot end, etc.  I'm working on a potential solution to the direct drive-extruder on the end of a delta machine, but don't have anything to show for it yet.  I'm hoping that it ends up being a nice way to solve a bunch of problems all in one go.    Well, the obvious solution to arms interference (especially to someone with a flare DeltaMaker) is to mount extruder under the plate like so: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ALKoD72zjE[1]    Holy shit.  You lose like, what, 60mm (maybe even 90mm) of build height doing that?!  Now you're using some gymnastics in order to argue your point.  I already told you the _proper_ solution to this.  And that's to mount the extruder like so: http://i.imgur.com/uGvywHb.gifv - it looks ugly but it does a few things: Pairs the extruder close enough to the hot end that you can extrude pretty much anything, including FilaFlex.  Reduces the moving mass on the arms to near zero; the arms don't fight the mass of the motor because the motor is at a near-stationary point in the assembly.   There's just simply a lot of confirmation bias in this subreddit.  If someone owns a delta, they don't believe they are wrong in making that choice (and honestly, they aren't wrong in making that choice.  They're perfectly fine machines for people who don't care about the theoretical, or for people who are building them as a pre-assembled kit).  I build them for a living.  I'm around them every day, I use them every day, I calibrate them every day, I troubleshoot faults in them every single day.  I know every single one of their fault modes, and that list is about 5x larger than any of the cartesian fault modes that I've seen over the past 4 years of doing this.   Honestly, you won't need bigger motors.  Drive it with belts.  The benefit to Deltas is that they scale pretty big without the need for scaling much else.  Short of you wanting to throw a wood router on the end effector, you should be good with scaled belts/arms.   The noise level has nothing to do with being a Delta or a Cartesian.  It has to do more with the quality of parts used for linear motion.  Rollers on T-slot are going to be more silent than LM8UUs on linear rail and they're going to be dampened by the longer belts on the Max. (Going by the list of printers you have in your flair)  And yeah, the arms of a delta are what stop you from mounting an extruder at the end effector for direct extrusion.  You have to account for all arms being vertical at any point in the build volume.  So your entire extruder mechanism has to fit in that vertical space, nothing hanging out.  Then, once you've done that - you're putting substantial load on arms that people are already complaining about having flex in them.  You can somewhat get around this by doing the weird rubber medical hose mounting of the extruder assembly above the end effector, but that just looks weird.  (Though, I'm all for looking weird if it gets the job done!)   In this case, I'm not sure if using an MVNO would help. :/   No they don't.  Because they receive an intent, fire off what they need to fire off, and then shut down.  They aren't active for more than a fraction of a second.  In fact, keeping your screen on for that 5 seconds likely uses way more power than the app would.   Stop dealing with those companies then!  I love how many people bitch about AT T and Verizon Android devices, but continue to use their service. :/   How about the fact that it also actually works as well.  I've run into plenty of times where SuperSU worked and Superuser didn't.   Deltas are just flat out a huge pain in the ass.  If you want a reliable, flat machine that will print _PLATES_ worth of parts reliably and quickly, a cartesian is the only way to go.  Cartesians are just flat out less hassle, have more mounting options for extruders/hot ends.  Ever want to print Filaflex?  Good luck doing that on a Delta with a 2ft long bowden tube.  Cartesians are just hands down better in all respects.  I build DeltaMaker printers for a living, have owned 2 Prusa i3, an Ingentis, a Prusa i2, and a Rostock Mini.  I will never voluntarily own a delta printer.  They're clean.  They're pretty.  And especially regarding wiring - they make it easy to make a professional looking product.  But the hassle in making sure they work constantly, consistently, is just not worth it.  If you get something with a metal plate, and one of the sensors that the printrbot uses, you'll have auto bed leveling on a large surface without plate deflection and if you're talking about a large surface, this is a huge deal.  Deflection becomes an issue with larger build plates.   Way to be so late that you submit news that has already been basically redacted, and removed and no longer relevant...   This is the number 1 reason why I don't buy Samsung phones anymore.  I've got a smartphone...if it can't even do GPS reliably, then why the fuck did I pay so much for it?  Originally I was a motorola fan, then they started crippling all their phones after the OG Droid, so I went Samsung.  After Google bought motorola they really turned around, and their hardware now is top notch.   Some battery management apps are exactly that.  Disabling all the unrequired stuff when the screen is off, keeping location wakes from happening (NLPUNbounce from the XPosed modules), etc.  Not all battery management apps are "kill all the apps!"   indeed.   First thing's first: You're overextruding.  Actually, fixing that seems to be the core of the problem here.  Retraction can also be improved in a J-head by pointing a fan across the body fins, which will help with oozing/blobbing.     This "don't be evil" shit is tossed around way too much. It has nothing to do with being "evil" and more to do with being lazy, or saving money by not having to hire a call center to handle things like this.    She's got hank hill ass: http://i.imgur.com/fdtqw0j.jpg   Fuck all of the "get an iPhone!/Android!" comments in this submission.  Seriously.  Both phones can mute group texts.   It's funny, that as an Apple user, you have to upgrade _your entire fucking operating system_ to get this one stupid feature.  Especially knowing that in some instances, Apple has been known to make iOS updates severely slow down older devices in order to persuade people into buying the new ones.   90% of the time, it works every time!   I'm not a Windows user.  I'm a linux user, and I'm quite familiar with out-of-the-blue changes to window managers (Unity on Ubuntu is a good example)... not your average joe here.  I'm used to jumping from multiple different windowing paradigms with ease.  OSX is disjointed, ill conceived, and unintuitive.   Seriously, this is bullshit.  This is not a place for advertising your product.  You've been downvoted everywhere else you've posted it.   Stop your fucking lying. Google disabled NSFW searches a loooong time ago.  If you search for "tits" you get women in bikinis, not a single bare tit on there.    Fuck you.   What's this blobbing look like?  Can you post a picture?   Honestly, at this point I just need to be able to navigate to parallels with an Arch linux install, and I'm good. :)  If I had anything to say good about Apple computers, it's that Parallels is awesome.   I want to say the top one.  Metallic/Glossy.  The settings icon and the terminal icon shown are the exact ones I saw/used.   Not sure; wasn't my Mac.  Was one I had to jump on at the office.  It looked like a TV screen, and supposedly hadn't been updated in a while.  The mouse had a left/right click, was gloss white, looked like this: http://store.appogee.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/apple/Apple%20Wired%20Mouse.jpg  If that gives you any idea to the age of the machine?  I won't lie and pretend I have experience with Macs.  It was my first time touching one; I'm mostly a Linux guy - I'm not exactly unfamiliar with strange interfaces (Unity, etc)  It did _NOT_ have the iPhone-esque desktop where all your programs were just thrown into a grid like I've seen on newer macs.   Well, then there is also E3D's new hot end the "Cyclops", which is a color-switching hot end.  Single-nozzle, multiple colors.  That's "state-of-the-art" too.  And then things like the iBoxNano (fucking TERRIBLE name, I know) that is using an LCD stripped of its backlight, with UV leds behind it acting as a digital mask to cure resin.  I'd say that's pretty "state-of-the-art" as well.  Then there are the mini LCOS based projectors, with the LEDs replaced with UV leds and projected....it's just...there's so much innovation going on now that the first patents have started expiring.   There's no single "state of the art".  There are multiple forms of 3D printing each of which are their own form of state of the art.  It's like any material selection.  Housing?  "What's the state of the art?"...well... you can go wood-frame house, concrete block, preform, etc.  Each have their uses in different climates, etc.   Fullscreen != Maximized.  And if OSX is making things fullscreen when maximized, that's non-intuitive.   Strangely enough, tried that.  Didn't pull chrome out.  Hit F11 (standard for full screening apps across multiple OSes) and it brought me to a desktop selector.  Ugh.  Oh, that was _after_ having to hit the function key, because who would _EVER_ want to use F-keys?  Nope...on a mac they default to being volume up/dn.   The whole damn OS is unintuitive.  ctrl+alt left/right doesn't swap desktops, super+up/dn doesn't max/min windows, you've gotta do this whole drag and drop nonsense in order to install programs, I actually felt more at home dropping to a terminal and working from there.   Nothing about OSX is intuitive.  I couldn't even find how to un-maximize my chrome window on a mac the other day... they just hide the buttons, completely.   Peachy printer, and they're called galvanometers.  Downside is that the larger your object is, the more time it takes to print.  Benefit of whole-plate exposure is that you pretty much have the same print time per layer regardless.   I can't actually find a price on that, but that's almost _exactly_ what I was thinking of.   It's more like research for the RepRap project.  Always looking for new ways of curing resin, or depositing filament.  If I manage to figure out some new alternative method and people can build a 3D printer for $200 less than they could before, it's a win for everyone.   Well, that's the point.  DLP light projector, $600+  LCD screen, $100 or so? - It's a huge difference in price and might mean the difference between millions of people being able to have access to this kind of tech, or only a handful.    You can take any display apart and remove the polarizing filters and such.  Yes, but the color filter is another beast entirely.  It is laminated between these layers and practically impossible to remove.  The polarizing filters aren't so hard.  They are generally unattached once you've removed the metal frame.  (I've converted an LCD into a projector unit before)   Why the hell did I have to dig soooo fucking deep for this question?  Sheesh.   I cannot actually find monochrome LCDs in any resolutions higher than 20x4, or TFT displays for old nokias which are like 80x60.   I'm looking to use an LCD screen as basically a digital-mask for UV light to cure resin, but I can't seem to find LCDs without bonded/laminated color filters.  I'm expecting I could take a regular LCD and put a UV light behind it, but suspect the filters would block most/all of the UV.  Are there, say, 800x600 color-filterless displays out there?  Anyone ever heard of such a thing?   What?  Since when?  I'm _constantly_ compiling things from the arch user repository...    has your information anonymized on the back end.  I'm guessing you missed that part.  In their database, you are merely a number.  A statistic.  Nothing more.  As far as that number, they have things put in place so that it would be extremely difficult to pick out an individual person.   Ooooohh, if this were fleshed out a little more, I could definitely get into it.  It's a little bland/sparse but knowing the flow of Marlin code would be pretty nice.   Seconding this!  Every picture/video I've ever taken is backed up in my Google Drive.  I could grind my phone into dust tomorrow and think nothing of it, because important stuff is backed up automatically. :)   http://html5test.com/results/desktop.html  Chrome: "What was that?  I can't hear you over all of this HTML5 that I'm supporting"   Google doesn't sell your information, it sells access to analytics that has your information anonymized on the back end.  Your information is what makes them so valuable for their advertising services.  If they _sold_ your information, everyone would just simply have your information and wouldn't need to go to Google to advertise.  I feel like a lot of people don't understand this simple concept.  Google does not sell your information.  They sell advertising and analytics.  Your information is a proprietary gold mine for them, they do not share it externally.   I'm not sure this is an example of that at all.  We're not talking black and white here with grey somewhere between, we're talking about 2 languages that have strengths and weaknesses.  Python has syntactic sugar as a strength, and C has its speed.  We're not finding a half-way point here, we're taking the good from one, and also the good from another.  Separate, they're still both very powerful.  Together, they're just as powerful.   Woah woah woah...  We have a Gentoo user...  Complaining about recompiling?

It's certainly worth a look, but lets not pretend that it's going to solve everything.  It still has its fair share of problems.  Or maybe I'm just subjected to people having problems more often because I help people every day and those who need help are only those with problems. :D  Anecdotal evidence, I'm aware. - but I'm just showing you what _I_ see about Simplify3D from the people that I follow, and who spent the money on the software.   Or alternatively, for the loss.  The Simplify3D team doesn't actually seem to care about community interaction.  I know a half dozen people that have problems with simplify3D, and want to report print-breaking bugs, but can't get so much as a response from them at all.     Ingentis, T-slot-Tantillus, etc are better options.   When the code is that old, those companies aren't the ones migrating their server infrastructure over to new versions of Windows.  It'll continue working just the same.   You don't check for the string "Windows 9", that's bad programming practice.  You check for version number.  This is just crutching bad programming practice.   Again; we're talking nearly 20 years old at this point.  Why are we doing something like this in order to account for bad programmers.  Bad programmers should update _their_ code.  I know, I know...that's how it works.  But, I'm saying it shouldn't work that way.   Should Microsoft really even be worried about programs that are checking for Windows 95 and 98 at this point though?  We're talking nearly 20 years old at this point.   Well, honestly Arch is for control-freaks like myself.  Dumps you into a command line, expects you to build everything up from scratch.  If you try out something like Mint, it's a drop-in windows experience.  Honestly, set up a virtual machine with Mint Linux and you'll be surprised at the things you _don't_ have to do afterwards.  Something like the new Mint with Cinnamon desktop is surprisingly well polished.   So, I found something for you.  https://downloads.archlinux.de/iso/archboot/2014.09  These images actually have the old Arch Installer that basically runs you through a checklist (most of which are defaults which you can simply ignore if you don't understand them) and after the install is done, it'll dump you to a command line with only a root user and base packages installed.  From there you can do a pacman -Syu in order to get fully up to date, and ethernet/dhcp is all previously set up for you.  Or maybe you need something that at least dumps you into xorg?   This wasn't a review.  This was a bunch of douchebags at a [6] laughing at Doctor Who stuff for 15 minutes, while occasionally interjecting something about the episode.   Because the good Doctor Who episodes are all about the enemies.  And usually the good enemies are the ones who have somehow managed to knock The Doctor off guard.   American checking in, never had an issue with english accents or variations of english dialect really.  I regularly have to listen to American English, Ebonics English, Aussie English, Scottish English, German English, Swedish English, Mexican English, etc.  Though yes, I do have to turn the TV up quite loud in order to hear the dialog usually.   So.  Imagine you're a 2D being.  Ignore the third dimension.  That 2D circle on the paper, you can only view it from X/Y.  So it looks like a straight line.  You're right.  But as you're traveling from the Y dimension to the X dimension, around the circle...the line never gets taller or shorter.  Reasonable assumption, is that it's a circle.  A square would get taller, then shorter, then taller, etc.  Stars, and other such shapes would get taller/shorter at a higher frequency, etc.   But he really wasn't "learning from them".  They were dying, but he wasn't learning anything from that.  He figured out that they were 2D from the first woman dying, but nobody else that died clued him in moreso than the events that were happening.   It's certainly sneaking up on being my favorite episode of the whole reboot so far.  Had just the right mix of humor, horror, etc.  I think it would make a good "introductory" episode like Blink.   The fact that they didn't focus too much on making it look "real" and gave it the whole disjointed effect is what made it I think.   Those military drones?  They're literally unmanned.  As in they don't have to be watched by soldiers on the ground.  They aren't controlled in an RC fashion because half way around the world it would take seconds for the signal to get there, and you cannot fly a device like that with seconds worth of latency between video, input, etc.  Drones are classified differently because their onboard computer, actually flies the thing.  It is not reliant on a human operator.  What you're calling a drone, is not a drone because it _requires_ line of sight and a pilot to fly.   There is a difference in classification.  [You wouldn't call this a drone, would you?:](https://www.paramountzone.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/z/m/zmer5.jpg)   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon   For an observer standing on the ground with h = 1.70 metres (5 ft 7 in) (average eye-level height), the horizon is at a distance of **4.7 kilometres (2.9 mi).**   https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100627084920AAv5Kyf   What is the maximum range in miles of an RC plane ?  **A typical hobby grade radio set will carry about a half mile in direct line-of-sight reliably.** Some good ones will carry twice that far reliably. With effort at designing optimum receiving antennae, etc, I am sure much greater range than that could be achieved. Even at a half mile, being able to see the model starts to become more of a limiting factor than the radio. Although larger sailplanes are often flown at great distances and are somewhat easier to see due to their size and high-visibility patterns on them.   There are many toy-grade rc airplanes that cannot be controlled beyond 300 feet.   Yeah, we call those "RC aircraft" not drones.   So you're telling me, we now have quadcopters that autonomously search out nude women, avoid incoming brooms, etc?  Because that's the only way your argument is correct...    You said a quadcopter is a drone  Reading comprehension much?    samloveshummus said:      "Unmanned Aerial Vehicle", of which this is obviously one type of example.  Yes, you're completely right.  This quadcopter was obviously looking for boobies completely unmanned!  I mean, it completely responded to the woman chasing it with a broom completely unmanned as well, by backing away in a logical manner that only an unmanned aircraft would do!  Completely unmanned!   Then buy better video cards.   It's called a quadcopter.  Not a fucking drone.  Get it?  [Drone](http://www.newyorker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/borowitz-drones.jpg)  [Quadcopter](http://www.swiftrc.co.uk/ekmps/shops/swiftrc/images/bumblebee-c-quadcopter-with-dji-naza-fc-6287-p.jpeg)   Sell it a build a PC.   It's not bad to learn on a single computer.  If you know how to swap VTs (ctrl+alt+F1, F2, etc) then right on bootup it says in the terminal that the beginners guide is available by running [X] command.  I usually swap VTs back and forth while following that guide (enough to get networking set up) and then connect to the 'net, and use links to finish off the rest.   Honestly, Arch is easy once you've done the install process once or twice.  Then it's beautiful being able to select the packages you want from the ground up.  I'm on an EEE900A with 2gb of DDR2 and an 8GB internal drive.  On a machine like that, you've gotta practice minimalism in order to pack everything into such a small drive, and also to be able to select lightweight enough packages that your single core 1.6ghz ATOM processor doesn't drive you insane.   Those people are in love with the idea of being in love, and things never work out.    The Moto G has the same waterproofing, and I've submerged it without issue.  They don't seal up the outside of the phone; they spray a superhydrophobic coating on all the PCBs and interior components so that water never "touches" the electronics.   I'm honestly wishing I can find someone who bought it, but couldn't return it, and is selling one dirt cheap so that I can rip it apart, solder a jumper on the motherboard, flash a new coreboot onto it, and load up Arch.

Just remember, they don't see Linux in that user agent string, they've got no reason to ever believe that giving into Linux is a good idea.  Given the fight they've been putting up with the FCC, and causing a fuss over Net Neutrality, you figure one might be a little more "tolerating".

I got my private pilot's license after years of playing flight sim. It definitely helped me feel comfortable in the cockpit, as I was already familiar with most of the instruments, knew a good deal of the terminology used by pilots, and even knew the basics of traffic patterns and such. Actually flying the plane was more of a learning experience, you just don't have the same feedback from the controls in the sim. The yoke doesn't get yanked to the side in a gust of wind or get really heavy during landing in sims. But still, I can say that even in that aspect the sims definitely helped me prepare.   Euros *per kilogram*. So you can safely be damn sure.   I read it as "not cican" so I put that into Google to see if it was a reference to something and it said "Did you mean: not clean?"

 A privy is sort of like a maker's mark, it identifies/differentiates the coin.

You can't collect on it, it's free money" (arguments about my morality continued).  They eventually stopped calling...At one point I just googled Maribella's full name, found her Facebook page where it listed her employer in Beaverton.

Even if silver files a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, hoping to reorganize its finances, instead of a Chapter 7 liquidation bankruptcy, it typically must cancel and eliminate its original silver, making that silver worthless.

 I just looked at the measurements and I was shocked to see that Indochino added a few inches to what I measured for my chest, I'm guessing thats why the suit is fitting the best. I really don't understand though I had someone else measure my chest, I actually measured my chest multiple times and it was always around 42" but Indochino changed it to 45.5"  * Side note, this is really important to me and I thank everyone for the informative feedback.   Strange thing is I got my third suit today from Indochino and it surprisingly fits well compared to the other 2. I'll post photos as well this evening.   I read the problem in the back could be a collar problem?    I'm so conflicted with colors on my business cards but wouldn't a high end market want purple or gold? Or a blue for calming/trust?    Does reading memes on Reddit count?    http://imgur.com/a/poUf7  Ok so first I apologize for the photo quality and while the photos look blurred, it's a shadow. Should I take a photo in anymore stances to better help gauge the fit?  The Black Lapel suit is the black suit. I'm overall satisfied with it but it feels just a little too tight. The back is clearly not fitting right but I also think it's from my horrible posture.  The grey suit is from suit supply. I was really impressed with the material. Similar to the black lapel, I think my posture is screwing it up. I was trying to stand straight and I didn't have many opportunities to redo the photograph because I basically had to bed my roommate to take photographs of me in the corner of my room anyway. The Suit Supply pants need to be hemmed but I felt like the Black Lapel pants may need to be hemmed as well, whats your thoughts?  Thank you!

Yeah and honestly I put about $2400 into a gaming PC (this including all accessories) but looking at AnAndTech 'for sale' forums and Reddits HardwareSwap subreddits, I think the next PC I build (hopefully another year from now) will be comprised mostly of used parts. I can't believe how cheap you can get a 780 etc.   I sold my gaming PC so I don't really have any dog in this fight but why release another graphics card when you're already the fastest?    Little Person - Jon Brion   I've decided to split between you and /u/jsnen and go with a 40L, time will tell. I don't know a lot about fashion/suits but when I receive all 3 suits I'll do a lot of photos and give a brief review of what I think as well as getting your opinions.  Went with this: http://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/suits/washington-light-grey-plain/P3829I.html?vpid=P3829I16   http://us.suitsupply.com/en_US/suits/washington-blue-plain/P4240I.html?start=3 cgid=Suits prefn1=styleFit prefv1=Contemporary-Washington  EXAMPLE:  I think I would go with this suit but my arms are too long for the 38R, which is requests but the chest seems to be way too big in the 40R.  Edit: And just checked trousers.. would be completed f *!ed with the 38 pants.    Well I meant more along the lines of how to measure. I have my measurements but what measurements should I make sure are the most accurate, and what areas are easier to tailor.   Couple measurements I forgot to include:  Jacket Length: 31.25"  Pant Length: 41.25"     So long story short, business has been good. I've always wanted to wear a suit daily and I'm near that point now. If you look at my previous posts, I purchased an Indochino suit (scheduled April 19th) and a Black Lapel suit (scheduled April 19th) Well I was able to put a couple more big closings together and I was already planning to do somewhat of an amateur review for you guys, so I decided I would look at purchasing a suit from Suit Supply. Unfortunately I'm not near a Suit Supply, is it possible to to still purchase a suit from them? I have my measurements from Black Lapel/Indochino to reference, but I don't know how well they would translate to Suit Supply.   Height: 6'1"  Weight: 195 pounds Jacket Length: 31.25" Chest Size: 41.75" Lower Waist: 37.5" Upper Waist: 36" Shoulder Size: 18.75" Sleeve Length: 25.25" Hips: 42.50" Waist: 37.50" Thigh: 25.50" Knee: 16"  Any suggestions or what should I look for? Thank you.    Interesting. My foot wouldn't actually come out of the shoe but I just didn't want my heal to continually rub the back of these shoes and I end up destroying $400 shoes. But thank you for the response, I think I'll continue to wear them then!    I went to Brooks Brothers today and purchased two pairs of Peal   Co. Shoes. I tried on an 11 wide and they were extremely tight. I have very high arches. I tried on the 11 1/2 wide and they seemed to fit perfectly. Like a moron, I didn't really walk around too much with them on. I get home and decide to put on one of the pairs before running back up to the office.  That's backstory, so I've noticed when walking my heel moves up just a little bit. Not enough to come out of the shoe but my heel is moving a bit up and down when I step. Is this minimum amount of movement normal or should I take them back? What would be another solution, considering the 11's seemed so tight?   Thank you!   (FIX)  Well I was on here a few minutes ago bitching and then I got on live chat and was bitching but they actually helped me. It's the wifi being stupid. I took my phone off wifi mode then clicked verify and it immediately verified.    Did they have it fixed because I bought a PS4 today and the same exact fucking thing is happen. I was a PC gamer. Decided I don't game as much sold it, purchased a PS4: regrets are happening!   I just bought a PS4 and I'm trying to verify my account. I receive the email but when I click on the verification or try to log into PSN from the website and either way it just sits loading and then times out.   I bought a PS4 today and I get home send the e-mail, receive the e-mail to verify my PSN account, and what do you know, the website won't load to verify jack shit.   Well I'll do a mini review as well. I ordered a suit off Black Lapel as well, so time will tell.   Great job!!   I was debating going for the Premium Navy Pinstripe on sale. Currently I only have an older black suit and I plan to have enough suits to have options weekly, but I wanted to purchase essential colors first; navy, grey, charcoal, black. Was there a notable difference between the premium and essential?  Just had a great run of closings and my budget has increased a bit. I purchased the essential navy blue today and I'll probably purchase one off of black lapel today as well for comparative purposes. Then I think I'll just purchase 3 or 4 from whoever I'm most satisfied with.    I really appreciate the fact that you responded almost immediately after I posted. To be completely honest with you, I like the appearance of some of the Black Lapel suits more then Indochino. I recently received a $100 gift card to Joseph A. Bank and went to purchase some dress shirts, the service was terrible. I'm in sales and customer service is huge to me. So even though I think my next purchase may be at Black Lapel just for comparative purposes, I took advantage of the 'HAVEITALL' sale today and purchased the essential blue sharkskin suit, a white dress shirt, and blue tie + a tie clip (unrelated to the sale). I probably would have went with a lighter blue off of Black Lapel first so tell your boss he needs to buy you lunch. Thank you again.   Just look up Brian Buffini. It basically is a referral driven system where you keep in contact with your previous clients with what I consider informative information. I would go into the whole sales pitch but I'm still in the office and I really want to finish work for the day. If you have any questions after looking into it, I would love to answer them for you. Once again there may be better services out there but I personally love the referral maker CRM.   If you have the money to spend, I love the Referral Maker CRM. It's rather pricey but I've received quite a lot of business as a direct result from it, and I feel like it's one of the best layouts, extremely user friendly.    If I could have a dollar for every post I made about a rumor or leak for the 390 from AMD, I would post so *hard*   I know there's quite a few posts about this but I have a few questions beyond the typical. I've already purchased the Indochino Tailor Kit and received my 16 fabric swatches and tape measurer.   1) I've received my tailoring kit. I've been checking the site occasionally. What is considered a great sale for them? When I see this sale when should I know it's time?   2) I've seen Indochino vs. Black Lapel reviews and it seems like Black Lapel was always slightly ahead. But I've also recently seen posts that have mentioned that Indochino has gotten their act together. Is this much closer or would I be foolish to purchase an Indochino premium suit?  * Bonus question, I believe I know this answer but Indochino's measuring tape should work fine with Black Lapel's suits right? I know it's almost definitely a yes, but I have to ask.   3) I don't have a suit supply near me. I do have a Brooks Brothers and a Joseph A. Bank. I really would rather go the custom suit direction. I feel like I've never had a suit that fit me "perfectly" and I'm not in a rush so sending suits back would not be an issue.   - Budget should be noted. I could spend up to $1,500 but realistically I need a few suits. I would like to catch a sale similar to JoS A. Bank where I could buy one "nice" suit for $1,000-1,500 range and get a few free. But I would much rather start my collection with a very nice suit and just continually build suits around that then spend $1,500 for a 3-4 so/so suits that I will want to replace in a short time.

America would be able to put up a good fight but there is no way they can win. Lets say it's just Russia and China against the U.S, the U.S would probably still lose. Even though we have one of the most advanced military, that won't mean shit when you have the rest of the world against you.   That's horrible! It's surprising how much kids can change. I used to know a few kids back in elementary school who were the sweetest kids I've ever met, I'm not sure what happened but they became major douchebags and constantly got into trouble. However, the opposite is also true. I knew some kids who I considered "bullies" in elementary school who actually became some of my closest friends!   Whoops that went over my head. I loved Ef but the last time I saw it was close to 3 years ago so I forgot a lot of stuff. All I remember was that I loved it at the time. The drama was pretty nice too.

Or you could become a super villain and try to take over the world... Just sayin   Despite how much schools stress the importance of reporting bullying, a lot of people still don't act on it. There was a kid in my gym class in high school, he was a little weird and he acted like a 5th grader even though we were in high school. Of course, everyone picked on him and even though I felt sorry for him, I didn't do anything to help him out. Obviously as a result of this, he became isolated from the rest of the kids. He was constantly writing in his notepad during gym class. Apparently one day another student read his notepad and it was filled with death threats and comments about how he wants to shoot up to school. The kid reported it to the teacher and he got expelled. It's a really unfortunate situation but I still feel bad for the kid. If everyone wasn't so mean to him, maybe he wouldn't have felt that way.

I don't understand how woman can be so kind to you and within a day they do a 180 and start flipping out over everything. I used to have a female friend that I kinda had a crush on. She was nice to me and we shared a lot of common interests until one day she randomly, out of the blue, stopped talking to me. She would ignore me everytime I try to talk to her and I still don't know what I exactly did to her. Women are confusing...   Gay Marriage is a totally different issue. Incest you might be able to argue for but Polygamy is just plain wrong. Why would you want to have multiple wives or husbands? That's just being unfaithful and it goes against societal standards.

 I've been trying this with Game of Thrones (not a film, but cinematic enough to be relevant). Reading the books helped because of all of the key context you miss, but I still find the show itself hard connect to. It all feels like set-up, but for events you don't always feel are inevitable. There's never a catharsis, just stuff happening - some of which is shocking.     It's entertaining, but it's way overrated.   We're going to need a new abbreviation for 'significant other' now that SO is being used for Shower Orange.   And found out Wayne wasn't her biological father after all, it was actually Hank Pym!   That's not the ending, though - that's the series as a whole. People blame the ending, when in fact they should blame the show itself. The final moments are unrelated to the mysteries.     edit: expanded upon final sentence   I've heard the same about Twin Peaks.   Despite several fantastic episodes, the final season commits some awful TV crimes. There were many moments I'd absolutely consider let downs...yet people bash *the ending*?! The last 15 minutes of the show were magnificent, and redeem most of that season. Much of what came in the episodes before it? Dreadful. That's what the backlash should be directed towards, not the ending - which 90% of people don't actually understand - [spoiler](/s "they weren't dead the whole time.")          This shouldn't reflect on people's view of the show in general, though. How does one final season make an entire show a let down?   They can be a new acting quartet - a package deal called the Fantastic Four or something.   It's the korrasamilluminati, right?

I couldn't think of a more relevant username for an OP. Well done!   Hola Unblocker could also use your IP to frame you as a child pornographer, so it's a win-lose situation.   I really liked the episode before TRACKS - the one at the SHIELD academy. That was the first super compelling episode in my opinion.   **:O**   YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE WIRE?!   I'm very blonde, with quite dark eyebrows. I'm a guy.   I'm a bigger fan of [Jigsaw Falling Into Place](https://youtu.be/GoLJJRIWCLU).   Not any currently existing Spider-Man movie, though.   Ron Howard has stepped down as director.   They were making a Sony joke.   As much as I think DT will be scarily easy for a studio to fuck up, I'd still rather see this than the Ghostbusters Cinematic Universe.   I was suggesting an alternative. Read my other replies - I don't have a problem with the idea. I'm not racist for preferring other actors over Elba.   SUNG KANG FOR BOND!   So, alternatively, we should just encourage them to continue to recycle the same old shit?   I agree.   It wouldn't be a problem. I'm not opposed to the idea, I just think it's unnecessary. He could be the head of a new 00 franchise and build upon a new awesome character in the same MI6 universe, and be more internally canonically consistent than 007 ever was. Recasting Bond as a black guy? It's a bit pointless in comparison to what could potentially be a new and refreshing franchise.   [It doesn't need to be James Bond himself, though.](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/321vnb/james_bond_should_not_be_black_says_first_black/cq7g0tc)     You seemed quick to assume I was against the idea. I was only suggesting an alternative.   Why can't Elba just play an original black character? He'd play a great spy, but we don't need to raceswap anyone just to give a great black actor a great action star role.   They're likely cancelling the Blu-rays as well.   Scream was the same. Matthew Lillard in nutcase-mode turned it into a comedy.   What about Penelope laying spread-eagle at the beach, sensually moaning "OOOH ODYSSEUS!" as the water washed up into her crotch?   Legendary are with Universal now, so it's actually slightly more possible.   Placing my bet right now: Jurassic World 's gross will be absolutely dwarfed by Star Wars, Avengers and Furious 7.   /u/Strike48 used to be right, though. You couldn't use it at all.   [How dare they copy Willy Moon?!](https://youtu.be/GaWXA5e0YTQ) How artistically bankrupt do you have to be to plagiarise the inventor of the suit?   [Exception.](https://youtu.be/mEpupr4saKo)   What plot twist?   And *that's* why you don't teach lessons!   Ditto.   I can't stand it when people say that Seasons 1   2 are the best. They are great, but I see it as they compliment Seasons 3-6 by giving all of the necessary character background so that when the show goes batshit off-the-wall bonkers, you care about the characters enough to go along with it.   **DON'T    DEAD OPEN     INSIDE**   Let Down is electronic?   Interstellar. That moment at the end where you realise they're about to try to one-up 2001, and Murph's ghost is revealed as EXACTLY what you expected it was. It had so much going for it! I don't mind all of the coincidences and stuff, but I can't stand how telegraphed the twist is,   ***Introducing...Disney Nature's Bears 2!***   Some people were disappointed there was no big conspiracy twist ending, and the one big twist only affected this self-contained tangent storyline that many people didn't care for - it only worked for those who wholly invested in the characters.     Also, some felt betrayed that the answers to some mysteries were either too vague or didn't come up.     All valid reasons. I loved the finale. Show went in a strange (arguably bad) direction for the final season, but largely redeemed itself with a super campy final episode paying tribute to its awesome characters.      It all depends on whether you cared more about the characters or the mysteries.   Finale was episode 6.17. [The Titanic episode was 6.14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_SxoS-Gd_s), slightly before.   This is where I came from: The DHARMA Initiative...I was smart enough to not end up in that ditch, which makes me considerably smarter than you, John.     *shoots Locke*    I honestly think that the director's cut kills the pacing entirely - bloats it to all hell, although the longer seminar scene was fantastic.   Controversial opinion: ***ALIEN***. Better pacing for a modern audience. Thank you, Ridley.   Nice work. Partly reminds me of The Dark Tower as well.   GoT is a mashup of several periods in the distant+not-so-distant past, made possible by setting it in an alt universe. I'd say it's comparable.   Yun-Jin Kim was incredible in much of seasons 4-6 of **LOST** (see 4.07 - Ji Yeon, 4.12-14 - There's No Place Like Home, 6.14 - The Candidate), but in Season 1...she had to pretend to be dramatically worse at speaking English than she actually was. Listening to her fake bad accent was like hearing somebody scratching a chalkboard.   Start ASAP and come back here after. Avoid spoilers   This season of the base show is really good. Cliff Curtis and Kim Dickens are good actors. Judging by the karma balance here, /r/television is in a pretty circlejerky mood today.   I kinda expected a colon in there somewhere.    Thanks!   underrated   The point of the film is that the anarchist message is clearly immature hypocritical bullshit and born out of misplaced masculinity. If you listen to what Tyler's plans are, his means are basically doing exactly what he condemns.   Secret epilogue?!   It *does* say #FantasticFour at the bottom, though.   Waaaaaaaaaalk into the jaws of hell...   Plot twist: he drugged her drink.   Hurley. Because he's the man, and he's fucking loaded.   In the hypothetical situation, he's supposed to be real. It's the whole point of the question.    Please tell me Josie's not your dog or something.   Lucy   Series Four will deal with Moriarty.   That's how I feel about the title track from Kid A. Fitter Happier, I can deal with - it's less than two minutes long and it absolutely elevates Electioneering.     Fucking Kid A lasts five fucking draining, depressing minutes. Fitter Happier is a cakewalk compared to that piece of scheie. Kid A turns me into a shadow for the rest of the day.   The Christmas Special is only 9 months away. It's an Alt. version of Sherlock, with the same actors but set in the original Victorian time period of the novels. Currently filming.   There was once a "Who are some great female directors?" post that got very mildly popular. My comment was one of the top five, and I suggested *"Michelle MacLaren is a fantastic television director..."*          A FEW MONTHS LATER, SHE'S PICKED TO DIRECT WONDER WOMAN. **WHERE'S MY CUT, WB?!**      (edit: [found post - my comment was third](http://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/24x8xl/who_is_your_favorite_female_director/chbm2es))   Fantastic cleavage, btw   In general, 'size', when referring to a measure of diversity, refers to population.   This is it. We aren't scared of bringing it up, we just don't wish to be be physically assaulted.   That's a top hat, though.   To be fair, I'm not from Europe, but it's a lot bigger population-wise than my nation.   Population-wise, rather large compared to many places. Tell me if Scots and Englanders sound similar, because they're both British nations.   Orange Is the New Black lifted the flashback structure straight from Lost. Tell him that.   Exactly.   http://your.moth/   "British accent" Bitch, do you know how big Great fucking Britain is? How many fucking accents there are?     (Edit: population-wise, people)   Sweet username!

[Love Birds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1636539/). It's not fantastic, but it's all I can think of.   SHE'S NOT MY DAUGHTER. I STOLE HER AS A BABY FROM AN INSANE WOMAN. SHE'S A PAWN, NOTHING MORE. SHE MEANS **NOTHING** TO ME.     The exact moment when Ben becomes sympathetic.   No Sanctuary (S5 premiere) was fantastic, though.   Not a pilot.   The only thing that I can get the hang of it and the rest of the day before I go to bed early tonight is going on with my friends are so cute when he said the government has been a long way toward the same time.

 Thank you. I hope It does too.   Growing up my parents weren't around a lot. They worked so their guidance and love wasnt given to me as much as a wished. I was beaten by all the people i called friends. Because of them i have back problems due to being hit with a baseball bat and kneed in the back. They also bruised my rib cage and almost killed me by choking me. Also when i was in 2nd grade i was almost killed again by beung choked by a 17 year old at the end of my street. The only person who was around was my "uncle". He faked his own death abd that crushed me. 6 months later he came back with some bullshit story but we havent talked since. On top of that my brother had a drug addiction and almost died multiple times. He stole from me and my family to buy pills. I wathced him destroy himself and couldnt do anything. Multiple people i was close to died when i was very young. I was also in therapy in elementary school for anxiety and anger issues. I went through 13 therapist before i was taken out.  Overall, a lot of stuff happened to me that caused me to look at the world as a horrible place. I realized how insignificant life was. I did not understand this feeling. I felt dreadful, useless, and felt like i was invisible. I didnt understand these feelings till about 8th grade. Its pathetic that ive let depression chew away at me and grab onto every aspect of my life.   My mother knows i am depressed aswell as my two closest friends. The issue is, i just try to act like im better. I constantly hide my feelings away from them in fear that i will disappoint them. I want them to think im better but i cant live this way anymore. I can continue being a shell of a person i once was. I feel so empty. I feel like their is a void inside me that is expanding and its killing me. I can not recall who i am no more, that or i am in denial of who i actually am. I hate myself and do not deserve the love and care of my family. Bot do i deserve love from the girl i hold close to me. I push the all away. I just do not want to exist. I always acted as if i didnt exist. I live in fear and isolation and ive tried to change but i cant. Thank you for your words.   Its just hard because i push all the people i love away and isolate myself. I cant look them in the eyes. Im not who they think i am and i am ashamed that im this way. I feel terrible that i live a lie and act that im better for their sake. Im dying inside. Ive been thinking about killing myself for a long time and have tried before. I have always failed. The only reason i am alive is so i dont disappoint my family. I dont want to pain them, but its so hard to continue living. Therapy is just so hard for me. It takes a lot out of me to talk to a therapist since i cope by trying to hold it in and distract myself. Im sorry.    I actually have been to multiple therapist and was diagnosed. I do have to man the fuck up honestly. Its pathetic that i chose to post personal shit on here in hopes of maybe feeling better and hearing advice. I want to die but its hard to commit that act. I no longer want to exist but its my fault for feeling this way. I shouldnt feel sorry for myself and seek help. I should just be as great as you and have the motivation and courage to live. Honestly i do not want to live but just committing the act is so hard. Medication does not help nor does empathy from people i love and care for. I have a small will to live but im losing it. Im pathetic.   Literally all i do is listen to music. Since i have a sleeping disorder i get 15 hours of music in my life each day. I have longer hair so i can hind ear buds in during my classes. Music has helped me a lot but it can only do so much.    Every hobby that i have has lost all meaning. The things i love to do bring me no pleasure anymore and i cant find anything that absorbs me. I literally sit in my room and just wait for the day to end. Thank you for the advice.    I do not care to stay. They just deserve to have a good bye from me. I much rather at least give them that pleasure. I no longer want to live and i am not afraid to die anymore. I want to die. Its the thing i want the most.   Friday is the end of the week and gives me time to get everything together. It gives me time to see the ones i love one last time. I can look at the things that i love. I know that this is what i want and i just want to secretly say goodbye to everyone in my life.    I have a 3.85 gpa and i am going into multiple A.P classes but i do not say i am intelligent. I am dumb. I make so many mistakes. My whole life is just a huge mistake. I have witnessed so many things. I have experienced horrible things. I have been depressed since i was 8 and i cant take it.   I am extremely unattractive, physically and in my personality. I always fuck everything up and care too much. I always say nothing when i should have said something. I am devoured by fear, shame, and anxiety. I have been abused by all the people i held close. Maybe i deserved it. I have a thin line between empathy and apathy. I either care too much or not at all. I am a horrible person that never wonders why anyone else is sad. I only focus on the pain thats mine. I always think horrible things that make me only hate myself. My self esteem is gone. I do not like anything about myself. Im so damn ugly in everyway. I dislike the way i push everyone away and i hste that i isolate myself. Im so alone and its all my fault. I want to die is the most brutal way. I want to suffer. I deserve it.    Ive tried so hard to help everyone before. I no longer trust people. I am insignificant to the people i love. I am nothing to those i hold close.   Ive been feeling this way for years. Ive attempted to kill myself multiple times before but either chickened out or i dod not succeed. I want this. I need this. Im sorry   I seriously can not do this anymore. I try and try and try. I feel so empty. I no longer want to live. Honestly, im so fucking angry. I want to fuck myself up. I hate myself with a passion. All i fucking do is push people away no matter how much i love them. I want to be alone. I dont need anyone. I fucking hate myself and do not deserve to fucking live. I hope i die. I do not want to exist. I feel so empty. Im sorry that my life crossed path with all of yours. I want to fucking die. Fuck me, fuck my life, and fuck everyone who has taken my kindness for granted. Maybe i do care too much. Maybe i care so much because im scared. Maybe i care too much to compensate for how shitty i am. I am going to disappear from everyones life for a while. Im going to crack but i may just disappear for a long time. I may just kill myself. I no longer know who i am. Ive lost myself. I feel like i no longer exist. Do not miss me. Im gone.   Haven't been able to get into any matches for the past week. Left my xbox on h2a playlist for half an hour and did not get but into a game. It's simply infuriating that mcc is still unplayable for the vast majority of active players.   This is rad.   I love the acoustic version aswell. Spirit desire is by far my favorite song by Tigers Jaw, and has a lot of meaning to me.    Id love to hear them replay their whole first album though. Itd be rad to hear them play all their old stuff again. I just hope they wont make another album like uno dos tre.    Yea anything after American Idiot was kinda bad in my opinion. I love Green day. First band i ever got into. No problem though. I'm glad that i could help!   A kerplunk one would be Kick ass. Fucking lover Kerplunk. Anyways I ordered it on [Amazon!] (http://www.amazon.com/30x40-Green-Day-American-Grenade/dp/B001B8UETM/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden ie=UTF8 qid=1424545093 sr=1-1 keywords=American+idiot+flag) Hopefully that helps I ordered it about a year ago.   I wanted the poster but had no money. Posture and the Grizzly and Rozwell Kid are fucking great. Both of them a recording new albums. I also met David F. Bello from TWIABP, Jnasty from Posture, and Sean from Rozwell Kid. They are all awesome people.       Dude I fucking Love TWIABP. I saw them in pittsburgh with Posture and the Grizzly and Rozwell kid. Rad show. The Emo Revival is amazing right now with stuff like Free Throw, Tigers Jaw, and all that shit. Love the Masked intruder and Clash poster.   That's cool. Collecting skate decks is pretty fun and they do make great decorations. I would hate to fuck them up.   Did you use to skate or just collecting? I love skating but if i find a rad deck i sometimes pick it up.    Those skate decks are rad! Nice.      I would say that this is my favorite. Next one's would be Good Good things, Coolidge, Sour Grapes, and Suburban Home.   	28
 Donate plasma, sell any extra stuff on eBay, try making money online.     27/F. Long story, but I never got my license. I've been relying on my boyfriend and public transportation for the last 11 years. It's been really inexpensive, since I work three miles away from where I live, but I think it's time I ~grow up~ and drive.   Another reason other than the stigma and overall feeling like a loser waiting for the bus: I got my BA in social work three years ago, and most jobs require a drivers license and a car. My job right now isn't bad, but I don't see myself there in the next year. Getting a car would open up my opportunities like 50x because I could also look at different cities to work in.  I have $4K saved, my boyfriend has around the same. We've been together 10 years, and he has said he'd help me buy a car when I'm ready to. I take home a little more than $2K a month, he takes home around $3K. We have the typical expenses. Our rent is $1350/month which is high, but other than that nothing crazy. Our combined credit card debt is around $2K and I have a student loan that's down to $900. I try to pay $75/month on it.  I want to start looking at cars, but I don't really know what to look at or when. I definitely don't want to pay a shitload each month on a car payment, but I don't want a piece of crap 1992 Ford either. My boyfriend says I should match what I have now and save up another $4K, but saving up that money was kind of a fluke. I was able to get as much overtime as I wanted for five months so I ended up working a bunch of 50-60 hour work weeks which gave me no time to spend money, but a lot to save. It probably COULD happen, but it would take me a long time and I don't know if I want to wait that long.   What would be the best way to go about this? Wait until my loan and credit card is paid off? Start looking seriously right now and keep saving? Should I just pay cash, or should I get a loan so I could put my cash towards something else?   Other things: My credit is decent, Credit Karma lists it as a 719. I don't want a truck or an SUV, and I don't see myself driving more than an average of 20 miles a day. The less I have to spend on gas/maintenance/insurance, the better.   I just turned 27 a week ago and am in the same boat. I got my BA in social work in 2012, needed a job straight out of college because I needed to move out of my mom's house, and started working retail. I've moved up pretty quick, to where now I earn about $30K/year (before taxes) but I still feel like... this is retail, what the fuck am I doing. People my age or younger come in to my work to buy stuff for their businesses, and they seem to be doing well, when I live in an apartment and have no car.  Things aren't all bad, my boyfriend is also in retail management and earns upwards of $40K a year, we have almost $10K in combined savings, minimal credit card debt, no loans, and two dogs that we love. But I still feel like a total loser sometimes.  The way I cope... the grass isn't always greener. We have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. The average debt in this country is $20K, and I know people with really nice cars and houses that have way more debt than that. So I think I'm doing pretty well for myself. Could I be doing better? Of course, but I should have majored in something in the medical field or business related if I wanted to be rich.   This is my issue, and why I usually never do.  But after this whole ordeal, I might start on technology items. I mean... lose $50 on a projector if we opened the box and it actually was intact and fine, or lose the entire $500 because we didn't check in the first place.   It took me like six months to watch the whole first season, but I finally did when it was put on Netflix.   Great show, really excited for the new season.    Your AM and GM have 50 every month to give out "just because" and then 50 for associate of the month and Safety Bingo points, which can get up to like 175 or something.  So they're obviously not keeping up with it.   I don't really earn them anymore because I really have no way to, but as a cashier I built up to around 350 and got a bunch of movie tickets, and they were all from my GM.  Start randomly recognizing people for doing a good job. Peer to peer recognitions automatically enter you and the person you recognize into a contest (I won 30 points from one once), and it's kinda fun and might get the ball rolling for your GM and AM to get their shit together with Stars.   Yeah, it's kind of a stupid program, but it's better than nothing.   This old man was just BITCHING about Brother ink and the price of it one day. And I was like "yeah I'm sorry sir, I can check our competitors and see what kind of price match we can do for you". He got all uppity and said "where's the manager? I want to speak to him". I said "I am the manager sir"  His demeanor did like a 180. He got all calm and collected. Like what's the difference, I'm a fellow human, therefore you shouldn't treat me like shit. It doesn't matter what title I have.       I still really like Save the Last Dance.    19 year old brother - Blow, 22 year old brother - Scarface   Identity   Two Staples in my district are closing next month.   Old people bring in emails to be printed a lot, like "send a money order for $100,000 for the Nigerian Prince, he needs you".  Also had a guy super recently print a 17x23 photo of this young Asian girl. I clicked on one of the other pictures on his flash drive and I guess it was like her cover photo or something because in the bottom right hand corner it said "AsianPrincess.com" or something. He kept saying "all I need to see is her pretty face, you can crop everything else out." And then he came in with a frame for the photo. Super creepy.  And a prostitute made business cards once. Her naked ass was basically the whole card. Classy.  	13
 Accroding to Wikipedia, "The vampire that attacks Dawn in the morgue was a touch many viewers took to be out of place for the episode. This scene contrasts the more fantasy-related deaths common in the series with Joyce's realistic death. Furthermore, similar to Xander's parking ticket and the sounds of life outside Buffy's house, in Sunnydale vampires are a normal experience, and it was intended to show that life for Buffy continues."   I, too, can't stop watching Vampire Diaries. The mythology is basically what keeps me interested. I refuse to watch The Originals purely because I dislike Klaus so hard.   Continuing on from this [prompt](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/3cet1u/wp_everyone_in_your_family_gets_one_wish_upon/csux8fk) (it isn't a direct continuation, as in this isn't the next scene; just merely another entry into the world of "The Unlucky Ones"):  Kimber retched over the side of the abandoned, musty couch, the only piece of furniture taking space in the empty warehouse. She heard the pitter-patter of rain hitting against the rust-covered window, and a slight, bitter wind blew in from the sole broken pane. Looking around, she felt the tiny fire Jonah made earlier in the night, before she fell asleep, fighting against the intense cold seeping in to the concrete-made facility.   Her round eyes scanned the room looking for her uncle, but he wasn't anywhere to be found. She tried focusing on his signature to find him, like she had when she first called for him, but her stomach folded in two, causing her to cramp up into the fetal position. A fear burrowed deep into her conscious as she worried about her Turning, and then she remembered her dream.  'You are the last. He is the first.'  Her mother watched over her, somewhere across the globe, or maybe next door, Kimber didn't know and neither did Jonah. No matter the distance, she had gotten to Kimber through her dreams and warned her of the girl's fate. Despite their blood ties, her mother was determined to finish this out to the end, to the point of murdering her daughter, just as she had with her son.  After a few moments of meditation to help calm her nerves, Kimber sat up from her faux bed and searched around the expansive space for her uncle. Her eyes adjusted to the darkness beyond the fire, but she saw nothing. Fearing the pain in her gut, she relented using her *other* senses and stood up to go searching for him.  The warehouse looked different in the night, less inviting, almost suffocating despite how large it looked in the day. Her feet moved against the hard stone floor with an echo, and she turned in every direction to make sure nobody was watching or following her. God, how she hated feeling this useless and mundane, reduced to a whimpering child looking for her parents after a nightmare.  But she did have a nightmare. A vicious vision of her mother standing over her, hand raised high in the air holding an athame as Kimber felt frozen on the cliffs near the shore, on the same rock as the one her brother's corpse had been found lying on. "You are the last; he is the first," her mother warned, before plunging the athame down in the direction of her daughter's heart.   What did she mean? Kimber didn't know.  Kimber stopped in the doorway leading outside, the same one Jonah bashed in to gain entry for the night. He stood out in the rain, with his hands in his overcoat pockets, contemplating. The intense rain didn't touch him, as if he wore an invisible barrier around his body. He looked up and their eyes met. Immediately, he understood it was time: *she* was coming.   Thanks. I hope to make something out of it.   I'd watch the HELL out of it. Honestly, it sounds like it'd do really well as a TV series (just my personal opinion). I'll keep on the look out, man.    Thanks. I actually borrowed the plot from an idea that has been brewing for the past 6 month - 1 year. It's called "The Unlucky Ones" and it's based on elements from my family life (quite complicated, but anyone in my family reading could see the connections). Anyway, originally, the idea was that the family is cursed to become magical after a horrific event happens in their life (something that leaves them changed deeply: loss, rape, suicide, etc) and they have incredible powers but they still cannot undo the horrific event in their lives and can only use their powers to help others be happy.    My birthday is actually August 8th, the birthday of the Sense8 crew!   Got a name for it yet? I want to make sure to pick it up, whether it's a book, comic, movie, tv show, whatever!   Kimber sat on the front steps of the school as she watched Uncle Jonah coming up the sidewalk wearing his trademark black, leather overcoat. He looked older, especially in his eyes, a fatique had taken over his usual, sunny smiling exterior from her childhood memories. She remembered his Turning, he had been so nervous about what to wish for, and Gram told him to stop focusing on the wish and prepare for the *change*.  Kimber's stomach cramped and she wondered if this is how it started, a simple tummy ache that would turn into the most intense pain ever felt in the world,  or at least that's how Jonah described it the day after his birthday.  "You'll know when it's happening," Jonah said reading her mind. He now stood at the bottom of the steps staring up at her, hands in his overcoat pockets. "How are you doing, love?"  She tried to smile, but it came out in a grimace. "Been a long time."  "Sorry, love," he said. He remained standing as he stared up at her. She wondered what he was thinking, but he made no indication in his body language.  "How's mum?" she asked.  He shrugged. "I hear about her from whispers on the wind." He paused as he looked at his grownup niece, taller than he remembered, a little rounder than before but beautiful with her long blond hair and bright blue eyes. This moment had waited too long. "I had expected to find her by now."  All she could do was nod as she looked down at her feet. She felt horrid, had all morning. She knew it was happening, her *conversion*, and she felt Jonah coming from across the globe. A few hours later, he stood in front of her despite all the years of no phone calls, no letters, no 'happy birthdays' or 'congratulations' for doing well in school, no presents for Christmas or Valentine's Day cards, just quiet.  She started to tremble as she felt the power growing inside of her. Her arms gathered around herself as she began to rock on the front steps.  "Let's get you out of her, love," he said. "Wouldn't want you to go through this on the front steps of your school."  She shook her head.  He could see the fear radiating off her. "Why not?"  "If I leave now," she said, her eyes opening and staring at him with an intense glare, "it means I leave this all behind. My **normal** life. The life without magic, wishes, an evil mother, a dead brother, and an uncle who promised he'd never leave me but disappeared a week later."  Jonah removed his hands from his pockets and walked up the stairs to sit next to her. He wrapped an arm around her body and she suddenly felt calmer. "I am sorry for walking out on you. I know you don't understand, but I had to, after your mother took Hunter and..." He couldn't finish the sentence. Kimber's memory went back to the day they found the boy's body on the cliff near the shore. Just turned 18 and completely lifeless. "She took his wish, sacrificed him for his power."  "Now she's hunting the others," Kimber said as she rested her head on her uncle's chest. She felt his heartbeat humming soothingly within. "She's gonna come for me."  Jonah nodded. "That's why I'm here. To protect you."  "I'm the bait," she said.  He shook his head and pulled her back. "No. If I wanted that, Kimber, I would've stayed and watched over you all these years. I didn't want it to take this long, but she's always been the master of evasiveness. I should've tried harder, but now you're in harm's way. I'm sorry."  A silence surrounded the two as the windy day blew from the East.  "We should go," he said standing up. He helped her to her feet. "I know you feel awful now, but you still have three days until your eighteenth. That's ample time to get things prepared, for both you and *your mother*."  Kimber followed Uncle Jonah down the steps at his side, all the way to the end of the sidewalk. She stopped and looked up at him. "You're going to have to kill her, won't you?"  Jonah looked her in the eye and said, "Yes, love."   Okay then:  **Mt. Djvul** is the largest mountain in all of Verhaal where the Eldric reside deep within the woods surrounding its base. It also happens to be the resting place of Ilke's heart, and home to the Kuomullinen.  **Elphaba the Witch** - After Redd and Gretel escape the Queen of Harts aka Red Queen, Redd is left in a feral state thanks to the vampiric Red Queen's blood magick. Luckily, Gretel knocks Redd out and drags her off into the nearby woods of Hart Kingdom where she finds the traveling merchant Merlyn and his apprentice Elphaba. As Merlyn helps pull Redd from Berserker mode, Elphaba shows Gretel a few tricks of magick which ends up having the Witch try to turn Robin the Blue Jay back into a human. Instead, she gives him an upgrade and turns him into a ferocious eagle.  After their first encounter, Redd takes Gretel across the lands to White Kingdom in hopes of raising an army to overthrow the Queen of Harts, but they'll need Merlyn's help to win. A year since their first encounter, Elphaba has become a powerful mage and she helps the Jaegers battle the Red Queen, but Merlyn ultimately dies during battle. Taking up the mantle of master, she takes Merlyn's magical book and helps take down the remaining army of Berserkers.  As the story continues, Elphaba trains under Glenda the Good Witch and ultimately becomes a host to a powerful spirit that slowly tries turning her into a Grimm by having her feed off the Noblest of Hearts, the Most Intelligent Brain, and the Essence of the Most Courageous Being. Thankfully, Gretel stops her and helps her rid her body of the demon.   By the end of the series, Elphaba helps defeat Blackheart by summoning Etev to destroy the Wyrm controlled by the villain.   Lastly, **the Fey** are beings connected to magick. They are your typical ideas of mythical fairy creatures: gnomes, nymphs, sprites, jinn, selkies, and more! These beings protect nature, live in it, thrive on it. They are closer to magick than Fehlen, though they aren't as powerful as the Unicorns, Draconians, or Eldric. Often, they become overprotective and they become mischievious when defending the woodlands.    This sounds like an awesome story! Can you give me a brief synopsis of what this story is about?   **Setting**  * Verhaal (overall continent)  * White Kingdom  * Hart Kingdom  * Charming Kingdom  * Mt. Djvul  **Characters**  * Redd  * Gretel  * Missy Muffett  * Charlemagne Charming  * Snow White  * Belle  * Goldilocks  * Blackheart  * McKenna (Matchstick Girl)  * Rumplestiltskin/Pinocchio  * Jen G. Beret the Cunning  * Tom Thumb and his lumberjack lover Sam  * Elphaba the Witch  * Robin the Blue Jay  * Anton the Horse  **Species**  * The Grimm  * The Hunde  * Fey  * Fehlen  * Eldric  * Draconians  * Unicorns  * The Jaegers  * The Kuomullinen  * The Child  * The Woodland Creatures   It's a great movie. You should check it out, man.   Oh wow. The more you learn. Thanks for letting me know.   I lived in Ohio when all the Affordable Healthcare Act stuff went down. So I was a neighbor for a while. But then when I returned to Oklahoma, as we passed through Indiana, we were pulled over (my friend from Oklahoma came to pick me up; packed her car full fo stuff; and headed out) and my friend got a ticket for speeding while I was cited for not wearing a belt. She hasn't paid her ticket to this day (3 years later) and she has crossed off Indiana as a state we can never visit again (like in the Simpsons).  	15
 well, you guys are on your way, the states that have legalized marihuana make it possible to carry way more of it with you then in the Netherlands... only thing thats weird is that its illegal if you travel one state further xD But talking about xtc, yeah we're pretty cool here in this small country.    Exactly! I frequently visit festivals in the Netherlands and truth is that at least 50% of the visitors are using something other then alcohol... maybe even more. I think they realise that you can't prevent people from using because they will always find a way to get it inside, then the next best thing is to at least try to make it as safe as possible and give people the opportunity to test their drugs and give them as much information as possible while they're there.    I've heard that you could test pills  at festivals in the Netherlands in the 90's, so you can make sure that you had clean pills. I can't understand why thats not a thing anymore, safety should be the number one priority, people are using it anyway...   Well, glad you found something that helped a little...   I'm just hoping that the Netherlands are going to be the number 1 tolerant country we were once... Now pot is legal in a lot of countries/American states, we have to become the bitching country that legalises MDMA, hup holland!

Dutch has a few, Cheetah = Hunting Lazy Horse (Jachtluipaard), and a Manatee is called a Sea Cow (Zeekoe). Which is pretty accurate i guess.    Most of them are pretty similar to Dutch, never thought of it being that funny. But translated to English its pretty weird actually.    You clever bastards, the tabloids in the UK are going to have a lot of fun with that name i guess...     Well said! Lets hope the PL will push him to his limits.    Great transfer!

Pay special attention to the last bit about going out late at night. May your kitty be home in your lap soon!   Be careful: a social media call to fool around with your employer's  FB rating by embellishing the story could backfire. You've given more than enough info here for someone -- the jerks or your boss or IHOP corporate -- to identify your real name, and you can't assume none of those people reads reddit. You also can't assume that IHOP would condone that behavior, which (since you're one of their managers) could look like IHOP is doing it, possibly in violation of FB's TOS.  Much better to get in front of this by telling the story from your point of view, in writing, to your immediate supervisor or district manager. If you can get a copy of the police incident report,great -- if this takes time, tell them you've asked for it already. That alone will help protect you from blowback you don't deserve.

Look where it ended up instead ...    more and more jobs are being taken up because of increases in automation  The problem isn't advertising or automation. The problem is concentration of ownership into the hands of a few megacorps that have zero commitment to journalistic values and demand an unrealistically high ROI -- thus, the decimation of editorial staffers, starting with the ones whose work took a long time and cost a lot of money.  ProPublica is great -- but you do understand, I hope, that its existence came about because there were so many old-school journos without jobs. It was almost the only success out of hundreds of efforts to build something new. What happened is basically that the megacorps outsourced serious reporting to foundations, leaving reporters without *ongoing* and (relatively) secure institutional support. The new organizations employ a tiny fraction of the available talent and publish an equally tiny fraction of the serious news that used to get published.   You can't see the difference because you can't see the work that is no longer even getting started anymore, but I've been in the business for longer than most redditors have been alive and the scale of what's no longer investigated -- especially at the local/state level -- is horrifying.  Anyway, the idiot mods here have decided that this post is off-topic because it isn't "explicitly about current US politics", so if you want to comment further, you'll need to go to one of the other postings.   I didn't say "what they think is the right thing". I said, and meant, the [objectively] right thing -- the action that is sustainable within the ecology of human society.  The point is that most people, psychopaths and sociopaths excepted, are both hard-wired and conditioned to want to be fair and compassionate. When some fail to do this, it's a lack of resources -- material or knowledge -- that causes the problem. The idea that it's only natural to compete is so reductionist as to be completely misleading. When public policy is based on that assumption we get massive wealth inequality and wars to protect the system that made some people so much richer than others.          Scratching it actually makes it worse  But applying very hot water for as long as you can stand it *does* help, especially if you do it immediately after being bitten.    Most people, most of the time, want to do the right thing.   I know the VT ACLU has been keeping watch on police misconduct in Burlington, if you're still there.  Remember, different cities have different histories. What we're all really looking for is an overview of best practices, and of best strategies for getting there. My city had a long history of lefty lawyers suing the City for $$$$ over individual incidents, plus a lot of agitation from white radicals who are anti-cop, without much changing. Then 20 years ago it got so bad the Justice Department almost took over the police department, before reaching an agreement with the City that had the effect of forcing a big jump ahead on things like training. We're still struggling, but at a different starting level than other cities, even those in the same state.  But I have another question: why is this discussion in this reddit? I love Bernie, but I'm unaware of his laser-focused economic populism campaign taking on an agenda for building an all-sided progressive movement. He almost certainly agrees on the importance of this issue, but the task at hand is a campaign for office.    There are several national organizations that have been working for police accountability for decades, and almost certainly a group in the city where you live. Have you reached out to anybody other than reddit about this? I don't mean to discourage you -- this is an incredibly important issue to commit energy to -- but for the last year it seems like everybody wants to start from scratch, for no good reason.      What letter?   When I clicked through to this, my elderly cat sitting next to me snapped to attention and watched the gif several times through. She's never been interested in anything else on that screen or the TV, but apparently the way a bird moves is hard-wired in her brain.  So the guys who gave that bird water *also* gave a far-distant critter something, too.   The people who did this study were a studies-for-hire company. Maybe they just aren't very competent.  Or maybe they were created specifically to come up with results like this, so they can push a specific agenda: [Barna Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Barna_Group#Overview) is an *evangelical* Christian polling company designed to provide "research and marketing expertise as a service to Christian ministry."            "Wire copy" used to mean something: AP, UPI, Reuters. This article is especially useful because it points to a particular fake news "wire service" as the root of the viral explosion. Other news coverage after the fact merely noted that the Mirror had retracted the story.      That's where 99% of the problem is, and that's why this bill is just grandstanding.   A reporter at the *Providence Journal* concisely summed up the cost of the takeover of most US daily newspapers by corporations during the last two decades in a comment in [this article about the recent sale of the last family-owned major daily to an investment group](http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/news/2015/06/11/dispatch-sale-heres-how-gatehouse-has-handled.html);  ... many reporters let go were veterans with deep institutional and community knowledge. They were replaced by younger, less-expensive writers, something that "gnaws at a lot of us in the newsroom ...  "Gnaws at us" likely means they can't stop thinking about the coverage they can't do any longer for lack of staff and funding: enterprise and investigative and science reporting, for starters.                  I can't believe I missed this. Must go adjust brain.   Don't ask. Seriously. Just be glad the annual temporary derangement caused by the end of high school classes hasn't spilled over into this reddit.   Since when are German Shepherds called cats?   OP, please post this to /r/Ohio for extra fun!    I've never even seen that meme.  This may be the first time anybody has ever admitted this on reddit. I'm sure it's true for others as well, but yours is a brave statement.   what was Hoot ?  Hoot was a [humor magazine](http://www.columbuslibrary.org/cmlcnix/searchresults.cfm?sort= afterdate= beforedate= searchlist=OSLIN%2C%20IRV%20%28%60HOOT%27%20MAGAZINE%29 searchindex=S pub=ALL) founded by local writer [Irv Oslin](https://irvoslin.wordpress.com/), who also wrote a weekly column full of epic snark for Columbus Guardian. After a hilarious but tragically failed run for Mayor of Columbus and the collapse of CG, he moved to Ashland and became a serious reporter.      Good points. A few more are detailed in this post about [**how to find a lost cat**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/199wf8/missing_kitty_in_the_arlington_center_w_henderson/c8m7lkp) from the Reddit Guide to Columbus in the sidebar.  OP, if you do find him, please come back and let us know!   I'm (always) speaking in terms of the basic infrastructure of reddit, without RES or gold. Also I subscribe to a hellacious number of reddits, so I see as much of the marginal stuff as I can find time to look at, without even trying.   Reading comprehension problems here beyond fixing.   A meeting with wine. (This is actually a long-running in-joke among fellow travelers.)   I'm not objecting to the amount of punishment, but the *kind*: do you want to live in a society where judges can tell reporters to write articles to the judge's specification?   Journalists are watching this to see what the news org will do, and what the editor will do. Both *should* refuse this sentence, but the editor in question is a widely-despised hack and will probably cave.   I have no idea what an appropriate conventional sentence would be. The guy violated a very clear court order, in an egregious manner. And this wasn't for any reason of high principle, just the reflexive race to get a scoop. What do you think?    Funny -- I go looking to check the zeitgeist on a regular basis, too, but usually by way of an intentional tour of my "friends" pages (submissions and comments) plus a big dose of serendipity via the random button. Together, it's like reading the best-edited magazine imaginable.   Doesn't this guy have any handlers?      Some people find it reassuring to know that what was once a slapped-together block party with radical politics has managed to survive for 43 years...  What would you like to see changed?     /r/all is a bigger shitpile then normal,  Why does anybody who understands how the site works even look at that page? I've always found that users who cite that can safely be assumed to be new and/or very young. Not surprisingly, it's Pao-hate central today.   This is so true. With very few exceptions, these are literally kids on summer break. [I had them pegged at 15](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/39fhtr/eli5_why_is_reddit_dying/cs2wnr3) rather than 17, but same principle applies: [school's out, and this is something to do](http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/39gj8x/eli5_why_are_people_getting_crazy_over_removed/cs35216).  The illusion that it's a bigger, more diverse, more serious crowd can be easily dispelled by a few minutes of reading the user histories of the redditors screaming the loudest. They talk about "reddit's front page" and mean /r/all ...   That's one of the best self-criticisms I've ever seen.   And as someone who used to carry around a tiny version of [this](https://img0.etsystatic.com/060/1/8030109/il_340x270.744115886_i75i.jpg), I have a significant basis of comparison w/r/t self-criticism ...      Okay, forget Jason Taylor -- at least for now. He did get hired by Gatehouse (New Media Investment Group), but for the foreseeable future he's mainly the [new publisher and president for the Las Vegas Review Journal.](http://www.thestreet.com/story/13184209/1/jason-taylor-named-president-and-publisher-of-las-vegas-review-journal-president-of-gatehouse-media-western-us-publishing-operations.html) Who knows whether Gatehouse thinks Columbus is part of their western region...   Thanks for this post, which is about 100% more informative than anything the Dispatch itself has published, and way more important than most of the posts here lately about any subject. Love or hate the Dispatch, it still has huge influence on the overall public understanding of what constitutes news in Columbus.  The graf below, describing what happened at the ProJo, succinctly describes the central issue with concentration of newspaper ownership into the hands of a few corporations that care more about the bottom line than the public good:  ...many reporters let go were veterans with deep institutional and community knowledge. They were replaced by younger, less-expensive writers, something that "gnaws at a lot of us in the newsroom...  "Gnaws at us" likely means they can't stop thinking about the coverage they can't do any longer for lack of staff and funding: enterprise and investigative and science reporting, for starters.  The guy they say will take over, Jason Taylor from Gannett, has most recently been running the Chattanooga Times Free Press and the Jackson (MS) Clarion-Ledger. Neither paper has suffered big staff cuts AFAIK, but I'm reserving judgment until I hear back from friends who work at those papers.   Lots of practice makes perfect!   My thoughts, exactly. This is *not* uplifting news.  Anybody who thinks you're too negative or over-reacting needs to know that this year, 2015, has been called the "crunch year" by climate scientists -- the last chance to even slow down the destruction of our home planet. In light of that, a "business decision" to slowly taper off production and use up the bad ingredient can be seen for what it is: the immoral acceptance of the amoral dictates of capitalism.    You say that like it's a bad thing. It's not!   Hey, at least he finally logged off for a while. I was starting to think that if he didn't get some sleep soon, we'd wind up reading about how his neighbors always thought he was a little off, but nobody imagined he would...    Loafs gonna loaf.   What does this even mean?   The way corporate owners control coverage is by *not* covering things that should be reported -- and there's no way for most reporters to effectively counter that. So they cover what they can, as ethically as they can, and so manage to at least feed their kids. The news industry has changed so much in the last 20 years that you could staff a hundred good news orgs with the reporters who have been fired for objecting to the new regime.  Be glad that there are still people trying to do it right.    Not exactly: it referred to [this](http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/jlbdf/2_am_ice_chili_shower/c2d2hcz).  [EDIT: It helps to see the context in which that 3 year old post was revived today.](http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/39g6ni/reddit_hasnt_seen_a_mass_exodus_like_this_since/)   Okay. I wondered if you were trying to play a cruel trick on readers who decided to wake 'n' bake before redditing. Glad to be wrong!   This is a serious answer: the people who are upset about this are very young and very wrong about what constitutes freedom of speech. School's out for the summer, and this is something to do.   Because he's a celebrity careerist with no firm understanding of left and right. He's been all over the map politically, so if you don't like his current position you can just wait a bit until he shifts again in pursuit of eyeballs.   Why is your friend letting that human steal his pizza?   In Canada. You put that in the headline elsewhere -- why not here?   ... and it MUST be a conspiracy by the admins!   The stupid, it burns.  You'd never know that it's possible to spend the whole day yesterday on reddit, having great conversations and reading interesting posts, without even hearing  about this "rebellion". Only people who think /r/all is the central forum on reddit are reporting on this as though it were anything other than the latest tantrum by middle-schoolers.     I did not give any advice. I pointed out the bloody obvious fact. What s/he does with it is up to her.   Could also be heat rash, skin fungus, whole list of other things.  SEE A VET before it gets worse.   Then the company you work FOR has agreed to let the company you (sometimes) work AT define the terms.   Adding, I am not a lawyer.   I'm unsure why this post has attracted no attention here -- it's an amazing story. Could it have been removed by mods because of my previous comment about the editor in question, Larry Henry? Well, just in case, here's [one tiny piece of his backstory](http://jimromenesko.com/2014/03/26/letter-arkansas-tv-newsman/) that only hints at why everybody who has ever worked for him thinks he's a hack (at best).   Do you work under a contract of any kind?   Don't tell Sarah Palin.   Someone who jumps from Sanders to Lessig never understood politics to begin with.  EDIT: ...and this someone created a brand new account just for this post, which seriously undercuts his claim to have ever been a Sanders supporter.       I am way off the mark  This. Reddit is not "a free speech initiative". It's a business. It's nowhere near dying. A lot of 15 year olds are bent out of shape because ... they're 15 years old.   It's entirely possible to spend an entire day (or night) on reddit right now without even knowing about this "scandal". I know about it because I subscribe to /r/announcements, but the other 50 or so subreddits I visit haven't even noticed the "uproar".  If you're bothering to read /r/all, stop. It's a piss-poor substitute for the combination of good subscriptions plus use of the "random" button. And SRD is a cesspool to be avoided at all costs.   [Just Pies](http://www.just-pies.com/) has one they call an apple crumb pie, using Jonathan and Northern Spy apples. If it's anything like the rest of their pies, it's very good.   Stop making sense. If you keep that up, you'll be banished to /r/panichistory.   OP, if you found it on /r/wtf, how did you manage to miss the exact explanation -- with links to an interview with the creator -- in [the first two comments?](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/39ar6t/whatever_this_is/cs2hpeu)   [Journalists still have ethics.](http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp) Corporate owners do not.   Oh, dear. My hotel tip is, if you don't already have a reservation by now, there may be a problem. This is peak season at one of the most heavily-visited vacation destinations in the world. It can take hours just to get past the South Rim front gate. So grab the first reservation you can get (forget about deals) and start out extremely early to drive there from Phoenix or wherever. Also, read the official park website from top to bottom -- you won't be sorry!    Are you planning to do any serious hiking (i.e., below the rim) or just visiting? Reading through responses to other posts here will give you a lot of answers, but for specific tips it would help to know what you plan to do there.   I meant the sentencing.      So whose ethics are more tortured by this judge: law, or journalism?      This mind-bending story gets even stranger when you know that the editor in question is one of the most widely despised hacks in the region.          What I said is that the main issue here *for you* is that you got beat to the punch on the main question.  You're embarrassing yourself, and we're done here (... unless you just can't handle the pressure of even this level of correction).   Unfortunately, the dog is already being monitored and  promoted by a rescue group, [Central Ohio Pit Savers](http://www.centralohiopitsavers.org/).   I hope someone is able to help this dog.   Reading comprehension. You need it.   I was right before you were, on the main question. That's what really started it. From your history, it's abundantly clear that you can't tolerate losing, or being challenged, or missing the point, or much of anything that disturbs your own image of yourself. Might want to deal with that before your  kid gets old enough to learn it from you.   As suspected: you're more interested in being right than in being civil.  As for being you because you supposedly think more than I do: no, thanks. I've seen what you call thinking.   Just Googled the tail number. Don't have any experience with small planes.   How ... how can you not realize that possibility?   Not everybody is you. Not everybody is even trying to be you.    I have no idea what would have caused it here.   The jet stream. Thanks, Canada!   Ozone and smog levels are reported to be normal.  That won't last. By tomorrow (Wed.) the Air Quality Index is expected to jump from 42 (good) to 87 (moderate) for two days, with the main pollutant being ozone; followed by three more days at the moderate level with the main pollutant being particulates.

Poor King. I like pibbles. I don't like trigger-happy neighbors. I really don't like the stupidity this incident will evoke on the subject of dangerous dogs *and* gun rights.  Is that enough to prime the discussion pump?       DO NOT give the kitten regular cow's milk -- it will cause diarrhea, which can be fatal in a kitten.  DO figure out how old the kitten is by checking this [age progression chart](http://www.alleycat.org/kittenprogression). If the kitten is very young, it will need feeding with special food every few hours, and may well need more care than you can handle.( Be honest with yourself about this, because leaving it alone for too long could kill it.) If you can handle it, read everything [on this page and the pages it links to.](http://www.alleycat.org/page.aspx?pid=289)  DO take kitty to a vet as soon as possible to check for diseases.  DO ask more questions as they come up!   You know you can buy clear duct tape, right? We have five cats, so we use a lot of it.   American Pharoah is a racehorse which just won the Triple Crown, the most prestigious award in horseracing. Newspapers are collections of reports about important things, like this, that you can read every day. You should try it.     Inside 270, if you're not living in a dodgy area, then you're living next to one.  That will be news to many thousands of people.   [This should help.](http://i.imgur.com/bW3thR2.jpg)      The video raises a lot of questions, some of which are answered [in this news coverage](http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2015/06/06/cincinnati-man-wants-to-build-community-center/28526585/).   But OP, be careful here: you can look into the GoFundMe campaign, but don't start doxxing other redditors or this post will be removed and you will be banned.    This is why paying some minimal amount of attention to actual news reporting is a good idea.   Sorry: too high a price to pay for safety.  Do you really live like that?   Just when I think I've seen every animal-related reddit in existence ... But this one needs more posts. C'mon /r/law, make your furfriends famous!     I love it: Black and white together for Bernie!   Don't worry: it's always the odd-looking kittens with spikey hair and big ears who grow into the most gorgeous cats. I have a couple that couldn't find homes for this reason, and now they're stunning. One kitten I did manage to give away despite being the strangest looking baby suddenly bloomed at about 12 weeks into a cover girl.  Anyway, your kitten is fine just as she is. What is her name?      It's owned by a realty company -- [here's the registration info](http://flightaware.com/resources/registration/N35HM). No idea what that thing on top is.  EDIT: no longer owned by a realty company -- they sold it to an anesthesiologist last week (see last line on linked page). So maybe the takeoffs and landings were just a new owner playing with a new toy.    How much do you like your GF?  Seriously, what makes you think you *have to* participate in this discussion? Sometimes the best thing to do is bite your tongue and hope your silence is noted by the saner people in the room.   But...but...where is his entourage?!?   You know there are [a lot of other redditors on this path,](http://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/wiki/links) right? It's not a substitute for getting outdoors and face-to-face, but it's a good resource. And helping others can help you, too!       Hedges and others are smart enough to recognize that if there isn't a peaceful revolution there will be violent chaos.  But not apparently smart enough to take the lesson that a "revolutionary moment" is when the people's resistance has the capacity to manage the earthquake of global economic disaster, not just when old systems and structures are failing. That term has a specific meaning, and this isn't it.   To only point  to the objective conditions without assessing the subjective factor -- organized strategic resistance -- is to raise false hopes of a shortcut that doesn't require the tedium of base-building. If those false hopes lead self-declared revolutionaries to assume there's a mass movement at their backs when there isn't one, the result will be worse than ugly.        If you're really poor you probably get a lot of subsidies   I'll muster more charity than I feel to say that I hope you never have to find out *first hand* how absurd your assumption here really is.   Think about what it will sound like to try to call the kitty by its name if it wanders away. Neither of those names roll easily off the tongue. (My brother insists there's an International Cat Naming Convention which requires all cat names to end in an "ee" sound for this reason. But what does he know? He only has 11 cats.)  How about Inky?   Yeah ... no. There's a reason why the leaders of the New Left summed up the main error of 60s and 70s as having believed *that* was "a revolutionary moment". Until there is a unified movement capable of both strategic planning and logistical resilience, the only thing going on here is temptation to take shortcuts.  There is a real danger in this moment from the agitators on the left and the right who wrongly think that it's enough to "bring chaos", after which everything will sort itself out. Such a scenario would default to the right, but probably not the way some of them assume. Preventing that is probably the most urgent task; leading a revolution is rather more than the left can do, especially in the US.      This is an Attention Getting Mechanism, as my mother used to say. You cat wants you to come to her, and play with her, more often.   Handwriting -- specifically, signatures -- plus the lag in equipment upgrades due to budget restrictions in government offices probably accounts for a lot of it.    Yes, she did, and it was awesome. I am not a Hillary fan, but this is an excellent development. I hope it can be seen, even by Sanders supporters, for the great step it is.   Google can answer this in two seconds.   I'm getting an "access forbidden" message from all of those links.   Basil appears to be a dilute calico, which means the kitten would most likely be female ... yes?   Thanks for the reply!

I haven't watched the whole thing yet, but right away you can see the type of seats my friend and I got -- right at field level, behind a low railing -- and even see another girl get the same treatment my friend got. I can't wait to see if we're in this film!  Adding, I can already see it includes ["the fifth Beatle", radio DJ Murray the K](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_the_K#.22The_Fifth_Beatle.22), whose "Swingin' Soiree" show on WINS in New York was the soundtrack we listened to every night on [first-generation transistor radios](http://www.mcrfb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/1963-Teen-Girl-Listening-to-Transistor-Radio.jpg) when our parents thought we were studying or sleeping. Murray the K was referred to by some parents (not mine) as "Moral Decay", and blamed for fanning the flames of Beatlemania. The idea that the Beatles' music was just that good was lost on a lot of older folks then.   Fortunately, my parents knew enough about music to appreciate both the roots and the innovation that made the band sound so new. My mother even bought herself a four-inch diameter button to wear that said "I love Ringo!", and although they didn't attend, they bought me and my brother tickets and drove us to Shea. It was an unforgettable gift.      [Angola prison is so infamous](http://www.southernstudies.org/2014/03/institute-index-a-brief-history-of-the-hell-that-i.html) that most American readers -- especially in /r/law -- think of it before they think of the nation.   *Nobody* could hear anything, including the Beatles themselves (they didn't have the same kind of sound system as today). I think there are documentaries that show how loud and crazy the scene was.   Blame? For what?   It seemed like mere minutes. We couldn't believe it when they ran off the field. [Looking it up now](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles%27_1965_US_tour#The_Shea_Stadium_show), I see that the Beatles' set was 30 minutes long. I also see that there were five other acts, which I assume we heard but ignored.  BTW, the classmate I went with climbed over the railing in front of us to try to storm the stage (we had GREAT seats), but was grabbed and pushed back onto her seat by stadium security. I don't think she even paused in her screaming.   [Must-read reactions to Cruz's apology.](https://www.facebook.com/tedcruzpage/posts/10153346155467464)    [Must-read reactions to Cruz's apology.](https://www.facebook.com/tedcruzpage/posts/10153346155467464)   I was there that day at Shea Stadium, and can tell you that (a) I spent the whole time screaming my head off, and (b) I never expected to do that until it happened. I was there *for the music* -- I'd had an excellent musical education and knew just how talented these musicians really were -- but once there I got caught up in the mass hysteria. As soon as it was over I was stunned and annoyed to realize that we hadn't been able to hear a single note.        I'm saving this image to use for reaction comments.    ... the result will be a slow and sometimes halting march towards a better country.  During which the political, legal and social space is maintained and expanded that allows for organizing a movement to get all that done faster. "Revolutionaries" who disdain reform work are just getting in their own way.     Don't worry: I'm a dedicated [First World Conformist](http://www.reddit.com/r/FirstWorldConformists/).   You forgot the /s .   *Columbus Guardian* was a better paper, for the short time it existed. It had serious reporters, serious attitude and Irv Oslin, FFS.   Even *Alive!* was a better paper than *TOP* until *Alive!* stopped covering local news in 1988. Hell, even *Hoot!* was a better paper than TOP, whose business model boiled down to pissing people off to guarantee newsstand pick-up greater than the skin ads alone brought in.  And the FreePress has been squatting space that should be taken by something better grounded ever since it went cuckoo for chemtrails. The Black Box voting obsession didn't help their credibility -- or that of saner organizations that affiliate with them for lack of any other general purpose progressive outlet.  Anyway, I don't see *The Dispatch* coverage changing much. The news hole is so small already that it *can't* change much, and they don't need to feed readers' inevitable resentment against the interlopers even one minute sooner than absolutely necessary. I'm guessing the new owners will tweak the peripheral businesses before they change the flagship publication, drawing out the advantage of reflexive reader loyalty to the familiar format while they study the market up close.    Ah, I misread your description of reality for a declaration of principle. Sorry!     Um, no. I had the unnerving experience in the mid-90s of interviewing a national figure in the WS/"patriot" movement *at his home*. He had mirrors mounted on the ceiling to see around corners, several attack-trained Dobermans, a bio-war laboratory in his kitchen -- and a single bookshelf with about 10 editions of the Geneva Bible and nothing else. It was the only printed material in sight. That kinda put me off the book.

Apparently, this guy thinks such coverage is what they call "earned media".        Civility is *everything* in an anonymous online forum. This is where we get to make up our own rules, which are based on what we want to get out of the experience.   Reddit allows for thousands of places where users can be brutal to each other if they want. But this is the subreddit that represents Columbus to the world, and it *can* be the kind of ideal neighborhood almost nobody ever gets to live in IRL: respectful of others' choices, supportive of others' needs, irreverent enough to laugh at ourselves, passionate about the future of our common homeplace.  Civility until unjustly attacked is a pretty good standard.       That's not a personal attack. She's a pretty shitty poster. Everything she posts is either uninteresting, self-promotional or has been posted a dozen times before.  Are you listening to yourself? Of course that's a personal attack. If one user's posts are so annoying that you're willing to go round up 18 citations to her posts -- four of those from other subreddits, and three of *those* from another state -- it's well beyond a discussion of why people in this subreddit, in general, seem to downvote everything, from anybody.  If you want to critique a certain style of using reddit, fine. I'd probably agree with you about this style -- not because there are a lot of similar pleas for help that could/should be found independently through simple searches, but because there aren't any posts contributing important local information or art or opportunities. It's a very selfish way to approach a public forum, let alone a community. I thinks it is a style deserves criticism, because if it becomes the norm it undercuts the usefulness, never mind the enjoyability, of the forum.  *[donewaiting.com, I'm looking at you.]*  Anyway: did you notice that I did not actually name the annoying poster in the comments above? That's giving the offender room to gracefully absorb the criticism and decide to change, without making their entire existence the issue and the target for the everybody who wanders by.  I wrote long here for the same reason you went out and researched those posts: both of us want a better /r/Columbus. We might not agree on what that means, but could we please agree to try to minimize targeting individuals this way?     It's not about karma. It's about being minimally civil.   And that's not coming from a position of cultural prudery: I'm a connoisseur of snark, and it pains me to see the low-effort, sloppily targeted crap that passes for criticism here. Politicians and major public figures, not other redditors, are the ones who deserve well-honed pointed comments.   She didn't ask "why are people downvoting me?". She's asking about a much broader dynamic, but you turned it into a personal attack.  Adding, the use of the term "shitpost" is a remarkably reliable indicator of a user who regards reddit as a competition among individuals rather than a forum for discussion, never mind community-building.  /r/Columbus could be so much better than it is if most of its subscribers were not intimidated out of posting. Why not put some energy into figuring out how to make that happen instead of constantly complaining?   That's why this question is so important. The endless downvoting of things that aren't necessarily wrong but merely reflect a different taste or opinion is a way to marginalize minority opinions and prevent participation.  Newsflash, downvote trolls:  [**Other cultures are not failed attempts at being you.**](https://www.syracuseculturalworkers.com/sites/default/files/styles/product_detail/public/images/products/cards/t948other-culture_0.jpg?itok=eMnqLAbn)   Personal attacks are uncalled for.   So these are the kind of advertisers supporting "Joe For America" -- an email list I never asked to be on and can't seem to dump. The latest mailing pitches this product, 9 mm push pins and the Geneva Bible, the guidebook for Dominionists and Reconstructionists. I thought the combination was, um, *interesting*.         If you remember that with such vivid (and appropriate) bitterness, you probably also remember the brief, golden moment when Columbus readers benefited from the competition between *three* weekly alternative papers -- Alive! and Columbus Guardian being the others.  And as for bad moments in journalism: the out-of-state owners of Columbus Guardian *pulped the archives* on their way out of town, which is why many here may not remember that award-winning paper. That move was especially galling because it came on the heels of learning that those publishers, who had lured experienced reporters here from much bigger papers on the promise that they'd be on the cutting edge of the move to digital, had never bothered to digitize the archives. All that lofty talk about reclaiming serious journalism, and it turned out they were all about the widgets.   More relevant than that is the fact that, until today, The Dispatch was the largest family-owned daily newspaper in the US. The  two-decade trend toward concentration of ownership of print news by conglomerates that prioritize profit over civic education is now complete.  In other words, it's a wrap. The beancounters won.    That's [New Media *Investment Group*](http://www.newmediainv.com/section/about) to you, buddy.   These beancounters wouldn't know journalism if it bit them on the ass.   One irony here is that 20 years ago, when concentration of ownership in print media was just starting to decimate the ranks of working reporters, journalists around the country were telling each other that family-owned papers, of which The Dispatch was the prime example, were the last hope for serious news reporting. Then it turned out that such papers had to compete in the same economy as those owned by soulless conglomerates with no commitment to traditional journalistic principles. That should have been predictable, but our hope was fed by desperation.             I love La Chatelaine, but from the description of his kids' ages and preferences, I'm imagining a chorus of "Eew, Dad, there's *spinach* in my eggs!"  OTOH, chocolate croissants.

What's happening in your state's Bernie subreddit? In mine, a guy I never heard of before (and I've been a political activist here for a looooong time) has already set up meetings in three cities, just by online networking.    the answer is of course no.  The answer is "not yet". Somebody needs to take responsibility in every town and city to start a local campaign, and that involves ordering, prepaying for, and distributing/re-selling these at cost. Why wait to start that? If this campaign isn't about grassroots organizing, it's nothing.   Flat rate shipping is $15. Your problem here is not that you're too poor to buy from the official store, but that you're not ordering enough stuff. Can you find others in your area to put together a larger order? Maybe some local group would like to start distributing these, and you all could put together the front money for a whole pack of these items. Sooner or later *somebody* will do this in your area -- why not you, now?   Not for official merch that supports the campaign ...   No, sorry.

If you can articulate what you mean, and apologize for name calling, we might have something to talk about.

 A lot more boring than a kinetic burglary.   Towards the ground yes   Purifying selection and genetic drift.   Shia Labeof   Recall that a sinusoid is the locus of a point on a circle as it rotates across the ground.   Seriously. They should pontificate about philosophy or something actually interesting.   Except Steven!   Reddit.   It depends. Which is to say, you should ask someone who knows your program.   1) Less difficult than... what? Probably not.  2) No, because decisions would be made by Feb-March for most programs.    Are you sure that she isn't white and gold?  Dress.   Okay. Well, genetically speaking, that simply isn't true. Phenotypically, it's just superficially a consequence of the fact that humans have a huge global range so we've adapted to many different environments from the hottest to coldest climates on earth, so we've quickly evolved a wide variety of phenotypes. Also, because we're humans, our brains are in part designed to recognize differences between humans especially well (people with face blindness lack this ability). We're a lot more sensitive to differences among human beings.   To make my statement more precise, the level of differentiation between human populations (as measured by Fst) is only around .1-.15, while certain species of deer and great apes have much higher population differentiation.  I don't know what you mean by "more variety in more factors". Edit: Another reference, http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.397.4618 rep=rep1 type=pdf By analysis of molecular variance, almost all of the variation in humans is *within* races, with only about 4.3% between "races"--in contrast, chimpanzee races account for over 30% of molecular variation.   Yes, biologists and anthropologists commonly agree that race is a social construct. I would base on this on a few main observations: While genetically speaking there is actual subpopulations within genetic data, they do not necessarily map well to racial groupings. For example, African-Americans can range anywhere between very little actual African ancestry to almost entirely African ancestry, yet we don't consider African-Americans with less than 50% African ancestry and more than 50% European ancestry to be European. Instead, the social construct of the African-American race is based on superficial phenotypic observations that overrule the genetic evidence, despite the biological reality that most of these phenotypes exist as gradients, and despite the association of a dark skin phenotype with Africans even though Africans actually exhibit a wide-range of skin colors while non-Africans such as Indians and Australian Aborigines also exhibit dark skin phenotypes. Hispanics are similarly socially constructed. Admixed individuals are almost invariably associated with their minority or marginalized ancestry. Also, from a genetic standpoint, the amount of genetic variation within "races" is much more than between races; since Africa is the birth place of humanity, almost all the genetic variation that exists in human beings is a subset of African genetic variation. Human beings are actually a very homogenous species; deer and chimpanzees, for example, are more genetically distinct from each other than any random two human beings. Lastly, conceptions of race differ from place to place, and depends not only on phenotype (which are only superficial representations of biological differences) but also language, culture, religion, ethnicity, politics, and nationality, which are not biological-based at all. For example, Taiwanese may consider themselves racially differently from Mainland Chinese, despite being genetically very similar, while Ainu Japanese may want to for political reasons construe themselves as not a separate race from other Japanese peoples; while in America, we just say they're all Asian. None of these distinctions are motivated by biology.   Every one of your ancestors had at least one child who grew up to have their own children. Think about that for a sec, every single one of your countless ancestors was reproductively successful. Your question is equivalent to asking why your ancestors were so reproductively successful despite the fact that a lot of individuals don't have children who survive to have their own children. The organisms we see today are good at surviving (i.e. existing) because if they weren't, they wouldn't survive (i.e. exist), by definition.   Well, she does have future vision.

To quote Connie from the episode Open Book:   "So, what did you think of the ending? I thought it was a disaster. All the books leading up to this seemed to be taking on and subverting these 'witch' tropes, really self-aware about being a pastiche, you know. But in the end, none of that even mattered.

Stevenbomb 3: Mall Cop   But everyone getting new costumes is indicative of a metaphorical transition to a new phase with Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl Jam album that is the best album of the 1960s era of post-modern rock-jazz afterbirth.   http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686939 is a good starting point, and has some good references, and also this review by Marcus Feldman and Kevin Laland on gene-culture coevolutionary theory: http://lalandlab.st-andrews.ac.uk/niche/pdf/Publication24.pdf. Look into the work of Robert Boyd and Peter Richerson on cultural evolution and their dual inheritance theory, and also Cavalli-Sforza and Marcus Feldman on gene-culture coevolutionary theory and the evolution of language. Also, the book "The Story of the Human Body" by Daniel Lieberman has some comments on how culture has affected our evolution (e.g. lactose tolerance) and our modern heath.   But actually, both shows can be viewed as deconstructions of the magical girl genre, so yes they have some similarities.      Pearl projecting her insecurities about being needed onto Garnet again.   Pearl projecting her insecurities about being needed onto Garnet again.   That was a great line.   That was a great line.   ...so I can drive it into your love's heart.   Pearl literally compared her self to a sheath. That's pretty flipping Freudian.   Meh, don't lose your head over this.   6/24/15: Steven Universe cancelled.   It was Amethyst's favorite before Greg came along.   Yes, that's why Toph fell off.   Like a pachyderm.   But who's the sheath? Pearl again?   She's... she's got a big pointy bird nose.   Yes, she's acutely aware.   Damn it Lapis, did she take all the water into the sky again?   I just like giant hands with hands as fingers.   Welp, now there's no context.   Don't mess with their funky flow.   I felt the same about the last episode. I have a hand and feet fetish.   I disagree that it takes itself seriously, but I agree that it isn't groundbreaking--in fact, the reason I like it is because I feel like it *recaptures* a lot of what of older cartoons did well. To me it *feels* like a 90s cartoon updated for the 2010s; it could have easily existed 15 years ago. It's humor existed in Nick and CN of the 90s, while it's serialized nature existed in more teen-oriented action cartoons of the same era. In contrast, I feel Steven Universe is a show that could only exist today; it *is* groundbreakingly modern in many respects with its themes and how it advances characters and structures plot eschewing common cartoon storytelling tropes while parodying others, (while also being a homage to 80s and 90s magical girl anime, which may be why it feels *different* from the western cartoon tradition*). Gravity Falls feels like a reboot of the best of the 90s; Steven Universe is the exemplar of the post-Adventure Time and ATLA/Korra era of cartoons.  Edit: *Now that I think about it, Steven Universe does have some (in my opinion anyways) similarities to shows like Power Puff Girls, Danny Phantom, As Told by Ginger, My Life as a Teenage Robot, Foster's Home era of cartoons.   90s were way better little man.   Same, episode 1 did nothing for me until I revisited it later. Episode 2 was when we really got an idea of the *heart* of the show and the feeling that this show is gonna be different from other shows: we get Greg's relationship with Steven, the first hints of Rose Quartz in terms of her relationship to the characters on the show, a fight that was (unlike Cookie Cat) really showed that the show isn't another monster-of-the-week show, and it does so by the juxtaposition with one of the better songs which happens to a *love* song. The moment that got me was the wonderful animation of the oscillating telephone lines under the influence of the Red Eye's gravity as Let Me Drive My Van is playing and that *lighting and color pallette*. Sucker for smooth animation.   The most recent *genetics* paper I could find on this question suggests that we have been monogamous with mild polygynous tendencies for a long time and so most likely HG's were also. From Labuda et al. 2010:   Was polygyny1 (excess of breeding women) present among hominid lineages? If both women and men equally contribute to subsequent generations, then the breeding ratio, , is 1. Under skewed breeding ratio or polygamy, female-to-male meiotic contributions differ and lead to differences in the effective (breeding) population sizes, Nef and Nem, such that Nef/Nem =   1. Such differences can be inferred by studying the uniparentally transmitted markers that are independently affected by Nef and Nem. For example, a study of Y chromosome diversity 2 proposed a shift from polygyny to monogamy in the recent history of modern humans. Differences in Nef and Nem also affect effective population sizes of the X chromosome and of the autosomes, NeX and NeA, respectively. Because men carry only one X chromosome and women carry two, the ratio NeX/NeA changes as a function of  ( Figure 1). In turn, changes in NeX/NeA affect the extent of genetic drift and the relative genetic diversities of these two chromosomal systems. Therefore, comparative analyses of genetic diversity and of the extent of genetic drift between the autosomes and the X chromosome can be used to reveal differences in demographic histories, migration, and breeding patterns of females and males. Two recent analyses yielded equivocal estimates of the breeding ratio in human populations. One study suggested that polygyny (  1) was common in Africa and was further increased in non-African populations; 3 whereas another claimed the oppositethat there were more breeding men than women during the out-of-Africa migration, leading to greater than expected differentiation of the X chromosome genetic diversity among continental populations. 4 These conflicting results were attributed to the confounding effects of natural selection and demography differently affecting DNA segments and/or samples examined by the two studies or to a bias in the choice of the data set analyzed or the choice of outgroup species for calibration of evolutionary rates. 5 As we show here, there is an inherent difficulty in evaluating the breeding ratio from the genetic (mutational) diversity of the autosomes and the X chromosome, because these diversities are a complex function of both the breeding ratio and the difference in the male and female meiotic mutation rate. 6, 7 and 8 Using, toward this end, uniparentally transmitted markers can circumvent this difficulty, but it requires assumption of neutrality, and this is questionable. 9 We propose a different approach, which evaluates  on the basis of the observed differences in the population recombination rate, , of the autosomes and the X chromosome. This approach appears robust to different confounding factors. We avoid potential biases due to the choice of DNA segments, 5 because entire chromosomes are used to estimate . Because there is no need to consider different rates of mutation in male and female meioses, 7 our method does not require the choice of an outgroup species to correct for differences in these mutation rates. 3 and 4 This is important, because over long evolutionary periods separating primate lineages, both  and the male-to-female mutation rate ratio are expected to vary. Finally, we also rewrite Miyata's 7 equations to include the effect of . *Our study of HapMap populations reveals that in the history of the modern human, the average  was greater than 1 and less than 2, in agreement with conclusions of social anthropologists and paleontologists describing our species as monogamous with polygynous tendencies.*   Pretty basic knowledge there.   Reminds me of myspace.   Amerigay.   Alien space rock band silhouette.   No, we've seen Centipeedle's "form" in the light when she reformed. It's clear that the forced fused gem shards had 4 separate beings when it was forming.   1) Peridot was no where near Malachite, she should have no knowledge of what happened.  2) It's simple to de-fuse. Pearl and Amethyst have spontaneously de-fused more than once. Last time we saw Malachite, she was de-syncing. They're not "stuck" in any sense.  3) Peridot has no reason to care about Malachite. It doesn't fit any of her objectives.  4) It's been clear from the beginning that Peridot's objective is to "continue where they left off". It's also clear that "fusion experiments" makes the most sense in context with Garnet's reaction.    and that networks like Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon base their criteria for shows based on educational content. That's the premise of any good cartoon.   That's a ridiculous premise. CN and Nick exist to make money, which they do by making shows that are popular to watch. No where in that suggests that these shows need to educate kids in anyway. Sure, educational shows can be used as a selling point to parents (Nick Jr., or shows like Wild Thornberries) and sure the above doesn't apply to publicaly funded PBSKids. In no way is education the primary reason for creating shows like Invader Zim or Cat Dog or Ed Edd and Eddy. You're right that these shows are marketed by networks for children, and thus are bound by restrictions of what seem appropriate for children. However both networks and show creators, because they are in fact adults, have always tried to push the envelope on what they can do on their shows, resulting in shows with adult inneundos, socially progressive themes, and subtly complex plots and character development. Restrictions motivate creative exploration. IMO, shows like Steven Universe deal with portrayals of non-traditional families, sexual exploration, and LGBT with far more maturity than standard adult fare like Game of Thrones.   Conversely, Steven Universe (like every cartoon) is made by adults.   But why. Why would you shampoo mangos Steven?   Especially to your sister.   Fair enough.   Was being facetious.   Fair enough, kinda, except that's a really low bar to not be called filler. At that point, "filler" basically only applies to non-cannon eps.   What you're saying doesn't disprove my point either, since I'm addressing what I quoted you said, not what you said you meant to say in your comment posted after my post.    And this Steven Bomb isn't special. No episodes were moved around so that these could air in order, they're simply the five episodes that would have aired had the hiatus not happened.  My objection to this is the new intro, which was timed right after Amethyst's form change, and the release of the book.   Er, did we not already know how they feel? It was pretty much exactly what we expected of them at this point.   Exactly. This episode was *just* fine.   Don't panic. Bring a towel.   Hakarl.   No, because Aang has already come of age.   ...la kill?   It's a reference to the real-world book "How to Win Friends and Influence People", a best-seller by Dale Carnegie.

Better than when Toph grew that sixth finger.   It's kinda like sucking on a pacifier.   Really only 13 hours and 15 minutes after rewatching the previous episodes from the week.   Really only 23 hours and 45 minutes.   This. This is why you don't take Steven's gem out of his belly button.   I can't believe Connie was Amon *this whole time*.   Ensmallment surgery, you mean.   mediocre.    I ignored the example because the Hymenoptera are haplo-diplo, and I buy that as a good reason for eusociality.  Hamilton's haplodiploidy hypothesis for eusociality is not widely believed by evolutionary and sociobiologists, and has been since the 70s and 80s. See papers mentioned in review by Queller and Strassmann 1998, quoted here:   However, many now think that despite its early promise, the haplo- diploid hypothesis has not aged particularly well (Evans 1977, Anders- son 1984, Strassmann and Queller 1989, Alexander et al. 1991, Seger 1991). The haplodiploid advantage turns out not to be so simple. Be- cause the high relatedness to sisters (r = 0.75) is balanced by low related- ness to brothers (r = 0.25), workers gain by rearing siblings instead of offspring only if workers lay the male eggs or if workers can concentrate on raising sisters while males are produced by solitary females (Trivers and Hare 1976, Seger 1983, Grafen 1986, Godfray and Grafen 1988). These conditions often do not apply, at least in contemporary species. Moreover, relatedness among fe- males is often well below the full- sister value of 0.75, due to multiple egg layers or multiple mates (Crozier and Pamilo 1996).  Alternative explanations based on monogamy, inbreeding (both inclusive fitness explanations), and fortress defense have proved more promising. It also doesn't explain why sweat bees exhibit both solitary and eusocial populations.   but I don't think we see the gradient of sociality in termites  Sure, but that's in extant termite species, which says nothing about extinct related lineages.   And even if we do, we still have to somehow explain thousands to hundreds of thousands of reproductively dead individuals in the eusocial termites who for some reason naver cheat. I don't think even inclusive fitness can save that one.  Relatedness is high due to monogamy in termites (Boomsma 2009). Lowered relatedness correlates with higher mortality in termites (Hartke and Rosengaus 2013).   ...which has evolved more than once. There's also a gradient of social forms, from solitary, to communal, to quasisocial, to eusocial. And you've ignored my example, where there are species of sweat bees where different populations within the same species can be either solitary or eusocial. That is, variation from solitary to eusociality can be exhibited at *sub-species* levels.   Kind of? Long-term evolution only happens through genotype. But the way genotype evolve due to natural selection is due to fitness, which is fundamentally an interaction between phenotype and environment. Epigenetics changes the relationship between genotype and phenotype. Epigenetic changes are also known to hereditary, albeit only for a few generations. So epigenetic changes are evolutionary changes only in the indirect sense that affects how genotypes evolve.   Microevolution (i.e. population genetics) deals with processes and patterns of evolution at the population level, i.e. sub-species level. Macroevolution deals with processes and patterns of evolution at the level of species and higher. For the most part, the only difference is a matter of scale. The fundamental processes of microevolution (i.e. selection, drift, migration, and mutations/recombination) also affect macroevolution, though macroevolution also deals with many processes that aren't usually within the purview of microevolution, including polyploidy, gene duplication, retroviruses, mechanisms of reproductive isolation, species-species interactions, niche construction, ontogeny, allopatry, hybridization, etc., though there is a lot of overlap.   Eusociality is not *that* giant of a thing. There are species of sweat bees where populations can be either solitary or eusocial depending on their location *within the same species*. Also, your use of "macroevolution" is not the way evo biologists use it, which is simply to describe any evolutionary changes at the level of species and higher.   Except that microevolution and macroevolution are terms used by evolutionary biologists to distinguish between two different scale of phenomena. Look at almost any evolutionary biologist's lab page who works primarily on speciation mechanisms vs any evolutionary biologist who works primarily on population genetics, and you'll likely see the terms "macroevolution" and "microevolution". The distinction wasn't created by religious nuts, it was appropriated from the scientific community and twisted to promote an agenda contrary to what it was originally intended.   Natural selection is the process by which populations gain information about their environment, that is, it transfer information about the environment into stored information in the form of population genetic data. Citations: Adami et al. 2000, Frank 2008.   Well, for example, when the sky is cloudy, you can't use telescopes to study the stars, for the obvious reason that clouds are blocking them. However, the stars in the water are not blocked, so even when it's cloudy, we can study them with our high powered telescopes. The other reason is that telescopes on land tend to rust due to the rain.   You should go to bed. Good night sweet prince.    However, for a trait to become common among a species it has to have some kind of advantage in terms of reproduction and survival.  This is false. Drift (stochastic effects) can, with some small but nonzero probability, increase the frequency of neutral and even deleterious variants to fixation in the population. As the other poster mentioned, modern medicine removes the selective effects of what would otherwise be deleterious or beneficial variants, and there are a lot more ways to be deleterious than beneficial.   It's really exciting cutting edge research. Few have ever studied the stars underneath the ocean before.   Well none of them die between now and then.  Yes.   You know how when the water is very clear and you can see the stars in the water? We study those with high powered telescopes placed under the water.  	109
 Oh okay. Thanks!   So why are they making two lines of browsers?   BMW is selling 35k 5-Series only in Germany and a lot more in the US/China. Do you think their 1 Million Cars per Year are only the 3-Series?    The fucking crops.. Are you serious?

 SF would be where I'm cooking all this wonderful food...   Well kick ass, thanks.   This.   I'm a convert. More green than red, but I'll use some red from time to time.   That is one of the greatest things I've seen today.     I'm neither from Texas or the South.  I like good 'q.   this is what you do with eye of round IMO...  http://i.imgur.com/g6GFnN4.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/g6GFnN4.jpg      That is the beauty.  Forced fan circulation, temp dial on top.  The only thing mine lacks is a timer.  I opted to not buy the one with the built in timer ($50 extra?  more?) and picked up an appliance timer from the hardware store for $10.  The only thing I've noticed, when run at 150 or at the max of 160, the things closer to the heating element do dry faster and you need to pay attention.  But at 140 or lower?  No need to touch it.  Maybe need to leave a rack out of a batch in for an extra hour due to how it was cut.  But if you slice it the same thickness, you're golden.  The only complaint I have is cleaning the racks.  They are somewhat of a pain, but that is the only drawback IMO.   I can't rave enough about my box man.  I've cranked so much out of it you'd shake your head.  I typically get 2-3# for each round and takes about 8-10hrs to do a batch.  If I set myself up correctly, I can get my total hands on time per pound of jerky down to about 10 minutes.  I hear you on the liquid smoke.  Here's a trick that you might find suitable.  Smoke your salt and/or your other dry spice.  You can control how much and what you put in at that point. If you already have smoking capacity, there is almost always room left over in the chamber for a pan of salt.   The dried melon was a fluke.  Had a melon that was going to go bad and I don't have a juicer. Figured what the hell, why not.  I hated it.  Turned out that dehydrated melon ground fine and mixed in with castor sugar makes for a nice homemade "dye" however.  Same with buttercream.  But you have to use a lot and then mask/alter the flavor.  However. The spoiled pups they are got their paws on some and loved it.  It's a good and healthy balance for them with the jerky I figure, and they love it.  Dried plantain chips too.  Boxed cookies or bagged treats are a rare and extra special treat for them.  I make most all their snacks.   eye of round.   Hey!  I just made up a batch of jerky yesterday.  Check the thread.  If you're looking for the best bang for your buck in regards to making jerky and have it be a "set it and forget it" operation, I got the ticket for ya...  http://www.reddit.com/r/Charcuterie/comments/2xbcqv/some_days_you_just_make_jerky/   I'm looking for homemade or regional specific.  I didn't grow the chile, but it's local. I roasted, dried, ground, and then mixed it all.    Now you're in Chicago.  Which means that you have some kick ass relish and all that.  I've visited. Problem is glass and shipping.  Gotta survive a week in the hands of USPS...   http://www.amazon.com/Flash-Pan-Death-American-Restaurant/dp/1439193770   http://i.imgur.com/JW7ndtt.jpg?1  WTF imgur?  why is that shit sideways?   I have an excalibur box as well.  I love it.  I run it at 145.  Jerky is sliced about 1/4" thick.  After the first time using it, I loved it so much I bought another one.  I just looked at it at, but there is no model# on the top.  Standard home use box, but NSF grade.  9 shelf.  Cost like $400 or 500 about 5 years ago?  I know they've dropped in price.  Great investment.  Fucking great investment.  I use it to proof bread and yeast dough.  Dogs love dried melon.  For anyone serious about cooking at home, this box is right up there with a Kitchen Aid Mixer and the Cuisinart Food Processor for being the dollar for dollar workhorse that you'll swear by for the rest of your life.  It ain't cheap, but worth every penny.  If you don't have a mandolin, my suggestion to maximize your use of that box.  That and crystallized citric acid to make water baths with.  For apples and other things you can dip in water to prevent oxi from happening.  http://www.amazon.com/Oneida-Polished-Mandolin-Interchangable-Slicer/dp/B0009HHZ20/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1425058060 sr=8-1 keywords=oneida+mandoline   I do realize that there might be a "redditgifts" for things like this.  However, after a not very cool experience trying to participate in a couple of gift exchanges, fuck that noise.  And I might be biting myself in the ass trying to trust the internet again...    Who would like to swap hometown/local boxes of goodness?  I'm specifically looking for someone to send me some New England maple sugar.  None of that Canadian crap.  WE ALL KNOW WHO HAS THE SUPERIOR TREES!  Below is a box I'm sending out to a fellow redditor, per my offer.  If anyone else out there is willing to put together a box of similar awesome, I'd love to do some trading.  Amazon is great.  So is the grocery.  However, I know there are a lot of people out there making shelf stable, kick ass things which can be thrown in a flat rate box.  Any takers?       contents  - Roasted Autumn Hatch Green Chile (med.) taco seasoning mix   - Smoked Chimayo Red (med.) taco seasoning mix  - Ground Sandia Red Chile (mild)  - Pinion smoked salt  - Hatch Green, ground (med.)  - Hatch Red, ground (very hot)  - Hatch Crushed Red with extra seed (very hot)  http://i.imgur.com/JW7ndtt.jpg?1  PS Canadians.  We love you.  But you have a Maple Syrup Cartel.  And international shipping is expensive ;)   Delicious.   I've got access to high desert Pinion honey and Green Chile Honey!   No. I just hit bammer patches last year. I still have about a gallon and a half of dried lobsters too...   Jerky ain't fancy and it's easy if you have basics - cookie cooling racks, sheet pans, oven.  A dehydrator is better of course.  Simple jerky you just let sit over night in the goodness and then pan it up over night before you go to bed.  Turn the oven on the lowest setting and crack the door.  You'll have to play with the thickness of the meat VS the temp of your oven (you want 140F and circulating if possible), but it is easy to figure out how to put it in the oven before bed and pull it when you get up in the morning for work.  You start doing that and bringing it to the office and people will lose their shit and start offering you money for it.  Jerky is what bacon aspires to be.  The hard part is finding a decent cut at a good price.  I happen to own a slicer, so it makes life easy.  However, if you bribe the guy at the meat counter, they'll typically slice up a bunch for you if they are not busy.    In short, this shit is easy, yo!  You should make some to give to some of the important people in your wedding.  Unless the photographer is a veg head, I couldn't think of a better tip myself...   Not in the slightest, especially if it's in a liquid meri.  Just cut it a little extra thick, low and slow and make sure you set a timer.  Then again though, I've got a very nice box that I love the hell out of which gives me perfect jerky every time.   It's mainly for other people.  The salt and pepper is for the dogs.  I already had dehydrator going with half that sheet pans worth of S P dog snacks as well.  They are quite spoiled.  I need to remember to leave a bag for the mailman too...   I almost did, but I've already got pork in brine in the fridge and can't fit another bucket...   all eye of round.  no trim involved, just remove the fat cap and slice.     And just to be clear, I said no wellington because most people would just look at the cut and say that without knowing what it was.   Oh I know the cut.  It was just figuring out what to do with the rest of it.  Thanks for stating a proper breading technique.  Better than the hammer for this one is the needler, which I don't have.  But am going to pick up tomorrow because I want to do it right, since most of it will be frozen in parchment wraps.     Smoked Red Chile  Salt and pepper  Hatch Green  In the bucket is Christian's #1 jerky.  It is delicious and some of the best I've ever made.        Eye or round is practically the best cut of meat to make jerky from.  One, it's shaped.  Two, there is little to no silver skin and the only fat is the cap.  Three, it's cheap as fuck, but not the cheapest cut of the cow.  It is also a cut of meat that if prepared properly, is fork tender.  Top to bottom  Smoked Red Chile Chimayo  Salt and Pepper  Hatch Green Chile  In the gallon bucket is Christians #1.  http://i.imgur.com/vFmTmDp.jpg   Tacos are on the list.  I hadn't thought about pulling the crock out yet.  I think that will finish it.  I've cut and pounded 12 portions worth for chicken fried steak.  This going to be my favorite part thing I'm doing with it all.  I took all the fat from the trim and ground it through the robocoup with another chunk.  I have about 2 quarts of that chilling in the cooler to get it ready to run through the stuffer.  I think 15-18 pieces of 12" stick to smoke and then run through the dehydrator.  One 5# chunk for roast beef sandwiches and another 3# for strogonoff.  This is after the gallons of sliced jerky I've gone through.  Tacos and all the rest of the scrap into the crockpot it goes.  Good call, thanks!   Stroganoff.  Good call.  I've got gallons of dried porcini from last fall in the pantry.  I can't believe I didn't think of that.  I also just found a package of 1/2" diamater casing in the freezer.  I should run a bunch through the grinder and fill it for sticks.     I have no problem just breaking it all down into jerky.  For myself, the dogs, or my friends.  But figured I've got all this, I should at least make something else.  Normally, I would make some Bresaola, but we're planning a move out of state and I don't want to start anymore long cure projects.  http://i.imgur.com/Ow0td03.jpg   A fan.   Best line ever.  "For breakfast it was a teaser, 5 piles of bacon."   So does the 99.  But that place reeks of ammonia.  Edit to add, notice I said they have pieces.  Not whole belly!   http://i.imgur.com/KLaChb4.jpg  I've made the offer before.  PM me a snail mail address and I'll mail ya a few ounces in the post of some dried ground Hatch Green Medium from this last season.  I've got plenty, don't worry about it.     "Hold my beer..."   You should.  Their pieces are skin on and run about $3.79lb.  They are small pound and a half to two pound chunks, which are perfect for doing batch learning at home.  And not too expensive when you're done with it with very little waste.    Other than that, the main component you'll need is Kosher Salt. Morton's 3# boxes are what I buy.  Everywhere has it, Target of all places has it cheapest.  Iodized salt is bad to cook with and it is not to be used in curing.  Please repeat that last statement with me :)  Also.  If you want pink salt (insta cure #2), the only places that I can think of that would have it on hand are The Alpine Sausage Kitchen and Nelson Meats?  Maybe one of the higher end Italian Kitchens in the area?  Check with them.  Other than that, you're talking mail order.  Alternatively, if you're serious about making bacon this weekend, I'm doing a Sunport run either Friday or Saturday and could meet up and pass you some.  Also, if you're in SF, shout.  It is important stuff and don't listen to the hippies who don't know shit on the subject.  I like helping people develop their cooking skills.   Yep.  It is fairly easy.  Bury it in spice and salt for a few days, rinse it, and smoke.  I cold smoke mine so I can cook it how I like later.  If you search my submissions by /r/bacon or /r/charcuterie  category, you'll find a bunch of different pieces I've made and random comments about how I've made each.  There are also a ton of other threads and links to blogs and what not on the subject to in the subs.  It is worth digging through, cause making your own bacon is the best.  It's honestly really easy.  If you like and can source pig belly, I'd be happy to walk you through it.  If you're in ABQ, I'll tell you to pick up a chunk of belly at Talin.  Cheapest and best cut for what it is in the area that I know of.  After that, all you need are gallon zip locks, salt, pink salt, spice, a fridge and patience.     My house.  I'm in Santa Fe.   If ya like.  I'm happy to pick up a USPS small flat rate box and throw $15-20 of chile in it.  But only if you promise to do something of the like in return of specialty from where you're at!  Or my addy will be with the box and you can just snail mail me $20 ;)   Chimayo Chile is easy.  All that shit is dried, yo!  Got an address?  OP mails!   Word up, thank you so much.  I'm coming out to listen to some music in March and that place in now on the list.   Some things do look like shit because I give a fuck about plating.  However, the shit that I make and feed my dogs is usually of higher quality and of standard than what you normally see.  And I can pull out of my fridge better food than what you pay for.  Does that sound bitter?  No.  It's just that I don't give a fuck.  I mean, I don't know what to tell you.  Constructive criticism is one thing.  Rude remarks are something entirely different.  Me speaking blatant truth is another.    But then again, I'm addressing someone who is a ghost and can't create or offer up anything.  So I'll just simply be completely fine with telling you to go fuck yourself.  Is that bitter?  No, I'm just an asshole with to much time on my hands today...  cheers!   Those look great.  The mush and egg combo is a favorite of mine as well.  Something that I keep on hand for the "plain" cheese pizza is mushroom dust.  Dried porcini or morels or whatever and run them through the spice grinder.  Sprinkle over the melted cheese or on the buttered/oiled crust straight out of the oven and there is enough heat to instantly caramelize and release all the mushy goodness.  We call it as the mushroom crack.  It is significantly better with more aroma and flavor then that shitty man made truffle oil everyone loves.  However, expensive to keep on hand if you are not hunting or cultivating your own mushrooms...  edit...  my favorite mush dust crack is - 1 C ground porcini, 3 T mortons kosher ground fine, 1 T fine ground black pepper, 1/2 tsp granulated garlic, 1/2 tsp powdered onion.  It is like magic on steak.     and a pic of some of it cooked.  I need to make me a sandwich!  http://i.imgur.com/3NhuscH.jpg      Who in your opinion has the best sandwiches in town?  Taking everything into account.  Can you eat it with one hand? While driving? Cost? Size? Deliciousness?  How long is the wait?   This was the snack before hand...  http://i.imgur.com/1xyvx40.jpg   I did years back, never liked it.  More novelty than effect from what I remember.  The kids that I know who are doing hemp beers are actually using trim in the wort for nose and flavor.  Then adding in small quantities of potent infused moonshine for effect.  Yes, they are actually stilling it themselves with a 5 liter capacity boiler for some reason rather than just buying ever-clear.  Fucking hipsters man.  When they told me that, I was just like you have got to be kidding me...  I've never tried it, they're in CO and there is NO regulation for any of it.  They say they've been making this "beginners beware beer" and it just makes me chuckle.  I'm sure it is, but hell.  That is probably the last thing we need on the market.  Just throw in several thousand mg's of caffeine and that shit will make 4-LOKO bust a nut :)   Hey hey now!  Making me make phone calls and shit.  I had to double back on that and good eye.  I called my friend that makes the chile beer and he says correct.  He throws dried chile in with the hop satchel for pils.  It is the pepporinchi he throws in the heffie during the last couple of days of aging.  I used to brew hard for many years.  1.5 bbl batches out of a homemade build.  But I had to give up the beer sometime ago in favor of the herb, it helps me be less of an asshole.  It is funny, doing something long enough, but not having it done in a while, it still makes you think like you know your shit.  Basics don't change, you just usually miss a step or two...   I like making her happy.  I'm a basically a housewife with no kids, so I'll pretty much make whatever keeps me in her good graces ;)  However, it does help that I'm somewhat skilled in the kitchen.  I will say though, that risotto was stellar.  I'm fairly hard on food and my cooking in general.  But I was quite happy with how it turned out.  Next menu I put together, some form of this will be on it.    Very very simple.  Take a blank/white risotto and fold in a puree.  The puree was simply bnut squash and compound butter.  No cream or cheese.  Is this the place where I mention saffron, green chile, and years of practice?  The trick is to cook the rice correctly.  It takes a half hour and lots of attention.  Once you have that down, you're golden to add in whatever you like.   That is a great call.  One of the guys I know here has done bunch of juniper stuff.  You shoukd try throwing in a fresh green chile during the dry hop of a heffie or a pils.  Or even during the barrel age.  Might change your life :)   I grew up there.  Used to drink off the vat at Bridgeport.  I'm more excited about the potential to go back to hunting the mushrooms.  Down here in the high desert, we ain't got nothing but more of the nothing...   You are not paid to fix their shit.  They don't see it as broken.  Get out.  Or if you come to them and be all" I can do this...," you better either be prepared to put it in front of them via numbers and writing or to grab your shoes as you walk out the back door.  No owner, especially a small business owner wants to be told they are doing shit wrong.  Even if they are.  It doesn't matter (usually) that you can get their product for 1/2 the price.  It is not your shop, not your shit.  I do professionally what you are talking about doing.  It is amazing the amount of people who want to do it their way.  The problem is that while they might be the boss/owner/money,what they do isn't always the right way.  Espicially if they operate in ways which are not maxing out their profit.  Untrained employees are a sure sign of a failing business or one that will fail shortly.  There is nothing you can do about it.  Reality sucks for people...   Will you be using knives?  Dress for the job you want, not the one you have.  Keep checks, shoes, and a knife roll in the car...   You're out in Bend if I remember correctly?  I' taking my GF to the airport so she can land at PDX this evening for an interview.  If we make the move, I'm gunna be stoked to come check it out!  But this looks Lots and lots better than what you had posted before.  Good for you for taking people's advice and helping yourself in the long run.  This looks much, much more profitable and more along the lines of how you said you want to approach and engage the community.  Kudos!    Butternut squash risotto with grilled bnut.  Balsalmic and red wine glazed sweet potato  Cider and champange vinegar glazed rainbow carrots.  Needs bacon.      Kick ass!  I couldn't find it in the thread.   You seem to be in the know about the sandwich.  If you are ever passing through New Mexico, give a shout and I'll make ya a snack.  If you check my submissions, you'll see I'm fairly serious about good, homemade sandwiches.   The real question is, did OP make it.  Or did they just eat it?   Thanks and fair enough.  I hate plating.  I'm a cook.  Not a photographer.  The only reason I started taking pics was that I didn't need to write down recipes that way.  I can just look at it and be like "this was how I made it."  At this point in time, I should ne taking better shots simply because I know better.  I think it's because I'm lazy and really hate most of the plates I own.      I don't drink, but roll me up a fatty please!    The run down on how I make my carbonara is in the following thread.  The gnocchi I'm just gunna say, make gnocchi.  I mill potatoes and then add egg and flour until it is the right consistency...  http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/2wh71s/i_will_never_grow_tired_of_carbonara_with_peas/cosi03r?context=3   No worries, no worries.  Now I've been wondering.   Calories?  WTF?  I have no idea what you're talking about.  I don't deal with calories.  I just make a bowl of grub and call it snack time.   Dinner?  Sure, but this is starting to be one of my go to breakfast dishes anymore.  Frozen gnocchi is a beautiful thing.         I mix my carb in a bowl, not in the pan.  Here are the steps.  Probably more detail than you'd like or expect, I've just been making this dish professionaly for many years now and it is one of my favorites to teach people.  The same way every time and it is always spot on.  Once you've got this dish down, I'll walk you through how to make the pancetta if you like...  Take a large stainless steel mixing bowl and throw the following inside...  1 large egg, a large hand full fresh grated parm (a Microplane is preference for tool), three finger pinch of chopped parsley, a couple of rounds off the pepper mill, and pinch crushed red pepper.  Take a pair of metal tongs and beat the hell out of this mix to make a wet paste.  I take this bowl and set it to the side of the stove or on the top back rail just to incorporate as much heat as slowly as possible into the egg mix.  Drop your 5 or 6 minute pasta.  Or start your pancetta at the 6 minute mark of your pasta.  As a side note.  I keep a bin of par cooked penne/rig/mac/farf in the fridge almost at all times.  30 seconds in salted boiling water and you have perfect pasta for whatever sauce you have on hand.  Stored properly, it keeps for almost a week after cooking it.  But don't bother doing this with angel hair or spag or any other type of long thin noodle pasta.  Shit only takes 5 minutes anyway.  Drop your pasta.  Heat a saute to hot hot.  Add your pancetta to the DRY pan.  After some of the fat starts to leach and you start to get a good crisp fond on 2 of the sides of each lardon, add a little bit of olive oil to coat and saute until desired crispiness.  Remove the bacon from the pan, reserving the fat/oil and straining off as much of the carbon in the fat as you can.  You need approx 1/3 C of the fat/oil mix.  If you do not have enough, add EVOO.  After the fat has been reserved and started to slightly cool, add 1/2 tsp shallot and 1/2 tsp minced garlic so it toasts.    The cooking of the pancetta, pulling it from the pan, and reserving the bacon fat should leave you with about one minute of cook time on your pasta.  This process should take no more than 5 minutes.  You must keep your fat hot during this time and  you *must not* burn your garlic.  It will ruin the dish.  Now the hard part.  The bowl with the egg and cheese.  Beat that shit hard with your tongs while you slowly work in your HOT fat.  Not too hot to curdle your egg, but hot enough to melt the cheese and cook and thin the egg.  Essentially you end up with this hollindaise type hot mayo.  Immediately pull your pasta after the emulsion is made and into the bowl it goes.  A little of the starchy pasta water is wanted, not much.  But not dry noodles, it helps thin the sauce to coat the pasta.  Now toss a punch of parsley, half the reserved bacon, and your frozen peas.  Twirl your pasta into a bowl, hit it with the rest of the bacon, more parsley, and cover in parm.  This dish is meant to be eaten immediately.  Don't make it for lunch tomorrow.  I mean, it'll heat up just fine.  But will be inferior on so many levels.  cheers!   No worries.  The GF tried giving me a hard time the last plate she saw me eat and was all "there is no cream in it!"   1oz parm - 8 grams fat  4oz pancetta - 24 grams fat  .25 oz parsley - 0 fat  1 egg - 5 grams fat  3.5 oz pasta - 1.75 grams fat   Based upon a 2000 calorie or an 80 gram of fat daily intake, I'd say that half of my daily fat coming from one of the two meals I eat daily ain't bad...   It's more along the lines that I can eat well and balanced in under 10 minutes...      It you do, don't cut a hole in the pastry like I did for the steam vent.  Form them, but don't egg wash or sugar.  Freeze them for 4 hours min.  375 degree oil for about 3 minutes or so, till golden.  Make sure you fry em in batches to not drop the temp of the oil to much.  Immediately out of the oil, hit with the Cinnamon sugar.   It's not that.  Most everything you say is negative, condescending, and just flat out dick behaviour.  You obviously love what you do.  I think you probably have a lot to offer and teach people.  But all you do is degrade and tell people it's not good enough because it isn't how you do it or were taught.  Or you call them inferior.  Not everyone is blessed in life to have all the wonderful experiences I have had. Or even you.  But just because you've held a truffle, it doesn't mean you know shit.  Go dig one out of the fucking ground and then we can talk.  But don't tell people that simply because the ONLY thing that they can get their hands on is inferior, because you're in a better market or have had better instruction.  You're not a chef, but pretend to be one.  A real chef educates people and makes them want to cook.  You make people want to stab you for no reason at all and would get thrown out of most of the kitchens represented here based upon your attitude.    It's real simple.  Don't be a dick.  People actually want you around.  But keep it up, you'll be regulated to dishes.   Anyone who calls themselves a chef and haven't spent at least 15 years working up in the industry is a fucking joke.   How is it not worth it?  You have the attention of all kinds of professionals who do what you are wanting to do.  All kinds of people are questioning how and why.  Please show us what we are doing wrong and how we can improve our own products.  If you have a better method, why don't you help others with theirs?  You seem so keen on asking for others help, can you not return the favor?   Hey OP!  Can you post pics of your $3 cookies?  I'd love to know what I can do to try and sell product for double the amount of eveyyone else in my city!   Check the thread...   Raise it by a couple bucks and consider it a loss leader.  But one of the ways you can really look at min maxing you profit is looking at what components and how you're making them in house.  And more importantly, what you're not making in house and why not.  Also. Another way is to figure out what your not making a profit off of and figure out a way to do so.  For instance, you're slinging pie.  More than likely you're bringing in semonila to use on the boards.  It burns, it goes in the garbage. That's all it is used for, And itis just considered a cost of doing business.  But it costs you more than you think because you are paying for square footage to store it and an employee to move sacks and clean the bins it lives in.  So my question is, why aren't you making some kind of semolina based product and selling it on your menu?  Stupid simple biscotti.  Oven fired cream based gnocchi dish.  Semolina "angel food cake" that you make bread pudding with.   Most business owners would charge for a straw if they could.  Why not charge for a product that you have to carry, which is also currently increasing overall food cost?   Sure?  Another friend said empanitas.   Hey hey now, I'd eat the hell outta all of that!  Looks delicious to me.   May I make a suggestion if you weren't happy with that?  I guess that's a stupid question, cause I'm gunna say it anyway ;)  If you'd like to try doing them differently and free form by hand and have them come out like mine. Make up a batch of two shell pie dough (takes 10 minutes) and divide it into a dozen pieces or so to freeze.  It'll keep 2 months and should make about 2 individual little pies each.  It Takes 5 minutes to thaw, is a small enough piece that you could just use your hand instead of using the rolling pin, and fill it with some of that delicious jam or compote you made last week that's kicking it in the fridge.  Turn your oven on before you pull the dough and it's at temp by the time it's formed and on the pan.  35 min total time, 25 in the oven.  Talk about a great way to make her want to come up for a cup of coffee.  Or hell, just for yourself!   Edited!   Scope it here.  Best way to put it.  http://www.cheesemaking.com/Chevre.html   We do what we can :)   It is funny you should ask.  I'm actually in the process of doing just that.  About a month ago I mentioned that I was thinking about doing just that and was actually working on a different cookbook in a another thread.  I recieved an overwhelming amount of requests to write it and many offers of payment.  So I was all " I guess I should start writing this damn book..."  it's trucking along and I hope to have it done in about a month.  Goal is 25, 4 or 5 item meals.  PDF/tablet format.  If you'd like to see the kind of stuff that I'm going to include, check my submitted history.  All of the plates I've posted are my from scratch work.   She works in an ICU.   I'm very sorry to hear that.  I hope you are able to make whatever adjustments you can and/or need too, to help improve your circumstances.     Well, you can cook too if you try :)   Sure sure.  But being a house husband, it's part of my job description :)   I wish I used recipes.  I do method and feel, I've just been cooking a long time.  Crust - 1 and 1/2 cup flour.  Pinch salt. 1T sugar.  1/3 cup butter.  Scant 1/2 cup dry white wine.  Zest of one lemon, dried.  Cut the butter into pea sized pieces and freeze at least an hour.  All the dry into the bowl.  Add the frozen butter and rub the butter in to make a sandy texture.  Add water 1T at a time until the dough comes together.  Don't overwork it.  Chill dough at least an hour before rolling.  Apples - peel and medium dice apples.  I did about 7# of mixed variety.  I like at least 50% tart for the mix.  Place apples in a large, dry pot over med high heat.  Add about 1/4 cup sugar per pound of apples.  I use white granulated.  Cook the apple mix until a good half the water from the apples is gone and a good syrup is forming. Now add the juice of a lemon.  A glug or two of vanilla paste.  Salt and spice.  I use nutmeg, clove, and cinnamon for my apple pie mix.  Once this has come to a gooey consistancey, remove from heat and cool.  Roll and cut your pie dough how you like and make little dumpling sized pies.  Egg wash and dust with cinnamon sugar.  350 degrees in the oven.  15 minutes.  Remove from oven and glaze with simple syrup.  7 minutes in oven.  Glaze again and finish for 7-10 minutes more until golden brown.  Let them cool, you will burn your mouth!    I know.  I think I ate to 10 putting them on the plate.  And now I'm kicking myself that I didn't make ice cream first :(   One of the things I've been spending fair amounts of time on is the chvre.  One of the easier soft cheese to make IMO.  Boil some milk, pitch your culture, let stand until set, strain and chill.  Whole process takes about 3 days and it keeps long enough for you to eat it.  Cultures and milk are cheap, processed chvre is not.  I wish more people would learn how to do easy things like this.         By the dozen, you will get $25 at most.  More than likely, to get the sales, you will be trying to move them for $18-20.  And that will be tough.  Unless they are the size of salad plates.  Remember who your competitors are.  And then quadruple the amount of people who you think are in direct competition with you, and who are selling a better product for cheaper, with less hassle.   Who is your target demographic?  Price point by piece?  What do you want to hit for your average individual sale?   Double your time allotted.   Do you have all your equipment?  Cards?  To go boxes?  Product?  Mixers?  Gas for delivers?  Overhead for licenses?  Money to burn buying product at retail rather than wholesale?  Money to cover your extra water, dish washing detergent, electricity, and gas incurred by making product?  You say that you will not incur debt to start, and I will tell you that you will spend money left and right and not even know it.  You'll reach into your fridge for eggs that you bought for yourself to eat and not even count it into the food cost of what the product is.  You'll forget stupid things like that, which is what kills people trying to do things like this.  Simple facts and to me, that is SERIOUS debt.    Home ovens are not commercial ovens.  If you use one for commercial purposes, you consume about twice to three times the amount of heating power than you normally would for home use.  Yes, the math and science backs it up.  It is about opening the door, running fans, and only being able to bake one sheet of cookies at a time.  I mean, seriously, there is a lot of shit to think about in doing something like this from home.   FYI, I'm not trying to burst bubbles.  Just giving you a reality check of what your talking about from first hand experience.  I've watched dozens of people do exactly what you are talking about doing and either go crazy with the work or walk away from it at a serious financial loss.   What you are talking about doing will net you about $8-10/hr for a long time.  And if you are able to translate an additional $5/hr into repayment of your loans/investment/overhead, you will be lucky in the beginning.  I'm not saying what you are wanting to do can't be profitable.  It will just take you a while.  If you have any debt at all, moving trades into the food business is a terrible idea.  If you plan on doing this on your own from scratch and want to make an extra $100 a week for 20 hour of work, by all means, hit the farmers market.  But, operating out of your house, that is what you are looking at.   Don't do it.  You'll waste your time, money, and risk your relationship.  You have a stable "day job" that pays at least 10X the amount of money hourly that you could ever make in a bakery.  Save yourself some headache and hassle and continue to make your cookies and cupcakes for your friends.   http://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/2w7467/home_bakery_advice/coocgjz   Well hell yeah!  Where do you live?  I'm always happy to deliver, especially for an awesome tip!    An internship is part of school.  Gots to do it to graduate.  Many people who are actually talented at cooking never get past their internship in school.  Some because the shop they do it at would rather hire them then and keep them around, rather than risk not getting the employee after school is done.    Or people realize that working in a restaurant and pursuing a dream to one day either own a restaurant or become a chef is completely and utterly stupid.  I mean, fucking stupid if you want to have a stable life, no substance abuse issues, a relationship that works, or any kind of financial freedom at all.  If you love to cook, keep it at home.  Stay the fuck out of the business.  Best thing you could do with your life is to not cook professionally.     my suggestion -  buy a 3 or 4lb chunk of belly.  Cut it into 8oz pieces.  Make up 5 or more different cure and crust mixes.  Cure and hang it all at the same time.  Then a month later you can side by side them all and determine which one is the one you like the most and can work on it from there.  After I figured to do that, I saved a lot of time in waiting to figure out what the recipe was I wanted...   Nice!  If you want, I'm always happy to help and am down in ABQ regularly.  I help you make bacon if you can convince your wife to help me perfect my kimchi :)   Very nice!  I typically have 2 or 3 chunks of random belly air drying.  Did you hang in a controlled environment?    For the crust, I've decided over the years that a straight pepper isn't for me.  I've got a couple of fall backs I like to go to which many have liked.  And considering "pancetta" is so easy and cheap to make, nothing like having a few different kinds around :)   2:2:1 - black pepper, coriander, fennel  4:4:2:1 - black pepper, green chile, granulated onion, granulated garlic  4:3:2:1 - black pepper, ground rosemary, ground thyme, granulated garlic    I normally don't comment on most things, but came in here to find the Bob Ross comment.  Because I agree, Bob Ross would be proud and I have to say that it would look awesome on my wall!  Would you be willing to trade it for a couple of sandwiches and a loaf of bacon?  :)   I showed this post to my GF and pointed that out as well.  Like it would somehow be missed...  I think the title of this thread should be "I'm the owner and I fucked an employee.  Now she is making my life and business miserable.  How can I get rid of her without getting sued for sexual harassment or discrimination?"   No shit.  I'm in the city, so I've never noticed the difference...   obviously, you're not a golfer.   Actually, I saw your explanation and disregarded it because it's BS.  Sorry.  I understand your reasoning, but it is faulty.  No offense, I simply want all people to develop skills which help them make better food.  Also.  Veg in stock isn't just an aromatic.  It fortifies nutrients and gives body.  If you would like to play, I would suggest you read McGee.     Thanks.  A non hostile and well thought out response in reddit.  I rarely get those ;)  Laying cable is a nightmare.  Which is why I believe that Google is pushing towards wireless and an eye in the sky.  I think that with the way tech is developing, here soon the mobile hotspot from my phone will be better than my wireless connection.  Maybe?   The thing I think more people should be talking about is the amount of infrastructure ATT needs to put in to match Google.  Google has to lay cable because it never had any.  How much and what kind of cable does ATT have down in the KC area?  Are they actually putting in new cable, or are they just "opening the pipes" as we all suspect?   You fucked your employee/co-owner?  Not good, not good!  10% of the company?  Fire her and suck up the 10% you'll have to pay out as her share.  That is the cost of getting your dick wet in the company ink.  Alternatively, try and buy her out.  But damn.  You down right fucked up.   A tip to help you be a better cook and to further develop your palete - never salt your stock.  Only salt your pan/dish.  This is restaurant 101 and something that will get you yelled at and humiliated in culinary school.  There are many reasons for this.  The main thing being is that you will never taste how food is developed in its "natural" state.  Many home cooks will argue that people do it all the time.  It is true, suzi q homemaker does.  But to get the kind of results that people like (as in restaurant quality) you are doing yourself a diservice by salting a stock.  However.  I will say that if you keep salted butter in your fridge, than this kind of advice is useless...  	122
 He was great in Undeclared and Sons of Anarchy. Haven't seen anything else so far though   It's all worth it. And to put you at ease, Season 7 is my favorite season. 8 and 9 were really good and 10 was awesome. Season 2 is where it gets good and Season 3 is when it begins its legendary status.          For me, I liked Jurassic World more. Mad Max:Fury Road was a little overhyped for me. I was much more entertained by JW   I agree with you, but how many times do you type "My Cocaine" for that phrase to be an option for Auto Correction of "Michael Caine"?    He is also a writer on the show   To me, it looked great but just wasn't what I wanted functionally. I wanted to flip quickly and easily between different websites. The only way to do it was the side menu or creating groups.    Friday Night Lights is one of the best series I've ever seen. You will not be disappointed if you like Kyle Chandler.    S2 just ended and I can't wait for S3 already   See, to me, that is what I liked about it. It's prison, is there ever really massive conflict and resolution? It was very character oriented and I loved that. I found it to be much more fulfilling than V forcing her way into the story. And Caputo was one of my favorite characters this season   Paperboy is easily the best. I've tried em all and Paperboy takes top notch in functionality, looks, and ease of use/navigation  Link me: PaperBoy: A Feedly Newsreader   Season 1 is easily the worst season. Season 3 is where is starts to become legendary   I saw this topic and was going to come in here are write pretty much the exact same thing.    Orange is the New Black Season 3. It has less of a season arc this season but I personally think it's a better season than last year. It's very character driven, which is why i watch the show, and features some of the best acting yet.    I don't know about other people but I never liked her. She was a disease on the show   Absolutely. That scene with Tastee and Susanne is one of the best scenes of the series in my opinion.    I'm through 11 episodes and although there is not as much of a season arc as last season, I think this is a much better season than last year. It's very character oriented which is why I watch the show. It also features some of the best acting yet. And no "V" which is great.    *Creates "Discussion" thread about an immensely popular film about reasons why it's a terrible movie.   *Says it's one of the worst movies seen in a while  *Provides no reasons/proof   First of all, this post isn't ironic, it's sarcastic. And yes, sarcasm is hard to show on the Internet.    Haha, True. I'd like another live action show from him though after Community   Go to an electronics store and buy a cheap HDTV (the insignia brand is decent and cheap at Best Buy). Get a Chromecast for $35 to stream pretty much any app from your phone, laptop, and tablet on your TV easily   Umm...    Check out Twee on Android. It has a great widget and it syncs with Trakt so you can keep track of the shows you watch and what episodes you've seen or not. Twee has a ton of other cool aspects too. I've tried a bunch of others and none compare. Plus the developer is one guy who is constantly upgrading based on user suggestions   Maybe see an episode or two of it before you form an opinion?   I didn't watch the show because it's not my type of thing but I've heard good things and know that it had a fanbase on here. I've been through Cancelation for some of my favorite shows too early as well so this sucks and I feel for you.    The very first scene of the series is post breaking bad, so there could be more   I was there and I don't remember  that, haha.    "So it's just like Community, but there's no Greendale, it takes place in a different location, doesn't have anything to do with Community College, has completely different characters, but it's written by Dan Harmon"    It was always the plan to make it an Anthology. I know it can't beat the first season but give it more than one episode to play out.    I really enjoyed it. It has a lot of potential. Tim Robbins was great and so was Jack Black   Personal opinion maybe? I thought the Rotten Tomatoes scores were too high for Mad Max but that's just my opinion.    Has a lot of potential. I really enjoyed it and the cast was great   Seems like Season 2 is going for the slow build. And I like that. It separates it from S1 right away but still carries a similar tone.    Watch Guardians of the Galaxy, Zero Dark Thirty, and Moneyball.    I always liked the movie.    I saw both and liked both. But Kingsman was miles beyond Spy.    California USA!... What do now?    Agree with all of those. I'd throw in Season 6 of Community and Season 5 of Shameless as well for me.    Make sure you buy "Park to Park" passes since Hogsmeade and Diagon Alley are on separate parks. That way you can do both and ride the Hogwarts Express back and forth.   Also, get the Hot Butterbeer at either the Hog's Head or Leaky Cauldron. It's the best kind of Butterbeer.    I agree with you but I think the "Ron Howard in a wig" was more to the fact that she actually is Ron Howard's daughter   You posted an article talking about how much it would "cost" to book rap artists. Specifically Childish Gambino. Then you titled the article saying that "Donald Glover" makes the amount that it cost to have him perform a concert. That made it seem as though you thought he received the entire amount. I just read it differently.    Actually, it's his booking agency's fee. He gets paid based off of that amount. As do all of the other things I listed. It's not as if he gets paid 85 grand and he just shells out cash to each of "his" employees.    He absolutely does not. The promoter may pay $85,000 for Childish Gambino to perform and most of that may come from the back end depending on ticket sales. That includes what he gets paid, his driver, equipment, tour bus, his management team, etc. He makes a good percentage of that but not 100%   Fuck, how did I forget Shameless in my suggestions... It's one of my favorites. Absolutely second this   Community is my favorite show, just wasn't sure it fit into OP's list of shows   Sons of Anarchy, True Detective, Fargo, Parks and Recreation, etc   I watch The Americans, Sons of Anarchy (now done), Fargo, Married, Man Seeking Woman, Louie, The Comedians, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Tyrant, etc. I love FX and FXX   Besides season 4 which there are quite a few. I'd go with Aerodynamics of Gender. It's the only episode I really did not like under Dan Harmon's care   I have to disagree. Other platforms may have a very slightly smoother interface for some apps. But on the whole, no other platform can do a lot of the things we can do on Android.   As far as I see it, when I first got a touchscreen phone, I had two options. An sleek and fast iPhone that was limited or a slower buggy Android that had full customization. I chose Android because of the customization and since then, Android mostly caught up on the sleekness and fastness of Apple but Apple never caught up on other things. They have only tried to mimic a few things from Android.  I love android and wouldn't trade it for any other platform. Not due to my loyalty, but still at its current state, it is overall better for my use.    That was my problem. It builds but never had a payoff. It dragged something funny on too long to where it wasn't funny any more. I didn't hate it, just didn't love it.    Hey Aziz! Big fan here.   What's the biggest thing you miss/will miss about playing Tom Haverford or filming Parks?    I watched the first three episodes. It had its moments but it honestly felt like a sketch on a sketch comedy show that just never ended. It was funny but then just continued until the joke was a little stale. Just my take on it. I liked the cast but just didnt grab me.    I didn't. I just wanted the toy   If it weren't for Reddit calling it out... I wouldn't have even noticed. It's funny when movies and TV get so much flack for product placement when in real life, there are more commercials and advertisements everywhere you look.   [Here is the real link to Paperboy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dottedcircle.paperboy hl=en)    I've tried all of them after Taptu went out 6 months ago. The best, easily, is Paperboy. It has the great look of some of the others but is much more controllable and not so cluttered. It also has great customization.  Link me: Paperboy  Edit: I have tried every one listed in this thread and found Paperboy to be the best of them.    It's impossible to know, but let's just assume he is now super rich and can have any job he wants. And I'm so glad, he seems like a great and genuine guy and I loved Parks and Rec.    Who gives a shit. I have never once found "product placement" distracting because I know it doesn't affect me. Most of the time I don't even notice it   And this thread is specifically about a reboot of HP as a TV show   The indominous can sense thermal heat not see it. It did sense thermal heat with them behind the car when is why in stuck it's head in there. The raptors only had those on when they were let loose. No one expected the pterodactyls to get loose therefore they felt no need   I already mentioned that about GOT in my first post. Sorry to ruin it for you but Hogwarts Castle is CGI and does not exist. And WB isn't going to do a remake of their incredibly popular film series less than 5 years after it finished when it was very well received and already done on a higher budget. There is no reason for it   The storyline IS absurd. It's a park with real dinosaurs open to the public. And they created a Hybrid to attract more customers. That is also a very meta commentary on real life with people's attention spans today and always wanting bigger and better and not impressed by anything (kinda like you with this movie).   You are mostly right about the characters. I don't think they are one dimensional but they don't quite compare to the original. But that's because the characters in the original are the smartest in their field and brought there because of their knowledge.   And yes, many scenes stick in my mind. I don't want to spoil anything so I won't say them.   Also, you say there are plot holes but didn't mention a single one.   Because Benedict Cumberbatch is awesome and did a great job   I am not paying for it but no TV studio will shell out the money that it needs and therefore it will cut corners and cut sequences out due to budget constraints   Even though I don't think the movie is as bad as a lot of people, the Star Wars Episode I teaser is probably one of the [best posters ever.](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/12/d6/0f/12d60f08494cb0ea007b284cec2a6de1.jpg)    I wouldn't want the book series as a TV show. It's too expensive to create. I know they do it with Game of Thrones but that's because most of the scope is real locations and effects are minimal (usually one or two big sequences per season) whereas Potter has grand locations, Grand set pieces, and a lot of effects.   However, there was a fake trailer for a TV series a few years ago titled "Aurors" which I would absolutely love to see. But again, it would either be insanely expensive or look cheap   Why disrespect the actress who plays the character to which this post would be related to?    You got that right about Shirley and Pierce, haha. Troy also was my favorite character but I guess the amazing episodes that followed his departure made me forget a little.   I personally love how Frankie fit into the group. She found her own place and kind of took a leadership role. But still found herself trying to please the group with things their friends who left might do.   Elroy also was great because throughout the entire season he had one foot in the study group and one out and also understood that. They never hid that or tried to make it something it wasn't. He had some really great moments and even though he was reluctant to be in the group, they treating him as an equal and fit in.   It can be different but have the same feel and writing. The group dynamic changes as does storylines, characters, etc. But Greendale is still there, the cast from the other seasons, and most importantly the writing and Dan Harmon's sense of humor.    Personally, the reason I loved it is because the show grew. It still held onto enough of what we love about the show but it was forced to makes changes with cast members leaving and, as much as I love the original cast, it is what the show needed.   The first couple episodes were a little tough to get into but once Frankie and Elroy added to the group dynamic, it really worked. I found a ton of episodes to have the classic Community heart, meta humor, references, and originality.   To me, it seems most people who didn't like Season 6 is because they are still subconsciously hoping for a glory days greatest hits of old Community but can't grasp that the show has changed and is still Community at its core, just a little different.   I really enjoyed season 6 and also think season 5 is my 2nd favorite season of the series.    Community, Party Down, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Workaholics, Broad City, Parks and Recreation, Arrested Development, Chuck   Okaaaaay?...   The Way Way Back   I think you would enjoy it still. You'll miss out on some of the inside jokes and some relationships but they do a fairly good job of catching viewers up.    There is some truth to what you say about weight but I think they did a great job making it the most realistic they can. I too love Jurassic Park, but like I said to someone else on here, the effects impress us because we still think in that time while watching it and the memory of being impressed. If Jurassic Park came out today for the first time with the same effects, it would sadly be criticized for lack of realism.   Lastly, I am a huge fan of all of the JP movies. I was 3 when the first one came out and it was probably the first movie I ever saw. I also have seen it and the sequels over 30 times. I was very impressed by this movie and pleased as a fan, not just as a mass audience member.    That is a mindset, it didn't feel real to you because you wouldn't let it. You wanted Animatronic and got CGI so you never let it have a chance. Also, maybe it's just your wording but Cinematography has nothing to do with CGI.  As for JP, that felt real back then because it was new technology and was the first of its kind. And now it still has that feeling due to memory of having seen it. As much as I love that film, if it came out today with the same effects, it would be shit on for feeling fake. The only reason to have Animatronic I-Rex would have been nostalgia.    I don't think it's the CGI, I think you have to look at the inner dialogue of the movie that people going to the park are used to dinosaurs now and that people want better, more scary, bigger dinosaurs because the old ones are "been there, done that". It's a very meta meaning because it's true with Jurassic Park movie goers. Since the original in 93 which was the first movie to really do dinosaurs right and feel real and scary interacting with humans, there have been 2 sequels and countless other dinosaur and dinosaur inspired movies to come out. It feels like an old hat and it doesn't phase you. An animatronic I-Rex would not have made it more scary or real for you. In fact, if they would have done that, it would probably feel more fake but make a few of the JP fanboys happy. And all 4 movies did have a mix of practical and CGI, number 4 just happened to use mostly CGI because it fits they action they wanted to accomplish and the detail they wanted to have in the I-Rex   I would totally be there. I'd make a whole trip out of it... Spared no expense   Buy them then so you don't have to watch the commercials   I kind of fit into that category. I read the first 4 books before the movies came out but then I got behind and the movies kept coming out so movies 5, 6, 7, and 8 I read the books after the movies came out. So I saw Deathly Hallows Part 1 and 2 without having read the book and totally followed the storylines. But at the same time, I had also read the other 6 books multiple times.    It currently holds a 7.8 on IMDb   You should have stopped at "other than it being made for pure enjoyment"...    True Detective, Community, Game of Thrones, Shameless, Daredevil   /u/BullshitUsername was right!    From Buzzfeed   "ARTICLE-5/18/99-Star Wars fans "I've got a baaaad feeling about this."   Haha! Awesome   Hey Blake!   Big Workaholics fan.   What's one of your best memories while still living in the Workaholics house that most people don't know?   Also, when is Ders gonna show up on Community because you and Adam have, haha.    Kingsman so far. Just watched it again last night and it easily beats any other I've seen this year so far. If Star Wars: The Force Awakens is as good as I hope, that could take top notch   Comedy-wise I thought this past season was the best personally. But to each their own      Haha, actually, Inspector Spacetime.    Easily the best filmed hand to hand combat action sequences I've ever seen. Favorite movie of the year so far   I love season 4 but that is not the first time that song has been used in that context. Old School did it as well.    Downvote for saying the actress' name instead of the character she plays.    Rule 1: Jeff Lies   It is Keith David, so in a way, yes. Its the same actor      How in the hell is this related to the discussion of movies? I award you no points... And may God have mercy on your soul...    Ha! That's awesome!    True. Also, have you seen Judd Apatow's followup to Freaks and Geeks? It's called Undeclared and it's also really good and got canceled after a season. Not quite as great as Freaks and Geeks but really good.    I don't mean to be a dick but these have been posted on here almost every other day for the last 2 years.   	102
 absolutely amazing! thank you so much for sharing!   I think you already made the first good step: you *moved* to another division.   I don't want to be too judgmental, but my warning bells are ringing... we INFP's are quite easily accessible for manipulative persons, that seem to be nice and caring, but you're just another marionette for them... since you said she's doing it in a subtle way and also to other people, she might have a narcissistic tendency..    Hopefully, that distance you already created will help you to find emotional distance, so that you can think about it a bit clearer...  Just my two cents.. I hope it helped you a bit to find the right path.   maybe it's true, that someone has more friends then you, or has accomplished more. but does that mean, you're not as equally great as anyone else in your OWN way? does that mean, your life can't still be fabulous? :)    Hi! *wink* same goes for me. I need to *feel* safe with a person. If my intuition says it's not right, then there's always a reason for that. So better not force anything when being at this point.. I rather try to figure out, why I feel this way. Other than that mentioned, having high expectations in a person or even in love, is never the right approach in my opinion... no one should have the feeling, they are not enough. They should know, that they are great the way they are. And love comes whenever it wants anyway with different reasons, so I limited down my expectations to two "key-questions": is the person treating me respectfully/genuinely? can I trust him? When these two things are given, hopefully time will show the other great different qualities the person has. Whichever they might be. :)   	4
 They are classy as hell, though   well what constitutes as "against us". Militants yes, but If you mean pro-palestinians in GENERAL   And a militia protecting shias (why they were created in the 80's) is bad why?  Christians aren't persecuted in their strongholds.

    Apparently it needs to be said...   Thank you for NOT including requim for a dream on this list!  Also watch Michael by Markus Schleinzer   This is for...Mathilda....   Thanks!  I was definitely in human form which explains the summonings.  That helps too with the tendency info, I'm going to go ahead and assume NG+ or more is in my future..   Dark souls vet trying to wrap my head around this feature.  Also, the summoning is different too right?  I helped someone beat the Giant spider then ran back to help someone else and I couldn't use my summon blue or black..   Listen to Catch 33 again.     get drak sword raiz resistance to 99 furst kill all blaksmit then praiz it casuls    Smeg-ing hell!  Thought it would be bigger!  Thanks for pointing it out!   Is red dwarf or star bug on here?    Julia roberts       All you can eat buffet and just never stop eating   Meshuggah - catch 33      Sure!  Yea, I'm just aware of the cut items not why they were cut.  I really hope we get to interact with NPC's more in DS2....Would love to see cut scenes that show the NPCs story, like when you rescue Dusk and she's talking about how she got trapped, or with Rhea when she's talking about her 'companions'.

 But it you stop people from with mental illness from flying no one with mental illness who flies will come forward. Same thing applies to guns "crazy people can't own guns" so if you have mental illness and own guns, you won't seek help. On the other hand, should mentally ill people be able to own guns or fly? People just need to accept that there is not such thing as 100% security and there is a 0.00001% chance they will die at the hands of some random nutjob. On the other hand, the'll probably die cause of all the fucking junk food they eat, or the drugs they do, or the people they have sex with, or that one little asshole epithelial cell that had a bad day. Everyone of the people reading this thread will die one day. A significant portion will die well before they expect to. Most of them will die painfully.   But what if they don't find out they were wrong, isn't life in prison for an innocent person a pretty high cost? If you believe in a justice system you accept that a tiny percentage of innocent people will suffer. Why is this OK if you merely jail them for life, but not OK if you kill them. Besides if you're on death row you have expanded rights to appeal that those with life do not have so if there IS an incorrect verdict there is a greater chance of it coming to light. Thats why most death row inmates in California oppose ending the death penalty in that state.   this is why I don't believe in prison   fuck, why did we even buy that dude an eotech   No one wants to be the guy that says "yeah ok, don't worry about it" and then dumbass blows themselves up   http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/05/02/virginia-man-killed-in-civil-war-cannonball-blast/ still potentially lethal   DOWN THE WELL! DOWN THE WELL!   all depends on who is on the plane, 300 people four hours from the target...fuck yea. A late night commuter flight on a tuesday with 10 people on board 5 minutes from the target....good luck. Keep in mind that it may be very possible to barricade the door. Counting on the passengers to take back the plane is highly speculative. Just following the 2 in the cockpit rule seems a lot easier.   If the USA went "all in, no rules" against ISIS, even with just conventional weapons it would be over in under a week. The problem would be that hundreds of thousands of Iraqis would be killed. In 1991 the USA went up against 650,000 iraqis much better armed than ISIS and killed 30,000 of them while losing under 200 of their own.   ITT: people that can't accept that they will never be totally safe    until the terrorist tells the person who knows the code to open the door or he gets fed his own balls   Would this precipitate a greater middle class in China and India?   Would the increased demand for labor be outweighed by the decrease in consumption in a highly automated economy?   Have fun in Ukraine this spring!      Most of government would be gone, leaving the remaining democratic president with incredible power. US military wouldn't like this, coup ensues, liberals don't like it but won't actually fight to stop it. Some kind of very limited democracy ensues.   Hell and Back Again   I find it strange that we are supposed to accept models of all body weights (something you can control and is related to your health) because it might give people an unrealistic impression of beauty. However, there is no movement to accept models who are not attractive in other ways (poor bone structure, asymmetry), features which we cannot control. Do models that fit these conventional measures of attractiveness not also create an unrealistic standard of beauty? Where is the movement for models with ugly faces? There also doesn't seem to be much of a movement for male models who are "plus size."   Arab Spring wins again!   You guys need some freedom, imma crank up the Abrams   Isn't less uninformed retards voting good?   then how do you support prison?   hahahahahahahahahahahaha   What about Wormtown?   It's not closed off, it is just a strange angle. That is a A2 birdcage flash suppressor so there are no slits on the bottom (to reduce dust signature when firing and decrease muzzle rise)   why does it look fake?   It would be funny watching the bikers make him eat it while the police walk by laughing   shit...we're just in the summer now   Remember when everyone was all excited about the Arab Spring?   this, peacetime military is like constant jacking off and never getting to fuck   Is this movie about how much it sucks being rich and fucking models all the time?   they should apologize for their racial stereotyping and sign up for a reeducation camp.   Yea, they should have gone with Corporate Bros and Finance Hoes.    American Pride has nothing to do with an ethnic heritage. If someone lives in America and they are offended by "American Pride" I suggest they leave. I hear there are some openings in northern Iraq.   my point being they shouldn't want us to have to come back   last time we took Okinawa it didn't work out too well for the locals   or we could do it by parental political affiliation!   Isn't this what we always knew....shit parents equal shit kids. There isn't a solution for this other than the forced redistribution of children and widespread sterilization. Good luck getting support for that.   Next do one with rate of HIV infection, felony conviction, and rate of gun violence and associated political party!! Oh, add rates of child abuse and mental illness as well.   what are you, like french or something?    because they hate america....   Well they could accidentally torpedo a russian warship. Oops. Totally deserved but won't happen because Europe trembles before Russia.   how far can a drone fly in an hour with how much weight and how much does it cost, honest question   or you could use rocket and mortars with far more effect and cheaper   a good one, I'd acquitt   Well he did get to live for about 35 years after killing a woman over 101 bucks. Regardless the cause he got what he deserved.   in a restaurant with an automatic weapon it is, esp if the people involved are white and part of "organized crime" as opposed to "street thugs" ie poor blacks   As do their demographics!   grunt life...   That Marine is a total boot   total frat move is the douchiest thing to ever douche   lots of biker gangs IIRC   USMC 0351   *except the vast, vast, vast, majority of people in combat units   Call me a sexist because maybe this makes me one but I 100% guarantee that this will lower combat readiness. - Male combat veteran that served in combat as part of an all male unit to which females were attached.   yup, they should make evictions EASIER if anything. If you don't pay your rent, fuck you, not only are you stealing from your landlord, you're inflating the prices for everyone else.    Not really true. You're trained to always shoot for a lethal area if you have a realistic chance of hitting it. For instance, people ARE trained to shoot at ankles under cars or for the pelvis if the target is distant and doesn't respond to torso shots (ie body armor). don't stick your leg out from the corner https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_SKqQ_dkpQA   It's the whole "if it's stupid and it works, it isn't stupid" thing   If you have to commute to Boston it sucks but there are alternatives. I pay 650 for a HUGE 1b in a brownstone located in the nicest part of Worcester. I have a  5 min walk to the commuter rail, grocery store, and literally dozens of restaurants and bars. People just can't get past the "but it's Worcester" part.   This guy. GI Bill ftw.   ITT: people that haven't a clue what they are talking about. It is a perfectly legitimate tactic. Anyone here been in a gunfight before? I have. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_BxQSxnD1g   I wanna see Jane Swift fight holyfield....   Yea, I was kinda joking and kinda not. Deval's got the age but Mitt has the size. Deval grew up in a bad neighborhood but left really young, while Mitt went to prep school in the early 60s. Neither is really a stand out athlete. I think it would be a good fight.   Are they going to have regular hours now?   Paul Revere's Ride- Events of Lexington and Concord and those leading up. Extraordinarily good, reads like a novel. You will have new found appreciation for the intelligence and courage of our forefathers. I couldn't get over the description of the Old North Bridge fight. Possibly the single most pivotal event in American History. A bunch of farmers stand against the greatest fighting force in the world. Somehow the English panic and flee and the world would never be the same.   should be Mitt vs Deval   When my mom and dad got married they agreed not to have any kids. Ten years later my mom changed her mind and here I am. Oops   thanks obama?   because it's a minority group...if they weren't jewish it would be "privilege"   Christ, I wasn't in school THAT long ago and none of those stupid rules were in place. Where did all that shit come from?   I bet he wouldn't egg the russians   I agree, we've lowered the bar. Doing your job and/or self preservation shouldn't meet the "hero" criteria.   yea, and if you buy it off ebay there is a high chance it "fell off a truck" hence "grey."    oh, that I'm sure he picked up in Iraq   just think, one sub can kill every population center in russia with a population over 50,000   uniforms yes, armor no, he probably bought it on the grey market.   So hating parts of a culture isn't racist, what about hating most of a culture?   what if you hate the culture not the people?   yup, vertical video   Hell and Back Again http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1748043/ is better and on Netflix   In all seriousness they should.    That white man's burden yo   you're right, see edit   This looks a lot more like US Marines in Helmand than US Army in Kunar. EDIT, I'm totally wrong, somehow watched wrong video.   and does their whining bring you over to their side or make your resentment grow?   You do realize the more whining people hear, the less they give a fuck about the whiner right?   time to buy land in Greenland   with that attitude I guess they better keep on oppressing you   Half ass jihadist. If ure gonna be a muj, you probably should skip the whole "my mean brother made me do it" defense.   christ, you need a sweater   It looks entertaining but I think this movie is going to take a lot of (possibly justified) criticism. It certainly has a "white people trapped among local savages" look to it.   bayonet them for having more money than you?    Hey, who cares when you make some money shitting all over some 78 year old lady for singing the lyrics to a song in private.   I'd rather watch "Shit-Faced NASCAR"   Did he push the olympic in any way? Serious question.   the problem is that politics in the US has become about sticking it to the other guy. The democrats would love to elect a clinton because they know the conservatives hate them. The republicans would like a bush for the same reason.   AND? Tourists will have to pay slightly more for whores and Thai exports will suffer.   Legalize, regulate, tax. Anything else is duck tarded.   Pro-gun? He is also a founding member of the Massachusetts Against Trafficking Handguns Coalition who issued the following statement: "With gun violence at a 10-year high in Boston and increasing in Springfield, New Bedford and other Massachusetts cities, we applaud leaders like Deval Patrick for advocating smart policies to deal with this growing crisis. Deval Patrick has shown himself to be a true champion for peace and public safety by recognizing the need to crack down on the flow of illegal guns coming into the Commonwealth. We thank Mr. Patrick for vowing to make our communities safer places to live, work and raise families and congratulate him on his victory in Tuesday's Democratic Party Primary."  Sounds like he was just an opportunist hustler.  http://www.19actionnews.com/story/5439861/massachusetts-against-trafficking-handguns-coalition-says-deval-patrick-will-win-the-peace   I guess by that rationale it is also aggressively pro-choice   Actually this isn't really true anymore. While obviously you shouldn't use a tourniquet for minor wounds, experience in Iraq and Afghanistan has shown that the risk of limb loss has been vastly overstated. Using a tourniquet is reasonable for any bleeding that can't be controlled with direct pressure or repositioning. Every soldier in on patrol in Afghanistan carries a minimum of 4 tourniquets, one for each limb.  edit from your link: In rare situations tourniquet application will be necessary and lifesaving in the civilian prehospital setting. Tourniquets are no longer only considered as a last resort device. Practitioners should familiarise themselves with this simple piece of equipment and be prepared to use it in appropriate cases without an irrational fear of complications  tl;dr- if you can't stop the bleeding with direct pressure or repositioning use a tourniquet because the benefits almost certainly outweigh the risks.   uh, I don't think we have a monopoly on that....but we do shit indoors   Because western society IS superior. Sorry.   Most of the "my gyno is an asshole" posts are overly dramatic, this is not, you should report it  	104
 This is a common missconception. The security lies in the pilots being told *to* fly into the tower, and the ATC's relying that the pilots training is completely shit.

They're just messing with you dude. (sorry guys)   I have to say I agree with him. Your post comes off as one: making a very reasonable point about respecting other peoples opinion, which 99% of rational people will agree with. Two: arguing against minors being able to deny potentially life saving treatment, which is without a doubt a much more controversial opinion. The first is generally agreed upon by all rational people, and the second is up for debate until the world explodes.  It's also one that both me and him (and the votes) agree detracts very much from your first point.  I personally see your first point only being made because of your second point, i.e., although I can appriciate how the first point is unrelated and still relevant.   Unintentionally deep title?   Yeah I think it means link to profile pages.   huehuehuehue   Excellent job dodging the question, and 'enhancing the discussion'. Don't expect a reply unless you can actually support the existence of this imaginery myth.   Okay, so say they don't google it. Where exactly do they hear this myth? The only reason i'm still replying is because I don't think you can find a popular website where people don't completely disagree the second that's posted, educating anybody reading it.   I mean, you keep claiming it's a myth, but 9/10 results on google say otherwise (http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Are+private+tracker+safe%3F). As well as anyone that's done 1 minute research on the subject. You haven't even posted a link or a screenshot of anyone saying that, and people agreeing with them.   Edit:  here's an article by the largest copyright and privacy website where they analyse the OP: https://torrentfreak.com/are-private-bittorrent-trackers-safe/ The only myth here is the one you're inventing, it's pretty hilarious you can't see that.   You agree with 99% of rational people that use private trackers. This is the most pointless thread i've read in a long while. Congratulations.   RIP   Having recruitment threads on trackers that require you to get to a higher user level (e.g. elite) is a pretty good incentive.

RIP Santa.   Read what I said in the very next sentence: Anyone that hears the -bro terms being used in context enough knows that to be true.   If you go to assumptions the first few times you hear something said, in a community you're completely new to, then it's not the communitys fault.   lmao b8/8   I racially identify as a helicopter, can I still join?   You're *really* reading too much into it. I think in the context that -bro is used in EvE it seems like a more blanket term, that isn't meant to include gender politics, but is used to connate a role that attracts friendship. It's not implied that your female or male, because no one actually knows what you are behind the screen. Anyone using the term like that does not represent the majority, and their defenition should not be taken as fact.  Personally i've only ever heard of logibro (when a logi saves someones ship) and newbros (because the game needs new players to survive) being used widely. Wormbro is a name of a corporation, and not something that fits the majority of the -bros.   It's not hard to get around the perception of exclusion, because there is none! Anyone that hears the -bro terms being used in context enough knows that to be true.  For some context i've been playing for about a year, and have been in large-very large corps for the majority of that time (so it's not like I play market pvp 24/7 in my 0% tax corp).   Did they set the drives on fire to test them!? Also you can be damn skippy those workers don't take as much care when the cameras not on them.

From what I understand of it, the code in the second picture shows the app downloading something silently, and encrypting and sending usage statistics of the user to Viber.

Please say you cross checked the fit with a trust corp mate or smth like that.   That 4th BCU gives you 300dps increase vs 30k EHP with a DCU. Is that really worth?   Assuming there was no such thing as eve-survival, wouldn't you just warp in, not bastion, align out, and warp if you can't tank it? Or do the frigates reach you too fast?  If there wasn't anything like eve-survival, people would just setup a channel and do it that way instead. And you would still have probably died because you wouldn't have read the comments there.

I've played with the worst of players in League of Legends, this is much much worse, simply because people can completely destroy your EvE experience, and you cant just leave a game like you can in League and forget about it.   The 'bonus room' was a 'service' created by a scammer. Once he scammed someone he would have them go into his teamspeak and make them degrade themselves IRL, or completely devalue their character (imagine making someone lose rating from diamond to bronze), just so they could get their assetts and money back (he still wouldn't give it back 9/10 times). He and his buddies were eventually permanently banned from EvE.  http://jestertrek.blogspot.co.uk/2014/03/the-bonus-round.html  There really isn't any permanence of meeting a troll in league, apart from maybe losing some rating and 40 minutes of your time. In EvE, the scumbags can kill your ship which you've spent actual days farming for.

 Um, have you not seen the Spongebob Squarepants movie?   It's one of my favorites!   If you have a 3DS, get Animal Crossing: New Leaf.

Okay, thanks! And I have a question on Kirby, did you think it was too easy of a game? I've read that in a few reviews   I'm definitely considering fire emblem now as it seems to be a well-liked game! And I love Animal Crossing as well!   Thanks! Is earthbound a virtual console game?

 I volunteer as tribute!    Not to mention how deliciously tantalizing the food looks all the time, regardless if it's human half the time.    That was so clever. I lol'd out loud.    Damn... thought the show was gonna have back to back seasons with kinky group sex scenes in it.   TBH it's a shame that guy had to die so quickly... he seemed kind of interesting actually.    I can almost taste everything on the screen.    This season clearly needs more orgies, especially with Wendigos.    I like what you did there.   Until Abel Gideon turns it around and BURNS Hannibal hardcore with only one limb.   Though it's a little hard to feel too bad for her... her curiosity of what Hannibal would do while unbound by his person suit outweighed the obvious option of call the police and shoot Hannibal.    She was so elegant and apparently calm too.    OMG that trailer for next week's episode looks ridiculous!!    Damn son! Abel Gideon calling Hannibal out with ONLY ONE limb left! Doesn't poor lonely Hannibal wish he could be dining with Will Graham?    ...And curiosity killed the cat. Damnit Bedelia    Gillian Anderson is so beautiful and graceful. Please survive this season.    Is anyone else finding these flashback scenes with Abel Gideon absolutely morbid?    Damnit that TA dude seems pretty cool... I'm pretty sure he's gonna die though.    Or you might not emerge alive.    That moment when Bedelia realizes why Hannibal's feeding her what he's feeding her.    Is it that kind of party?  ...Such a shame.    Anyone else tweeting for the first time in a long time?    Don't go to Hannibal's for dinner. Bad decision.    Cry... I want to be there.    I'm not sure about the legal technicalities, but I feel like another network or Netflix could possibly be interested in picking Hannibal up... a lot of critics consider it one of the best shows on TV right now. That's gotta count for something in this day and age.   Thanks for the rec!    Second this recommendation - the best I've had in the Triangle so far.    Oliver's inflections and way of speaking is much better than Fisk's. I can understand Oliver completely, whereas for Fisk, half the time I have no idea what he's saying because he's so terrible.   And yes, there are regional accents for Mandarin, but she just sounds like someone who doesn't speak it trying speak it. A "southern" accent in Mandarin still wouldn't sound like that. Also, if she's from HK, the locals don't speak Mandarin there.    As a speaker of both Mandarin and Japanese, his Mandarin is pretty terrible (it's one of the worst ones I've heard in recent memory) and his Japanese accent is fairly average / decent enough.   The actress for Madame Gao isn't a native speaker of Mandarin either. She has all the inflection and pauses, etc correct, but it's pretty accented (she sounds like she might be a native Cantonese speaker.)    Are there still items up for auction?    I've seen the movie so I guess not a terribly big spoiler. Didn't realize it was a series - I'll check it out. Thanks!    Examples: Hannibal Lector, Dexter Morgan, Jeremy in the Carson Ryder series,    Specifically, I'm trying to find books or series where there's a recurring serial killer who's not the main antagonist, but some sort of chaotic neutral character who may even help the main character (such as in the example of Jeremy in the Carson Ryder series).   But I'll take general recommendations that fit the title as well. Thanks!   Hey Triangle represent! I'll have to swing by sometime.    Holy crap - I have this white bear!! (And here I was scrolling through this thread thinking about how adorable this thread was with all the many lives of OP's bear). His nose is squished in just like your bears' too! I would send along a pic but he's at my parents house in storage somewhere.       Great example!    What? $12/year? That's really good for unlimited photo storage! I have like close to 1 TB of photos.    Yuup. I didn't watch it in theaters but this is exactly how me and my brother treated the movie and we had a blast. We laughed so much we almost cried, especially during that White House lawn chase scene.    Sorry out of town this weekend!   I don't we've seen the last of him, but yes agreed. I'm really excited to see more of Ward and of him fully stepping into his role as the villain. I felt like they kept teasing a possible redemption this season, but that would been so unrealistic.    White House Down. Minigun mounted SUV chases the Presidential Limo around... on the White House lawn... 'nuff said.    As a first gen immigrant to the US, this sounds like my childhood.    I think we'll see a return from him at some point next season. He's too good of a character.    Loved the semi-dark sounding music in the background when Snart and Flash teamed up.    Agree - thought he was going to get offed saving Skye these last few episodes, but I guess he was just so good they had to keep him on.    Oh no. Fitz is never going to forgive himself for it. :(    I demand Robo!Coulson.   Nah, they wouldn't do that, but I'm guessing some sort of mind control or temporary insanity for at least part of the next season.    I didn't realize he had been memory wiped - just thought he was calmed down and rehabilitated. :(    And then bam, date cancelled.    This is Captain America all over again. NOoooooo. Jemma better not go all Winter Solider on us next season.    And they tied up all the other story threads so well and then BAM CLIFFHANGER.    Join me, and together, we can rule the MCU as mother and daughter!!   Quickest aww to noo in 30 seconds flat.    Ditto this. But fish oil is good for you.    Coulson let Skye drive his baby???   Oh shit. Didn't even think of that. But really looking forward to more powered people next season.    Mack's gonna feel extra shitty about himself when they figure it out.    Ward as new head of Hydra? CANT WAIT FOR NEXT SEASON.    I demand Robo!Couslon next season (or Darth!Coulson!)     I felt like most of my marriage to Bobbi was a trap.   I love these two - they're so perfect for each other. Im actually really really glad they didnt move forward with the SHIELD spin off the show just wouldnt be the same without the two of them. Also, glad they made it through this episode because it looked a little questionable right around the one hour mark.    Kyle MacLachlan killed it in this episode.   Not in the literal sense, but RIP Cal. :(    WHAT WAS THAT ENDING??? Full on AWW to NOO in 30 seconds flat!   She had a good heart. It was just torn out. :(   As much as Jiaying went from manipulative to batshit insane in this episode, you couldnt help but to feel sorry for her and what she went through at Whitehalls hands.   EDIT: ~~Worn~~ Torn   Join me, and together, we can rule the MCU as mother and daughter!!   Love the concept. Given Wachowski's have done the Matrix and Cloud Atlas and this gives me a Heroes vibe... I can see this being really awesome. Fingers crossed. Either way, I'm excited Netflix is jumping head first into original productions.    Ha, this would be the perfect nod.    One quick question: is this open to all types of fantasy (specifically urban fantasy) or would you be looking for something that's more in the vein of traditional/high fantasy?    This absolutely stunning. I know you have an entire thread full of people telling you already, but I really enjoy art of all mediums and this is incredibly beautiful and unique and I can only imagine the career you'll have ahead of you. I wish I were in a point in my career/life where I can afford to drop thousands on this and keep it for myself, but sadly I'm not.   Also, as someone who works in business/finance, I agree with the other posters when I say you should absolutely take no less than $5K for this. You should probably ask for more and I wouldn't be surprised if you could sell this for upwards of $10K to the right buyer. Here's a helpful hint, in all negotiations, always let the other person give you a starting price. You may be surprised at what they start with.      Wow... this is a fantastic opportunity. I'm not sure if any of my short fiction will qualify (on the humor bit), but thank you so much for taking the time for doing this for the community. It's very generous and I respect that immensely.    You were so close! It was Miller's Crossing. :)   My full list for reference:      1. Miller's Crossing  2. No Country for Old Men   3. Barton Fink   4. Fargo   5. A Serious Man      6. True Grit   7. Burn After Reading   8. The Big Lebowski          9. O Brother, Where Art Thou?    I'm clearly a bigger fan of their darker more dramatic works with the exception being Fargo. I love Miller's crossing not for what the Coen brothers are typically known for, but simply because I love Tom Reagan's character and I'm a sucker for mob movies. Objectively, I think that No Country is probably their best movie (followed closely by Fargo). I think a lot of people like the Big Lebowski or O Brother because they are the most accessible of their works (minimal amounts of death/murder and generally light hearted in tone).   Agree with you that I definitely want to watch Blood Simple (and eventually Inside Llewlyn Davis) at some point as well, though right now I'm just waiting for their new movie, Hail Caesar to come out.     Nope. As much as I love No Country (coming in at #2)... you're looking for my personal favorite here, which incidentally is also the first Coen Brothers movie I watched.    Nope and nope. I haven't seen Raising Arizona (I've seen 9 Coen Brothers movies) and as much as I love True Grit as a movie overall, on my Coen list it comes in at #6.    Close, but no cigar. That's #2.   Still nope. Though I'd put Fargo at #4.    Still nope!    Nope!    Coen Brothers, 26.    They look way too young.   Also, waaay too much photoshopping here.    I'm really looking forward to the rest of his career actually. Think he's gonna be one of next bigs of the next generation from Britain.     Or the scene where One Two basically tells him to shut his pie hole at the party about what happened the night before.    That song was just perfect for that trailer. I also liked the part where Tom Hardy says "Me and my brother" and the song goes "which one will you choose". Great throwback to an era from yesteryear.    I'm really looking forward to all the awesome stuff that Taron Egerton does in the future. He was ridiculously good in Kingsmen.    Sorry I really don't remember. I added the song only about a week before it got deleted. It want to say it featured a more mainstream DJ or mainstream artist in the song, but it didn't really sound like them.   When the song opens there's about 45secs-1min of non-80s sounding edm music, then the beat kicks in around then. Think the singer's voice sounded a little like La Roux, but I don't think if that's just because her stuff also sounds similar.    Hm it's more upbeat and has a faster tempo than this song, but thanks for the guess!    Hi guys, I'm looking for a track I recently added to my spotify playlist but was removed. I don't remember much else of the song other than it had an 80s beat/vibe to it and there was a female singer (who also was singing in an 80s tone). Believe it from one of the more popular artists or featured one, but I can't remember anything else other than that for the life of me.  Any help would be appreciated - thanks!    Thanks will try!

Everyone: No.    Did they just really blow up the Bus?? I kept hoping it was a decoy Bus they got from fake Shield.    Gemma not joking about killing Ward... :(   Ward disappointed at her change... :(    I've really missed Ward... so nice to have the team all back together again.    Man... Ward's apology speech... really tugged at my heartstrings. Made me want to believe. :( But I just have to remember manipulative psychotic Ward from before.    Gemma really creeping me out with her sweet... "he didn't make it".    Welp we finally got the team back together!    Creepy Jenna smiling and being like "he didn't make it".    Ward redemption makes me hope....   Finally got the team back together!    I usually only buy, but I think their prices are a little high. You can generally find the same or similar items through Vinted or Poshmark or eBay. Though obviously they won't have return policies.    Yeah I got one too, but it's weird because I don't really post to this sub so I'm not really sure how I got it?    Was it for just the day or over a weekend? I need some place to leave my car for 3-4 days.    Hey guys, I'm thinking of taking Megabus up to DC for a weekend and I'm trying to figure out the best place to park my car for the weekend near downtown Durham where the Amtrak station is.   I know the Durham decks are free after 7PM and on weekends, but am I just allowed to leave my car parked there all weekend? I'ved parked at the deck on Magnum (across the street from Rue Cler) on weekends before and it seems like the gate is just up all the time.   If not, is there a deck somewhere that does allow overnight/weekend parking? (I don't mind paying I'm just trying to figure out my options).   Thanks!    No definitely a Captain Jack Sparrow reference.    I'm sorry Raylan, but it most definitely does NOT fit.    Huh, didn't even think of that.   Tho I still didn't think I understand why that incident caused her relationship with her husband to implode.    Wow, that's surprisingly spot on. Except Vader was never as batshit insane as Cal.    So well cast and great acting all around as well.    I almost felt like he was in on it... it seemed like he was bringing the food. Wouldn't it be odd for the three of them to just have been there with the door wide open if everything was supposed to be hush hush?    He's dedicated the last 26 years of his life to finding his daughter... that's enough to drive anyone a little mad.   I'm all onboard the Cal redemption train... though I feel like it might be setting him up for some horrible gut wrenching death.    To be fair, the fam dinner was super sweet... also a little sad... also a little weird and creepy... though definitely heartwarming.   I'm onboard.    I'm so happy that Coulson, Hunter and Fitz are getting back together now.    It wasn't a dream!! Ohhh snap!    God that Skye and fam dinner was sooo sad and weird and cute and heartwarming at the same time.    Key is to wait for 30% off sales or BOGO50% then stack with the coupons. Also, sign up for the Express rewards program, stack those rewards on top. Most things I buy there wind up being so ridiculously cheap they're practically F21 prices.     Pretty much all stores unless it's high end name brand stuff that never goes on sale... but I'm not shopping at those places anyways.   Express is probably one of the worst offenders on the list. I love that store, but if you buy anything there for less than 40% off you are seriously getting ripped off.   	124
 well i would still love to hear about your time hangin out with those bands. maybe you could do an AMA sometime or something like that   do you still live in seattle? i linked you to a Mad Season song before i saw that you hung out with alice in chains. i did my college essay on Spoonman. if you're still in seattle lets grab a few drinks sometime   hey op - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fm72DPJCX58  mad season - river of deceit   I do to but only when I camp. But I did steal someone's hub cap one time to use as a base so I didnt start a forest fire. I put it on the roof of their car in the morning burnt and charred. Feel bad about that   damn, thanks i had no idea that was possible. i was thinking about making them out of skateboard wheels   "Mexican officials late Saturday said he was apprehended with a man identified as Carlos Manuel Hoo Ramirez, contradicting earlier reports that he was arrested with a woman."  #REKT   he posted it to a different subreddit each time   i like your other video too. any damage to the motorcycle? i wonder if i should put sliders on my supermoto after i get it   school security guard put a boot on my car so i took off the tire, took the boot off, put tire back on and was driving away when he came out. he pulled me out of my car and searched my car without permission (later he said i gave him permission) and found a bb gun i forgot about. when i went to jail i spilt some hot ham juice on my foot and got a huge blister bubble (hot ham juice is the most dangerous weapon in jail, that shit was over 100 degrees) but aside from that jail was pretty cool. just watched family guy and played cards and read all day, got 3 meals a day and could take a shower whenever i wanted. i kinda want to go back to jail   they chose that job so they could abuse their authority and go on power trips, that's what appealed to them and made them go after those jobs. nobody wants to look closely at people's assholes but i guess domination over other people outweighed the downside for them. i hope none of the reddit mods decide to be prison guards, that's a scary thought   if i ever cried i would die of dehydration. i'm like the people in Dune    my piss tastes like Rainier or Rainier tastes like my piss    "yeah me and my playstation are gonna have a wild night." i might also try to finish that movie i have watched every night this week but only remember a few more minutes of it everytime   i've lived in seattle my whole life and never done any of the cool stuff on that site. never even been to the spaceneedle    jpepe is a poop name. unless your last name is pepe then i'm sorry   light has energy, when it encounters an object it pushes it a little bit so you weigh more when the lights are on NASA has to account for light when it goes on long missions. chicago weighs 300 pounds more when its sunny, faggot   i'm have to remember that line.   not for OP's friend now   starring that one black girl in that movie where she overcomes adversity and hardship, while being oppressed into having to attend school   i guess i shouldn't of pissed on my laptop. but maybe the fucker deserved it, i don't remember   what is Grain belt? i'm a washingtonian and love my craft beers too, especially when i go down to oregon.   i keep a beer koozie in my shower so i can hawaiin hotbox and drink cold beers   Look on the bright side, you might just have parkinsons   Widespread panic   I sleep good. When I used to sleep sober I'd hum the cat-dog cartoon song to sleep   Something just downloaded onto my phone when I clicked that link. Better not have a fucking penis on my phone now   You're shoes will be fine. You don't want to know what my wallets been throu   That's disgusting I would smell like piss for weeks   Can you please shoot a video of like a dozen guys titty fucking an obese woman with different parts of fat on her body? Please. And then link to me after?    I really want to watch a video of like a dozen guys titty fucking an obese woman with different parts of fat on her body. Sadly no such video exists   No I had the shower running so nobody would hear the lotion and to get the water hot. But I came too fast the water was cold   Anyone know if a video exists of like a dozen guys titty fucking an obese woman at the same time but with different parts of fat on her body? I need this.    We accept him! We accept him! One of us! One of us! Gooble gobble! Gooble gobble!   I just tasted my cum too! Parents wanted to Skype with relatives so I took a shower and unrolled the hose. I was on my back and meant to cum on my shirt but came too hard. Fuckin Jenni lee...   i asked my dad for a zip (an ounce of weed) when i meant to ask my friend dave. i then told him a zip meant a full tank of gas because i panicked.    "if marriage didn't exist would you invent it? would you say to your girlfriend, 'hey baby. this shit's so good let's get the government in on it. i love you so much let's get lawyers and judges involved'" - doug stanhope (paraphrased)   $10,000 bail = $1,000 bond. his family left him in there because they didn't want to lose $1,000?   i would rather have someone who does drugs in congress than someone who never has or sucked at using drugs   pterodactyl     i'm sure you can find the whole thing on reddit in 5 minute clips   men can't be raped you faggot   i didn't ask to be circumcised    so since it doesn't go through my stomach would i still piss myself? or would i piss out my asshole?   wasn't expecting that. have some of [this](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lryu9iTeb31r3bm2co1_500.jpg) and some of [this!](http://31.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ls3scfgKRT1qjcf0do1_500.jpg)   that's what i've been doing for awhile but doesn't seem to work. i tried swishing hydrogen peroxide around in my mouth but that always gets me close to puking   wow thank you. thanks a lot. how much toothpaste should i put in though?   i usually only smoke when i drink. and average 1.5 cups of coffee a day   "In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony god's blessing. But because, I am enlightened by my intelligence."    fighting ninjas in the backyard and using pine cones as grenades. no wonder they gave me special education      i would dress as a hobo and hold a sign that says "single mother, please help. god bless"   i drank my piss when i thought it was beer. it tasted kinda like oxygenated beer so i took another sip, then i realized. i also drank chewing tobacco spit    [Joe Camel](http://eppy7890.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/joe_camel.jpg)   these fucking assholes call them munchies and they put pretzels in them. what kind of sick bastard would do that?   fuck munchies. who the fuck thought it would be a good idea to put pretzels in them? i give the pretzels to my dog so he'll drink beer   my mom stole my weed   i was forced to go to NA awhile ago. i think that if you want to stop drinking then you should go. why wouldn't you go if there's a small chance it will help you reach your goal? yes it's extremely religious but that only takes up a few minutes of it, the rest is about hearing other talk openly   i want to, i just don't know where or how to start   how do i go about learning more about a PC? the audio on my laptop stopped working so i learned how to uninstall the audio driver and then restore my laptop to how it is when you first buy it. but that's all i know how to do know.    do you have the one of the dog with the smile?   i understand why the US gives so many billions of dollars to Israel, but at some point it's like we're financing terrorism... again   i hope he gets compensation for this happening to him and i really hope those officers lose their jobs, but any money he receives comes from tax payers.    you're old enough to shoot people and get shot at for your country but not old enough to smoke a cigarette?   remember to stay hydrated buddy   i guess there's a benefit that all japanese teenagers never leave their room   how did he only shoot 3 people? does he have parkinson's disease?   i just watched Person of Interest and thought that guy would make the perfect batman   i don't know. i'd rather not have a job and still get paid   well i guess it's ok as long as it's on purpose.          i think so too because i've heard dogs try to run when they sleep. can dogs talk to other dogs like humans talk?   	72
 That's the nice thing about humor; there is a flavor for everyone.  I'm more of a Louis C.K. fan.   I bet it still tastes like freedom!       Oh, no offense taken.  It's funny how you go on hearing and saying things without ever really thinking about what it is that's being said.  Like that old McDonald's jingle, "two all beef patties...blah blah...on a seseme-seed bun."  I'll start saying in from now on.   I think he's throwing gang signs.  Kids these days...   I'm a grown ass man and this shit's funny. Get off your high horse and get a sense of humor.   You can kill a sub, but you can never kill what that sub represented.   This scientific study proves it.   As do I  _   Here in Murika we use stupid units of measurement...   I didn't add that factorial and didn't notice it until now. Good eye.   You're right. I'm so used to hearing "on a bun" or "on rye" but it really is *in*, isn't it.      I don't have enough fucks left explain to you the point of this.   [Slow clap]   I agree.  I cook and make cocktails with lemon.  Also, lemon has plenty of sugars naturally.   Side note; Liz Lemon is alright by me too.   *Before 5pm   Hurray! and Thank you!    /r/fatpaohate  Oh wow, my first time being the first poster to a sub. I feel honored.   Time to update the 'ol resume.      YISSSSS!!! They're GRowing BIggerrrr!      I'm thinking fork lifts.    Let's go for circus sideshow fat!   I know their fatter than this.  Should have made the measurement in stones. Or maybe included the weight of their ego.   Thin privilege is making the rest of Wildwooders feel disgusting by comparison.       That's the most disgusting thing I've heard all week. It's like a gross coffee smoothie. I hate it when fat people try to act tough. It's like, we know your T count is low af and your bones are weak. Who are you trying to fool?   Crystal is one with the rug.   I asked: Confirmed Sith   That sounds really good. I think I'm going to make that into a cocktail actually. But here in America; without adequate sugaz we go into starvation mode and get fatter.   It's a trashy good time...when you're in high school.    TIL again. The Beetus thus forth.   The betes is strong along the jersey shore.  	34
 Why on earth is this on /r/askreddit?    So the WSJ thing I want to get working with or without the root. Was asking how to get that 'gift' in the first place.   Also, when you say warranty, do you mean Samsung's warranty? I have t-mobile's stupid warranty for $8 a month.  And what about this site?   http://galaxynote4root.com/      Why is the aspect ratio so lame?   Why is the aspect ratio so lame?   It will help the GOP.  "Senator, what is your position on gay marriage" "Why is that significant? That issue has already been decided. My stance on gay marriage, pro or against, would have no bearing on how I will govern. Next question".   1. I want to root my phone. I have a T-mobile SM-910T. Will this help with my battery life? My battery life SUCKS after the lollicrap update (can we start calling it **Lollicrap** please?). So can I root this phone? I know for some phones you can't. I also don't know/care what KNOX is.  2. I remember I got a Samsung gift for 6 months free of WSJ, but I never did anything with it, and kind find any info. Anyone know what I need to do? I've had the phone for 7 months already - but I never activated the subscription, so I should still in theory be able to use it.  EDIT: this second question is completely unrelated    Ok cool thanks. I'm not sure if I personally see value in that, but that's a good distinction.   No, not bootstrap paradox. It's the **'Predestination Paradox'** - which is not actually a paradox.    Why should I use Atom instead of Sublime Text 3 (other than $$)?   Thanks Obama   I have it, and it's my favorite. It's awesome.    Probably because they didn't think of it first  This.   "Come, and journey into the mystical forest of the elves..."   Wow. Love it.   Amazing color. It almost doesn't even look real. Great stuff.   That's an amazing reflection   All those people who killed themselves after watching Avatar should have just come to /r/earthporn.   Wait but you only get the 1% back if you spend it as credit - which you can't do when loading redcard.   Ah I see. So you just don't like the naming convention. That makes sense - especially since Vegeta went from SSJ2 to SSJ4 - which doesn't make sense if that's how you name it.    Yea I don't plan on doing more than $500, maybe $1,000 a month. I really just want some points and to pay some bills using REDcard.   I have a Paypal Business Debit Mastercard. I'm wondering if I can use it to load my REDcard account. Has anyone tried this? The CVS by me allows me to buy Paypal cash cards with a CC - which is great, because the fee is only $3.95 for a $500.00 purchase.  For the record, there are 2x such CVS that I know do this.  * CVS on Howard and Western (Chicago) * CVS in Ogilvie Train Station (Chicago)   I'm wondering what /u/shewdz would say. He complains that SSJ4 isn't an advancement from SSJ3.   but it kind of muddles the SSJ line as theoretically you could achieve it after only achieving SSJ1  By that logic, SSJG is even worse. You don't even have to become an SSJ to become an SSJG.   I see what you did there.   You mean like SSG?   Then how do you feel about SSG?   That response was way too PG-13.   Judgemental. Very judgemental   Awesome. This deserves more upvotes.   Vox. A very, unbaised, legitimate news source...  Not saying they are wrong, but posting a liberal blog to outline a Republican is just kind of stupid and couldn't possibly lead to an objective analysis.   I have a neighbor who has a sign on his lawn that says, "black lives matter". I want to put a sign next to his saying, **"white lives don't"**.    Banning in general? No, it's idiotic and goes apart from the 1st Amendment. Banning from official public properties, and issued material? Yes.  Agreed. That's an important distinction.   I am pretty pro-gun for the most part. But honestly, the two day waiting period seems pretty reasonable. I mean, if you order a gun, it might take a while before you get it. 2 days? I think it's more than appropriate.  EDIT: you guys are right - if you already own guns, then the waiting period makes absolutely no sense. So what about the woman who needs a gun to protect herself **now**? We make her wait? Good point. we don't want that.   Didn't we see the same thing about another state recently?   I am nano offended by your micro offendedness of micro aggressions   I'm coming from windows/Linux, and the Finder has been infuriating. I know you posted a month ago, but I hear you. Finding the path, opening a terminal from the finder, or moving up one directory should not require research. Very frustrating.   I was absolutely infuriated with the finder last night. Same of the same complaints. It's really shit, honestly. Shouldn't have to do a Google search to figure out how to find the current path or how to move up a directory.  And how about opening the terminal from the finder? No? I need an app for that? FU Apple.    That Illiana bullshit needed to die. Leftovers of spending hungry Democrats.   It's not baffling whatsoever. Look at the shape this city and state is in.  As /u/TheJPdude says, people voted *against Quinn*, not *for Rauner*.   IIT - Illinois Institute of Technology. It's a private school on the South side of Chicago.   Two games for Christmas hardly classifies as "Richie Rich". I know you are being sarcastic and making a joke btw.  Anyway kids nowadays, even kids in middle class, get brand new phones for their bdays - you know, $700 phones. I know there is inflation, but holy crap that's a lot of money compared to 2x N64 games.   The word *could* is used over and over again. But is it practical? It sounds a little bit like fear-mongering. I'm not educated on this topic, I'm just telling you my impression from that info-graphic.   You had a second one!   Thanks, got it.    If you think there job is to tell the truth and the honest news of what's going on, your bullshitting yourself.  If you think **their** job.  EDIT: another typo for you:   your bullshitting yourself  **You're** bullshitting yourself   Well, he does *talk about news*. I mean, he makes fun of it. but really most of the time he has a political undertone, and has quite the bias. I would say it's closer to a political talk show than news or comedy.    Oh man I hope they make at least one of them kosher.   Personal story here.   **I used to steal the little caps on the tires of cars.** Some crazy ass kid got me into it. I would go to parking lots and look for cars with tire caps that looked shiny. The best were the special ones like [this from a Porche](http://img0083.popscreencdn.com/105230619_agt-aluminum-silver-valve-caps-tire-cap-stem-for-porsche.jpg). I had about 60-70 of these cool tire caps until I got caught around the age of 15. I didn't even actually arrested. They took me to the local police station and called my parents. That was enough to scare me straight.  Yea, I'm white.   Tumblr comments.      Rafael Nadal. Such an amazing player, and has made tennis so much fun to watch the past 10 years.   -Barack Obama   If they don't think it's satire, what do they think it is?    They do, it's just their rating are horrendous compared to FOX, and most mainstream media has a heavy liberal bias, so no one sits and scrutinizes MSNBC like we scrutinize FOX.    That were going fucking broke.  Chicago/Illinois.   Had to read that story in french class.   You are most welcome.   A little? I'm 5'8, somewhat muscular, and 200 lbs. But even when I was 170 lbs I had the same problem. It doesn't seem to be about the weight.   People who overshare, and only the share the best parts of their lives. Not only that, but they always make it look like they are the shit. It's like their entire Facebook page exists to make them look like a douche. Good job, you did it.   You came here to be a grammar nazi?   That's not a word.  That's like saying "I'd'like" is normal. It's not, but "I'd like" is. No such conjugation "J'm'apelle" exists in the French language. It's simply incorrect, and I'm quite sure you have no idea wtf you're talking about.   And... So because he shouted during the state of the Union he is racist? Are you serious? How does that help your ridiculous claim?   Nobody claimed that. That's just a cheap trick on your part  You said the idiot who shouted is from South Carolina, whose state capitol is racist because it has a confederate flag, and because that racist mass-killer killed people.  Now that you've established that area to be racist - (because of the flag and one person), you go on to say...   Now, it could very well be a coincidence that a congressman  wait for it...    from a racist state happened to shout during the State of The Union  You literally obtain your conclusion from the fact that the shouter is 'from a racist state'.   1. Not all people in SC are racist. Making such a claim is ignorant and devoid of any factual evidence. 2. You conclude that A) because the shouter was from SC B) He shouted during the SOTU, and C) Obama is black, that it *must be because of race*.  And then you have the audacity to tell me 'nobody claimed that', when in fact, **you did**.   So anyone from South Carolina, who says the President lies, is racially charged?   Wow. This is the type of thinking that fuels racial tensions.    I think there's no way he would have done it to a white president  I'm sure there would be no difference, as long as the President is a Democrat.    Je m'appelle Unidan is proper.  J'm'appelle is just plain retarded. I didn't notice what I had typed initially.    I didn't think I was correcting you. I did correct you.  No. No you didn't.    less likely to get divorced even if it's a shitty relationship  Kind of an unproven statistic. Many people who are not religious stay in terrible marriages for their children. Or just cheat.   It's not about moving in together necessarily, but that people tend to move in together for necessity. The relationships progresses in a sense, but not for a good reason - it could be to save money/time, someone needs to move anyway, etc. It's not a properly thought out decision - and when big decisions like that are made out of convenience - that usually ends in divorce.   Think about people who get married because the girl got knocked up. Those marriages rarely work out. They made a big decisions in regards to their relationship for the wrong reasons.   If you think you are correcting me, you are a moron, and quite lazy.    Bernie Sanders stood for LGBT Equality long before it was acceptable.  This shows his sincerity, whereas Clinton only came out as pro-gay when the polls were in her favor to do so.    I favorited someone (@buysellshort). I also made sure my phone gets notifications from Twitter. However I still don't get notified when @buysellshort Tweets. The message popped up on my phone that I will now get notifications when he tweets. Anyone else have this problem?   PCworld article here:  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2939321/google-finally-makes-undo-send-an-official-gmail-feature.html      This could be the greatest addition to email in the history of the world, err, internet.   J'mappelle unidan   Also floss, and use mouthwash.     Don't marry someone before you've lived with them.  Disagree with that one, but that's just me. A lot of studies show that those who move in together too quickly, are much more likely to get divorced   Don't commit to the first pretty girl that comes along because you don't think you'll ever do better.  For sure   Looks are not everything, a nice pair of tits does not compensate for a lack of personality.  Yup.   This.  And the only people that would believe they were the first to find out, are probably the same type of people who have already called for the 'rapture' in the past.   No one would believe them. Basically, nothing would happen.   I ask Xavier from X-Men.  [CALM YOUR MIND] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBRlM9hN0GQ)   I sweat waay too much for a normal person. I am hot when everyone is cold. I sweat just from walking, even when it's 60 degrees out. Battling my sweat/heat is a daily grind.   Sounds like you don't have a soul, ginger - so you don't apply to this thread.   In school, 8th grade. Some kid in my class came up to me with this super-excited face and said, "Dude! Someone just bombed the Pentagon!".   The deserves to be at the top.   What's a Jewish supremacist group?    Reminds me of when Westboro said the V Tech shootings happened because of gays. It's almost not even worth responding to such things.    I hate my focus. I'd rather be driving something else. Only have it because of the wife.    I can do all that, but I'll never give up my Nespresso. Nespresso, by the way, is recyclable, unlike Keurig (read like, 'tastes like ass').   Do wah. Do wah.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Horner   Where were these teachers when I was in school??    Good  Good ^thing you **didn't** quote him    I hardly think this is genuine concern for civil rights at its best.  Since politicians are generally never sincere, I'd say you are probably right.    Good thing you quoted him.  Good thing you quoted Him  GoOd quOTEd thing you *him***  **Good** ^thing you *quoted* him    Never heard of the CTS, CTS-V, or Escalade?  Yeah I have. They are crap.   How can you put BMW and Cadillac in the same sentence? And BMW has some of the highest residual value in the industry. Not as much for the other two.    Good thing you quoted him.  Good thing you quoted him   You might need to look into taking some medication... or getting some help...    If he likes to lift, he should probably start lifting more.  OOOOOHHHHHH! BURN!   8 inches. Around. Think about it.    Also, OP forgot the serious tag.  Good call.    I think it's safe to say that people who fly the confederate flag are probably too credulous  Kind of a douchey comment honestly. You've already made up your mind about someone who hasn't even verbalized their opinion yet. It's quite closed minded, and doesn't yield to an open discussion. I have downvoted your comment accordingly.    "I'll do it later"   "I simply don't have time for video games right now"   Actually really liked that movie. It felt original in a sense of the general set up of the alien movie. They weren't invaders, but 3rd class citizens in our own world. It was pretty neat.   With that said, I'd love to see those aliens come back and take vengeance for all the crap the humans put them through.   To be fair, my Mom taught me great eating habits my entire life - and I still eat like a fat kid.   I'm 5"8, 205 lbs, slightly muscular. When my metabolism slows down even more (I'm 27), I'll gain weight very quickly.   Selfie   Direct violation of rule 3:   Questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere, provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls and surveys, etc.), or limit discussion are not appropriate.   No then we'll all be singing "Seven seven three, two-oh-two, LUUNAAAA!"   Jaywalking.   1. Raw chicken left in the garage. There were 50 maggots. 2. A dead squirrel that was partially decayed and stuck to my porch. Had to scrape it off. It was half eaten already. 3. The women's bathroom at Staples.

    Best of luck! I also gained everything back after a 28 lb loss several years ago, and I haven't made more than a token effort since then, but today's the day I buckle down too. I'll think of you as I'm trying to retrain my will power!       @anonymau5--No.   @bdavisx--as was widely reported, right-wing media immediately declared it was a gang sign, but it turned out to have been a college fraternity sign. So no, not an issue except as a flag for racists.   Tmbisrealcool--no, it was rather quickly determined to be a fraternity sign.   @brianhass--the FBI database has been found to omit many police shootings. Also, if the category is "justifiable," that is obviously not tracking those homicides that might not be justifiable.       @eatyourbrain -- Why do you say that? They are not drawing conclusions about the police shootings; the "malpractice" is the failure to compile national stats on police shootings. The government certainly keeps stats on just about everything else.   Here's another piece on the issue by NPR:  http://www.npr.org/2014/08/21/342228794/ferguson-turns-lens-on-police-involved-killings-but-some-facts-are-few In the NPR story, note what the U of Missouri prof says about the lack of info on police shootings:  "I've actually heard police executives say that they don't want to have a national reporting system because then people will compare and say, well, you know, this police department shoots more people than that police department. And it'll lead to problems"                @susannahnesmith--Bottom line is, though, as you say, that every writer is responsible for his researchers.                @GoddessWine--yes, the article explains that the LAPD's beating of Rodney King was the impetus for this law.                                    You look beautiful! Congrats! You lost 30 pounds in four months?!                        Thanks for your vigilance, umbra. Judging from your comments, including the one on the other version of this story, you have an interest in suppressing this type of news.

The cheaper plan offered featured 80 percent rather than 90 percent coverage but apparently has a meaningful out- of- pocket limit -- our current plan's out- of -pocket limit is so loaded with exceptions it's almost meaningless.  So I'm somewhat worried about what we'll get after next year but we'll see. Our business pays a ton for our group coverage.      	136
 I will, if possible    Great! waiting for your new movie and good luck :)   Haha, so will you choose to watch it again if you get any chance?    Yeah, word of mouth can make every movie successful.   Does this mean we have no more 007 series? What a pity!   I see~ So have you ever thought of the things about your second movie?       Why did you choose Suspicion to be your Directorial Debut? I mean you must have had some choices and why you finally chose Suspicion?    But creating heroes in the movie doesn't mean creating the heroes in our real life. In my opinion, in order to fulfill people's desire of heroes we need to make our nation stronger.    I can't agree more. And this kind of films are popular outside America, which enlarge the market and gives the film maker more profit to make. But now I want to know what things they will make into hero in the future. So far we have iron, spider and so many things. It seems that children and boys are more addicted to this kind of films.    Yes, so I mean there won't be so many women who want a guy at their father's age to be their boyfriend.    Haha, the monster on the cover is very cute.

 Ok.    The fearless hunter snatched her rifle, took aim at the deadly beast which was just 10 feet away, and gunned it down  saving her sibling's life   Tanner White reportedly went outside to feed the family's dogs but, as he walked back to the house, the cougar jumped out from under one of their cars.With the young boy seemingly unaware he was being followed, he let himself back inside the house and shut the door. His father then looked out the window and was stunned to see the cougar just feet away. Cal Treser, enforcement officer for Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife, revealed that little Shelby White  who has a permit to kill cougars  acted immediately. She grabbed her rifle and shot the cougar dead, before posing for pictures alongside her kill, he added.  The reason my granddaughter shot the cougar was because she was only one in our family that had a tag, William White says. Were trying to follow the law as best we can.   My point being, if you have the time to decide who should shoot the animal due to permits, then youre most likely not in a life or death situation. Or youre making bullshit up.     this is reddit, its what we do   Here's the jist of it. Tags are given by the state to control the taking of wild game, as to account for numbers and how many can be taken without endangering the species/family in the area. Its legal to kill these animals if you have the proper tags.  The problem is this. When you have 700 acres of land in the northwest, poaching is easy. The story that the family is going with absolutely makes no sense at all. They paint a picture of this 11 year old girl being a bad ass traccker, shes not. There is no way her and little brother are hanging out and she runs in the house, after making the ethical decision with her family that she should kill the cougar sense she was the only one with a tag, grabs a rifle and quick scopes a 3ft cougar "stalking" her brother. Especially with their prior engagements with endangered animals.  Favorite line is by the grandpa saying were just trying to follow the law as best as we can or what not. No, no, no my friend, your last issue wasnt a little mistake, it was you consciously killing an endangered animal then trying to mail it over the border under false labeling. You are not a law abiding sportsman, youre a piece of shit.

Its great man      You should have just freaking blew all of it at Pechanga Hotel   your correct   your wrong    Maurice Henry Pappworth (9 January 1910  12 October 1994) was a pioneering British medical ethicist and tutor, best known for his 1967 book Human Guinea Pigs, which exposed the unethical dimensions of medical research. Born and educated in Liverpool, Pappworth graduated as a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1932 from Liverpool University. After working in a series of junior medical positions, his applications for more senior posts were rejected because of his Jewish parentage. In the Second World War he served in the Royal Army Medical Corps. Having been unsuccessful in achieving a post in any well known London hospital after the war, he set up in London as an independent medical consultant and tutor.  Pappworth's teaching of postgraduate students had a profound effect on the Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP) examination pass rate, and his contact with junior doctors led him to investigate the ethics of medical research on humans. The publication of Human Guinea Pigs, which examined unethical medical research practices, exposed the subject to a wider audience and led to Pappworth's becoming persona non grata within the medical establishment for much of his career, but ultimately helped lead to stricter codes of practice for human experimentation.      if youre curious about the topic look up "Human Guinea Pig" By Maurice Henry Pappworth. Book covers the stories of service members affected by nuclear research / test that the government denies benefits for.

 Thanks for this info. :)   So talent agents look for people who are singing and dancing at public places such as restaurants?                  Great to hear! :) Frankly, we should hear about these kinds of stories more often. :) Seriously. :)   Yes, you are even more important than coal. :)   Good! :) After all, doesn't coal help contribute to climate change?    1/4000 x 18/100=0.0045%. Those are your odds of knocking a girl up with both forms of contraception in place.  I don't think that you are calculating this correctly. However, even if so, since these odds aren't good enough for at least some pro-choicers in the hypothetical event of an abortion ban, these odds likewise aren't good enough for me.  Plus, I have heard that condoms reduce sexual pleasure and intimacy. Thus, I certainly don't intend to wear a condom all of the time (though sometimes condoms might be necessary to wear for STD protection).  Outside of user error you're looking at even lower odds.  Yes, but I always take user error into consideration.  Honestly this is a really poor reason to make a decision like this and any licensed professional specializing in gender identity issues will be very very disinclined to provide you with what you want if you mention this as one of your reasons. Remember that it's part of a gender therapist's job to weed out the transgender's from the mere fetishists.  You might very well have a point here; however, I nevertheless need to do a test run on female hormones and anti-androgens just to see their impact on me. After all, I certainly can't keep this metaphorical box locked forever.  Plus, transitioning for fetishistic reasons is a bad remove since female hormones might very well reduce one's sex drive.   Alright look. After talking with you a little bit I honestly think you should do you, whatever you decide that is. It's just... what you were asking was a little concerning is all.  That's all. Just a little concerned about you.  Understood, and thanks for caring. :) Seriously. :) Also, though, for the record, I will certainly discuss all of these issues with a therapist at my university and then decide how exactly I should proceed from there. :) That sounds like a good plan--correct?    It's not quite a language disconnect. You can usually tell from a person's writing voice that english isn't their first language. Generally they make bizarre syntax choices or use phrases/words in a manner that isn't necessarily incorrect but isn't quite right either. But the writing is still filled with emotional context.  OK.   That's not what I detected here. Rather there's a weird level of emotional detachment to your writing. You come across as a fleshy computer making a logistical decision, not a trans person attempting to alleviate an emotional condition.  Well, the thing is that I am not a transgender person in the conventional/binary sense (I mean, I wish that I was a binary trans-woman, but I'm not). However, I could very well identify as gender-fluid/genderqueer/neutrois. Basically, I don't have much problems with living as an extremely feminine man for the rest of my life. However, I also often daydream about the idea of me being a woman, including having a female brain/mind and everything. Indeed, the concept of autogynephilia (in a broad sense--rather than only in a sexual sense) appears to describe me pretty well. (Yes, I am aware of the BS conclusions that transphobes have made form the autogynephilia concept, and I certainly don't agree with those BS conclusions.) Frankly, if I will live long enough and we will develop successful technology to change one's gender identity without significantly changing one's sexuality in the process, then I would probably seek to utilize this technology myself sooner or later. Seriously. After all, if I could become the (trans-)woman of my daydreams in every way, then why not do this at some point in my lifetime?  Also, for what it's worth, I previously discussed my history of cross-gender feelings here: http://www.crossdreamlife.com/viewtopic.php?f=1 t=2519  I also made some other posts on that forum which might interest you (under the username "Futurist"). Thus, please feel free to check out what exactly I wrote on that forum. :)  Given that, I'm not saying that this is actually the case, merely that your writing voice is so devoid of emotional context that it appears to be the case. I have no idea what is actually lurking under the surface of your mind.  Well, maybe now you have a somewhat better picture of what exactly is actually lurking under the surface of my mind. :)   The last person I got to know pretty well who was asperger's was also trans (FtM for the record). He didn't describe gender dysphoria (though that doesn't mean it wasn't there, I don't know his life like that) but seemed to think men get more respect in society and thus wanted to be identified as a man. It was less about who he innately saw himself as and more about his place in the herd and I can't help but wonder if you're not coming from a similar place. You seem to be under the impression that this choice your making will allow you to fill some role you see for yourself.  Actually, I think that my own case is different from the case of the trans-man whom you are describing here.   People on the autism spectrum in general don't seem to be strongly gendered in the classical sense and I'm personally inclined to think it comes with the territory of autism.  For all I know, you could be correct in regards to this.  Your dysphoria over your hairiness could also be a byproduct of ASD, less related to any ideas you have about gender and more just something your autistic brain cooked up as being unappealing.  Actually, it's not just that; after all, my excessive hairiness is also preventing me from cross-dressing, which I strongly want to do sometimes. :(   I'm not saying you shouldn't try to be whatever flavor of gender you want, cause buddy I'm the last person to try and talk you down from that. But I'm I personally believe that you're autistic and that your condition as such is coloring your choices.  OK.  You really need to speak to a professional before making any sort of permanent decisions about your body.  OK, and will do! :)    How certain are you that this is actually bullet-proof?  Castration? More certain than I am for anything else. (Of course, there can be a possibility of some testicle cells accidentally not being removed or the possibility of 1+ extra testicles existing somewhere else in one's body.) Of course, I could get my vas deferens snipped, cauterized, and tied in addition to getting castrated. After all, one is not incompatible with the other.   1 in 4000 is an incredibly low number.  And yet it is not good enough either for pro-choicers in the hypothetical event of an abortion ban or for me.  After all, these types of odds mean that out of every 10,000 male-bodied people who get this done, there is a whopping 92% chance that at least one of these male-bodied people's vasectomies will fail.  Combined with condoms and you're as close to bulletbabyproof as you can get on this earth.  I hate to break it to you, but condoms by themselves have about an 18% annual failure rate if one takes use error into account (as I always do). Also, that's just for one year--imagine what the data would look like for 10, 20, 30, et cetera years!  As I said before--my views on the risk are based on those of pro-choice people in the hypothetical event of an abortion ban. After all, I have hard pro-choicers complain many, many times to politically anti-abortion people about the risk of contraception failure and sterilization failure.  No no no. Hormones can have dangerous side-effects and it's not something you take for funsies. Seriously.  Yes, I agree that one always needs to be on the look-out for negative side-effects of hormone replacement therapy. However, it is also worth pointing out that, as far as I know, trans-men live about as long as cis-men do. Likewise, I would think that trans-women wouldn't live much less than cis-women do if one takes transphobia out of the picture.  Furthermore you could end up growing tits which kind of runs counter to your goal of a more androgynous look.  So do you have a way of taking female hormones and not growing tits?  Also, it is worth noting that tits can be hidden and that I can get surgery to remove my tits later on if I will get desperate. Also, for the record, some cis-men also have female-like breasts and even female-like nipples.  If the hair bothers you get it lasered off.  Yes, that's what I intend to do for the rest of my body, along with electrolysis for my face.   Go see a real doctor not some idiot you talked to on a message board.  Agreed. Of course, it is worth noting that I could also try out anti-androgens and female hormones (preferably with the help of a doctor) and see if I will like them. It other words, it would be a test run of sorts. :)   Someone with credentials needs to talk you down from this ledge.  We'll see about that.   I have no idea what you even mean by this or what kind of expectations you've placed on blocking testosterone production in your body. I sense that things will not work out the way you hope, however.  What I mean is that I would like to reduce my sex drive and also to give sexual arousal more meaning by making orgasms longer. After all, I currently orgasm too quickly, which in turn reduces the meaning and value of orgasms for me.  Also, again, there is always the possibility of doing a test run with anti-androgens and with female hormones before I will decide whether or not to proceed with surgical castration. :) In addition, though, I have to try out anti-androgens and female hormones in any case in order to get a clearer picture of my own gender identity. While I obviously have some cross-gender feelings, I'd like to see if these feelings are even deeper than I realize. Frankly, doing this previously helped some other cross-dreamers get a clearer picture of their own gender identity; thus, perhaps doing this will likewise do the same for me. :)   Actually, becoming a eunuch by cutting off my testicles with scissors is way worse than injecting alcohol into my testicles. After all, I have heard that the scissors route can result in me being dead in several minutes as a result of massive blood loss. :(    I don't intend any insult with this question, but have you ever been diagnosed on the autism spectrum?  No, but I suspect that I might have Asperger's and/or some amount of OCD.  Also, though, for what it's worth, English is not my first language. Thus, maybe this helps make my writing voice off-putting (which, for the record, I sincerely apologize for).   Don't worry--after all, I certainly intend to discuss all of this with a therapist at my university once my summer vacation is over and then take it from there. :)   He was still an anti-Semite when he discovered this news, though. This is why I didn't write "former" in my thread title here.      Out of curiosity--won't all of the British intelligence files in regards to Rudolf Hess's death likewise come out in 2017?   Hopefully this question is okay to ask here.  Anyway, who exactly are your favorite androgynous fictional characters?  As for me, Dio Eraclea from Last Exile would definitely be either at or near the top of my list in regards to this. :)    I DO hope you get through this in a safe, medical setting. Good luck with your aspirations!  Thank you very much! :)   Just don't do something based on something some moron on the interwebs said.  Believe me--I would strongly prefer to get this done in a safe, medical setting. Let us just seriously hope that gate-keeping among doctors won't prevent me from getting this done in a safe, medical setting, though.    I feel like you are having a bit of dysmorphia about your sack.  Maybe, but if so, at least I have practical reasons for this dysmorphia.   You can't couch your issues in different flavors to solve your goals man, thats not logical. You should understand that the lack of testosterone from a full castration will make you not care about that stuff nearly as much as you do now.  Oh sure, but I will still have a romantic attraction to some women, now wouldn't I?   You could find yourself alone and confused from lack of drive to pursue others. These are things you might not learn by asking one sided questions.  While I might have less drive to pursue others sexually, I will still have a lot of drive to pursue others romantically. Plus, it's not like women have zero sex drive.   I have balls but no sex drive, enough that I worry about taking testosterone supplements.  Exactly how old are you, though?   I ruined several relationships because neither of us understood how to talk about the problem.  I am sorry to hear that. :(   I hope you can find someone to talk to about your sexual needs and help you to find an answer that is beneficial to you before you do something drastic.  How about a therapist at my university, though?  I'm glad to pm in further if you like.  OK; thus, go ahead and do this! :) Seriously. :)   OK; good. :)   The worst way to do what, exactly?   Also, for the record, I will also allow you to read this explanation of mine in regards to this (I previously typed it up for another poster here):  I have three goals with an orchiectomy:  1. To achieve "bullet-proof" sterilization. Since all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization (including vasectomies) can and sometimes do fail, they are just not good enough for me.  2. If my expectations in regards to female hormones will turn out to be accurate, then I would want to use female hormones on a regular or at least on a semi-regular basis. After all, I have heard good things about female hormones from both trans-women and trans-men. However, I must find some way to still be able to get erections using my penis, as well as to still be able to have penis-in-vagina sex, while I am taking female hormones, since otherwise female hormones might not work for me.  3. To better regulate my sex drive and to give my ejaculations and sexual arousal more meaning.  In addition to this, though, independently of that, I also want to permanently get rid of as much of my body hair and facial hair as possible due to the fact that this hair makes me dysphoric (and I unfortunately have a lot of it, so yeah). Likewise, I want to feminize my face to some extent as well, though I still want to live as a man (albeit as a very feminine eunuch) most (but not all) of the time after I will get all of this done.   No problem! :)   Hopefully this question is okay to ask here.  Anyway, who exactly are your favorite androgynous fictional characters?  As for me, Dio Eraclea from Last Exile would definitely be either at or near the top of my list in regards to this. :)   Haha!   Actually, I *am* extremely paranoid in regards to unplanned pregnancy. You can thank pro-choicers for instilling a zero tolerance of risk in me in regards to this. Seriously. After all, I heard pro-choicers complain many, many times about contraception and sterilization failure. However, unlike these pro-choicers, I simply don't have the option of abortion in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, which in turn means that I absolutely cannot risk an unplanned pregnancy in the first place. Also, abstaining from sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me.  However, in addition to this, I did say that I am interested in using female hormones and reducing my sex drive, both of which is accurate. After all, I have heard (from both trans-women and trans-men) that female hormones make one more emotional, which is certainly something that I want. Plus, having a lower sex drive would be a good thing since it will allow me to focus more on other things but also allow me to have sex when I will want to. Plus, I have heard that female hormones increase the length of one's orgasm and make one body sexually aroused in a different way, both of which I would certainly like to try out. Also, I would like to have a more feminine face so that I would develop a more androgynous appearance.  In addition to this, though, I absolutely hate all of my body hair and facial hair and thus want to permanently get rid of as much of it as possible. This hair makes me feel dysphoric and I would prefer that all of it simply disappeared and never grew back. After all, I would like to have a more feminine and "clean" appearance as well as to cross-dress at times.   Well, I would strongly prefer to become a eunuch in a safe, medical setting. Thus, let us seriously hope that I will succeed in doing this.   A 0.07% chance of an unplanned pregnancy isn't good enough for some/many pro-choice females in the hypothetical event of an abortion ban. Thus, these odds likewise aren't good enough for me either.  As for injecting 190 proof alcohol into my testicles, I would only do it as a last resort if I could not become a eunuch in a safe, medical setting (which is my strong preference in regards to this).   You said it, cowboy (or cowgirl)! ;)   Oh, sure, the Iran fear-mongers have been wrong numerous times before!   But I will get to the emergency room in time to prevent it from killing me.   It's a different photo, though.   Yes, you can phrase it that way       That would SUCK!! I'm glad you made a solid recovery from that...  Thank you very much! :) Also, for the record, I had surgery done to eliminate my huge (1.3 cm) underbite a year ago. The recovery process from that surgery was extremely brutal (but I did fully recover in the end).  but injecting almost straight alcohol into your scrote?!? That may fucking kill you! There is blood flow there and it will go to your brain. I would not do this, what so ever!  Believe me--I will try extremely hard to get this done in a safe, medical setting before I will try doing this. Also, though, as far as I know, some people did previously succeed in using alcohol injections to destroy the function of their testicles.   Because even it isn't bulletproof; plus, remember--women have the option of abortion, whereas I certainly don't have this option (and I never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion in the event of an unplanned pregnancy, so yeah).   Actually, as far as I know, eunuchs still have some testosterone left in their bodies--just much less than before.  Also, as far as I know, Viagra and/or some amount of additional testosterone can help with the erections. Of course, interestingly enough, I did talk to some trans-women on Reddit who still have their penises (but not their testicles) and who are still able to get erections using their penises as well as to still have penis-in-vagina sex.   Thank you very much! :)   Here's what I have found in regards to late failures:  https://www.vasweb.com/vasectomy_faqs.html  "From these four cases and reports in the literature, late failure resulting in pregnancy is possible but rare, odds being about one in 4000, a rate of failure much lower than with any other form of contraception."  Also, re-canalization can occur in between tests.      Also, take a look at the info here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasectomy#Efficacy_as_contraception  "A 2005 systematic review of twenty-eight studies including both early failures and late failures described a total of 183 failures or recanalizations from approximately 43,642 vasectomy patients (0.4%), and twenty studies in the same review described sixty pregnancies after 92,184 vasectomies (0.07%).[29]"   Done! :) Also, thank you very much for this advice! :)   Many people.      Yes, many Republicans are warmongers; what exactly did you expect?      You're banging some Persian chick? ;)    Good luck.  Thank you very much! :)  Also, what about rubbing alcohol. Aren't those often sold at 90% abv  I am honestly unsure; please let me ask the people at the Transgender reddits what exactly their own thoughts on this are, though.   It might be less painful than accidentally almost completely tearing off one of my pinky toes, though. Yes, I had to endure that as a result of an accident nine years ago; thankfully I was able to get stitches afterwards in order to successfully reattach my toe to the rest of my body, though. :) Seriously.   And why exactly would you read about me on the news?   Thanks! :)   Well, I have three goals with an orchiectomy:  1. To achieve "bullet-proof" sterilization. Since all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization (including vasectomies) can and sometimes do fail, they are just not good enough for me.  2. If my expectations in regards to female hormones will turn out to be accurate, then I would want to use female hormones on a regular or at least on a semi-regular basis. After all, I have heard good things about female hormones from both trans-women and trans-men. However, I must find some way to still be able to get erections using my penis, as well as to still be able to have penis-in-vagina sex, while I am taking female hormones, since otherwise female hormones might not work for me.  3. To better regulate my sex drive and to give my ejaculations and sexual arousal more meaning.  In addition to this, though, independently of that, I also want to permanently get rid of as much of my body hair and facial hair as possible due to the fact that this hair makes me dysphoric (and I unfortunately have a lot of it, so yeah). Likewise, I want to feminize my face to some extent as well, though I still want to live as a man (albeit as a very feminine eunuch) most (but not all) of the time after I will get all of this done.   Also, an ER trip is very likely going to be much cheaper than child support payments.   OK; let me say this, though--you win some, and you lose some.   Vasectomies aren't 100% effective, though.   OK; fair enough, I suppose.  Thus, should I delete this TIL?         Says you. ;)   Yes, that might be at least a part of the reason for this.   For one, my desire for sterilization which is incapable of *ever* failing.   Actually, we *do* currently have tools which allow women to pee standing up. :)               That's OK. In any case, I was primarily curious about the legality of this.  For the record, I still hope to become a eunuch in a safe, medical setting. However, if this will not be possible, then I might very well travel to a U.S. state where 190 proof is legal and then damage my testicles there to the point where they no longer work.   By injecting this alcohol into their testicles using a syringe, no?   A male-bodied person without testicles, of course.    In any case please do try to exhaust all of your options before resorting to this.  Completely agreed. :)   To put it bluntly, I want to use 190 proof in order to severely damage my testicles in the event that I will be unable to become a eunuch in a safe, medical setting. Yes, I am completely serious about this; after all, apparently some other aspiring eunuchs previously did this and successfully achieved their desired result.    As far as consumption goes, you're not going to find a big difference between the 151 proof everclear that you can buy in california and the 190 proof you can buy in other states.  Thanks for this info. That said, though, what about for other uses of this?   Any thoughts on this?   Any thoughts on this?   Also, out of curiosity, would a series of Everclear alcohol injections to the testicles work for this?   Yeah, as far as I know, unlike the Iranian government, ordinary Iranians (especially the younger generation) are actually quite pro-American. :)       That's a tough one. If being 'transgender' means having a female brain in a male body (and vice versa), then what does simply being gay mean? You feel like a man but you desire men. Seems like a grey area.  Being gay means that you have sexual desires similar to those of heterosexual people of the opposite gender.  I don't think that's fair. "You're a man who likes women but all women are gay, so let's chop your dick off."  If this comes with a change in one's gender identity, then let's go for it! :) After all, I myself would certainly volunteer for this! :) Seriously.  But honestly, yes, it's very troubling. The best case scenario for pedophiles is to watch child pornography and try to stop thinking about ever having real sex. Can you imagine that being the BEST life you can have?  Or they could simply have sex with adults (perhaps with adults who are dressed like children if they are *that* desperate).  Also, Yes, this would certainly be tragic (plus, it is worth noting that actual child porn, as opposed to cartoon child porn, is obviously illegal). However, it's not like we have any better options at this point in time (well, other than surgical castration--seriously).   Yeah, that's where I got the idea from this post from. :) Deal with it! ;)    Gender identity isn't the same as sexual attraction,  No, it isn't, but this will easily solve the problem in regards to this. (Heck, as a side note, I want to become a lesbian trans-woman even in this current world. Seriously.)  Also, though, as a side note, I wouldn't be surprised if the process by which one becomes transgender in the womb is similar to the process by which one becomes gay in the womb. Seriously. After all, I have previously read that both gay people and transgender people have feminized/masculinized brains relative to the sex that they were assigned at birth.  but I see what you're saying.  Yes--if you can't deal with the status quo, then there should ideally be some way to change the status quo without harming anyone.  Yes, I highly doubt any pedophile would rather stay a pedophile.  Yes; correct! In turn, this is why I strongly hope that a cure for pedophilia (probably by altering one's brain in some way) will eventually be found.  However, for the time being, pedophiles should be offered treatment and counselling. Likewise, any pedophile (and any other adult, for that matter) who genuinely wants to become a eunuch should be able to do so in a safe, medical setting. Seriously.   Out of curiosity--have you ever seriously considered becoming a eunuch? After all, becoming a eunuch (as in, getting rid of your testicles) will probably permanently get rid of most of your sex drive. Also, Yes, I am completely serious about all of this.      Being a pedophile is just like being a straight male in a world where all females are lesbians. The obvious result is that you'd have sexual desires that cannot be met without hurting someone.  I really hope that technology to change one's gender identity exists in such a scenario; after all, I'd certainly like to turn myself into a lesbian trans-woman. :)      As every *currently living* person on Earth, that is.   OK; thanks for this info, and good luck with your future plans in regards to this! :)    No, no I didn't. I was referring to HRT.  Oh; OK. That said, though, did you get an orchiectomy yet?   Abortion is not exactly a walk in the park.  No, but it *is* a piece of cake in comparison to an orchiectomy.  In any case, what I meant is that, if it is difficult even getting a vasectomy, getting an orchiectomy will be even more difficult.  Agreed, unfortunately. :(    I really have no idea. I am in Europe, and am DIY for the moment, so my info is limited to wild guesses.  Wait--you actually performed your orchiectomy yourself?  I think you may be facing more than a bit of opposition, though. I remember reading of people who had a lot of difficulties for a simple vasectomy/tubal, so there's that.  In regards to a tubal litigation, though, a woman who could not get a tubal litigation done could simply get an abortion afterwards (and a second abortion if the first abortion fails, and so forth); thus, it is less pressing (in other words, less urgent) than me becoming a eunuch.   Also, out of curiosity--exactly how difficult do you think it will be for me to find a doctor who will be willing to perform an elective orchiectomy on me?    A more fair comparison would be getting kicked in the crotch by the Hulk. There is a world of difference between a sudden impact and cutting in.  OK; understood.   Of course, going off cyproterone would lead to a (slow) reversal of most of its effect. It might just leave you permanently sterile.  The key word here is "might." "Might" isn't good enough for me, considering that I want something which is guaranteed to leave me permanently sterile.   Regarding 2), after removal of the testes erections will be more difficult and you will likely experience shrinkage. You could always take T and/or viagra to avoid this.  Yes, I am well-aware of this. Thus, I should discuss this with a gender therapist before I will actually become a eunuch.   If you take estrogens (even anti-androgens/orchiectomy cause this, to an extent) you will feminize. Breasts included.  As long as I can still pass as a man (even an extremely feminine man), though, then this shouldn't be a problem. After all, even some cis-men have large breasts and even female nipples. (Plus, there is the option of breast removal and/or breast reduction surgery later on if necessary; frankly, I appear to be largely indifferent in regards to breasts.)  And you need either estrogen or testosterone to avoid osteoporosis, so this might be a problem.  Yes, I am certainly well-aware of that, which is why I intend to always take at least one of these two hormones.    The crotch has way more nerves than your pinky. I really doubt you would be able to deal with the pain, especially if you are trying to do an orchiectomy at the same time.  OK, though for the record, I did previously get kicked in the crotch by some idiot (back in middle school) nine or ten years ago and managed to survive it.  And, while I don't know exactly how much blood flows to the testicular artery, I know that you can bleed out in seconds if you cut the wrong artery/vein. Thus, even being near or inside an hospital might not be enough.  OK; thank you very much for this information.  I'm not suggesting cyproterone acetate as a long-term solution. I was under the impression that you wanted to attempt a DIY orchiectomy now, and while it may not be good on the long-term it would certainly be effective in shutting them down and making them shrink.  OK, but what about if one goes off of cyproterone acetate? Would the testicles then go back to normal?  Regarding gatekeeping - tell your doctors that you are going to do it, with or without your help. It might help or it might not, but if you really are determined in going through with it they should - least harm - help you do so safely.  Completely agreed. In fact, this is what I am going to tell the therapist at my university at the start of the Fall 2015 quarter (I am currently on summer vacation, so yeah). I haven't talked with him or her at all yet; thus, I will need to discuss everything, including this, with him or her.  As always, IANAD.  Thanks for this disclaimer. :)  Also, for the record, I have three goals with an orchiectomy:  1. To achieve "bullet-proof" sterilization. Since all non-drastic methods of contraception and sterilization (including vasectomies) can and sometimes do fail, they are just not good enough for me.  2. If my expectations in regards to female hormones will turn out to be accurate, then I would want to use female hormones on a regular or at least on a semi-regular basis. After all, I have heard good things about female hormones from both trans-women and trans-men. However, I must find some way to still be able to get erections using my penis, as well as to still be able to have penis-in-vagina sex, while I am taking female hormones, since otherwise female hormones might not work for me.  3. To better regulate my sex drive and to give my ejaculations and sexual arousal more meaning.  In addition to this, though, independently of that, I also want to permanently get rid of as much of my body hair and facial hair as possible due to the fact that this hair makes me dysphoric (and I unfortunately have a lot of it, so yeah). Likewise, I want to feminize my face to some extent as well, though I still want to live as a man (albeit as a very feminine eunuch) most (but not all) of the time after I will get all of this done.    I answered you in another thread, but I'll answer you here, too. Always remember that IANAD.  OK.  DIY surgery is, as a rule, a very bad idea. Even quite simple field surgery (extracting bullets and shrapnel) is dangerous if you are not trained. And even if you have training infection is a pretty big risk.  OK.  And a DIY orchiectomy seems to me like a doubly bad idea, because: The area is highly innervated - this means that the surgery will be quite painful.  I think that I can deal with this pain, though. After all, I previously (nine years ago) accidentally almost completely ripped one of my pinky toes from the rest of my body; it hurt like Hell and I had to get stitches afterwards to reattach this toe (Yes, this stitching was thankfully successful).  The testicles are fed by the testicular artery, and if you clip/cut/damage it you will likely bleed out.  What about doing this in the private stall of a restroom right outside of a hospital emergency room, though?  Now, if you:  ...   There would be no problems. But that would not be DIY surgery anymore, would it?  No, it would not. Thus, would even seeking a "cutter" to do this be a better move than doing it oneself?   You aren't trained as a surgeon. You won't know how deep you have to go or how deep you can go or how you have to cut or what you have to cut. It's likely that you won't have the precision needed to operate safely, even if you knew exactly what you need to do. You don't have access to sterile equipment. This means infection and possibly gangrene. You don't have access to local anesthetic. This means that you will have to bear through the pain - and there will be a lot of pain, risking that a spasm will kill you or something - or take painkillers/alcohol and thus impairing your concentration/precision. You are operating on yourself. That means a difficult angle, that means having to suffer through the pain of the operation and having to do it.  Yes, you appear to be correct in regards to this.  Other than cutting into your scrotum and removing your testicles, there are other methods to kill them. But safely? They are likely relatively more safe than DIY an orchiectomy, but they are not safe. Clamping them with an elastic band would work. You will need to keep the band firmly in place until your testicles fall off (I think they autoamputate - any doctors here?). But this will be extremely painful and not without risks. Your testicles will basically rot, and if you remove the band you will likely die from shock.  OK; thus, if I will get really desperate, then I might do this. However, where exactly do I get an elastic band?   TL;DR: don't DIY an orchiectomy. Might I suggest cyproterone acetate instead?  No, cyproterone acetate is certainly *not* going to be an acceptable long(er)-term replacement for an orchiectomy. Rather, my testicles *have* to come off, and I absolutely cannot compromise in regards to this.  Also, for the record, I still seek to become a eunuch in safe, medical setting (well, once I will raise the money for this and for HRT, that is). However, I am asking about a DIY orchiectomy here in the event that the tragic worst-case scenario comes to pass in regards to this. After all, I know that there is an awful lot of excessive gate-keeping in regards to aspiring eunuchs who want to get elective orchiectomies, which in turn results in some of these aspiring eunuchs attempting DIY orchiectomies and/or "back-alley" orchiectomies instead. :(   Edit: I cannot words at 04:21. I should really be sleeping.  OK.   OK; I will make sure to read what they have to say in regards to this.   Didn't the Muslim League (running on a pro-secession and pro-Pakistan platform) overwhelmingly win in the Muslim-majority areas in the 1946 election, though?               Yes; this article got that part wrong.    Exactly how is it better?  Well, it's no longer in the Middle Ages.  The US invasion has failed to eliminate the Taliban,  Yes, but I am unsure that fully eliminating the Taliban is necessary.  who happen to be still strong as ever,  Eh ... I'm not so sure about that; after all, isn't Pakistan cracking down on some of the sanctuary areas in Pakistan which the Taliban have previously used?  the Afghan government does not control large swathes of the country  Give them time, though.  and their security services are in no way prepared to handle the whole country by themselves.  Not yet; however, as long as Western money keeps on flowing, they will have additional time to improve their skills.  As soon as the US leaves Afghanistan will enter another civil war. Afghanistan will be back where it started.  Maybe ... maybe. However, it is also worth noting that Afghanistan didn't collapse or come close to collapsing when the U.S. decreased its troop presence there from about 100,000 to about 10,000 over the last 4 or 5 years.         Completely agreed.    genderfluid  Gender-fluid: Someone who alternates between genders.   crossdreaming  Imagining oneself as another gender/sex.      Thank you. :)   Congratulations to him! :) I am certainly glad that he is now cancer-free! :)   Understood; also, though, for the record, I still want to get this done in a safe, medical setting. I am simply preparing for the tragic worst-case scenario just in case. :(      However, I can ask this question here again in one or two years, correct?   Thanks for this info. :)       it has the lowest chance of complications and the fewest risks as long as you are going to a reputable surgeon.  That's the crucial part, though; after all, unfortunately gate-keeping has not allowed all aspiring eunuchs to successfully find such a surgeon. :(   In the big picture, Yes. However, I am not talking about 1979 Afghanistan here--rather I'm talking about 2001 Afghanistan here.   Eh ... I'd say that Afghanistan is better off now than it was back in 2001.    On second thought don't actually do that.  Too late. ;)   That's because he was the first U.S. President who was born after the U.S. actually became independent (in 1776).      Yes, but wrong in the sense of being too *pessimistic*.      Any thoughts on this?   Why not?    What a fascinating man.  Completely agreed. :)   I don't want GRS, though.   You already got a part of Kashmir, though.   Or only have gay sex while one is in college. ;)   What exactly does RIT stand for?   What exactly is a Monroebot, though?   Then don't have a kid in the first place. Problem solved.   You are forgetting the fact that after sufficiently intelligent and sentient artificial intelligence (AI) is developed, even robots would be able to claim that the sex that they had with you was non-consensual.   Unless I am missing something, it appears that the left of guilty of hypocrisy in regards to this (and I say this as a liberal-leaning person myself). After all, if the left wants the government and authorities out of people's bedrooms, then why the heck it is supporting a law as drastic as this one?  I certainly think that people who are guilty of sexual assault should be punished, but laws such as this one appear to reduce the importance and meaning of *actual* sexual assault. :(   Ah; OK. Got it! :)   You're freaked out by vaginas?   So 9 out of 10 Chinese people would be willing to support the proposal which I stated here?         Other than more warfare, fighting, and deaths, obviously (and unfortunately)?      Yep. :)   Yes, while I like things such as hijabs. ;) Seriously.   Any thoughts on this?   Yep. :) It's a bit disappointing that none of them became supercentenarians, though. :(          Let's be honest China's claim is most likely right.  Do you mean in both the east and in the west?    Mcmahaon line was drawn up the British.  Yes, but China was already willing to agree to it back under Mao (as in, before the 1962 Sino-Indian War).   Some of that land if theirs , not all , but some.  So what exactly do you propose should be done in regards to this?   In reality we lost a lot of land in the west with Sindh and Punjab due to that idiot Gandhi.  Can you please elaborate on this part?   I'm sorry ... what?    I'd prefer you didn't do it at all;  So do I, actually.    China will keep the issue boiling until it reaches a position of maximum strength where it can leverage a deal highly skewed in its favour.  How exactly will such a deal look like, though? Also, will India even accept such a deal?    I think that the majority of Palestinians in general would vastly prefer to live in Israel rather than Palestine, Israel has a prosperous economy, low corruption, no occupation, no restrictions on airspace or resource use, no significant conflicts, and a very good political system. However Israel has consistently forbid any Palestinian in the Palestinian territories, as well as the 700,000 Arab Israelis displaced in 1948 from having Israeli citizenship or from having any sort of representation in the Knesset. Now Israel wants to annex and have permanent exclusive Jewish control over Arab East Jerusalem, the universally recognized rightful capital of Palestine, without taking any of the Palestinians elsewhere else in the occupied territories. This is completely unacceptable. You can't just take the capital of a state which you find valuable, and leave the rest to languish. You either have to let the Palestinians have a real viable state (give them east jerusalem) or you have to annex the whole of Palestine. A partial measure is unacceptable.  OK.  I don't know enough about it to say my opinion about that.  OK.  It will be Israeli.  So Syria (if it will even survive its current civil war intact) will never get the Golan Heights back?  Exactly the same as Obama and Bush. She will vocally condemn the expansion of settlements, she will call for east jerusalem to be the capital of Palestine, but she will do nothing practical other than support Israel with aid and weapons, and defend it from UNSC resolutions at the UN.  What about if a new Israeli leader wants to make peace with the Palestinians, though? Will she agree to mediate between the two of them?  She will be more hawkish on Iran than Obama, if Obama has not locked in a very comprehensive deal by the time he leaves office.  If so, then one should be happy that Obama will probably have such a deal locked in by the point that he will leave office.  Clinton is very eager to display her hawkish side, she has made that exceedingly clear.  This might be in order to silence sexist critics who challenge her toughness due to the fact that she is a woman, though.  Also, one more thing: If terrorist groups such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad refuse to fully and veritable disarm in the event of a final Israeli-Palestinian peace deal (even if/as they agree to recognize Israel), then who exactly is going to forcibly disarm these terrorist groups? Israel?   Any thoughts on this?  	152
 Literally every video on the internet has someone saying this word and I've never known what it means   I mean, it *does* look like a controlled demolition though. It's obviously not. But it looks like one. It just so happens that a controlled demolition and a collapse from an impact and burning fuel look very very similar because, duh Joe, that's what buildings look like when they fall down.  I think Joe is just used to saying whatever the hell he wants on his show with no repercussions, since it's a very casual non-formal podcast where anyone can talk about anything they want like friends hanging out.  Dunning on the other hand, is from a podcast where he is claiming to be scientifically accurate and constructive and influencing people's ideas and behaviour.  They're two completely different guys with completely different goals with completely different beliefs about what their responsibilities as a host of a podcast show are, and so their styles just clash horrendously and they can never really find any common ground.    That's especially annoying because during the full podcast every single point Dunning wanted to argue about, and all the negative things he said about Joe's show, were all based on him taking everything Joe said completely literally and then picking it apart to prove him wrong and make him seem like a dangerous liar.   I listened to this podcast when it first came out, and man, I love both these guy's shows, so this was pretty painful to listen to.   I really hate how Dunning said "you're taking my words too literally" whereas absolutely  every single complaint Dunning had against Joe's podcast was based on taking all his words totally literally and then trying to pick them apart to prove Rogan to be wrong.  Dunning clearly wasn't expecting Rogan to fight back as much as he was, probably because whenever he debunks things on his Skeptoid podcast it's just him by himself talking to no one. But then Rogan also clearly doesn't give a shit about logical fallacies and scientific arguments and cares more about just chatting casually person to person, and the two styles do not mix at all.   Dunning seemed to just keep trying to pick apart everything and anything he could to try to seem smarter, and Rogan was just so non-specific and all over the place. It made Dunning seem like a total petty douche bag, and made Rogan seem like he doesn't get a lot of points Dunning is making, or doesn't really care to.  I still enjoy both their podcasts, and they both seem like really nice dudes, but this podcast just went on and on and on in increasingly argumentative and petty circles that it was too infuriating to listen to.    what fer?   Yeah I'm pretty sure he is powered entirely by his nuclear reactor heart, that's why he can live at the bottom of the ocean for decades without needing to eat or breathe.   In Godzilla vs Mechagodzilla 2 they explicitly explain that he does infact have two hearts.   None of my non-Godzilla fan friends really liked it. They all thought it was 'okay' dumb fun but kinda boring. I liked it the most out of everyone.   The Godzilla stuff all felt perfect, it just wasn't quite enough. The marketing made it seem like such a huge epic apocalyptic blockbuster, but the movie felt kinda 'small'   Plus no one really seemed very surprised or horrified at learning of the existence of giant monsters.   I'm pretty excited. I'll be seeing it about 2 hours. I haven't been this pumped for a movie in years. I've convinced like 8 of my friends to come with me.  EDIT: just saw it. It was good. Not great. The entire second act just felt worthless, and for a movie with so little monster action, it didn't at all make use of the human characters. But when it got good, it was an incredible experience. Really well shot, all the bits with Godzilla were great, the first act felt really strong and like it was building to something great. But then it was just okay.   This sounds kind of ridiculous and not true. I seriously doubt any movie shoot would have the animatronics out on location all the way in Hawaii, and I'm having trouble picturing this movie having a scene where Bryce Dallas Howard gets graphically chewed on by a big animatronic dinosaur.  EDIT: [Frank Marshall](https://twitter.com/LeDoctor/status/466375292840574976) says this story is BS.   Absolutely perfect choice.   One of my favourite composers around, everything he does is so fun and lively and interesting and full of energy. The only complaint I ever hear about him is that he's clearly very derivative of John Williams' style, and that's definitely an intentional thing.  So who better than to score the fresh new reboot of a classic film than the fresh new reboot of that film's composer   who?   Wow, this is probably the most accurate size chart to ever be posted here so far. Simple, easy to read, and the scale seems pretty close to perfect.  So [here's](http://i.imgur.com/ac2FO4v.jpg) a version with just the Godzilla's from the films    I expect it to drop into the 60s during release week, but I'd expect it to even out to around 75-80%   Can we get a 'out of ten' rating, or at least a 'positive' or 'negative' or 'good' or 'bad' score next to each of the review links?   Yikes, this one's pretty negative   TLDR; 9/10  "Few recent films have had as much pre-release hype as Gareth Edwards Godzilla, as legions of devoted fans have hungrily devoured each new detail, tease, and marketing release. So, does it deliver? In a word: Yes.  Legendary Pictures' Godzilla origin story carries the weight of unwieldy expectations, but rather than buckle, it is ultimately a fantastic - though imperfect - example of the genre. Gareth Edwards both depicts what is beloved about this magnificent creature and creates a film that is distinctly its own entity, one that brings Godzilla to gorgeous new life. The Easter Eggs and nods to previous versions and additional suitmation favorites will likely be appreciated by sharp-eyed aficionados. If Edwards installment serves as your introduction to the King of the Monsters, though, theres plenty for you to enjoy as well."    Where is this image from?   Edited my comment to explain the reasoning behind my preferences :)    I disagree but it is pretty dang fantastic .  The final fight in a The Raid 2 is incredible. It's so intricately and amazingly well choreographed, and is certainly an unmatched show of skill and technique. But the final fight in the first Raid just felt way more brutal and exciting, all three men were completely destroyed and battling to survive and you could feel the desperation and brutality, coupled with the emotional aspect of Rama trying to save his brother.  Plus the Assassin wasn't nearly as well built up as an unstoppable killing machine as Mad Dog.  I never once felt that Rama was in any way close to losing the fights in the second movie. And while they were much more varied and better choreographed on a technical skill level, the first film had an insane sense of urgency and brutality and it constantly felt like Rama was only just barely surviving each encounter. Plus The Raid 2 had tonnes of fights that didn't even involve the main characters so the outcome didn't even really matter.   Fucking amazing film though.    Is that Bluray one disc or two   I don't think it was that bad of a comment to make at all. Maybe not the *best* thing to say, but I truly think people were making a big deal out of it just to stir up controversy.   So I guess that makes it even cringier that he couldn't think of a simple way of explaining himself.   Wow that's crazy. GMK is my all time favorite (so far)  Awesome fun fact    Oh wow that's awesome!    You'll have to put your experience playing Cut the Rope to the test to get that turd into the toilet    THERE ARE HOLES IN MY BELTS WHO PUT THESE HOLES IN MY BELTS    They've been pretty good about it up until the last two weeks    That's some incredible animatronic work for something that's so hard to even see in the finished product. Practical animatronics have always been so interesting and amazing to me   I wonder what those real horses were thinking   No original ***3*** actors returning   Kind of?   Underwater battles would probably be way too expensive and difficult for a Toho Godzilla film, so the best we get is usually battles in the middle of the ocean where the water is inexplicably knee deep.    *I smell a sitcom!*   Jurassic Park movies have always had very very normal every day looking characters. They were always believable and real and were perfect for the 'ordinary person in an extraordinary situation' theme that Spielberg has always been great at. I mean don't get me wrong, Neill and Goldblum and Dern are all good looking people, but they were realistically good looking, and were just ordinary realistically-aged unexceptional scientists who were out of their element.  This whole cast looks super young and fit and Hollywood-attractive, and people have even been saying Pratt is playing an ex-marine dinosaur wrangler.  Doesn't exactly seem like the same realistic relatable ordinary regular cast of characters we're used to from this franchise.  But hey, I'm sure it's no big deal and I'm still super excited for this movie in a big big way.   Do we know if there are any more of these Blurays coming?   He sure is pretty    I would love to see the comments on this    Because this isn't how evolution works. Humans did not evolve from chimps. This explains it pretty well!  http://sufuns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/infographic.png   I got really excited when I saw that Toho was releasing every single Godzilla movie on Blu-ray this year, only to find out that none of them will apparently have English subtitles.   I've been trying to collect Godzilla DVDs for quite some time now, but it's so hard tracking them all down and figuring out which ones were released in which region. I have a couple that have dubs and subtitles, some with just subtitles, some with both the American and Japanese versions on one disc, and other films I simply can't find on DVD at all. And of course there's a handful of Godzilla movies on Blu-ray already but no where near a full collection.  I was super excited to just get all these new Blu-rays, but without subtitles they're pretty much useless to me, so I just don't know what to do about building the perfect collection.  Any help or advice from any other Godzilla collectors would be greatly appreciated. Anyone know if these new Toho Bluray releases might find themselves getting an international version with subtitles or am I just going to have to be happy with my hodge podge of mismatched Blurays and DVDs forever   Ugh she's even the first one to bring up her own tits in the comments    I don't think Jurassic park totally covers 100% of the entire island, and the guided tour wouldn't go around the entire property either    I would go for the original 1954 Godzilla, then the 1984 Godzilla, and then maybe Godzilla 2000.  There are 3 distinct 'eras' of Godzilla, "Showa" starting with the 1954 original, "Hesei" starting with the 1984 Godzilla, and 'Millenium" starting with Godzilla 2000. Each era the timeline is 'rebooted' and starts fresh to be accessible for new viewers.  Godzilla vs Biollante, Godzilla vs Mothra (1992) Giant Monsters All Out Attack (my personal favorite) Tokyo S.O.S, and Godzilla vs Desotroyah are pretty highly regarded and very accessible and would probably be the best to watch before you start really getting deep into the weirdness that is the Godzilla franchise  Obviously this is leaving out a lot of the classics, (like Godzilla vs King Kong, Destroy All Monsters, Smog Monster, etc.) but I think starting on the older campier crazier Showa movies might be kinda jarring to modern viewers unfamiliar with Godzilla since they are pretty weird and cheap and out there, and aren't always easy to watch, and might need to be eased into after some more 'normal' Godzilla films.  You shouldn't really need to worry about any exact order or anything since most of the films are fairly stand alone so you can pretty much jump around as you wish.   James Rolfe (AVGN) has a fantastic little series that briefly sums up each Godzilla film and explains the different eras and styles [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avc4AS3AvcA list=PLAAD30B9523D89FAA), and I highly reccommend watching this first and then choosing your own order based on what appeals to you.   Does Godzilla kill all those kids in school buses on the bridge?   If your film club publishes it's reviews online in any way you should link it here   Awesome! Thanks for answering all our questions buddy. You're really getting us all super hyped and excited... and kinda filled with seething jealously as well.   First off, boo I am so jealous. Secondly, some spoiler free questions.   How was it tonally? Was it as dark and apocalyptic as the trailers or was it a bit more summer blockbuster?  The trailers seem to be showing off a lot of Bryan Cranston and Ken Watanabe, how was Aaron Taylor Johnson as the lead?  Do we get the atomic breath?  Do we get decent story and character stuff outside of a typical big monster/disaster blockbuster movie?  We've heard a lot about not seeing a whole bunch of Godzilla until the final showdown in San Francisco. Mostly just glimpses and short sequences and a whole lot of build up. Is this accurate? If so, how does the first half handle not having much monster action?   And most importantly, once we get to the big San Francisco sequence, how long is it and how much action do we get? Do we get some big extended city destruction like a lot of big action films have had recently?  It's so hard to avoid ruining this movie for myself. I'm trying not to read too much or even watch those new clips but the hype is so strong. Only 2 more weeks...   Yeah it's weird. Kev Smith really truly passionately *gets* Batman in a very emotional and powerful way. It's a shame he isn't really able to transfer that into his writing. But I could listen to him talk about Batman all day. His podcast is fantastic.   https://twitter.com/brian_tee/status/461951229371768832  Here's a picture suggesting that he will most probably be playing 'Hamada.' The bad ass Japanese game warden in the tradition of Muldoon from the leaked screen play excerpts.       Nope not at all. This movie takes place in Tokyo, Hawaii, Vegas and San Francisco    No more Colbert Report and no more Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. This is indeed a disturbing universe.    But then you wouldn't get to hear such entertaining hilarious phrases like *"baller"* over and over again   I don't have a source but I seem to remember someone saying that if this sells well they were hoping to reignite the Oddworld franchise in a small indie way    Octodad just came out on PS4 last week and it still has a more annoying camera than this game   Looks like it ends with the astronaut husband dying in space at the same time his wife gives birth    My favorite terrible sound effect is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7Dfi-b-qns) fence getting knocked down sound from Rollerball   The environment looks a little *too* barren. Like it's just sand and rocks. No towns or mountains or anything.   I still think this game could be really fun. Stupid, and totally not in the spirit of Mad Max, but still fun.   I feel like if you tried to play it by yourself you'd just end up getting your arms all tangled in a knot pretty soon   The fight choreography in the second one, in terms of technical skill and variety, was absolutely incredible. But in terms of emotional impact and tension, the first was better. The first had a constant feeling of brutal desperation and intensity that the second didn't match. In the first it seemed like Rama was always constantly in the verge of death and just managed to claw his way to safety. Rama in the second never really seemed like he was ever close to losing a fight.    I had heard that Ethan Hawke is very much against children becoming actors. I assume due to his own experience, he once said something about children shouldn't be used as actors as it's ultimately unhealthy for the kid and can damage their childhood experience or something. So I'd be interested on heating him talk about the production of this film.      2 and 3 definitely had roughly as much animatronics as 1.  Phil Tippet said Jurassic World would not have very much animatronics at all and would be a very CGI heavy film.   Kualoa Ranch    Or a nurse    "It's going... chillfully... thus far.. I'm not.. uh"  "Elvis Presley.. the uh... famous... 50s... 60s and 70s... uhhmm... person. The, the, the, the, singer.. songwriter... that kind of thing"  Jesus Christ how can someone so pretentious and so obsessed with being interesting and intelligent and quirky be so utterly titanically unable to string a basic fucking sentence together.   It's intentionally unrealistic. It's 4chan.    That looked incredible!  I'm assuming it's slightly trimmed down for WonderCon though since it seemed a little rushed.  But holy cats everything about that was so awesome and scary and atmospheric and well directed and just everything you could want in a badass Godzilla movie!   That looked incredible!   I'm assuming it's slightly trimmed down for WonderCon though since it seemed a little rushed.   But holy cats everything about that was so awesome and scary and atmospheric and well directed and just everything you could want in a badass Godzilla movie!   Wow. I feel very un-Australian at the moment. I've lived here all my life, and I've heard this song countless times growing up, but I've *never* ever heard that chant before.   Oh man that sounds awesome! I'd love to be able to see it   How the hell is that story about smiles and cries?    I can't find him on that list   IMDb tells me he was the costume designer for Man of Steel, Watchmen, 300, Noah, TRON Legacy, Sucker Punch, Terminator Salvation, Sky High, and was nominated for an Oscar for his costume work on American Hustle.   I don't know about 'properly'  This isn't even slightly similar to the Jurassic Park look.   This is the greatest and best thing in the world   I think the CGI looks incredible, with the exception of that one shot of the wave hitting the beach with the dog barking in the foreground. It just doesn't seem real at all. Everything else in all the other shots looks perfect.   The CGI in Pacific Rim was handled by ILM, the CGI in Godzilla is by Weta. I tend to think ILM usually crafts the most incredible and realistic CGI in the film industry, but ever since King Kong Weta is definitely a close second.   ILM is responsible for Jurassic Park, Pirates of the Carribbean and Transformers, Weta does the LOTR films, Avatar and the new Planet of the Apes movies   It's a lion it's huge   Topical    That is so insanely accurate   cis scum    What the fuck is happening here    Pretty sure this scene was shown at SXSW and the girl did in fact make it   I appreciate the feet being stocky and thick, it makes sense that they'd be huge and stable for such an impossibly massive beast, but I think they might be a little *too* stocky.   It's a great idea, and I certainly don't want skinny dinosaur legs or anything, but it's a little too elephant like and seems like it might be veering more towards cartoony over realistic. Everything else about the design is perfect.    and Chris Pratt plays a dino wrangler with "a cowboy attitude".  Huh. First people were saying he was playing an ex-marine, now this. I don't know if either of those things have been confirmed officially, but an ex-marine dino wrangler seems kinda ridiculous and cheesy and cliche, even for a Jurassic Park movie.   Oh man I love Judy Greer   slappadyslappadapabadadap little kick    Man it feels so weird that this is all actually happening   I think Vinny has been doing a fantastic job of keeping everything positive and fun. He was always my favorite, but he has really stepped up as the heart and soul, and most of the laughs, ever since Ryan passed. Brad is still Brad. Drew has been doing a lot more, which is great. But Jeff seems even more grumpy and jaded than ever, which is totally understandable.    He died about a year ago   [Poor Nic always gets so much hate](http://img.pandawhale.com/post-30267-what-do-you-say-you-cut-me-som-E1On.gif)   But that's why he's so disappointed    I wish Brett Ratner would give up   Jesus this is horrible   Yeah watching this edit actually made me look up the show to see how terrible it was, and I ended up watching both full seasons. I actually enjoyed it a fair bit.  It's stupid and cheesy and can be horribly lame and cringy sometimes, but somehow less offensive than most reality shows around. A lot of the personalities were actually pretty fun to watch. There are always a few narcissistic delusional assholes on shows like this, but despite being quite awkward a lot of the time, some of them really seem like genuinely good people.   Episodes are way too long and over-dramatized, but I was surprised at how much I got into it. And I usually really hate geexploitation shit like this.   This joke works on so many levels    Holy shit Ants in my Eyes Johnson was hilarious  I loved how like 90% of this episode was improv. This show just gets crazier and stranger and more brilliantly funny every episode.   I love Scarface as a fun over the top cheesy cartoon. It's so ridiculous and goofy and entertaining. It's a great movie, and I always enjoy watching it, but I have never really considered it to be a classic 'serious' gangster film.   I think Michael Fassbender is a spot on perfect young Ian McKellan, but James McAvoy is not a believable young Patrick Stewart at all. He's still a really great actor, and it worked in First Class since it seemed like a very different reboot-verse, but it might be weird seeing them together like this.    I'm pretty sure neither of those guys were actually in any scenes with JGL in the movie, so maybe that's why    How do you get different jackets    Go get your own dinner    He has denied it outright several times    Bullock looks great, Gordon looks terrible. A gritty noir detective show set in Gotham styled after Gotham Central could be an amazing show. But this just looks lame.    I was hoping for a Hammond cameo more than anyone else, but I hope we at least get to hear about what's happened to him   He also spends the whole movie erasing things from his notepad and checking the time   Read Gotham Central   I hate Alien 3 and 4, but that boxset is still worth it for all the amazing special features that comes with it   I thought Justin Lin was supposed to be directing this    It looks like all the future timeline characters from the original trilogy, aside from Wolverine, Magneto and Prof X, don't have as big important parts as I once hoped  	109

 This was over two years ago and from recollection both drivers survived with minimal injuries.    To thank it for allowing me to control the direction of my car.    Though often misunderstood to refer only to insecticides, the term pesticide also applies to herbicides, fungicides, and various other substances used to control pests.    -[EPA](http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/about/index.htm)   This is your best one yet.

They also keep claiming Roundup is 100% safe for human consumption and the environment, because Glyphosate[1] is very toxic to non-human entities. Our environment is just as important.     No one is claiming it's safe for human consumption, what is claimed is that it is safe when used as directed. [In terms of herbicides glyphosate is one of the least harmful ones to non-target organisms and soil health.](http://www.epa.gov/ogwdw/pdfs/factsheets/soc/tech/glyphosa.pdf)    [Also glyphosate tolerant crops have allowed farmers to use more non-tillage farming practices in order to preserve soil health.](http://grist.org/food/soil-proprietor-do-gmos-promote-dirt-conservation/)    They also are the original developer's of Agent Orange (now banned, but you see where the stream goes.)     No they are not, they were one of many producers of the chemical under orders of the US government.     Bill Nye, though not a "GMO scientist" has done the basic math and found that USA doesn't "need" GMO's    [Actually Bill Nye changed his mind after actually researching and learning about GMOs.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/03/03/proof-hes-the-science-guy-bill-nye-is-changing-his-mind-about-gmos/)    so why does Monsanto keep pushing it here? Other countries that DO need it aren't getting enough of it.    There has been a push for GMOs in many countries from India to the Philippines and in all instances it has shown to be a plus to local farmers from increase yields to decrease pesticide exposure. The issue is that GMOs have unfortunately become a political talking point and many countries that could gain from their use have decided to ban and halt their use.        Of course, if someone has a different opinion they must be a shill.    MS should have released both Halo 5   6 day 1, it's a joke that we have to wait so long!   So just a bunch of documentaries?    Most likely it was caught early so surgery was all that was required.    How so exactly?    This test wasn't done by Top Gear, but yeah I'm sure Ferrari isn't too happy.    GMOs are not poison, this is no better than the anti-vac movement.    Do you have to have the disk in to play?    Most likely, the disk will be used as an authentication key.    The 360 emulated original xbox games but not all ran so well and some where unplayable.    Both the X360   PS3 used different hardware architecture then the current gen.   You have to download the game, but it's free if you use a 360 copy.    Or maybe they will use a pesticide that costs a little more with just as much saftey testing but has less damaging effect on the environment and doesn't give their customers cancer.    What one? And there is little evidence that glyphosate is actually causing cancer in humans.        IARC's findings are not a risk assessment, they didn't look at the actual risk of getting cancer from glyphosate exposure. Their classification and findings are based off if they believe it can from the available evidence. A chemical could cause cancer in 1:1billion people or 1:10 people and they can be classified under the same group.    When you look at human and animal studies the risk of glyphosate is overblown even among high risk groups such as applicators.

The lack of a plausible mechanism, along with published epidemiology studies, which fail to demonstrate clear, statistically significant, unbiased and non-confounded associations between glyphosate and cancer of any single etiology, and a compelling weight of evidence, support the conclusion that glyphosate does not present concern with respect to carcinogenic potential in humans.

Of the studies that I have linked to what ones are falsified or have been disproven by more recent research?   No one.    Cell cultures are not the only way to asses toxicity.    Yes, it does, but it classifies glyphosate as probably carcinogenic which is a completely different category.     They are not completely different categories as they are merely in different subcategories of Group 2 classification.     In cell cultures.    The organization is mentioned in the article and is the reason for the current ban.    The same group (IARC) classifies cellphones as possibly carcinogens.       There is plenty of evidence supporting the relative safety of glyphosate to humans.

They're not, Ferrari doesn't control the actual operations on how the team is ran.    Again, a single anecdotal account is hardly evidence.    There's a clinical trial going on right now in the U.S. looking at its effectiveness with treating seizures in children.   I was always asking for strong clinical controlled studies proving mmj effectiveness, the same threshold required for all drugs.    The issue with the current research on seizures is that the studies are small and not controlled. Which is fine for supporting further research, but not proving efficacy.   None of those are control clinical studies.    Maybe you wont because there are very few studies showing efficacy of mmj.    What studies? Please provide links to controlled clinical data showing cannabis effectiveness curing or treating disease/illness.    Anecdotal accounts are hardly compelling evidence.    Are these controlled   blinded studies you are referring to? If so I would like a link.    America is not the world.   Ferrari doesn't actually have a team that competes at Le Mans.    Unfortunately as long as Ferrari believes F1 is the only important racing series we won't see a Ferrari Ford rivalry unless Ford enters F1.   But the evidence that mmj is actually having a positive effect on reducing seizures is weak/lacking.    A lot of shit has been used for thousands of years, but that isn't proof that it is an effective medical treatment.    They can still gain exclusivity on it.    Except there is no Ferrari team at Le Mans   I noticed the Ferrari reference, but I wonder if Ford knows that Ferrari doesn't actually have a factory team at Le Mans anymore.       The Tesla is fast, except around a track.   Canada doesn't allow research into cannabis?    Because it's easier to just repurpose a V8 from an existing car.

Second, we find that Bt cotton technology has been very effective overall in India. However, the context in which Bt cotton was introduced has generated disappointing results in some particular districts and seasons. Third, our analysis clearly shows that Bt cotton is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of farmer suicides. In contrast, many other factors have likely played a prominent role. Nevertheless, in specific regions and years, where Bt cotton may have indirectly contributed to farmer indebtedness, leading to suicides, its failure was mainly the result of the context or environment in which it was planted.     [Here is the 2011 Version](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/routledg/jds/2011/00000047/00000002/art00007)           [And a more recent report.](http://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/2014/03/05/new-research-paper-gm-cotton-in-india-has-probably-reduced-farmer-suicides-not-caused-them/#.UxqR46hn8Uu)   The analysis reveals considerable variation in trends in suicide rates across the nine cotton-growing states. The data, although not ideal, and the modeling do not, however, support the claim that GM cotton has led to an increase in farmer suicide rates: if anything the reverse is true. The Indian farmer suicide story has become received wisdom for some anti-GM campaigners. In fact, we find that the suicide rate for male Indian farmers is slightly lower than the non-farmer rate. And Indian suicide rates as a whole, although contested, do not appear to be notably high in a world context. The pattern of changes in suicide rates over the last 15 years is consistent with a beneficial effect of Bt cotton for India as a whole albeit perhaps not in every cotton-growing state.        Overall in terms of increase yields and decreased pesticide use Bt-cotton has been a significant plus to farmers in India.

Madoff got 150 years, Rajaratnam is also still in jail   HBO need to reair John Oliver segment on FIFA   i believe they will return to Europa and win it again   does not matter, once he is charged anywhere, his days in FIFA is over.   Jack Warner is like 70 years old right?  i believe he will cut deal to not die in prison   tax evasion, they did not report the bribe as income. and money laundering when they move the cash through US banks   http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-05-27/u-s-treats-fifa-like-the-mafia  The prosecutions are being brought under RICO, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970, which was designed to prosecute crime syndicates that had taken over otherwise lawful organizations. Roughly speaking, the law works by allowing the government to prove that a defendant participated in a criminal organization and also committed at least two criminal acts under other specified laws, including bribery and wire fraud. If the government can prove that, the defendant is guilty of racketeering, and qualifies for stiff sentences, the seizure of assets and potential civil-liability lawsuits.      the Swiss investigation are specific to the two world cup. the US investigation in on CONCACAF and CONMEBOL bribery, 2010 and 2014 world cup.             in 2011 they got Chuck Blazer by the ball, Chuck turn informer and help FBI tape FIFA internal meeting. the foreign corrupt practices act have statue of limitation of 5 years.   Adidas must be regretting the endorsement deal that specify their ball need to be on every FIFA press conference table.    how much money you will need to paying for these people to be willing to do 20 years in federal ass pounding prison? especially when the ability of the FIFA people to pay is in doubt, there is always the risk that they will also indicted when investigation widen.   the exec arrested today will give up all the evidence they have to make a deal. that is just self presevation            i thought the Swiss are always on time, why is this press conference still not started?   England are now sixth favourites to host the 2022 World Cup following today's developments with the USA among the leading pack to replace Qatar. Ladbrokes have the 1994 hosts at 3/1 to stage the tournament. Who will host the 2022 World Cup? Here are the latest odds: Qatar 1/6, USA 3/1, Australia 8/1, Germany 12/1, South Korea 25/1, England 25/1, Japan 33/1.   more bad news for FIFA  http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/may/27/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-live#comments  World Cup votes - criminal proceedings opened  The Swiss Federal Office of Justice has announced it is now questioning 10 people who took part in voting on the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids. More to follow.   still, he does have a point about the 36 team plan      i dont see why these people will do time for Blatter if they got the evidence to turn over for a deal with DoJ. it is not like FIFA are going put a hit on federal witness.   https://twitter.com/BillNeelyNBC  Bill Neely @BillNeelyNBC Charging #FIFA officials on minor tournaments,not #Qatar2022 is like arresting Al Capone on tax charges. #getyourman   he already wear a wire to FIFA meeting for the FBI, i think he already given up all the dirt he have.    those 15 are going to flip for FBI, just like Chuck Blazer. only question is how much evidence they can produce on the boss.   imagine, Sepp Blatter in a Geneva lake front house, hold a golden AK, hitting a huge line of coke, while outside a team SEAL emerge from the lake and take up position .....   you dont mess with Bubba   the news got even better  http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2015/may/27/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-live  Although Swiss authorities have confirmed six arrests took place in Zurich this morning, the Guardian understands as many as 15 people worldwide might have been taken into custody.   Jeffrey Webb, Concacaf president, arrested  reports  No names have yet been confirmed by Swiss authorities, but among those arrested this morning is reported to be Jeffrey Webb, president of the Concacaf (Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football) federation formerly controlled by Jack Warner.   lets hope FBI will sent Burt Macklin over to take these guys into custody   CIA cannot confirm or deny that this is true   even if oil price rise they will still be in big trouble. they are buying petrol from US at market price to be sell at the pump at effectively free price. the massive market distortion is fueling the massive smuggling operation. the more international oil price rise, the more demand there will be for smuggled petrol from venezuala.                hey, Bloodborne is a PS4 exclusive      rebound jihadi         Australia take bio security very seriously, even bringing in a piece of dead wood would need to be quarantined properly.   did you guys watch him in Wolf hall? he also play a religious leader in that series. several actor on the show was also on Game of Thrones like Anton Lesser aka Qyburn, Thomas Brodie-Sangster aka Jojen Reed, Mark Gatiss aka Tycho Nestoris   North Korea are the world leader in making large statue, since they have been making so much of them at home, they have been exporting these expertise abroad.   http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-03-27/north-korea-bags-5-million-for-building-two-mugabe-statues  North Korea may be cut off from much of the world, but the so-called Hermit Kingdom manages to run a thriving multimillion-dollar business building monuments, statues, museums, sports stadiums, and more for a long list of countries, many of them in Africa. Its most recent deal fetched $5 million for two statues of Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwes longtime president, to mark the leaders 90th birthday.         is Jorah the Explorer's quest to escape friendzone finally coming to an end?   he is not just thinking about doing it, he have make concrete action toward that goal.    precisely why he made this statue for himself.                  wow, the anti vaxxer found someone dumber than Jenny McCarthy   the logic checks out, this is legit warning   maybe is written on the sign outside         Adebisi would be a great used car salesman   He was annoying when introduced   But pairing with Jonah make him comedy gold   He will be at the subway by the end of his first day   This episode is on fire, the jokes just keep rolling in for beginning to end   the be fair, bin Hammam is the one that benefit most from Qatar winning the bid. for Blatter it make bin Hammam a rival to his reign.      this is no way worst than Iraq, hundreds if not thousand can be shot within a weekend in a Iraqi city under ISIS.   no, UK is the union of NI and GB.    just when you think Florida Man cannot be more over the top, this shit will bring him to a new level      update : 18 shot this weekend in Baltimore  http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-shootings-20150524-story.html   "Just couldn't stand up to the modern urban crime environment, man."         he want to sent you to a nice summer camp   he did work hard to cheat           	196
 I work for a gas station and I get coffee or fountain soda for 30 while at work.      Figure out what product or service you're going to be offering/selling.   It is a pretty retarded reason to downvote someone, but I do think Americans don't have so much of an issue with soccer being referred to as football everywhere else, but rather another completely different sport in America already being named football.   Username checks out.   A significant amount of racial tension is caused by minorities segregating themselves and constantly playing the victim card and crying racism because they dislike something someone's said or done regardless of the situation.   Not saying there's no such thing as real racism, and not saying all minorities are like this, but (in America at least) this is a significant cause to the perpetuation of racial tension. This can also apply to other "discriminated against" demographics, not just minority races.   I've had 1-3 cats pretty much my entire life.   First of all, the kid is barely even touching the cat, and that's one way cats play with each other, by slapping each other, only harder than that kid was doing it and with claws that sometimes aren't completely tucked away.   Second of all, the cat is showing zero signs of anger, irritation or aggression. He's showing signs of a cat in "play feral mode" waiting for the opportune moment to playfully strike back, which he did. This is likely why the person filming did nothing, this is probably a common occurrence between this boy and his cat.   TLDR; Nothing went wrong.   I got this on [a shirt for my birthday from my girlfriend.]( http://imgur.com/kYs61D4 )  I even tweeted it to Bill Nye and Neil Degrasse Tyson but to no avail   Edit: image and grammar   Obviously he's guilty, but I don't understand how they conclude that a sane person would ever do something like this... no matter what the reason he's given or circumstances, *no sane person would ever shoot up a movie theater full of innocent people.*   Then please explain to me how in 30 thousand years we've managed to go from wolves to poodles and pugs?   Wait, I'll do it for you. It's called evolution by *artificial selection,* and we do it with animals *all the time.* We take our understanding of how evolution by *natural selection* and speed things up in the direction we want it to go by *selective breeding.*   You're welcome. I've helped you make use of the internet so you could LEARN something.   Negative. We have a machine that scans the information and pulls it the same way a card reader does and declines accounts without proper funds.   As I said, *exactly the same as a debit card.* Only longer.   Not boring no, but I've personally found women with no real interest or hobby that they can kill some time with to be quite clingy... like wanting to occupy the same space as me 99% of the time, which is alarming and serves really to push me away.   Not sure if that's an answer to your question or not but yeah.   This is similar to every conversation I have about anything technology related with anyone in my family older than 50.   I linked this once a year or two ago in an askreddit thread and got accused of writing this myself for attention by a couple people so it turned into a huge downvote fest lol.  Edit: I linked the entire blog or whatever.   The first picture of the Olympic Archer was awesome.   I'm a big fan of stopping to stretch my legs frequently. It pisses off people I'm traveling with but I think safety and sanity comes before getting there 20 minutes sooner..   Gas station cashier here.  They're not super common, no. On average I do about 400-500 transactions in an 8 hour shift (big city, busy area, and a drive thru) and I see probably 3 checks a day on average. It royally irritates me because it's **literally** the same thing as using your debit card, only it takes 2 minutes instead of 2 seconds.   Yup I've had that happen before. People get really butthurt on reddit and when you don't feed them with replies they do whatever they think will get under your skin.   I seriously thought this was satire... Wow. Just wow. This is beyond dumb.  	19
 Madison is in Wisconsin and Minneapolis is in Minnesota   Mining, logging and tourism are really what drives the economy up there...jobs are scarce and mostly part-time.     Have an upvote...I LOVE THIS!   how about 50 videos 50 states, One solution...and then go into the policies that would help that state   Ex-yooper here...planning to move back within the next three months..I have a sister and a cousin up there who are Bernie supporters.  Jobs are essential to the UP...the economy is complete shit up there...most people up there are pro-union.  The economy is based on mining and logging.   yes...he's tapped into this new magic called "telling the truth"   Have an upvote...you almost made me snort coffee out my nose!   Scott Walker says he doesn't appeal to most Americans...hmm I wonder if 10,000 will show up for his announcement. (I was there, and I got to shake Bernie's hand!)   that was me!   especially on a Wed night with only about a week's notice   I got to shake his hand!  It is great to have someone to vote FOR instead of just the lesser of two evils   or maybe "bern it down"   Good on you Macy's...and the people who signed the petition...   hmmm...seems like the natives are getting restless....good on you moveon.org and good on you Macy's       Good Morning People, WAKE UP!      She is trying to look more in touch with the little people.      I don't worry about being scammed if the person isn't really homeless, I figure if I give them money, that's money that isn't going to make a CEO richer, and it will help someone out.   I'm going! Also, my boyfriend!   Bernie has stated that he needs public support on these policies...After he wins, his supporters will need to call and email their reps on these issues to show support.  That's how things can change.  We will need to put public pressure on them.  	21
 NewSwiss is right - the energy density from insolation (solar energy hitting the surface of the earth) is not sufficiently high, although there is lots of it.  Some concentrated storage will be needed, like batteries, H2, or maybe even hydrocarbon fuels that were produced via CO2+solar+H2O (another hot but challenging area of research that is akin to reproducing photosynthesis, but chemically).     Thanks for the description but send me an email.  Was like a small town - I am sure your name will ring a bell.  Ian, by any chance?   So much interesting work going on with respect to sodium batteries, flow batteries (liquid reagents = liquid batteries that you can refill), and other variants, as well as hydrogen fuels and related storage, etc.  Toshiba was pushing methanol-based fuel cells for portable electronics a few years ago, but that has become dormant, but not dead, in my opinion.  If the energy storage is stationary, heavy is not hugely problematic, but expensive and hard to maintain, that's not good, and needs improvement.  Companies like Tesla have re-energized the field of battery research, and we see many hundreds of manuscripts on batteries of all different flavors.  Hard to say what is going to come out a winner in this busy area.   I must have spaced out and not pressed "save" because I answered this earlier.  If this answer is redundant, I apologize.  What I wrote earlier was that (corny alert) being an editor is really interesting, thanks to all the diverse science I get to read every single day, and due to the incredibly energetic people I am lucky enough to work with, either directly or indirectly, such as my fabulous students, our editors, authors, and editors of other journals who are awe-inspiring, such as Prashant Kamat, Paul Weiss, Laura Kiessling, Kirk Schanze, and others.  I feel obliged to not let people down, and so while it happens that while juggling balls I misjudge and let some fall, you pick them up and keep going.  If I have 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes 'free', I try to use it for something (see what new papers have come in, work on a figure for a paper, scan Twitter, etc).  At the end of the day when my brain is like scrambled eggs, I go running 4-5 times/week and that helps.  Family says I am much nicer after the run, which is probably true.  I try to get in about 1-2 hours of work in the evening, which helps a lot - doesn't feel so much like work if it's fun.    	4
 As everyone is saying, it sucks, but with time and more kick ass lucid dreams you'll get through it man.   The Doctor can get through anything.

 Also, you can't purchase much without a looooot of clams. The game is way too expensive. There isn't nearly enough land to put everything. There isn't much you can buy in the game with 'cash' as it is. The game crashes a lot, all the time, actually. The mechanics pretty much suck. I'm done with it. I was willing to bank my clams, build them up the right way, but seeing as how they take legally claimed clams, I'm fucking done.   It is Indian giving. Pure and simple. I think everyone learned at a young age that it's wrong and wins you no friends (read: loyalty) I for one am deleting my game. Going back to Tapped Out.   We are not talking about that. We are talking about in game given clams. If you can't just bank clams that are freely given (in game) then THAT is wrong and goes against how the game should be played.   But taking clams they give you freely in game, the way it is meant to be played is wrong.   Did your son take Risperidal and grow breasts?   Super fast! Thank you!   I love C2C, but before the show airs is a great show out of Portland, Oregon called Ground Zero. It's hosted by Clyde Lewis and I would go so far as to say he's a better host than Noory with more probing questions. I've been listening for some time now, and I just was wondering something. Why is there no subreddit for this show? He has done shows that remind me of old Art Bell from time to time and yet I see no love for him anywhere. I know he can't be that obscure, he is syndicated now. If there is a subreddit, let me know, please! I would love to discuss shows and ideas surrounding them. If there isn't, I believe one should be created. I can't imagine that everyone who listens to C2C regularly has just somehow missed this show entirely.   I just want the discussion to start. Get the ideas flowing. Thoughts are welcome! Thank you!   I would like to get Sherry Bobbins. I played the crap out of the Easter event, spent loads of donuts trying to get her. Got a lot of gates and other things I didn't really need. I read about the algorithm they used and I guess I must have juuuust missed the mark for her, but I never did get her. If anyone would be so awesome as to help me our with this I would be so happy. She would complete my set! Message me or PM me if you can help. Thanks in advance!!   Oooops! My bad, I'm on kindle so seeing posting rules is not easy to find. Thank you!   It is stupid. He got it legit, the way the game is supposed to be played, and they took it. Such bs.   Did it?   My boyfriend and I did use hacks for this game. However, I think the 250clam count is a cap for all involved. Reason being: He got a free clam from gassing the kids. His count went to 251 clams, he went to sleep, woke up, and they had removed that clam, bringing him back down to 250. I do not think he is going to be alone in this issue. If they are giving away free clams during play, then removing them because of their issue with our hacking, I'm going to be done with this game. A big thank you to all the givers, we know this isn't your fault.   My boyfriend became an IBO just last night. And his sister is knee deep into it. And their mother is about to join in. Yay. /s   Walgreens does. I had to quit because I knew I couldn't pass. Not sure how common that is for Walgreens, but they were doing it almost monthly. I was a shift leader. My use had no reflection on my ability to perform my duties, never came to work high, either. Such bullshit.     I think, after reading more posts that it is all Amway, just people create their own corps that try to hide that fact and thus sound more legit. They say they aren't with Amway, just that Amway is their distributor. Also, the one I am semi tied to is called Dougherty Marketing. Look it up if you are interested in seeing how it works. These guys claim to make bank but they have lots of legs. Lots.   No problem! I'm sure Wikipedia would be way more help but I am too lazy to check it out lol   I wasn't arguing against you LoL! I was voicing support =)   Thank you Alice. More people need to know this. They hold it in and cough violently, it doesn't need to be that way. Trees should never hurt!   No. They are both too new for this. They need to start off small. When they are experienced then they may want to try this, but it is too soon. Your first time doesn't need to be a blowout. =)   Actually, there are many studies about mushrooms and lsd helping immensely with ptsd. Don't discount it. Wait for more studies to be done but it really seems to be helping many sufferers.   It isn't a state. It is a district. I'm American and even I don't get the nuances of it all.   I'm in nc and have no hope. The bible thumpers will never allow it.   Nc needs to legalize it. So bad.   Also, my boyfriends sister sells it and it is actually one of very few skincare products that doesn't make my skin rash the hell up. But it definitely is a scam. They got my Boyfriend into it. He became an IBO last night. *cries*    I'm very vain. Anything to help my skin stay youthful I will want. It... it's a sickness lol   How long ago was that? They are calling it LTD. now.   The energy drink is called XL. It isn't bad, in truth. It was supposedly invented for a runner who ran across the country. Also, they claim it is number 1 in Japan. Don't know if that is true or not tho.   I want some of their skincare products but they are much too expensive to just buy. More than department store prices.   I have been wanting one for quite some time now. I hope they do it!   How do we begin? I'm pretty pissed off   If you're gonna cheat, just leave. The damage you will do to your spouse will be irreversible. It's morally wrong and just plain screwed up. I understand that the thought crosses minds, but trust me, it will create mountains of problems.   This is a joke, right? Right?   I'm gonna have to watch this, that guy looked genuinely spooked at the noise. Also, crazy footage!   Should have made Uter. Bonus points if they make it out of chocolate.   I had the same issue. All these guys acting like I was ready to sub for them just after one email. I stopped using it because I felt like it was a meat market. If I sub I gotta have a deep level of trust with that person otherwise it just isn't happening.    Nah... I like this place, think I'll stay. See you in r/trees!   What? I thought making terrible jokes was the point of this subreddit? Oh... did I hit a nerve? Go hit your wife.   Mod probably beats his girl so he thinks it is ok.   Let's start a petition at change.org! I want them tested just like everyone else! They are our public servants, nothing more.   Probably not if he is admittedly smoking openly. Maybe now tho...   Cars to drive or motorcycles... man that would be awesome   So... politicians don't get drug tested but minimum wage people do? This actually aggrevates me to no end. My tax dollars are paying these guys to do something I will be fired or denied a job for. Bullshit. This really needs to be changed. I'd like to smoke...lots of people would but this sort of ass-backwards crap stands in the way.    I was always taught God doesn't change his laws to fit man. This guy...so full of it.   I only have a kindle....sigh    In some cultures owls are seen as harbingers of death or an omen.    I have used it too, with good results. I turned friends onto it and it worked for them as well. You have to make a solid seal to ensure the suction is proper. Maybe they did it wrong? Maybe it doesn't work for some? I don't know. I am usually very skeptical of alternative medicines and therapies, but this one has worked for me.    Thanks. Maybe someone can put it on vodlocker?      Hiding history for future generations. I'd hold on to some of the "good" stuff, if you know what I mean.   Anyone have a link to the full first episode? I hear these Moms are nuttier than our Moms stateside. If anyone can find it, please post!!   The struggle is real. Keep trying! I'm curious to know if anyone responds.   I don't know why you got downvoted for that. Chevron is the correct term for the pattern.   Can you repost it? For inquiring minds of course.   I'm convinced you are a troll. I'm not feeding you anymore than I have already.   Your reasoning, as you call it, is not reasonable or logical. You need serious help. Get it. Come back when you can discuss this issue in a non-condescending manner and act like an adult.    Your mental gymnastics are insane. I believe you are trolling. If not, you have serious issues with reality and are delusional. Keep drinking that kool-aid, kid. That burning of the bosom feeling might just be indigestion. You should have it looked at!   Love it!   Damn, I just saw that scene on abc, coincidence? I think not!   Does that involve bonuses for conversions? Gotta have those legs!   I've thought about that. But it has been years, you'd think the fear would have subsided by now.   The copter didn't crash, so what's the real problem?   I think the event itself. Maybe me, but they didn't tell me. Still won't. I wish I could remember what happened. Not knowing really bothers me.   With Twin Peaks there are no coincidences.   She would be amazing.   I was absolutely awake that whole night, my friend said she broke into the apt around 7:30am, I blacked out before 2am. That's 5 and a half hours of lost time. The only time I black out is when drinking heavily. I was sober, at the time as I was a practicing Mormon. The fact I was sober and it happened and people are too scared to this day to say what I was doing tells me something really scary happened. I want to know, I've asked, but they say they'd just rather not discuss it. They get scared.    It really is. Dude wants his 100% rating to stay that way. Can't blame him =) Worked out for me tho!   If I had an actual computer and not this touch screen bs, I would do it. I'd be able to go in depth the way I wanted. Essentially, I was in college in an apt with one of my roommates. We were just talking when strange things, sounds, started happening. It was an all night event. We were scared due to furniture being moved and slamming into walls, heavy furniture. At some point either I got scared or something happened to me, but I completely blacked out. Apparently, things did happen while I was blacked out as a friend basically told me years later (with much prodding) that she had to break into the apt, climb over massive amounts of furniture, and found my roommate and I huddled in a bedroom corner holding a big butcher knife looking extremely terrified and wild. My memory of that is nil. I recall waking up by my roommate waking me up in her bed saying everything was the way it was the night before. I recall being alarmed that I was in her bed, that it was the next day, I asked her how I got there, she said I refused to leave her room, but that wasn't quite what I meant. She didn't realize I had experienced missing time/blacked out. She was there with me that night, but refused to tell me what happened after I blacked out. She was too scared.  This was years ago, but the event still bugs me. What happened? Why all the sudden burst of activity? We were talking about her fiance, not playing with Ouija boards. Part of me wants to go under hypnosis to find out, but part of me is scared to do so. There is more to the story, but this is all I have time to type out. You can reply to me and ask questions! I will be happy to answer.   I actually messaged the guy and he said he returned my money. I'm waiting to see it back in my acct. He also apologized for the mix-up. Being as prompt as he was I won't give a negative review, I just wanted a resolution to my issue!   Sweet. I went over there and didn't see it. Gotta link?     I have experienced the weird bed shakes. So strange. Thought it was quakes but USGS said nothing and I do not live in an earthquake prone area.  Have you looked into your missing time event, btw? There are resources to help you recall what happened. I've had one that to this day seriously scares me. If it weren't for the terror I felt before I blacked out, I would have looked into it by now.   I've had many. They range from non-scary to terrifying. Sometimes I wish I knew why they happen so often to me. Maybe they happen more to certain people because they are open to it, maybe it is just 'right place at the right time' scenario. Who really knows? One thing though, they sure add a special spice to life that not everyone gets.   They are just digging their own grave.   Someone should post the essay to r/mormon, might do some good over there.   Let us know how it turns out!   And EBay can't seem to find the item #, or my previous purchase. I called and fiddled with the 5digit numbers until I got a answering machine and left a message. Don't know if it will help, but it is worth a shot.   I will! I'd love to get my money back and get the right one. I was so excited when I got my games and guitar all in one day. Can't play til I get the right controller though. Thank you for your help, I feel a lot better now knowing ebay will do the right thing.   Now, how do I use buyer protection?   Yes. The seller definitely said Xbox 360, http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rock-Band-Fender-Stratocaster-Controller-Guitar-Hero-/221580823418?   http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rock-Band-Fender-Stratocaster-Controller-Guitar-Hero-/221580823418?  No dongle, but it does say for the 360, I feel so screwed.   In case ya were wondering, the seller said it was for the 360, check it out. http://www.ebay.com/itm/Rock-Band-Fender-Stratocaster-Controller-Guitar-Hero-/221580823418?   Ok, I'll give it a shot. I'd like to know about the entity that is bound to me.   It is wireless. It came with the strap. Not sure about a dongle.   Adapter? Not sure, what do I look for?   No. It said Rock Band Stratocaster, I am a noob and didn't realize they made the strats for PlayStation as well as 360.   The owner says no refunds, and the guitar itself looks to be new. I do not own a PlayStation, so I cannot use this. If anyone knows what can be done please let me know. I just received a bunch of Rock Band games in the mail and was so excited to play. Everything arrived the same day! I am beyond bummed here.   At first I was all nooooo-not Lana, but then I thought again. She would be an amazing singer for The Roadhouse.    My boyfriends iPhone didn't even require an update for this. I'm deleting my game if it hasn't been updated by tonight. What a waste of my time.   I'm waiting too. This is some bs, making me not want to play anymore.   A freshly used and discarded condom thrown on the ground right by the camera. I don't believe I need to go into the 'why' aspect.   That's harsh. Good luck!!   Exactly.   Damn. I wish that link worked :(   Oh man, if you could find some I'd be so happy. I always wondered we get that one video. If that thing was as big and flying as low as people said it was, almost any camera should've been able to capture something. I know the pic on the newspaper that came out the next day was computer generated, I mean, c'mon! Not one person could have submitted a real photo of it? I really think they were confiscated. I bet people went to their film development store and the film was taken or exposed (on purpose) or something. With all those eyewitnesses there should be plenty of photos.   This kinda is my point. Children can go their whole little lives thinking and believing something. I mean, so many of us believed in St. Nick. I'm sure there were kids that wanted to be elves. I'm sure some would have put the idea that if they could just look like an elf, they'd BE an elf. Elves don't exist, but try telling that to a child who believes firmly. Now, when I was younger I thought I was a witch. With POWERS. I waited on my 16th birthday for my 'powers' to show. They didn't. If I could have had a doctor give me 'powers', I would have. Witches aren't real, either. My point is that children aren't capable of long term thinking. They aren't capable of comprehending their actions. When adults, who should have critical thinking skills, who should be able to think long term, forget all of this and solely listen to a child say "I wanna be a boy, even tho I am a girl", I think they should be listened to, but it shouldn't be played into. If a girl wants to be a boy, put her in boy scouts (or a similar program), hell buy her boy clothes. Don't reassign her gender. It could be a really big, life long mistake. I think it's really scary when adults start treating children as if they are 'little adults'. It's insanity. You become an adult not just by age, but by life experience. A child has no life experience to grasp onto, they can't put things into perspective the way an adult can.  I would also like to say, I am not against reassignment surgery on adults. Adults of sound mind can do as they wish as long as it doesn't harm anyone. But, children? Let them be children. Don't play into their little games. We're the adults. We need to remember that.    I wasn't talking about doing the procedure on adults. I am discussing adults entertaining the mere notion of changing the gender of a child. Even if 'money' isn't an issue, it is still a huge decision and definitely NOT one for a child to make. Even if that child becomes an adult and DOES go through with the surgery, I think it is better to wait. People change and children are not really ones to make knowledgeable, healthy LIFE LONG decisions. If Janie wants to become Jimmy at 10 or so, and then gets the OK to do it, Janie might realize later in life, "hey, I want children and I want to actually birth them." That person may miss out on things because they really thought and "believed" they were born the wrong gender. I also realize it is rare on non-adults, but I know it happens. Maybe I am naiive, but I do not believe this is something a child should decide. It's an adult decision. For an adult to make for themselves.   I have always wondered where the photos are. If so many people saw it, certainly more than 1 camera had to capture it. Where are they? Were they confiscated? Did people really NOT think to photo or video it? If anyone knows where there are photos or video (not just the one everyone saw over Phoenix itself), I'd be interested in seeing them.   So what if the boys wore skirts? The real issue here is children being allowed to choose their gender. I swear to God if they had a surgery to turn a child into an animal because the child really believed they were born a kitty, they'd do it. A decision like that is life-long, and shouldn't be done because of a child's wants. Very disturbing. Children have no real world knowledge about their gender, that comes with time, learning, and mature personal growth. Children really have no capacity to make the decision of gender switching on a permanent level. For adults to entertain the question is a huge issue, too. Seems to me docs just want to make money with no real forward thought of what they are really doing.  Edit: Not sure why this got downvoted. I sincerely don't think people grasp the issue with children deciding their own gender. Children (and teens) can barely decide anything, they think they know everything, and how many of them really know next to nothing? I'd say a vast majority. I don't mean in the terms of learning, I simply mean in the terms of who they are. Children go their whole little lives wanting to be a doctor, fireman, police officer, teacher, rock star, actor, etc etc. You know what most of them end up doing? None of those things. They might be a nameless hack on the net. They might be flipping burgers at McD's. Children can't decide shit for themselves, let alone their gender. If it's really that huge of an issue, maybe, just maybe they should see a doctor who can help understand why they feel that way and that doctor can decide if they would be a candidate as an adult for the surgery. (They should do follow ups as the child grows to see if they even still feel that way, the child might not. Or they might. Oh yes, they should also be loved. No matter their ADULT choice.)   How do I update it? Usually I restart my kindle and there's the update. This time nothing. What do I do?  	98
                   I heard on Howard Stern via an interview with David Spade that Kevin James is box office gold.  All his movies gross $100 million.

 Went to ER- no other symptoms, the area was swollen and painful. Doctor said it could be a bite, but it's being treated as a bacterial infection. Two steroids and antibiotics have brought the swelling down, but is still painful and red.   Back of the thigh.     	3
 [Overflow from Tahoe into the Truckee river.](http://www.truckeeriverkeepers.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Truckee-Tahoe-boca-900x600.jpg) Normally it is up around those tree banks.  Probably want to get out there soon. The two tributary rivers behind my house that feed Tahoe should be about 4ft deep right now. They are about a foot deep at most. That much because we got some rain this month.  edit: site with more info http://www.truckeeriverkeepers.com   They must have gotten permission to dredge. Last I heard the coast guard grounded her due to shallow water after she was stuck on the sand bar. I am glad you had a good time.   Bit more than that:  http://i.imgur.com/vxZrq.jpg  https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DZ56uSY03_g/mqdefault.jpg    East coasters [need to see this](https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU)- the reason behind these stuck weather patterns.   Tahoe is so low it is no longer feeding the Truckee river and snowpack was officially 0 this year. They have had to dry dock the tourist boats because the water level is too low to get to dock.   The water is really algae-murky too near the shoreline. It's a complete mess.   The overflow from Lake Tahoe into the Truckee river- which feeds tributaries to this- hasn't been flowing for a year and a half - Tahoes water level is too low. Add 0 (zero) snowpack this season and Nevada is cooked.  Such a shame - this area of the sierra foothills was so beautiful. I wonder how the tribes are handling it.   You never explored the unfinished map of the Emerald Dream. It's amazing. And no - not all green. Giant plants and flowers though.   If I were a teacher forced to teach creationism I would include major creationism stories from around the world, including the Aztec, Navajo, Babylonian, Sumerian, Dogon, Chinese   Indian creationism stories, with an emphasis on similarities. I would be sure to give them all equal weight and measure.       I just figured he had a bunch of virgins in the basement, eating vegan and running treadmills till he needed another one.   Some people are just too mean to die.   What I meant was that fennel and kohlrabi have an allelochemical defense mechanism against peppers and they don't do well when grown near each other.   That ain't Jesus calling him...and why he's afraid to die.   Yes I have noticed for the past two summers there is a preponderance of it in those states.   What are they planted near? Don't plant peppers near fennel or kohlrabi.  I  would dig a little natural compost in around, make sure they have good drainage and just give them some time. You might want to try a little epsom salts (half teaspoon per gallon of warm water) and water them once a week for a couple weeks with that.   Be careful with nitrogenous fertilizers though. If you over fertilize peppers with nitrogen they will get lush leaves and no fruit. You might want to try a dry vegetable mix fertilizer at half recommended dosage. Make sure to get a fertilizer with usable iron and sulfur.   I live near the mountains now and we have wild ones. But I did grow hybrids in my rock garden (in the midwest) with alstroemeria, dog-tooth violets, lady slipper, yellow and purple dwarf siberian irises, johnny jump ups around the base of them -and purple and yellow columbine.  I loved that garden.   Spinach always grew like crazy in my raised bed. (I let my chickens bed on it for half the winter and tossed wood ash from winters fireplace in it) I learned to toss it into darn near everything. Scrambled eggs? Go grab a couple double handfuls to toss in. Fried Rice? Same. And every single slow cooker meal. It especially goes well with pork dishes.   I had some morning glories come in through my kitchen window from a trellis of it in my annual bed. I loved the sunlight shining through the petals in the morning.   Bright Angel Point?                                 And this shits safe to drink, huh? Unless you are a plant.       And just try posting anything that could possibly be perceived as even 7th generation criticism of Warcraft or Blizzard on /r/wow. It's blatantly obvious that it is corporate controlled at this point. I was shocked at some of the very mild statements that I and others have made lately that were dv to death.   It's not a circle-jerk as much as a dick sucking contest.       GD?  Edit: Ok I had my coffee. Got it.    I started noticing an anti-female 'anti-feminist' astroturfing campaign about 8 months ago. I'm in marketing.   So about 2 months ago an old colleague contacted me about references. I asked him what he had been doing and he said he had been doing PR postings for the Republican party under a media group contract. I asked him why he left and he said it was because it had been turned into a *'Woman hatred, feminist hatred, made up stories fest 24/7"* in "prepping" for a Hillary run. He said they were even posting as rabid, crazy people claiming to be 'feminists' to make them look bad.  He quit when met someone and fell in love, and realized that he was posting, ultimately, about her, and his mother, and his sisters.   A lot of people fall for slick 'advertising' - even redditors. Usually a clue is when all of a sudden you notice a clear trend popping up.    All of the achieves in Draenor includes:  Mythic Draenor Raider  Complete the Mythic raiding achievements listed below. Mythic: Gruul Mythic: Oregorger Mythic: Hans'gar and Franzok Mythic: Beastlord Darmac Mythic: Flamebender Ka'graz Mythic: Operator Thogar Mythic: Blast Furnace Mythic: Kromog Mythic: Iron Maidens Mythic: Blackhand's Crucible Mythic: Kargath Bladefist Mythic: The Butcher Mythic: Tectus Mythic: Brackenspore Mythic: Twin Ogron Mythic: Ko'ragh Mythic: Imperator's Fall   Me too. I guess I will go sign up again. Still not thrilled with the garrison thing- but it at least shows someone was listening. Or maybe the numbers were beating them over the head.   Economic, social and technological.  Warning: long.  People pretty much stayed in the same places. My great grandmothers home was built by her father in 1920. She lived there until a few weeks before she died in 1983- when my grandmother cared for her in the house *they* bought in 1958.   There were long term familial and neighborly support structures in place. People knew each other, and helped each other. The routine in the evenings was to go sit on the porch after supper and people who were out walking would stop and visit, and tell stories and talk politics or whatever. If you had a big porch like my great gran you had a few pitchers of cold tea ready. Same people, same faces, going back to the depression/war era.  Part of the reason for porch sitting or taking walks was to see people, part of the reason was AC wasn't common back then and it was nice to cool off in the evenings outside.  The generation of people older than me by 8-10 years; when they graduated college and got jobs, companies started moving people across the country. That was the beginning of the breakdown of the support system.  When I graduated HS I worked at a local pet shop for a few months, then got my own place. A very nice little rental that was comfortably paid for with one weeks check. There were no 'credit checks' back then- it was inconceivable that you could not afford a place to live with even the humblest of jobs. I was able to go to college part time and save back for the downpayment on my first house.  In the 2000's, when an artificial economy was built on the housing 'market' - driven by higher and higher property values (how are you going to *grow* an economy on stable values?) suddenly people couldn't afford to purchase homes, hell they could barely afford rent.  This also means that people move around a lot. More social breakdown, combined with technology that keeps people entertained in their artificial environments. And people having to work more than one job at a time that leaves little room for socializing with neighbors struggling to do the same.   And here we are today.   When I see pictures or google maps pics of European cities in which there are a lot of folks out and about, socializing, I know they are doing well. It's a thumbstick measure I have internalized.   My guild killed a lot of bosses over time. A lot of those moments were memorable. [We were always doing stupid, fun, wild stuff, from vanilla right through MOP.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/11499710@N00/)  But about epics, I'll put it like this:   What if you were Indiana Jones and went on an adventure, endured some grueling moments, challenged fate, monsters, your skills and the elements and finally emerged victorious with a glorious, magical ring.  So you go back to town ... and half the people are walking around with the same ring, having barely done a thing to achieve it.  First off, there is definitely not the same sense of achievement and pleasure for the people who didn't leave town or even break a sweat to get the ring. The excitement and joy would be diminished. Ho hum, just another bit of gear.  Secondly, Indy would just be like.. fuuck.   I didn't unsub because of the hunter issue. My unsub was in protest of this xpac. I have 3 100's. One at 675 so it is not like I didn't give it a good shot.   We paid 20% more and waited 14+ months for an expansion that removed more playable / fun content from the game than it has added:  1. Flying  2. Reforging + Item Upgrades  3. Scenarios  4. Character Abilities  5. Valor/Justice Points  6. Daily quest hubs  7. 10 Heroic ('Mythic') Raiding  8. Guild levelling/perks  9. Repeatable rare mobs  10. Gathering professions for over half a year and counting  11. All old school unique professions scrapped in all future 'content'.  12. Decent ilvl gear from world bosses (650?)  13. Previous expansions' content scrapped: MoP legendary questline, Garrosh heirlooms, Isle of Thunder solo scenarios, MoP challenge mode content, old raid item drop nerfs  14. "Promised"/Delayed content:  Farahlon  Karabor/BladespireIron Docks quest hub  Tanaan Jungle  Trial of the Gladiator  Battle Pet Breeding/Epic Pets  Multiple garrison features: the ability to put your garrison is various locations, renaming your epic followers, garrison Trophies for killing rares/elite mobs in Draenor, Building Garrison Defences, Diablo 3-style transmog system   ------------------------------------   Not sure how anyone can reconcile this. Never in the history of WoW have so many features been removed or scrapped.   As a child of the '60's I can tell you that people were out more and interacting. In neighborhoods and city streets. I watched that change and have some theories on it.   Aunt Thomasina.   Ok get the other one. We can still dual wield. Get the glowing green feathered shoulders and the green mail robe and gloves (LW pattern) and hang out in your main city - with a green pet. :)   Yes, it took two mini patches. Thanks!   See http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/3995xq/new_to_this_game/   I think the writer is full of shit. I have known two black players on the game - one of whom was my exclusive running buddy for the past 8 months. Well past the time we hit 100 we used to pop in and do LFD to help strangers get their Leeroy. My friend? He would have said something if he sensed any racism about it. He thought it was funny as hell.     My raider in vanilla was my pally, mage for bc / wrath (hunter was pvp) then I reversed that with hunter and mage for cata. MOP Hunter/pally raiding.   I decided to focus 100% on the hunter last half of MOP and started her first in WoD, not knowing that they would fuck the Beast spec so badly that a dev even apologized on twitter and did an early mini patch to try to help fix them.    My point being, if I have a minimum range limit with the bow then I need to effectively melee. That means proper weaps- ability. AP used to be the go-to stat.    The hunter dead zone is impossible in several encounters in dungeons or raids. But if we got our unique pet abilities back and were allowed to melee and dual wield again, it would be fun in pvp.   I played with that 'dead zone' for a long time on my hunter. It just can't be done without bringing the other elements back, including proper traps instead of the bullshit we have now.   Edit: about my first sentence there. Here is an example: The [End Time in Cata](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/ugSVZK-k4PM/maxresdefault.jpg). You had to be within the circle of lights on the encounters, remember? If you were within those- as you needed to be - you were too close range to shoot the boss.  If you stepped back to where you were at closest range to shoot- you were outside the light and only did about 10% to 20% damage.   It was like an Anti Hunter encounter.    I absolutely agree with everything you said. Not only have they made classes homogenous- they did the same thing with hunter pets.  One of the Fun things about having a hunter was going out and getting elusive pets that had unique abilities (like horn toss for rhinos or snatch (disarm) for birds etc). These abilities were then useful for different encounters, battlegrounds, enemies, etc. It was part of being a well-rounded hunter.   Now all the pets are just buff machines for the raid.    Give me those pet abilities back- plus the hunter melee abilities we used to be able to use, including dual wielding for close encounters (I still have my Edge of Chaos and Sundered Bone axe in the bank) and full-on aggressive mode for pets- and I will gladly give up my several yards.  I used to love parking my cat at flags - on aggressive and prowl (stealthed with burst damage coming out) and watch it pop out -stunning the crap out of the would-be flag stealer and wrecking them while I threw traps and arcane shot. Yea, I'll give up my close up yards for that. But I don't think you would like it.   As a player with a 100 druid healer- I applaud you for posting this.    I'm hostile about it because it's the first time since I started playing that - for any toon - the ability imbalance forced me to play a spec I never wanted to play. It lost the element of fun. Same thing that many others are complaining about.   I am pissed because Blizzard, to my mind, has ruined the game to the point where I had to unsub to protest after 10 yrs consistent subbing. I even kept my sub through business trips overseas and hiatuses when I couldn't play at all or took a break for a few months.  They decided to chase a trend of social network/Facebook style games instead of sticking to the formula everyone loved.  It's like Paul Sams (former COO Blizzard) said in his first interview this week after leaving Blizzard:  **Paul Sams**:   First and foremost, *I learned that you must put game quality and player experience first in everything that you do.* Gamers are not driven to buy games because they have a clever business model, they buy games that are *fun and immersive that deliver on what was promised.* I also learned that being a trend chaser or first mover is not a key to victory.   *Force feeding a development team to chase a business model or game type trend* when the team doesn't love it is a likely losing proposition. A happy and motivated team that is making a game that they absolutely love *with a leadership team that doesn't force them to ship their game before it is ready is part of that formula for success.*   We used to co-raid with Conquest, Kilrogg. They had a kid in there like that. Awesome player and everyone would think he was a 30 yr old raider .. until he got on vent.    Nice attitude there Chuck.   Maybe you think people should just get a whole suit of epics simply for buying the game?   Part of what is wrong with the game now is the loss of a sense of accomplishment that comes from spending time excelling and focusing on a task, then succeeding. Those are the memories that stand out and make you smile.   I unsubbed this week for the first time in 10 yrs. I have always, until now, been able to play how I wanted. I won't play again until blizzard gets us back to the WORLD of Warcraft instead of the Facebook/UI/game WoD turned it into.   Old school trick. For the first trip to Menethil from IF we used to jump off of one spot on the dam at Loch Modan. It was a death leap but if you did it right you would end up at the GY at Menethil. Bingo flight path. Saved the run past those damn spiders, which killed you anyway, most likely.    So I am in a WoD dungeon the first time. My Hunter - I have been playing and raiding with her since July 05.   We get in there - first pull on a group mob- all is clear behind them.. I set my pet on the target - pet hits the target. Then I use Barrage- same main target ...and the ammo is going *through my body* to hit a mob that is across the room behind me. I swear to fucking christ if the DL hadn't seen it himself and started laughing and freaking out I probably would have been kicked.   Next area. My pet and the Lock pet both start going crazy in the room- like they are stuck on these paths like a tram on rails and going a hundred miles an hour.   Fuck me if we didn't pull every damn thing there. Thankfully we were with old school experienced players that knew stuff was bugging out.     level ranks gone, and fuck buying spells.  I really loved level ranks for spells. For example with a pvp mage I kept lvl 1 or 2 Blizzard and Arcane Nova keybound and could constantly pop around or blizzard areas to uncover stealthed enemies and only use tiny amounts of mana. Also, if a lower level wanted mana/health food I could make that for them. I can't do that now.   There were benefits to all of my toons to be able to access lower level spells/abilities.    All hybrids. I loved my shockadin.    Seriously? But.. cheetahs are the cat that does go supersonic- so that makes absolutely.. oh yea.    I think the Deer travel form art and animation is some of the best done in the game. Someone studied deer/elk.    My bear ass still looks like a pointy pentagon.   Hunter  Lore: Cry havoc and unleash the Stampede of war.  Player: Fucking Blizzard, making me go Marks when I been playing Beast for 9 years.   How I felt throughout Highmaul.   Should have played Vanilla Pally. https://www.flickr.com/photos/11499710@N00/8704746307/in/photostream/   No dude. Tanking Wars were worse than worthless in tm vs ss.   Fucking brilliant, praise Uther!   Not only legendaries- but it used to be getting a purple was a big deal. Now there are low lvl new people running around decked in purps. I will never forget the first one that I got - at lvl 60 in Vanilla MC.   As an economist once said, "Both a poor man and a rich man can choose which bridge to sleep under."   That's the one I was considering. Especially if she has psychically picked up on Jons true parentage.   I don't know, man. She is so evil- I had a suspicion that she is possibly doing all she can to eradicate the Baratheons. We will see.   Weird. I have adblock on and got no message. If I had I would not have posted that particular video. I'm sorry bout that.   I thought I was the only one that tried to use google to see if I could locate a place and see what's still there. Howdy!  Amazing how bustling and busy everything looked back in the day. Streets look positively empty now.   Same for some of us women. I need quiet like a polar bear needs ice. The hubby can never take a clue on that it seems. I think this is more a 'human' issue than male/female.   Yes but we don't leave our hand in our bra, cupping our boob, for upwards of 30 minutes - heh.   I taught a class on Nostradamus. I taught them that this 'sept' did not mean "7th month", that was a crock.   Also, when calculating the difference between the calendar of Nostradamus day and ours - 1999 would actually be 2001. "King of the Mongols'' is also wrong.  I taught this class in the mid-1990's.   L'an mil neuf cens nonante neuf sept mois, Du ciel viendra un gran Roy d'effrayeur. Resusciter le grand Roy d'Angolmois. Avant apres Mars regner par bon heur.  The year 1999, Sept, From the sky will come a great King of Terror. To bring back to life the great King of the Mongols, Before and after Mars to reign by good luck.  Your post just reminded me of this. Now back to your regularly scheduled program.    I don't think I could ever 'cull' any. They just hang out and breed and have a good time. I feed them Wardley pleco algae tabs a few times a week. Otherwise they eat leftovers.   I keep thinking that after she kills / removes everything from Stannis, once he is a completely broken man, she will declare another person the 'real king'.    I absolutely agree with you- having read all of the books multiple times and now watching the show.   I don't know how anyone can make dany out to be a villain...if anything she was too kind in not executing every one of the masters- or letting the slaves do it.   And Stannis is an rigid, arrogant, uptight, unfeeling asshole who just watched his only child burn to death.    Let it begin.    At one time Route 19 in Florida had massive Jacaranda tree tunnels over long stretches. The ones from Crystal River to south of New Port Richey were astonishing. Bigger and more lush than in the picture here. But the greed heads came through, cut them all down, widened the road and stuck malls and mall parking lots all up and down the stretch. Some of those are abandoned now.  They could have made a secondary road for not much more money. Apparently someone hated trees, especially giant, lush purple blossomed trees that people would drive down from all over just to see.       Something like this happened in the early 60's to someones daughter that I knew. But the 2 cops took her around the corner and felt her up.  So the dad, grandpa and a few cousins and brothers went to the station and waited out back for the weasels to get off work. When they came out in their civvies they drug them into an alley and 'gave them the beat-down of their lives'. Along with a threat to do it again and worse.   People are too complacent these days.       lel   I was thinking, just strip down in court.                         First one I experienced was sitting on one of those cement benches outside the San Fran airport by the drop off zone. Thought at first that there was a big truck rolling up - but it just kept rocking.   Some of the worst after-disaster injuries I have seen were to the feet- hurricanes and tornados. I suppose house damage is all the same- lots of broken glass, nails, etc. At least have a pair of heavy soled shoes waiting by the door.    Ramsey gets turned into a white walker. White Walker Bolton. You only thought he was bad before.   You missed just a few things:  * Tyrion is introduced to the captive dragons. They love him because he is actually the son of Joanna Lannister and Aerys Targaryon. He sneaks down during the Pit fight and releases them. They all frolic like puppies together then go burn all the masters to death. No one makes fun of Tyrion, the Dragon Rider, ever, again.  * Jorah Mormont wins the Pit fight like the man he is- then discovers that dragons blood is the cure for Stone. A dragon graciously dribbles a little blood on his patch- curing him. He and Dany kiss and make up.       Start with the events that leads to this:  Aegon: Yield now, and you may remain as Lord of the Iron Islands. Yield now, and your sons will live to rule after you. I have eight thousand men outside your walls.  Harren: What is outside my walls is of no concern to me. Those walls are strong and thick.  Aegon: But not so high as to keep out dragons. Dragons fly.  Harren: I built in stone. Stone does not burn.  Aegon: When the sun sets, your line shall end.      xposted to /r/photoshopsofkimjongun   Conveniently forgot to mention this:  Issue with that big community center.

I would also say you didn't bother to read my post, but came in with a pre-concieved belief system and were really responding to that, rather than the facts.         How it's never been mentioned that suspects in the Holly Bobo case are also somehow involved in the Kristie Moon disappearance:   Kristie Baugus Moon was dating Michael Pearcy when she disappeared 10/27/1999. According to her mother, he was the last one to see her.    Michael Pearcy is the son of Mark Pearcy- both Mark and Jeff Pearcy are under arrest for being accessories and accessories after the fact in the Holly Bobo kidnapping and murder.  That is from an article I wrote after digging around for info on the Bobo case some months back- at:  http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/2fxx1l/kristie_moon_disappearance_connection_with_holly/  I haven't yet seen mention of this in any articles. It's like they want the Kristie Moon case to just blow away with the wind. And the Holly Bobo case is just fucked beyond recognition.    Fabulous write up. Thank you, it's a fascinating bit of Americana.  Could you (or would you) post the address so we can see the house on Google Maps? This is probably as real a haunted house as any recorded.

We had shots of our smoking court in my late 70's yearbook. It was not a big deal back then.   There was not a plethora of uptight, thin lipped, disapproving, unbending, tightasses lurking around every corner waiting to smash anything outside of the right wing, talibanish, christian coalition or left wing 'gotta control people for their own good' elements. . Everything was so 'live and let live' back then.   What the hell happened?   All of us. I take that back. One boy died from falling off a parking garage after a concert and another had a rare brain aneurysm at age 22 that killed him instantly.    Reminds me of an old torture method used by (either the Japanese or Koreans- can't recall right now) where they would starve two military prisoners and then offer each the chance to feed the other a piece of bread or eat it themselves. Either starve or let your combat partner starve.  This is just about that fucking disgusting and egregious.   I'm finding the advertisers and calling all of them.   they have been working hand in hand with the multinational and 'too big to fail' corporations to turn us into a large 3rd world labor force.  Haven't you noticed the massive astroturfing against Unions and labor protections? The massive inequality? Pulling the safety net (actually an outright war on the poor lately), turning 'low education' people against those in poverty- against union and labor and pollution protections?   It keeps up and we will be as well off as Bangladesh.      Wouldn't it be cool to have a massive walk-in closet?   Another thing sorely lacking in garrisons  :D    Not back when we had unlimited sheeps with no cd :D   Why, yes.

No, they aren't. A lot of people have them but don't ride them because of the animation.    It actually makes me extremely sad to see my favorite game turned into this.  Me too. I did't mind dropping money for store mounts until now. And that purple cat is my favorite. But I won't buy it from principle.   I don't know. I did ogre beads for the real ones.   I still have [Carrot on a Stick] on two toons banks. Hoarder in game.   *grabs cane and puts uppers in*  ...And I did the same with my gnome, for a cat mount. But it was harder because my legs are shorter. And people on my server had never seen a gnome on a massive cat before me, and it was good. But no one ever asked me to dance. Anywhere.   I swear I have been wondering if they hired some 3rd world hack/code company for the '250' new developers. I about cried when I saw what they did to my NE female. She runs like a linebacker- on quaaludes. They all look horrible. I have to keep the new art turned off- too distracting to play.    Apparently so do the WoD mount animators.    Reminded me more of a McDonalds wind up toy.   Old school doctors used to commonly give family members 'pain pills' to help people along who were dying of painful illnesses. Like, "..be careful, more than 5 of these will stop the heart." Unspoken but understood.   That's why I started /r/StormComing. There have been so many extreme weather incidents not being reported - starting a few years ago it seems - that I thought there needed to be a place for them.   If these millions in payouts were coming out of the FOP Retirement funds this shit would stop yesterday.   And I am sure it scarred her daughters for life- as it did her husband.    Exactly.     I still oppose assisted suicide.  This is fine, for you. But you should not oppose it for others if that is their choice. All I could think of while reading this is please do not let me go out this way. I will bypass chemo or any level of modern medicine besides pain meds to go quicker and less traumatically- just as most doctors do. I have thought about this for a long time now- and this story just reinforces it.     I would have played more and harder, gotten closer to some people and enjoyed it while it was great.   Now THAT was pvp :)   Asbestos was an awesome guild :)   Text from a post about this:  A little trip down memory lane.  Flickr Album: https://www.flickr.com/photos/11499710@N00/  From early 40 man raids through the surprise appearance (and downing) of the BC launch Bosses, to massive Horde/Alliance raids and battles to the Shan Bu World Tour, (kited by Amaruca and my hunter, Astromeria.)  If you were with Angelic Reign, Conquest, Still Life, Angelic Crusade (Angelic Reigns Raid Guild), Asbestos, Circle of Truth, Reservoir Dogs and some others- you might see yourself in these shots.  Enjoy:                  Bring in some alligators and charge a few bucks at the gate. That's what they do in Florida.   Incredible shot. Thanks for sharing.      You forgot the /s :)   and the numbers are still higher than the end of MoP.  [End of MOP 7.4, end of March, 7.1.](http://www.statista.com/statistics/276601/number-of-world-of-warcraft-subscribers-by-quarter/)  Reforging was a method of fine tuning and personalizing a character. *If you didn't want to use it, you didn't have to.* And as MOP RNG was not as whack as it is in WoD, not necessary. As bad as RNG is in WoD (especially Highmaul gear and random stats on made items) it would be a welcome relief.  A lot of people enjoy spending time fine tuning and personalizing their character so that they were not just generic copies of other Pally's, DK's, etc. For instance, I loved my shockadin.  There was no reason not to leave reforging in the game.   We are in a minimal El Nino right now. As in,[ it is weak to moderate.](http://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/anomaly/anomnight.current.gif)  Compare that to a [strong El Nino](https://youtu.be/9rPqIuXlWuA?t=44s)  There is a 80%-90% possibility we may get a strong El Nino in the near future, but it will take a little time even as it strengthens to generate observable effects.  There is an approximately 90% chance that El Nio will become enhanced or strong through Northern Hemisphere summer 2015, 80% throughout 2015.   After leveling 2 toons to 100, I boosted my old druid to 90 who, embarrassing enough, was still at 60 from 40 man progression. I leveled to 100 through WoD.  Since there were areas of the world she missed through that, I did a ground mount only run from Ghostlands to Booty Bay last week. I wanted to enjoy the music and scenery and take my time- hitting every raid in between, from Zul Aman to Zul Gurub.   I opened it up on the LFR and had three people by Zul Aman (all 100's) who had never been in ZA (shockingly to me). From there out we ranged between 10 and 15 players the rest of the way. Mostly 100's.   People ended up leading mini tours through their favorite areas, and it just kind of happened that way. I showed them Rausche's grave and it was pretty goosebumpy. Then another person wanted to show everyone something else and it just took off from there.   Best day on wow in months and months.   I leveled 3 100's and have blocked my other alts from progressing past 90. I don't go to draenor any longer- haven't for over a month. And I cancelled.   It was Blizz fault the moment they decided to blend server populations.    Blended servers :(   Oh yes, and they hate FEMA. Not a good mix.  Edit: Ok so not always. Ted Cruz voted down FEMA and emergency funds for Hurricane Sandy, but is screaming for federal funds for Texas' current disaster. http://thedailybanter.com/2015/05/ted-cruzs-mind-blowing-hypocrisy-on-texas-floods-shows-idiocy-of-republican-philosophy/   face the consequences for doing so.  Blizzard is 'facing the consequences' right now- losing over 3M subs.  Actually since you aren't a professional pollster, remarks such as "Not a SINGLE person liked reforging when we had it" and all of your other subjective remarks are absolutely worthless.   I and every other player I know, from casual to raider, liked reforging. The 3rd party apps just simplified it.   And.. I have never, ever heard or read a player complaining about flying. That is inconceivable to me as a 10 yr player.   I have seen a lot of blizzard apologists lately. Considering that many of the more rabid ones ("I HATE FLYING!!") are probably Blizzard employees sent out to try to prop up a dead horse- you are pretty damn extreme.        I don't understand why people are so dramatic when it comes to cancelling your subscription to this game.  I have one of the oldest guilds on an original vanilla server. Through the years we have made friendships - some 10 years old now. We have also lost a few people due to tragedies and illnesses.   In our case we lost 2 friends to long term illnesses that were made a bit more bearable by the game. In these cases family members came on and met us after their passing, to request that we never remove them from our roster. And they are still there.   So the whole "just cancel your sub and quit whining, it's only a game!" doesn't always meet with reality.      This is a great, illustrative post reflecting exactly how I have seen the evolution of the game since cross-realm.   And the streamlining? I leveled a new toon last week to check the leveling process- I never died, I needed no help to do any of it and I popped a new level about every 3-5 quests- never finishing a quest chain.   You can bypass entire sections of the world now. What a waste.    When we used to know other players, (no cross-realm) and have mount parades in IF, kite dragons/bosses to major cities, have snowball fights in the tram, etc. etc.   Unfortunately  I hear it is one mass apex grind for the most part.   In 10 yrs I never, ever heard anyone saying the game was 'too social'. Quite the opposite, a lot of people said the social aspect was what kept them in the game at periods that the content grew stale.   Because we screamed, yelled and threw a huge fit. One spec being 10 times more effective than the other spec? That was bullshit.   Blizz actually apologized for this screw up.    ok...   Yep.  Point being- it's fun to swoop and fly through the air with your friends into a gorgeous sky, over a remarkable landscape.   They had said they were going to make an MOP style start- flying at end level but ground mount through leveling. I had no problem with that. If they had told the truth I never would have upgraded.   This was my concern, that a 'stuck' weather pattern may not ease up on this for some time. Just like the 'stuck' weather pattern that brought the drought to Ca and the months of flooding to the UK last year.  The reason for these stalled weather patterns is here: https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU   It's not what you might think. But it's the only thing that makes sense.

C/P from the Warcraft forums says it all: WoD has been a contraction. Not an expansion.  ----------------------------------  **A list of all the removed features in WoD**  1. Flying  2. Reforging + Item Upgrades  3. Scenarios  4. Character Abilities  5. Valor/Justice Points  6. Daily quest hubs  7. 10 Heroic ('Mythic') Raiding  8. Guild levelling/perks (instead of just removing cash flow they remove the whole thing)  9. Repeatable rare mobs  10. Effectively gathering professions for over half a year and counting  11. Decent ilvl gear from world bosses (650 for Drov seriously?)  12. Battleground 'Call to Arms'  13. Previous expansions' content: MoP legendary questline, Garrosh heirlooms, Isle of Thunder solo scenarios, MoP challenge mode content, old raid item drop nerfs  **"Promised"/Delayed content**  Farahlon  Karabor/Bladespire  Iron Docks quest hub   (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/568125120562094081)  Tanaan Jungle  Trial of the Gladiator  Battle Pet Breeding/Epic Pets  Multiple garrison features: the ability to put your garrison is various locations, renaming your epic followers, garrison Trophies for killing rares/elite mobs in Draenor, Building Garrison Defences  Diablo 3-style transmog system (it was being worked on as at November 2013)  PvP Spectator Mode (confirmation needed)  Fixing Stormwind  ----------------------------------  Has this expansion removed more than it has added?! We paid 20% more and waited 14+ months for this? Can anyone reconcile this? Never in the history of WoW have so many features been removed or scrapped. I think the community deserve an answer.   This whole 'anti-flying' thing is so strange. They are so vicious about it.   No one is stopping them from walking-ground mounting anywhere they want to.   It's almost like blizzard put a bunch of their 'new developers' out there to belittle and attack players who like to fly to try to lead the conversation.   Yep.. I am just one of going on 4 million players who have quit the game. Why should blizzard care about that?  From the nasty attitude of white knights like you- it apparently can't happen soon enough. That's another thing I miss about old Wow. How cool and friendly most players were. Now too many of them on the forums act like 4chan rejects. If you want to walk- then fucking walk- no one is stopping you.      Yes they did.       Henry Lee Lucas looks like George W. Bush in some shots.   Notice that all of the advertisements for the new purple cat mount show it flying over Shadowmoon Valley in Draenor?   http://i.ytimg.com/vi/mPqqjV3VzhI/maxresdefault.jpg   I guess when you have been paying a monthly fee for 10 years to a company you get to feel a little 'entitled' to get at *least* the same level of service you got from the preceding years.   Or perhaps you are the kind of person who pays for a steak and is afraid to complain when the waitress flops a hamburger on your plate.     10yr player here. The continual addition of unique content and expansion of capabilities, like flying, is exactly why I and millions of other players re-subbed month after month for years.      Pre-purchase for Draenor included a Raven flying mount and a promise by developers that flying will come 'later on'.   It's like pre-purchasing a meal that includes a steak knife as part of the deal, but the dinner consists of stale bread and water with a promise of a steak 'later on'. So you then you get to 'later on' - and they don't even throw you a crumb.   https://youtu.be/UqJdkV6iiFA   I have been reading the forums for years. I have never, ever seen this many upset players in all of those years. Something went terribly wrong here and it is time for Blizzard to fix it if they actually care more about the game and player base than the stockholders.   I was wondering about this. I am unsubbing when my last month is over. The news about flying was the final nail in that coffin, on top of the no-content train wreck of WoD. I was wondering if anyone at blizzard would be curious as to why I am unsubbing after 10 yrs.  About the 'no flying' bit:  I had a buddy who was doing design for Blizzard and she talked about the time and creativity it took to allow for play on the Z plane.   They had to hire extra people and put in extra hours to prep areas like Elwynn forest for flight because they have unpatched, untexturized landscapes that can't be seen from a riding mount and that need finished for flight. There are also elements to coding and design that make it a bit more difficult to implement than simple ground tracking.  The (until Wod) incredible content and finish of the game is why I have paid them a monthly fee for 10 yrs. I am not going to go backwards and forego a real pleasure of the game in order to keep developers 'happy' at this stage, or save blizzard money in developer salaries.  If anti-flight players want to walk, go for it. I'm not stopping you and neither is blizzard.    I did too. We used to re-train promising, 4-6yr old retired race-horses as hunter/jumpers. Getting a bit long in the tooth for more than a little pleasure and trail riding now, though. My last two horses are totally retired. Did you ever ride with your mom and sister?   That is gorgeous. What a joy.  I used to do 3 Day Eventing in the midwest.    It was the musical freestyle portion of the World Equestrian Games. This particular style of training/riding is called [Dressage.](http://www.usdf.org/about/about-dressage/)  [About training](http://www.usdf.org/about/about-dressage/dressage-training.asp).

I initially read this as "Ancient Greeks lining up at ATMs." Did kind of a double take.                  Montreal is great for creepy statues. Here's one I love on McGill College that has a theme of immigration to Canada. If you can see the people in the back, the ones who haven't made it to Canada yet, they're basically starving, near corpses:(https://www.google.com/search?q=montreal+statue+mcgill+college biw=1920 bih=922 source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ei=W92NVd_hI4y0-AHCpJL4DA ved=0CAcQ_AUoAg#imgrc=IexeWSMv48y-VM%3A)   That leads to the question: what does it mean to be a democracy?   While it doesn't go nearly far enough, I was actually surprised that they did distribute their criticism. Here's the line from the report on the US:    There were worrying revelations by whistleblower, Edward Snowden that US intelligence agents spied on prominent human rights   organisations. Law enforcement authorities were accused of heavy-  handedness and intimidation of protestors following demonstrations   against discriminatory treatment by police of African-Americans.  They could have gone on at length about how corporate interests have created legalized corruption that circumvents democracy, but maybe that makes the sequel.   I think the short answer is you can't.   Over two seasons fighting in the Octagon, you don't want to mess with that.   That exact same line leapt out at me.             When I see the American flag now, I usually think "Bow to your sensei".   China also has enormous bubbles in property and currency. Somewhere between Greece, China, the US student loan bubble, and the TPP, I can't imagine we aren't in for a giant economic shock in the near future.      I've come across this site more and more. It's very glossy and predictably pro business, pro tech. Who is behind it? Their About Us section of their web site has a lot of bullshit about digital media and says it is linked from the Atlantic but who is funding it? It strikes me as being a strange site and the lack of comment sections on many issues is suspect. Is this just a huge PR thing?   There was actually an experiment like this in Canada during the sixties. It was only in one small city, in Manitoba but it was wildly successful. It went nowhere because of politics but for a couple of years they had a guaranteed basic income and unemployment fell to an all time low: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mincome         In an ideal world, these people would come with subtitles translating their corporatese into English.               Ha! A Bhutanese Hamlet would probably be a happy Hamlet.   I've been following homesteading locally and would recommend sites that have localized info. Here's a good one for Buffalo to give an idea of how it works though there are a lot of others for different cities: http://buffalorising.com/2013/05/homestead-eligible-properties-buy-a-house-in-buffalo-for-a-single-dollar/   Maybe Yankees caps?   I know exactly what you mean about not being able to paint apartments. Have you ever considered something like homesteading? Depending on your part of the country, it's becoming more common and is realistic for younger couples especially if there are homesteading groups near you.   In other news, Shakespeare believes that Hamlet should stay Danish and perplexed.   It's a shame we don't have some widely recognized symbol representing Northern racism that we could get these companies to ban.   I have a feeling that even a few minutes as King will allow him to do more damage than is conceivable.       I'm not sure if this is the country very many people actually wanted. I think a lot of people's wishes have been ignored or overturned by very powerful systems that don't take into account what average folks want or need. Corporations and government bureaucracy have a range of concerns that have little to do with improving the lives of the citizenry. Profit, power, trickle down, efficiency, all of these things have to line up before the quality of our lives is factored in.         Very hard to tell if these people are completely corrupt or just epically spineless. I stopped worrying about who is which a long time ago since it all ends up in the same ugly place.                But from the fish's perspective, maybe we're humans with fish looking teeth?      At least we can be sure it's somehow connected to him.         They forced a bunch of planes to land and examined them including one in Austria after Snowden initially went to Russia. At first, it was assumed that he had simply changed flights in Moscow. The Bolivian leader's private plane was forced to land after he'd visited Russia because it was suspected he might have Snowden on board.   Not much of a shock that these people are all spying on each other, but nice to have confirmation.      I don't think would make it to Iceland. His flight would likely be intercepted even if they offered him asylum.   Very interesting about Canada. I didn't realize that there was low turnout there. My lasting impression was from being in Quebec during the 1995 Referendum on secession when the voter participation was well over 90%. I guess people vote when they feel they can make a tangible difference.   I think the fact that Iceland is a parliamentary system helps to encourage participation because supposedly "fringe" parties have a real chance to gain seats in government. I'm not Republican or Democrat in the US and although I vote, I really don't feel like it means anything.               That my friend is an excellent question.    Thus far, the United States has never really accepted the Nuremberg Code. While the code was being created, the U.S. was giving people syphilis in Guatemala. It did the same at Tuskegee. Also during the Nuremberg trial, children at the Pennhurst school in southeastern Pennsylvania were given hepatitis-laced feces to eat.         Purity of Essence!              	92
 Dollar sign goes before the number.  Also, dollar sign and USD are redundant. Just use USD.  Which also should go before the number.   Been doing this to me since October.  What's worse is even with no balance carried forward I get a late fee assessed.  Started after I changed plans while I was on a trip because I ran out of data (was on 1GB single line w/Edge and they moved me to 2GB single line at the same price).  This past month I got a bill credit for the inconvenience and a further assurance it's fixed.  Guess I'll see next week when my billing period resets.   Yeah, no kidding, but oil tends to move around inside an engine while it's operating...  Wikipedia on "Motor oil":  "In gasoline engines, the top piston ring can expose the motor oil to temperatures of 160C (320F)."  I do believe that's much hotter than 212F...   The diary would suggest there were plenty or right times and places that were never/haven't yet been shown to viewers.   "The burning smell means it's working!"   So what you're telling me is, Toyota/Subaru designed the FA20 to leak right above the overpipe in order to allow owners such as myself to verify I don't have a bad head gasket?  Ingenious.   Sounds like you might've forgot to set the permissions on the new animation.   Whatever tiny bit of water is in your oil boils off when the engine is running...If there's a lot of water in your oil, you're gonna have a bad time.   No company cares about you (specifically) as a customer.  You are not a precious snowflake.  I don't know where people get this idea...  That said, sorry for the screw up you endured.   That may will be so.  Doesn't change the fact that there was a lot out fun to be had.  Most of the people in this sub were probably still chilling in their parent's panties when 1942 came out.  That's ok.   He's only 75.  But yes, I dread the day.  Such a role model...Ugh I shudder just thinking of it.   Son, wouldn't be no future if not for my time in 'Nam.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcCR4wft3uk  Man seriously I loved nothing more than to Hop in a Huey and throw on Fortunate Son.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM-GZGtqmEw   Yeah, I actually saw that one when I was searching.  I love this guy:  Battlefield Meets Metal: http://youtu.be/6oHmFeIubD0   Ahh, memories.   Not a big reader are we...   "Is the UIDH still present if a customer has opted-out of the advertising programs? Currently, when a customer opts out of the RMA program and is not a participant in Verizon Selects, the UIDH is present. In these circumstances the UIDH is used for the authentication purposes described above, but it cannot be used for advertising purposes because there is no information associated with the UIDH available to our ad partners. Verizon is working to automatically disable the UIDH for customers who are opted out of the RMA program or who opt out in the future. Verizon will also disable the UIDH for any customers who are ineligible to participate in these advertising programs, such as government and enterprise lines. We are in the process of making the systems changes needed to deliver these solutions, and will begin implementing modifications in locations across the country once testing is complete. Customers may opt-out of the RMA program from MyVerizon."   They used music from Batman Begins previously as well.   That is not MY Battlefield theme...  http://youtu.be/vg0Tmydj29M   OP...Best advice is maybe not to obsess about passing and just do your best.  You seem to be posting about this quite a bit this week.  Maybe take a break from it?  Maybe wait to take the test until it's a less stressful time?  I dunno.  That was almost 20 years ago now for me.  All I remember is that I made a right on red that I shouldn't have but they gave me a pass because the sign was really high up on the pole and hard to see in the vehicle I was testing in.   Going slow might be OK for a test situation but in the real world there are lots of places with minimum speed limits...Also, driving below the speed at which the rest of traffic is flowing can be dangerous.   Doesn't seem likely given there's an LG executive interviewed in this article saying they aren't ready to replace the G3 already; they also aren't announcing at MWC...  http://www.androidpit.com/lg-g4-release-date-price-specs-features  Also, I have read a lot about a 3K screen.  3K at 5.3" would be pretty silly given the success of the G3 and Note 4 at 5.5"+...   LG released the G3 on 17 July last year...Given it has been a phenomenal seller I don't see them replacing it this quickly.  They've only just announced the G Flex 2 afterall.  The others of course will introduce new phones at MWC in March as is pretty typical.  The M9 will very likely be the first available given it's already been out in the wild in concept form and teased online.  The M7 was announced in Feb and the M8 in March, so that's pretty in line with history.  The Z3 though was in September.  And this was hardly confirmation:  http://www.techradar.com/us/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/early-images-of-sony-xperia-z4-leak-with-a-little-help-from-007-1277841  The Galaxy S5 and S4 were both April releases after announcements at MWC in their respective years' February; since MWC is later this year than is typical it's likely the phones announced there will release later as well.   Thanks!  I try ;)   My co-workers, degrees and salary would tend to disagree but as ever, I value your insight.   No need to resort to name calling.  I already conceded that you know more about how my cat, who's lived with me his whole life, behaves than I do.   They'll be announced, but very unlikely they'll be available for purchase before summer.   This car doesn't have fogs.  Those are the marker lights/turn signals.  If fogs were installed they'd be in that black vent area.  Like this:  [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/aup9E7N.jpg)   Don't be the jerk who can't be bothered to dust all the snow off their car, allowing chunks to fly off and hit other vehicles.  (your trunk...)  It's not like the 86 platform is hard to reach the top off.   Pub we went to in Fleet a few visits ago had a free range Mastiff.  It was glorious.   He's been my little buddy almost six years, and was a kitten when he joined me.  Think I know my own cat's mannerisms.  But anyway, I digress, as clearly all cats act the exact same way and have no personalities to speak of independent of instinct.  Whatever...   No, that's sitting at the window trying to figure out how to get at the birds eating the bird seed day just put down.   That isn't remotely what my cat looks like when he's about to go get something.  He gets puffed up, ears forward, shows his teeth and chits.  Sometimes he doesn't do the mouth gape bit though.   If you want better performance using the OEM OS isn't the way to do it.  Use CyanogenMod or another variation thereof.  The OEM will never squeeze all the performance there is out of a device because they're hamstrung by having to load their and carrier's crapware.   Yes, I do upgrade my PC.  I bought my last rather than do a homebuild, but since then I've upgraded storage twice (small SSD and then a larger SSD, swapping the small SSD into my bedroom HTPC), and graphics card to a newer single then an SLI configuration.  Processor, I still haven't needed as I'm just at 1080P on my living room TV and I've gotten tired of FPSs.  I certainly understand the parallels - I think though it's probably a case of a phone being much more important to some folks than they are to me, since I can't really do anything with it for work like a lot of folks seem to.  Thanks all for the explainers :)    But how much do these modules cost?  That's what makes the case.  It seems like a solution without a problem.   For those features, never.  I buy new phones for better and bigger screens typically.  If I'm listening to music it's via headphones - people who listen to devices in public over their device speakers...I find that incredibly rude.   FYI Cyandelta is not a Cyanogen product and is not officially supported.  The safest way to update is to use the real nightlies and make backups via recovery periodically...   Man, lots of water spots on the back window at 1:15...thought this was supposed to be a detailing shop?   Ok so...I really need for someone to explain to me the hoopla around this modular phone concept.  I seriously don't get it.  I feel like as a male age 18-49 electrical engineer I'd be the target demo but it does nothing at all for me.   Drier is better.  Hate hate hate goopy m c.  Also, initially undertook the noodles.   That was sort of exactly my point.  For one or two or a handful of beings in all the history of the universe it'd be amazing.  For everyone else, they'd never know the difference.   Here's the thing about that though...for 99.99999999999999999999999...% of living beings it'd be no different than our universe as it exists today.   Erosion due to glaciation, or so the ranger station would have one believe...   Shouldn't have replied to me directly then...   Incomplete information is just as bad as incorrect.   Um, I was disagreeing with you on your statement that better materials, a dubious distinction in itself, are the biggest reason why a Porsche is more expensive than a Mustang.  I said nothing about a Mustang being better.  What costs more is the Porsche workforce in my opinion.  That and the logos on the fascia, wheels and tail.  The 911 GT3 is my dream car and I hope to get the next revision once my 2017 plan is complete.  I do production engineering for a living so I do know what I'm talking about...   You can search within any site using Google...just do this - "search term" site:website.tld (you only need quotes if your search term is multiple words).  I do this all the time; works great.   I hate to be that guy but I really don't like this new boot animation.  First, the blinding white background (not to mention hugely inefficient for AMOLED folks); second, it makes the phone feel laggy as it slides off at the end (this is even apparent in the gif version you linked).  I replaced it after the first boot and I never want to see it again.   Ford managed to keep the new GT a secret up to their reveal; dunno why a phone manufacturer couldn't do the same if they tried.   You realize he was talking about buying both of those right, not one or the other?   Problem is the 2015 STs aren't out yet so it's not really a fair comparison (neither is the GTI Performance Pack).   220 is with perf pack; 210/258 otherwise.  For the GTI, have little feet.  It was uncomfortable working the clutch with my size 12s.  Not a lot of room between the floor and the bottom of the dash.  And the pedals were really low.   There were 5 different potential engines for the 67 Vette rated between 300 and 430 HP.  It wasn't like today where there's only a single choice.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C2)   As an production engineer I can tell you that is often not the case.  Touch labor drives cost, not material.  And labor has far more to do with quality than material.   And what's really weird is that I found this while looking for Han Solo memes (specifically, "Boring conversation anyway") which is the name of this particular Tumblr.   [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/B4u5KoD.gifv)      I clearly was not the only person coming into this thread thinking "Skypunch?  Pfft. TIGER UPPERCUT!"   Liz has really let herself go.   Mr. Heat Miser.   But not the one they deserve.   Nightmare's a bit dramatic don't you think?  If you've got directional tires, you don't rotate.  If you've got asymmetric, you swap side to side.  Not that big a deal, m8... ;)   Looks like we're going to need another Timmy!   http://m.quickmeme.com/img/56/56c7f0ed2a8e46a866ce3eb20f1a239001a670d20f1dce121cf0696b1511413b.jpg   ...which was?   Pee-khans, pray-leans.  Grew up in California with parents from the Midwest.   Do you plan on swapping the buttons on the transmission to their black versions?  http://www.ft86club.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1890543 postcount=1   I think satin tends to look "fancier" than gloss in my experience.     Low production vehicle my friend...   Thank you for your (or your ancestor's) service.   Yeah so I tried watching that on my tablet and apparently wasn't capable of displaying the 60 fps so I brought it up on my desktop and it brought my system crashing down.  One quick reboot though and holy crap, it's like watching real life through a window.   Don't know a good way to extract from iCloud but for Android use I recommend Google Keep - it's accessible from web and phone just like iCloud notes are.   For the US Gov, yes; but not typically for individuals filing taxes...   The US Government fiscal year is 01 October to 30 September.  The TAX YEAR, however, is usually the same as the calendar year for individuals (it can vary for organizations)...  http://www.irs.gov/publications/p509/ar02.html   It's just a word.  They're all just words.  There's nothing inherently good or bad about them.  Society needs to move past this kind of infantile nonsense.    I loved math growing up.  I have an MS in Engineering.  I was just being silly.  It's reddit, not a Congressional subcommittee.   I was being incredibly sarcastic/condescending simply to be contrary.  My job doesn't tend to involve basic arithmetic.  What math I do, it's usually via Excel.  Or someone who works for me.  ;)   Here's how I'd do it: I'd pick up my phone, open Droid48, type 3 7 6 ENTER 4 7 9 +.  Because I don't waste time doing math problems in my head at 34 the way I was forced to when I was 12.  :D   This isn't combinatorics; it'd basic whole number addition.  "Thinking in math", right.   Why wouldn't you break the 8 down into 5 and 3?  Most people have 5 digits on each hand.  Honestly though, I don't see what problem this technique solves.  Monkey fuckin' a football.  They didn't teach crap this way back in the eighties.  We did math uphill, both ways in the snow, barefoot, and by FSM, we liked it.   Check this article out for some advice  http://jalopnik.com/5928491/2013-scion-frs-will-it-baby   Factory/dealer installed options, particularly with the FR-S.  Not these special models.  Let folks configure them how they want.  More color options.  Wheel options.  Stereo options.  Better quality interior like a stitched leather/alcantara dash.  A multiclutch transmission would be good but neither Toyota nor Subaru have one in production and so they'll never develop one for such a niche vehicle.   Realistically, that'll be years down the road.  Neither Toyota nor Subaru are exactly forward thinking when it comes to powertrains.   The headlights have nothing to do with the backup cam.  Both the BRZ and FR-S have near plug and play camera options.  The link below is one example (which will work with most any backup cam on the market).  http://www.beatsonicusa.com/bcus3-536.html   The seats in the RS 1.0 are fabric but different than stock FR-S fabric seats.  The Monogram had heated leather seats.   You don't need an app to do a backup...your recovery will do it.  I've always heard folks say you can install backups from CWM on TWRP....I'm thinking the app you used didn't make a backup in accordance with real CWM specs.  Do you use the Google features of Android like photo backup, contacts backup?  If so you might not have lost anything.   What "all your data" did you lose?  You should know CWM is no longer supported by the devs - only TWRP is a current project.   http://www.leastof.org/worldwealthcalculator  I'm in the top 0.3%.  Nice.  Or...not nice?  Hrm...   If you're trying to Obey Your Thirst, you should really sign up for Sprite Special Ops.   Insulate!  Insulate!   Swype has nothing to do with your device.  Post up in /r/Android or if there's a /r/swype maybe?   Flashing a .tot or .kdz will wipe everything other than your external microSD card.  You don't want to go that route except in an emergency.   No, I don't think that's what he meant.  I'm thinking it meant district courts (the article stated federal courts).  Once it's the law of the land there will be nothing they can do as it'll no longer be an issue for the states.  I think part of the idea that will make Texas go away once the Supreme rules bans are unconstitutional is the Supremacy Clause.  Lots of good articles in this search I did:  https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1 q=supremacy+clause+gay+marriage   You can't force another human being to do something they themselves don't want to do.  I mean, you can, but they'll eventually figure out it wasn't their idea, be miserable, blame you, etc.  They have to choose their own path.   There's a big place in San Souci in Lexington Park (High Tide Games) that's always packed.  More CCG/board games than comics though.  There's also a good comic shop at Old Wash Rd and 5 in Waldorf (Comics MD).   Gave you a bump.  Hope you find somebody.  If we lived up there we'd be down but we're in St. Mary's so it's a bit of a drive.   Have you tried the Radio.com app?  It doesn't do anything in the background when it's not being used.  I used to use TIR for Area 95.5 HD 2 but they switched to Radio.com.  If used with an adblocker - you'll get a blank screen when it tries to play an ad before starting a station's feed, but you just hit back and it'll work fine.   Let this douchebag do what he wants.  In five months it'll be completely irrelevant anyway.  The Supreme Court will never overturn 36 states and DC on something like this.   Go reddit, this is amazing.  Let's pick another winner and make their dreams a reality.   Good luck!  It will be tough but you can do it.  Don't worry about being perfect - just keep the goal in mind.   FYI, the diffuser in this reddit post is not the same diffuser you linked.  It is not the T2 variant of the one you linked as you guessed - you'll notice it is not straight across, but gets higher in the middle.

 but im on reddit where he cant get me   eraserhead      oh its ON NOW!!   because i get REALLY fucking tired of people bitching about it, i wish they were suffering for the rest of their days, especially doug walker, oh god do i hate doug walker, hes probably the leader of the avatar haters, they probably have big ralleys in some huge undeground or abandonned auditorium, with huge pictures of doug everywhere, with him up on a pedestal, giving huge anti avatar speeches, i also surely believe he has a conservative agenda which he uses with his nostalgia critic character, because not only avatar with a liberal message he bashed, he bashes OTHER movies with liberal agendas too, district 9 BASHED IT, a troll in central park BASHED IT, and he likes chuck norris whos another conservative jackass. now you may be thinking, "theres haters for star wars, for the godfather, for annie hall, for star wars, for robocop, theres a hater for EVERY movie" well youre right, but i liiked avatar and i will make sure no one will influece me otherwise, ill open a big can of whoopass! on the next person who says, "the story sucks", or "its only made to look pretty", or "theyre smurfs" or other bullshit like that, doug walker is probably gathering followers for his anti liberal cult as we speak! if im wrong about ANY of these please state why, thank you   i saw it today and it was ok, not a classic but funny at times, even hilarious   if you start one from the beginning you'll be like her: https://i.imgflip.com/25w8.jpg if you start one from the middle you'll be like him: https://i.imgflip.com/grb00.jpg   they didn't wanna pay rick baker? i mean granted it was convincing, but i mean c'mon.   an age old fan question "are the pokemon movies (past movies 1 and 2) true canon to the anime?" i would say 'no', BUT they complement their respective seasons so well, they may as well be.   are the atmosphere and characters the same as you imagined from the books? id say 'close enough'      i dont want to live on this planet anymore      well its not so much that people are telling me i cant like them, its just that the haters are everywhere and they wont give up, making me feel like a jackass,    He needs to rethink his life   a la english muffins, french toast, german chocolate cake, etc.   now it's the 'whatever the hell we wanna show' channel   you know the rest if so why? if not why? please dont hesitate and look at my other posts to get an idea of my ordeal, also how can i help live with people who dont like them? and how can i get some to stop bullying those who like them? also will they ever come to terms with them? because generally i come to beleive some were huge jerks so, yeah      i mean i'm not entirely clear on whether they want to reboot the whole series or want to make a tangent of reboot movies, but whatever the case im not sure if i want them to make it or not, i mean on the one hand it could be an avengers quality superhero romp, but on the other hand it would suck if 20+ seasons were just thrown away, IDK im hoping itll stand on its own feet and not have to interfere with the tv show, but thats just me  EDIT: OR they can create another timeline like star trek   i was searching up 'doug jones mewtwo' because i thought doug jones could play mewtwo in a live action pokemon and somebody beat me to it, check it out:  http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/KCatCreations/news/?a=36185  also keep in mind im typing this from my perspective   in that case keep up the good work, im sorry if i sounded upset   help me daniel abraham youre my only hope. why is no one concerned of the changes from the books? why didnt you put it on hbo? they wouldve kept the swearing, it wouldve broken new ground for hbo, instead its on syfy where itll just be another battlestar galactica, wont the expanse lose its edge if its on syfy?   Perfectly fine      that does not look like fun for the horse   more like SNUFFED his toe   its also like an urban legend   http://youtu.be/zExMcJ2aUO4   who the hell is chespirito?   really?   and heard a loud banging sound on the door, THAT WAS ME!!, how much cheese have you consumed within the last 24 hours?, or are you just naturally selfish? you took forever in the bathroom, i went to that starbucks to get some breakfast, and i wanted to use bathroom and i try to open the door and its locked so i go sit down and eat my breakfast, so then like 10 minutes goes by i go try again its still locked, and i go back to my seat and play with my phone, 10 more minutes go by i try again its still locked!! so then 5 minutes later i flat out start banging on the door! so the i go back to my seat to blend in and i see you walking out and you looked mad, GOOD! and you still dont know who i am!! youre probably one of those people who wakes up early in the morning to watch Power Rangers: super turbo mega space dino mystic dino space turbo mega force or whatever the hell its called this season, and goes right back to bed afterwards and sleeps in till 5pm. the point is dont stall in the bathroom at starbucks! thank you      you suck mcbain!!!   is that bad?      if a radio can be national and public, why isnt there any schools that are private and public? im pointing out an oxymoron   is there also 'private public schools'?   i dont get it   announcer: are you a size zero? would waldo have a hard time finding you? when you go to the park do the ducks feed YOU pieces of bread? then call the anorexia prevention hotline at 555-1701   I mean it's not like you see school librarians seeing a student use Wikipedia on one of the computers and puts them in detention for "attempted plagiarism"   You hit a lot of good points, especially the wishing death part   help me out then, enlighten me   and i discovered magic hat wilhelm scream pumpkin ale (or ANY pumpkin ale for that matter) and jack daniels honey whiskey are a NASTY combination!! but if you want a good buzz use regular ale and ANY whiskey, im amazed i can still spell.   jj abrams revives the franchise and there are people who complain about it not feeling like old star trek, NEWS FLASH THEY GOT 95% AND 87% ON ROTTEN TOMATOES!!!!!

I promise I'm not a schizophrenic or a preteen im a normal person with normal emotions just like you, I'm just stressed out that the expanse tv show won't have the edge the books have.   I should've left out the 'must be educated' part   And why do people seem ok with it!?! I keep telling people on reddit "they will change stuff from the books" "they will neuter the characters and turn them into wimps" "they will rearrange the sequences of events" and people keep telling me that the writers of the books are gonna be involved in writing and are producers, as if that'll make the show any more faithful to the books, the syfy tv executives have a bigger hand in the show! I mean do people really wanna see characters they're attached to to lose their edge!?!?! and the story lose its edge? Like wtf?!? you know what enjoy your watered down, neutered 'expanse' ill read the books, they contain the PROPER stories  	49

 http://imgur.com/6UFMFoq   I bought it for a friend when they had the flu. She read it in a day and it became her favorite book. I've read all his books and enjoyed them all. This one is great and the book thief is great as well.    I thought so too. Got down voted pretty quick. Its from Star Wars Tales 19.   "Of all that was found. And all that was lost." -John Connoly. The Book Of Lost Things.   It was the last book my father read. I read it a year after he died. I was 12 and so was the protagonist, both of us grieving a lost parent.    [I Am The Messenger] (http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19057.I_Am_the_Messenger) The character is a bit older, but its a very good book. The book is mostly about the development of a young man whose life at the beginning of the novel is rather stagnant and unfulfilling.   	5

 Yes because if there's one thing I've noticed since moving here...the people are horrible drivers.   Very nice. I'm gonna check it out now. Thanks!    This isn't where I parked my car.   Maybe your mom is defending you, afraid you may have actually done it. Have you spoken to her about it?   Here's to hoping you're right.   I need an update, I'm kind of lost.   6 hours and no update?

Mark is currently with Karen as she has a broader reach in voter approval (speculation). Lisa was last seen sharing a pie with Connor, so it would appear he's still trying to salvage this campaign. Does Connor know something, or have any blackmail material on Mark, as he has been quiet throughout this whole poster incident, whereas Rawlins is flapping on about anything and everything. I think this whole poster incident has opened a Pandora's Box and I'm not sure this school is ready for such a deep scandal.  	43

 So if the G fund is the only one guaranteed return, how can I invest in the other funds without loosing all my money? If the G fund is managed by experts, how could I manage the other funds?

    I heard this incredible story first on This American Life. Here's the [link](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/522/tarred-and-feathered?act=2#play) for anyone who'd rather listen than read.                                                So true. He has that big (mostly) liberal blind spot on GMOs and vaccines. I watch his show every week and bite my tongue when he goes on one of those rants.         The full scene is much longer. The build-up is like 3-4 minutes. It's perfect.   For me, probably The Ring.  One of the best constructed horror scenes came from [Exorcist III](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zH8ynu0jRvY), however.                                                            Looks like it could be a quality movie, but I don't think I'll never be able to accept Michael C. Hall as any character but Dexter.  	42

We rushed mid the first round and he missed a nade dealing 66 dmg to me. He got banned for his goofyness, rather than griefing, so he's still kind of unlucky.   Pros make a decent amount of money for their living. Ranging from prize money to marketing money.    He means that these two videos are not related to the one on this thread.  The one in this thread was a teamkill and it was on Nuke.         StatChicken   That's true. The smokes in CS:GO are very bad, also including the frame drops when near them.   "crybabies" Are you like, one of the pros? Do you attend in tournaments with your team and experience the pressure both from the crowd, enemy team and managers? I don't think so. Also, I think that you don't really understand the term professional.  They get money by playing.   I actually wanted to look up if it's an image from Google. Knew it wasn't original. :/    It's a wooden plank to make it possible to wallbang with a nice graphical touch on it.  I didn't think of any other way to make it wallbangable at the time.   Yes you could. Remember this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYR3b7-SThc  And this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qP80WyoTqM0   It would make it even better for those who like it. I'm not fanboying De_Dust2, but it's one of the most balanced CS maps out there.    Oh boy, let's remove the tagging, add some aimpunch and maybe add a gun called CZ and make it overpowered, just because it's a new game, right?  You could wallbang it in every CS version. You could even wallbang it in CS:GO before the wallbanging update.    8ft is enough to have a room in-between.  EDIT - It's a real picture and I recompiled the map, how do you think I made it work?   In 1.6 you could literally wallbang everything. I'm talking about B site only.  IIRC this was possible before the wallbang update.  EDIT: Bringing a good feature from 1.6 doesn't make it 1.6, it just makes it a better game in general. Just like tagging.   It is in favor of CT side. First of all, if CT is shooting from B he has more open space to shoot from. T's are usually crowded up in tunnel, making it easier for a CT shooting through wall to get a kill. Second of all, when the T's are guarding the bomb on B after it's planted, this spot has no weakness. You can literally watch tunnel, window and doors at the same time without too much exposure. With this feature the T's would have to rethink about camping in that spot, as it's weakness would be being sprayed down through a wall. And it's a common spot by Terrorists.  I don't see what would make it more T sided?  P.s - That spot is probably one of the most obvious ones, I'm sure everyone peeks it when entering the site as Terrorists. It wouldn't make it more T sided, it would make it harder for T's to hide after the bomb plant.      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es_qzifA5e8  0:40  Uploaded at May 18. I'm sure there are even older videos of it.   Sorry to tell you, but it's old.       I never bothered to count how long until they pass the doors. Guess I'll know now! :P   There have been like... 5000 topics like this? I'm sorry. I prefer P2000, I don't know why, but I feel more comfortable spraying with it. (Fast clicking or whatever you wan't to call it.)  It has bigger magazine overall too.   I can already imagine dicks being drawn every time, it's sad but it's true.   It's not big, but it's money. Having saved that 2.50 I could have also bought him a skin as a starter pack. :D   Looks like it's glitch week... The Hogwarts glitch on Mirage, now this. I might as well as go glitch hunt too! :D   Why have two if you can have best of both.   Great, exactly one day after I purchased CS:GO gift for my friend. :|   Unfortunately, knowing Valve it won't :(   SOMEONE HOST A SERVER PLEASE!   I tried very hard. :-;   15  "Nah, not really good"   SURE I'LL TAKE IT. I'm a lonely scrub with shitty skins here :D   Knifes aren't that bad though, they are priced high unlike normal weapons.    This one clip looks way sketchier than Flusha's clips, at least to me.    Problem is, there's no manual admins. :/   Reddit doesn't mind criticism/skepticism as long as your statement is constructive, backed up and you have evidence/proof whatever it may be.   Here, we can see a specimen of species called "idiots". He, to survive in this wild nature environment, had to resort to cheating tools... Not for long, as the glorious GabeN came from the sky to rain terror upon him. He ran, mercilessly, trying to save his inventory.. But then.. It was gone. In a blink of a second he disappeared into oblivion. He was only heard once, but only his salty tears could be heard. Justice was served, and the world was ever and happy again.   I can tell he's pretty good at prefiring and having those "do it but do it good" shots, he might be the right one.  Waiting to see some new matches with him! :)   I've read somewhere that first signs of "anti-matter" where discovered by scientists, however, we are tad too far away from manipulating with it.    Shit. I had this once.  The moment when you stare at some sort of creature you have never seen, that somehow happened to be at your doorstep. The moment where your brain is so overwhelmed that you don't know if you should scream or keep staring.    It looks like a gun that my grandma would gift me ( ~  )   Oh well, gotta remake the video then.      It's interesting to see on what design choices Valve went for remaking Train. I usually improve at mapping by studying what makes other maps so good.   The next videos are going to be serious, just messing with the idea. Unfortunately I'm getting dislike bombed, so I might as well as just stop making videos all-together.                I love the body armor they have though.      It would be ass to recompile all the maps though.   I mean, considering the graphics.  It reuses a lot of old Source props and it looks low-quality compared to other maps in general. I mean, If they remade it with new assets but kept the scale and stuff I would love it even more.      I wish they would actually remake Nuke honestly. It looks very similar to Source version.   I'm Lithuanian too, can confirm. :P  There is an external program to block out certain regions, it's legit and it works. The only problem is that even if the region thingy would be added it still wouldn't stop Russians from playing on American servers or anywhere else. There would still be some people who would do it for trolling.   You can't say it's "better". I know I will get downvoted for this, but I'd say it's a preference. I definitely enjoy CS:GO's inferno over this one, also after the slight "graphical" update Valve did.   http://steamcommunity.com/id/theguma I'm a mapper,  I appreciate any gifts.  Here's my gift (WIP!!!) - http://cloud-2.steampowered.com/ugc/32979935917407325/54B00240E6B115F2CCBA9E3BF148B274148679A9/  Try and guess.   But it doesn't work on 64 tick matchmaking. I also don't find myself using this technique for any kind of situation.  	70

One of the largest economies in world has a stock market that goes from 2030 to 5023 from June last year to June this year, then drops 30% in a few weeks, then the government steps in with $billions to try to prop it back up, and you think it's "big whoop"?  So what is your astute investment prediction in that market?    This is BEAUTIFUL!!!  "I was sitting in a lawn chair looking down through the clouds at 747 airplanes and looking up to a cluster of helium balloons"   Mr Boria said he "somersaulted out the chair" and parachuted down to safety after the balloons took him too high.  The whereabouts of the garden chair are unknown, police chief Kyle Grant said.  He "has been charged with causing *mischief*"   "**Evergreen**"? Really? That's what you learned from this page? How about:  "The origin of the lemon is unknown"  "The tree's ellipsoidal yellow fruit" ... it has ellipsoidal fruit!  "used for culinary and non-culinary purposes ... cleaning uses."  "In 1747, James Lind's experiments on seamen suffering from scurvy involved adding lemon juice to their diets, though vitamin C was not yet known."  and "lemonade"    Three-week plunge that has knocked around 30% off Chinese shares since mid-June  On Saturday, China's 21 largest brokerage firms said they would spend a whopping 120 billion yuan (about $19.3 billion) to try to stabilize the market  Chinese stocks plummeted yet again on Tuesday morning, defying rapid-fire emergency support measures from Beijing and raising concerns about policy makers' ability to stabilise one of the most highly volatile markets in the world.

The "**Narci-stick**"    Seal (because Dark Side of the Moon was already posted)   I thought the "We" referred to me since I am a member of a weekly Bingo game with several Ukrainian members.

Cheers.     I'm sure she'd greatly prefer it if they ended up Christian, but she'd never say it out loud. I really wouldn't care as long as they acted right  Very insightful. Peace.     The fact that he has no belief system doesn't bother me  If you don't mind me asking, in my own relationship I found this very troubling - - how is it that his not being on a path to "salvation" (or whatever you want to call it) doesn't bother you? And beyond that, if you stay together and have children, how would you feel about him convincing them to be atheist?   I ask because I have wrestled with these issues myself.    So, when you say "was", the moving on was not due to religious differences I take it.  It sounds like you had a deep relationship, and exploring the differences may have made it even more meaningful. Thank you for sharing.    I hope you take this in the spirit it is meant. While my ex was the one that was very disrespectful within our relationship (see my other post in this thread) I had difficulties with her beliefs as well.  To sum it up, the majority of Christians have a belief in an afterlife that is conditional on your behavior (yes, I've really oversimplified, but please go with me on this).   It can be very difficult to see the person you love most as being on a path that does not lead to the afterlife that you believe in. So, while a Christian may initially say they are OK with you being an atheist, be aware - - belief is a powerful force, and as time goes on, it can really mess with how one sees their partner.    I've never heard of that, so I suspect you are joking.  I am the opposite. I love the outdoors (camping, kayaking, etc.) but I'm always the 1st to be bit by mosquitoes.   If I'm bit before going to bed, I can't sleep. My heart races for an hour or two before it subsides. It really sucks.     the differences lie in the individuals and how willing they are about accepting each others differences  Yes - this. On so many levels, relationships are built on mutual respect.    I'm christian and my ex was atheist. Even though I'm not hugely religious, it was a terrible mistake. She disrespected me and made fun of my beliefs . When we had a kid, it created huge problems.   Prior to getting married, she claimed to be "spiritual" but not affiliated with any one religion. That changed to "organized religion is evil" and "believing in fictitious beings is just stupid".   If I get married again, I don't think it will be with someone outside my faith.    Everybody that just left Reddit please raise your hands.  No? I didn't think so. Based on all the complaints, I don't see much of an "exodus".    Oh, dog . . . no you didn't!   I've NEVER been able to get it to load. How hard can it be to rent more rack space to handle more traffic? I'm boggled.    No. While I supported the protests, it was a blip.  Reddit is 10 years old, has a strong corporate history, and last year raised $50 million in venture capital for hiring and refining the advertising business.  Reddit is in a space where controversy is bound to happen. "This has all happened before and will happen again."   Not a direct answer, but here's some more Reddit related info from [The Seattle Times](http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/reddit-moderators-shut-down-parts-of-site-over-employees-dismissal/)  Reddit sells large, targeted advertising campaigns that run at the top of individual subreddits.  The events come at a particularly inauspicious time for Reddit, which only a week ago celebrated its 10th anniversary. Last year, Reddit raised $50 million in venture capital and planned to use the money for hiring and refining the advertising business.  The site has been valued at roughly $250 million, according to a recent disclosure by its lawyers. Advance Publications, the parent company of Cond Nast, still owns a majority of the company and retains a board seat.  The company has had its problems during the past year. Yishan Wong abruptly resigned in November as Reddits chief executive after a dispute with the companys board of directors.  Reddit has also taken steps to combat harassment on and off its site, moves that many members of the community complain have stifled the principles of free speech upon which the site was founded.  There has also been tension between factions of the Reddit community and Ellen Pao, the companys interim chief executive, whom many Reddit users blame for imposing the anti-harassment policies. An online petition asking Pao to step down has garnered more than 13,000 signatures.  Reddit users have also questioned Paos ability to lead the company while dealing with major issues in her personal life. For nearly two years, Pao was embroiled in a well-publicized discrimination lawsuit against Kleiner Perkins Caufield   Byers, the venture-capital firm. Pao lost that case in March.

Tim Kane of the Hoover Institute has met with four different GOP presidential campaigns  (he met with them? Shocking!)   Thats as far as I got.

I looked it up myself, and the length of time between sunsets does vary significantly throughout the year. This is *so* not intuitive to me.   But the times I get are different than yours (I might be doing the math wrong). I get 2 hours 23 min today, and 2 hours 56 min. at Christmas.   I think this is correct since the Earth is about 24,000 miles around, so you'd need to travel about 1000 mph (at equator) to keep up with the sun. Less at relevant latitudes.   Did I do this right/wrong?    If it's just before sunset, you have about 3 hours and 27 minutes (**today**) to get from, say, Washington DC to San Diego  Again, why "today" vs 6 months from now? Just wondering.    Very doable since the Fastest production vehicles are:  Year, Make and model, Top speed of production car  1992 Jaguar XJ220 212.3 mph (342 km/h)  1993 McLaren F1 240.1 mph (386 km/h)  2005 Bugatti Veyron 16.4 253.81 mph (408.47 km/h)  2010 Bugatti Veyron Super Sport 267.857 mph (431 km/h)    If you leave "just before sunset" why would it make any difference what day it is?

[Reddit Silver - the community based alternative](https://i.imgflip.com/nq5mf.jpg)   I care about Reddit, and I invest time here. Why does it not make sense to protest here?    But, if you are a new CEO with little experience in the market of "your" company, and you want to push a revenue agenda, what are you to do?   It was a protest post. Very frustrated with Reddit right now. They need to step up.    Trump is "aggressive sloppy and immature"  OK - I think we are close to common ground here.    From your post, Donald said the following:   "When Mexico *sends* its people, they're not *sending* their best"  "They're *sending* people that have lots of problems"  "They're rapists."  Do you seriously not have any issues with this?  You really see this as a "realistic if not aggressive observation on socio-geo-political conditions"?      Reddit Gold Handcuffs    No idea what that it.   I heard about it from a morning radio program. One of the hosts went on vacation and visited a "torture" museum, and described this invention in detail.    Story time. When I was a kid I was given a really nice mechanical pencil. I loved it, and used it in school all the time. As I'm sure many of you can relate, assignments were just a bit more enjoyable when using an instrument of beauty. So one day it gets stolen, and it really bummed me out. I kept an eye out, and sure enough I eventually see a kid in another class using my pencil. I confront him and he says it's his. I give him one last chance, and he digs in.  So by now the teacher has come over because I'm pretty pissed off. He still claims it's his. So I ask the teacher to remove the eraser and take out the paper underneath it. It reads "This belongs to train_subject5937".   Busted!    Not really, unless you are satisfied with upvoting everyone who isn't spamming because they are technically contributing the the discussion in one way or another.   Isn't this the same rationale against the downvoting? (There is indiscriminate downvoting to otherwise appropriate content).  Did you really just quote the entire post to which you are replying? Why would you do that?    Another problem a downvote bot causes it it discourages people from posting, and it makes the subreddit feel way more hostile to a new user. Even if it doesn't modify the placement on the 'new' page, it kills me to see posts at 0 or -1 points when they don't deserve it.   I understand this sentiment, but it is overcome so quickly by other users upvoting it (if it is appropriate content).  Both sides have good points and overall I am just concerned about any form of potential "censorship." I am kind of in a if its not too broke lets not fix it mentality in regards to the downvotes.

 I would love to see the segues for those topics.

If you're a girl into voyeurism, /r/gonewild.     Yep, can confirm. My house mate buys organise tooth paste and I laugh at him.  Source: Am Australian   My vegan house mate buys organic shampoo. What the fuck is organic shampoo.  He spends like $3 more per bottle than the shit we have at home.   You can't lose weight without exercise.  Soooo many people use this as an excuse for why they don't even try. *I can't afford a gym membership* or *it hurts to exercise* therefore I won't even try to lose weight.  This myth sucks and won't go away it seems.   Dude fold up a piece of TP several times and place it at the bottom of the toilet. I've not had a Poseidon's kiss in years. It also doubles as a silencer.   I can juggle but I don't do it in front of people because I'm afraid I'll will come off as being an attention seeking show off.  Why the fuck did I teach myself to do this?   I'm obese and heading toward an early grave and I **can** actually do something about it.  Luckily I discovered this truth 4 months ago before any real health problems.  43 lbs lost and counting!!   Hell, not even 100 years ago. You read about serial killers in the 70s and 80s, they were able to get away with so much just because mobile phones, basic forensics and centralised databases were all in their infancy.   Next step is to switch from kilogram to stone.     Oh god this. Every year I go camping, like proper (not a single shred of electricity for 50 kms) camping.   On of the most beautiful sights you can see is putting out your campfire and finding a clearing to sit and just staring into the nights sky. It's unbelievable.    A few years ago my WoW raiding guild was desperately looking for a raider for our roster. Finally out of the blue a personal applied for it and ended up being recruited. Everything was going well. We ended up having a chat and we found out that he and I actually went to high school together in the same year level, in fact we were Facebook friends!  When you take a step back and look at it, of the tens of thousands of Australians on the dozens of Oceanic servers for him to be the right class, the right level of experience, the right faction AND the right server is an insane coincidence.     My favourite part of the Daily Show is always the segments where it's just Jon and a topic. No silly cut aways, no pre recorded bits with his colleagues and no interviews.  Just Jon, a topic and his passion for truth, satire and humor.   John Olivers show is pretty much that entire thing, wrapped into a single 30 minute show. A show (which by the way, thanks to HBO) has no concerns for censorship due to sponsorship.  I would be fucking ecstatic if John Olivers show could be increased to an hour, or perhaps several 30 minute episodes per week. That being said, the show looks like they put **SO MUCH** effort into their 1 episode that this maybe hard to do.   Either way, I'm happy Last Week Tonight exists because I'm not sure how well The Daily Show will be without Jon Stewart.   Then again I had that worry when John Oliver took over in 2013 and boy oh boy was I happy with the result :)    I really enjoyed it, I think some people are just being negative nancys. I loved the plot, I liked the division between Frank and Clare. Even though I think some of her decisions were stupid.  That fucking scene with Doug turning the van around was insane, I did not see that coming!  Oh by the way, I'm so happy that Doug survived, he was one of my favourite characters.   This is actually one of the reasons I don't like women who're as muscular. That softness is what make women wonderful :)   Drink beer.   God damn I don't know why its hot but it is :)   This won't compare to some of the shit in here, I guess I'm lucky.  I was pinned down by a dirt bike which had been running for hours that I had crashed. The red hot exhaust pipe was pinned against my left calf muscle for like 20~ seconds while I tried to squeeze out. That was painful, but that's not the worst part.  The worst part was that I was a 16 year old fucking idiot who didn't go to the doctors and I took very poor care of the wound. The palm sized burn ended up becoming really infected and it became so painful that I couldn't even have a blanket over my leg.  I ended up getting it disinfected and started treating it, but it took so long for that wound to heal properly.   Gah, the smell was awful.  I don't know what's wrong with me, because a few years later I had another incident where I sliced my index finger almost down to the bone on a metal door and me fearing getting stitches (for the 4th time in my life) I just washed the wound and bandaged it tight.  It ended up getting fucking infected really bad and for the longest of time I thought I wouldn't be able to fully bend my index finger. It eventually healed but I'm kicking myself that I didn't get it properly treated. I guess I didn't want to run to my parents crying about it.   You show me a man who doesn't like them and I'll show you a liar.   It's important that it exists. If she's studying and supports herself with some sort of income - that's great! If she has a steady job, that's great! If she earns 4x my salary, that's great!  The only thing I actually care about is that she is financially responsible and can sustain herself. I don't want to date someone who has crippling debt and no want or means to remove it.  I'm not sure why that's important to me, perhaps it's because I've had financial responsibility hammered into me from my parents so much growing up.    I don't get the guys out there who feel emasculated because a woman earns more than you. Get over yourselves, chances are that they worked harder than you to get where they're.   Everyone's different, but the 1st 2 steps are essential  Totally agree, the third one isn't always a good idea, I can attest to that. If you think you can handle it, go for it. But don't do it to *fuck the pain away*, that's my experience anyway.   I was having this conversation with a friend who did a tour overseas in the army. It was an interesting conversation actually. He firmly states that if a woman can handle the **exact** same physical requirements as the men, then she deserves to be in the front line (in fact, he mentions several woman in high esteem who met this requirement). He told me the problem lies with fraternisation.  Sadly it happens and there is little you can do about it. When you're in the field you can't have the soldiers in relationships, it causes fractures and distractions in the team. This isn't entirely about women. Apparently this happens with gay soldiers all the time and the problem is equally as bad in those instances. Even exterior to relationships, the additional distraction of women in the front line causes problems too. You can cite this as a problem with men in society, it doesn't matter - it's likely going to happen.  I always thought that it was clear cut, if a woman want's to be a front line grunt and can handle the physical and mental requirements - then she should be able to.  But there are other portions to this equation.   TIL I have incidentally been correctly ingesting beer for a full experience all of these years :D   That's interesting, I find my fake smiles make me look serial killer-esque because of my eyes, they're too *open*? If that makes sense   I'm the same as far as smiles are concerned. I'm told that I have a really nice smile, in fact an ex of mine always complimented me on my (her phrasing) *Smiley Eyes*, it used to make her melt.  But that never translated to pictures. I cannot take a picture without me looking like a smiling mad man.  Kinda sucks    He really knows how to play to the fanboys. We really are easy to rile up ;)    there are a number of organoleptic sensations that occur with the swallow including a big impact from retronasal olfaction.  As an avid lover of beer, I think I subconsciously already knew that when I asked the question haha  I just didn't know if there was a term for it, that beer after taste/smell is rather intoxicating (pun intended)   Good reminder to everyone.  Something else to keep in mind - the time will go **much** quicker if you let what you're doing become part of your daily routine. But it will also go quick if you don't spend too much of your day obsessing over it. That's where I get a little conflict in me. This subreddit is an awesome place if you need support or information, but it can be bad if you're an impatient person.  Ever had a boring class in highschool where you're constantly looking at the clock on the wall? Time tends to go slower that way. So while I'm not telling people to go away from this subreddit, I would recommend not looking at the clock as often if you're impatient.   Why not organise a cheat day for it? I had a long weekend trip interstate last weekend, so for 2 days I drank and ate merrily. I went back into my diet the day after and I still ended up losing weight this week.  Don't feel like you have to constantly say no to everything, you need to find balance.   I probably won't have another cheat day for a while, but I earned the shit out of last weekend that's for sure.   I totally get where you're coming from, I've been sober for the past 4 months in an effort to lose this weight. It's been somewhat tough, I came to realise that you don't have to drink heavily to have fun, as lame as that sounds it's true!  I found that while you can have a cheat night every now and again, try just drinking water. You can be the designated driver for your friends, they'll likely love you for it.  The point is that if you're serious about dropping some weight, you do need to make sacrifices. If the amount you drink every week is what's stopping you, you need to weigh up your wants versus your needs.  Something I tell myself every weekend when I think about having a drink is "the reason that your friends can drink is because you overdid it for years and they didn't. You've had enough, it's time to work off the deficit"  Granted this information is from a guy who is quite a bit more overweight than yourself, I think it may still be helpful.   The biggest change I did was to completely cut beer out of my life, that would've been so much harder if it were my job!  Are you able to just spit the beer out for work? I would imagine that to maintain a deficit and still drink beer, that you would be a bit more hungry since you're not getting as many non-empty calories.   Jenny the fucking whore.  I'm pretty sure I'm lying to myself to think that the whole thing wasn't made up, but I kind of want a closure follow up.  True or false, that story was an emotional rollercoaster.   I'm kind of the same. I always watch the teaser and I always watch the first trailer. After that... I don't watch shit.  I had to learn this the hard way, I'm doing this with Ant-man and I find that I'm way more excited for it. I saw the teaser and the first trailer and I'm fucking sold. I don't need anymore marketing to convince me this will be good.  I'm a little bit sad that the Thomas the Tank Engine gag was in the trailer. I hope that doesn't take away from the scene when we watch it in the film.   Good point actually, remember that episode of Family Guy where Brian has sex with Quagmire's post op father and when he finds out he does that extended vomit scene?  He copped shit loads of flak for that scene from the LGBT community.  That being said, Mcfarlane's response was rather interesting.  [He also defended Brian's vomiting after discovering he had sex with someone who had undergone sex reassignment surgery noting Brian's character is heterosexual and "If I found out that I had slept with a transsexual, I might throw up in the same way that a gay guy looks at a vagina and goes, 'Oh, my God, that's disgusting.'"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quagmire%27s_Dad#Reception)  Although Ace's scene was a parody of The Crying Game, the humor would be mostly lost in 2015.   It took fucking ages in this trailer to event point out that it's even in the Rocky universe... I like it.  They could just as easily have made Sly the main star of the trailer. But Sly doesn't even turn up till like the last quarter of the video.  This movie may actually be the closest movie to the first Rocky since the first Rocky.     Mimic spaghetti    As long as there is reform to allow for a divorce, I don't see why it shouldn't be allowed.   You mother fuckers put your wallet in your back pocket? Isn't sitting on it uncomfortable?   Ex smoker reporting in, I don't hate you guys  I know exactly what you're going through :)   I'm an ex smoker, so I have empathy for them. I also know what it's like hearing non smokers loudly judge you about your choice to smoke, so I don't do that with anyone.  My opinion is that the vast majority of young smokers have no real grasp of the consequences of what they're doing. They think they're invincible because they know someone who smoked till 80.   Just to give you a measure of speed of lost, I'm a 27 yo 5'9 male. 4 months ago I was 285 lbs, I'm now down to 242.   I was losing crazy amounts of weight in the first month. I easily dropped the first 18 lbs in the first month. After that it soon started to taper off rather quickly, without me changing my diet at all.  At higher weights you're always going to lose weight quicker **at first**. Assuming that you're not eating too little and exercising too much, you should be fine.  Of course, I would talk to a doctor and do some research of your own.   Well done though! ~50 lbs is a great feat!     So what you're saying is that BMI obesity is like determining erotica from pornography?  *I'll know it, when I see it*   Best answer so far, so fucking funnny    I'd be really good with the "why?" game.  I'm not sure this game is about answering questions :(   Iirc, at the start you can hear it called over the announcment   Perhaps I'm in the minority here, but I've never met a man who thinks like this. In fact, most of my mates all talk about wanting to date someone who has a solid career, doctors, lawyers etc.  I'm starting to suspect that many of these 'common reddit occurrences' of the genders are fringe cases. Or, perhaps I'm living in the fringe.   To be fair, there are some strange questions posted on /r/askmen too and you know what?  So there should be, go ahead - ask me my opinion on women with non symmetrical shoulder freckles.   In my naive youth, I never had this conversation and I regretted it a few years ago when I started dating someone who had caught something from a recent ex.  It almost derailed our relatively new relationship.  Have the conversation before you stop using protection (See /u/Little_Lion 's top comment), luckily for me it was one of the curable diseases.   I'm 5'9 and a half, which is pretty much bang on average. I don't have a single second of insecurity. Partly because I know how guys even only 3-4 inches shorter are perceived.     Welcome to armchair activism :(   I work in IT, there is so much gossip talk. It's so fucking frustrating.  I just walk away when the shit talking starts.   Lets face it, we all do this.   I'm debt free at 27, so there's that.   Well this thread sure took a turn towards sexy (   )   Competition 8-ball pool. I've been playing for a decade and I currently run a team :)  I love it   My last relationship started like this. I got a FB message from a friend asking if I was single and if I were interested in a cool chick he knew. I was curious so I said yes.   We chatted on Facebook for a bit and hit it off. Dated for almost a year, it was quite nice actually.  I'd almost rather meeting girls via friends. That way you can get someone you know and trust to vouch both to me and the other person.  Helps weed out the crazies too :D   Any argument against gay people getting married, I've not seen a reason which isn't just silly.   Just plain shirt, jeans and casual shoes.  Fashion is a stupid concept.   Thanks for posting this twice, you deserve double the upvotes.   Its also a diuretic so it helps with water weight! :P   I've been wearing a wrist watch since I've been able to tell time. I want to be able to tell the time quickly and in a less rude manner than pulling my phone out.   It's also a sentimental thing, my parents bought me my current watch 10 years ago. I love this thing, it's my only piece of jewelry. Buy a good quality watch guys, this one has never skipped a beat in 10 years and it's eco-drive so it charges the battery when I fap :P   After my break up with a serious relationship in my early 20s, I went out and had a rebound hook up. I moved WAY too fast, I was trying to replace a lost part of me from the break up.  She ended up moving in with me very quickly and I didn't even really like her all that much. The sex was average and our chemistry wasn't even all that solid. She was actually kind of crazy.  I ended up regretting having that empty hookup for the longest of time. As cliche as it sounds, random hookups really are not worth pursuing in that context.  I should qualify that ONSs are only really bad if you're trying to replace someone instead of having fun with a stranger.   Reddit loves a good pun, the top comments of threads are mostly puns. I love it so much.     In your defence, what sane person would turn the car around to search for that plastic bag.   They're not reviled. I've never actually met anyone who *hates* dad jokes. You get people who groan at them, but in my entire 27 years of existence I've never actually had anyone tell me to seriously stop telling bad jokes.     Tzatziki.  I've been looking like a fucking idiot pronouncing it as tis-iki instead of zat-ziki    Adding onto this, brush your tongue. Both of these practices will fix most of the bad breath out there.  You'd be surprised how much gunk is stuck on your tongue.  I started flossing every day a while ago and my teeth have never been whiter.    I'm 40 lbs down, this is my main secret. No booze, no sugary drinks. Just water and the occasional coffee.  That shit adds up quick in your daily calorie intake.   Thank you! Credit cards are only a bad idea if you use them wrong. If you use them as short term loan machines, then you're using them right.  Need $200 for emergency car repairs and fully intend to pay it back over the next pay check or two? Then you're a smart credit card user.   I love his work.  What I really admire is that he takes the same stance on his routine as George Carlin. He scraps his routine every year and writes new material. You have to respect that his act changes every year. Check out his specials, they're wonderful.   Also, his stance on selling his DRM free content is remarkable. He does all of his own directing, shooting and editing then he provides *direct to the consumer* digital downloads. You can actually download his stand up specials for a one off payment of $5 and he makes some serious cash out of it. It's quite brilliant.  Plus anyone who can make me laugh about sexually stimulating a sewer rat has some real skill in comedy.     It may be, but litter collectors would still be employed. There would just be ~~less~~ **fewer** of them.   Edit: Fine Stannis, its changed. Are you happy? At least my family's still alive.   Your straw false dichotomy hominem has triggered me.   I assume he means the public comment section, I *never* **ever** go there for Facebook or Youtube. It's just plain retarded to read.  In fact, I only ever read comments on things which only my friends are involved in.   If used right it can have a good effect on your life.   Since I started using portions of reddit for information and support rather than lulz and dankness, I've lost 40 lbs, exercise frequently, formed better dental hygiene practices and learned quite a lot of trivia.  Shoutout to /r/loseit, /r/askreddit, /r/askmen, /r/askwomen, /r/progresspics, /r/fatlogic, /r/fitness and /r/todayilearned.   I think the problem is minors possessing porn *of* minors. That's illegal.   Not all litter is caused by people littering you would think, what about things like trash cans being knocked over by the wind, animals breaking open trash bags etc  Edit: My point is that even if these non human sources of litter only accounted for a small percentage of litter, the job of litter collector would still exist.  Edit 2: I get it, in a perfect world litter wouldn't exist. This thread isn't about a perfect hypothetical society. And not picking up everyone elses trash doesn't make you a *dick*. If it did, *litter*ally 99% of us would be dicks.   Funny story, this movie was released in Australia a few months after the US release as *The Wrong Man*. The reason being was that [the name *Lucky Number Slevin* was determined to be a spoiler by the critics after the US release lol. Because they saw the link between the horse at the start named Slevin and the main characters fake name] (/spoiler)  Excellent fucking movie though, very original and fun story.   Thanks, trust me when I tell you this - it will go so fucking quick! Just let what you're doing become part of your daily routine and try not to obsess over it every day.  It's been 4 months and it feels like 4 weeks.   Everyone is different. Some would rather many small meals throughout the day and that's fine. Others (like me) prefer to have 2 larger meals for the day.  The latter suited me better, so my change was to work out the rough calories for the meals I like. Once I had that number and determined how much my body requires at a safe deficit I (through willpower) stopped myself from eating.  I know consciously that my body had enough energy to keep going and the hunger I was feeling was superficial. Once you objectify food as an energy source and not solely as a source of pleasure, you realise how easy it can be to put the fork down.  So as strange as it sounds - *I fixed my relationship by objectifying my partner*.  Come at me foodi-nazis.   Oh, you're a woman? Yeah, guys have it much easier :(  My window for reaching my deficit safely is much larger, so 200~ calories over isn't the end of the world    That makes sense, I would imagine it would be hard to fit 5 guys into a daily food budget.   It really isn't that big of a deal, not in the long run. Once you see that you need to consume 3500 *extra* calories over your budget to gain a single pound of fat - you can see that going a bit over once in a while isn't the end of the world.  The important thing is to make sure that you don't have these cheat meals too often. Weight loss is about long term consistency. It's fine to stop your marathon for a few seconds before continuing :)   Your title is punderful ;)  Nice one, i'll be there in another 40 lbs :D   yesterday I fit Five Guys into it as well.  Please tell me this is some American food, otherwise this post got a little weird o.o   Do I think it's bad that some people find you more attractive than before? Hell no, that's a good benefit of weight loss - attractiveness is attractiveness, that goes for all sexes.  Do I think it's tactless of this idiot spouting "I would've liked you had you not been fat"? Yes.   You're not being sensitive to this dick being so brash with you. As a guy, I hate hearing about these dickheads who give the majority of us a bad reputation.    After doing it for a while, don't you eventually learn the calories of your favourite foods? I'd imagine that there would be quite a bit of intuitive eating involved during maintenance.   I'm just a sucker for routine, so by knowing what meals contain X calories, I can organise lunch/dinner to fit my budget without counting a thing in detail.   Am I the only one in here who has friends who are girls who I would consider 'one of the guys', just because she fits in well with us in social settings?   I'm seeing lots of judgement for women who want to hang out with their male friends without feeling like they need to censor themselves around here.  This type of relationship is very common for the girlfriends of my friends.   I'm starting to realise that the experience of the average redditor is not the experience of the average real person.  Edit: speeling   I'm so fucking excited, its such a good casting choice. Also, the fact that he is taking it so seriously tells me that he will do the source material justice.   You hear that constantly from actors who play superheroes, that they don't want to upset the fanboys   I'm a little bit worried after this latest season, it wasn't really their best. I still enjoyed it, but there has been a tonal shift in the past few years.   More specifically, I hope they do a factory reset with this meta humor shit from last season.   That being said, the show will continue to be funny and watchable as long as idiots do idiot things :)    I didn't find this episode any different than any other previous episodes   You're totally on the money here, it was **exactly** the same as his normal episodes.  I think when some take issue with the main segments premise, it throws a spanner in the works for the show itself.  I guess that's a good thing? The show would be boring if you totally 100% agreed with everything that John says :)  Solid episode     YES! Upvote to you, that's the one!   GW is tricky, not because it's unobtainable. but because I don't know what the number will be like when I decide to start gaining lean mass.    She took a picture? That's creepy as shit.   My current car is a 2008 Toyota Camry manual. The reason why this is so special is because years ago I spent **months** searching for a manual version of this car. I easily went through 40-50 cars and this one was the only manual which existed.  It makes me kind of sad actually, I would happily drive manuals for the rest of my life but so few are being manufactured.   Nah, that's not it. It's close though. Ill keep doing some digging.   That wouldn't be completely fair. My old job (during peak hours) I had to take 2 trains for a total of an hour to get there and riding a bike would take even longer. Driving took around 30 minutes and non of my colleagues worked in my direction.   I didn't actually drive an automatic until I had my full licence for 3 years. I couldn't believe that people could actually drive using only half of their limbs.     They're not really fond of 'dude' either   I totally agree with this, when I first got my licence, my insurance company offered to shaved 10% off my premium if I took part in a defensive driving course.  I have to say, that afternoon was incredibly helpful. We learned how to recover from a skid, how to identify un-roadworthy problems with your car and how different speeds can affect different braking distances.  It made me a much more capable and confident driver, 10 years later and I've still never had an accident.   This sort of fits the question.  But there was a CEO of a company a while back who jokingly stated that his product 'was kinda crap'. That statement was taken literally and the stocks in his company dropped and he ended up going bankrupt.   He had an effect named after him, can anyone remember what it's called?  Edit: Thanks /u/bigscience87 it's called the [Ratner Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ratner)   I get what you're getting at, but some people will still always do under the speed limit, I can't see having different lane limits changing that, also adding extra limits on the fast lane will likely make the fast line more congested.  I like the concept of 'keep to the left/right (depending on country lol) unless overtaking)   I assume you mean replace all traffic lights with roundabouts ?       Step 4: Call her dad  Warning, most girls hate it when you call them Dad.   Finally getting that annoying piece of food between your teeth out with your tongue.   I knew a guy who owned a house he was renting out to a few people, he had a legit house rule of 'if it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown flush it down' for the toilet. His reasoning? "Saving money on the water bill"  He meanwhile would take 30+ minute showers. I tried to tell him that shaving 10 minutes off a shower would save a weeks worth of 'yellow' flushing.   It's an **amazing** film, but it'll emotionally wreck you. So much so that I won't be rewatching it, despite me really enjoying it.   They're best enjoyed just eating by themselves like grapes.  So fucking tasty :D   You mother fucker, you had me till the last sentence.   The Tomacco episode of the Simpsons, that shit was perfect.   have you ever tried pickled garlic cloves? Oh sweet jesus they're delicious   A-are you a girl?   That chick is fucking shit at negging.   Oh sweet jesus that is a ridiculous cat.   OH MY GOD! WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FAAAAAAACEEEEEEEEEE   Liero.  Try to pick it apart you monsters.   The problem isn't just the fat, the bigger issue is the calories. So many calories.  I've not had cheese in the longest of times due to it being so calorically dense.   Worst sitcom, ever.  	120
 correct         guilty.   Joseph Campbell's spin on that, "The fool says in his heart there is no God' (Psalms 14:1). There is, however, another type of fool, more dangerous and sure of himself, who says in his heart and proclaims to all the world, 'There is no God but mine.'" - Joseph Campbell, The Masks of God, Vol. IV: Creative Mythology, p. 28    Honestly, I just feel like Apple Pay pushes the act of spending further into the abstract. Maybe simple impediments to purchasing like finding my wallet are a good thing.   Besides, the idea that Im burdened in some way by having to swipe my cards seems silly. Apple pay is a solution looking for a problem. Lets make fun of it.       yes   i recently contacted a Microsoft Store about a service issue and they were anything but helpful.  If you can take it back to the retailer you should.  In general, do everything possible to avoid dealing directly with the manufacturer.  they don't give a fuck.   I will upvote Rome gifs all day   this a great one.  It's the recorded oral tradition and a great read.      The blue crew basically executes promotions for the marketing department.  Things may have changed but at the time we were under the same direction of the guy who signed off on the music, graphics, etc.     Most nights were routine. You come in, talk about the promotions running that night; who was going to escort Charles Glen (or whoever, I believe it was still alternating) to the ice, who was going to round up mighty mites and their parents and get them through security, etc. We would pick the participants for contests from people on the concourse early so if my friends were going to the game I made sure they knew to be there early and to hang around the section where we came out on to the concourse so they could get one ice for whatever we were doing that night. Officially it was frowned upon but it was understood that if you had friends at the game they could participate in the promotion.  Once I got to wear plain clothes and walk around with a radio and pick the winners for contests on fan appreciation night.  Totally arbitrary; if I dug your shirt, you were the guy.  Probably my favorite story though was one night after the slingshot bowling thing on the ice.  We would get reminded all the time that we HAD to be off the ice before the intermission clock got to a certain time or the Blues would get fined by the NHL.  I think it was 10 minutes but Im not sure.   So we do the sling shot bowling and it goes like it normally does and its time to go.  I unlatch the big bungee cord from the penalty box side of the ice and start to gather it up. At I start to head for the Zamboni pit the guy out there with me starts yelling at me.   I run over and the bench door is closed on the cord and the thing is wedged shut.  We got a guy from the ice crew  over to help us out and the thing just isnt budging.  The clock is ticking down and there is still a huge bungee cord laying all over the ice. So with seconds left I run out and start gathering up the cord and start throwing it onto the bench and dove over the boards as time expired.  We couldnt just hang out on the bench so we ended up cutting the cord and leaving via the locker room which was kind of cool.    Little things:    A lot of European players play soccer in the halls to warm up,   Saw Panger doing a national Hockey night broadcast for ESPN once and he would stand on a box when doing the pregame with Steve Levy.  Just a tiny man.  You all know that Christ Pronger was a beast but Im 61 and generally am thought of as a big guy.  Standing next to Pronger made me feel like less of a man. On skates the guy was just a monster.  I know a guy who managed to turn multiple years on the blue crew into a front office career in the NHL.  The actual Blues offices where the GM and everyone works are right there at Scott trade.  Its the door to the right of the parking garage entrance.  (it just never occurred to me.)    i was on the blue crew for 2 years. back when it was coed.  kind of fun shooting t shirts out of a cannon and watching people eat it in giant hamster balls    I was able to use my windows install disk to boot into safe mode.  I updated all the drivers for my mother board and restarted.  so far so good.   I also like this movie way too much.  I made these a while back.  http://i.imgur.com/6zbAZTa.gif  http://i.imgur.com/iC8nwzm.gif   This is a new build (my first) that I finished last week. It's been running great since that time. Yesterday i turned it on and it booted to a blank blue screen with the cursor. I attempted to windows boot disc repair and system restore without any luck. I've checked the ram one stick at a time as was suggested for similar problems here and on toms hardware, no luck there.  This might not be related but at one point last night it booted up normally and while i was was playing a game my wife turned a TV on(i have the HDMI out on the videocard going to a 4x2 HDMImatrix and the second monitor disabled) which seemed to cue the blue screen. Hasn't booted since so i haven't had the opportunity to try and replicate that but it seemed relevant.  I've seen some suggestion for similar issues to attempt to reboot in safe mode and make sure my mobo drivers are up to date. maybe try and older driver for the video care? I'm going to give these 2 a shot first when i get home.  Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

This is a new build (my first) that I finished last week. It's been running great over that time.  Yesterday i turned it on and it booted to a blank blue screen with the cursor.   I attempted to windows boot disc repair and system restore without any luck. I've checked the ram one stick at a time as was suggested for similar problems here and on toms hardware, no luck there.    This might not be related but at one point last night it booted up normally and while i was was playing a game my wife turned a TV on(i have the HDMI out on the videocard going to a 4x2 HDMImatrix and the second monitor disabled) which seemed to cue the blue screen. Hasn't booted since so i haven't had the opportunity to try and replicate that but it seemed relevant.

       We used to go there after the clubs closed back in my high school and college days. A late night breakfast and a slice of pie. . . . memories   Not too surprised, in light of the recent Court decision, I suspect more people than normal will be at the parade tonight.      Just be careful, should you get caught by the cops, you could risk charges, or threat of charges, that would involve sex offender registration.   I went to the Astros game last night, and it was crazy downtown, ended up paying $30 to valet at Vic   Anthony's. If you can't get there very early, look at using light rail.         Rugby fans are a bit odd to begin with.      Then they have no business getting married because they don't understand what marriage is.   I don't think they'd even lose tax exempt status, there's a long history of churches that don't perform marriages where one of the parties is not a member of that faith. And, LGBT people want to get married to be happy, to promote love for each other - nobody wants to start their marriage by trying to force someone to perform the marriage ceremony, weddings are about good memories, not shitty memories.      It's not satire, it's an extremely conservative website that seems to border on satire.   I enjoyed the ending, I liked how they set the table for Season 4.                  One law enforcement problem I've heard about is that when a law is passed to outlaw it, the manufactures change up the chemical formula so it doesn't violate the law anymore.    A couple years ago, the teenage daughter of a couple I know tried some synthetic stuff, she ended up on life support in the hospital. Long tragic story short, she survived but has been undergoing extensive rehab ever since due to the brain damage.         It might feel like that in Texas, but, I've not found that to be the real case throughout the country, especially in business where $ is the almighty ruler.      As a lawyer, I'd prefer religion to stay out of marriage. So much of the property law I deal with on a regular basis is tied to marital and familial status and relationships.   I wouldn't say they are in control of most Christian denominations (or Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, etc. denominations), they're always just the loudest and most outrageous.   I've seen this photograph at an exhibition and it was fascinating. [This morning, NPR aired a story about the girls in the photograph.](http://www.npr.org/2015/06/27/417782675/what-happened-to-the-9-year-old-smoking-in-mary-ellen-marks-photo)      I'm not sure that you "need" to giver her away. Cats are super self-reliant, she's a kitten so she is going to be more active now, but as she gets older she'll chill out. Cats sleep for about 70% of their lives. As for bigger space, I can see an issue with a dog, but I know many people who live in small apartments that have not one, but two cats.    You're essentially saying that the most conservative elements of religion represent all religious people, which is far, far, far from the truth. I'm a Christian and am in constant disagreement with the evangelicals and their beliefs. I support gay marriage, I have no problem with churches performing gay wedding ceremonies.   Not a minor league team but maybe considered a low-key sport in the States, [the Houston Dynamo](http://www.houstondynamo.com) have reasonably priced tickets.   I've never thought of marriage as a vestige of religion. In the historical sense, marriage is a contractual relationship between two (often wealthy) families.    The County Attorney for Harris County (Houston) isn't letting the Harris County Clerk drag his feet for three weeks, instead he issued a letter directing the Clerk to start handing out marriage licenses to same sex couples - http://i.imgur.com/SmOnrAu.jpg                  Glad to see the County Attorney in Harris County didn't put up with any foot dragging BS from the County Clerk http://i.imgur.com/SmOnrAu.jpg   I can't believe this hypocritical jerk passed a bar exam.

For the past few seasons, I think the writers have been struggling with Divya's storyline, it's like they're just saying "What can we do to make things tougher on Divya?"   Trust me, you're not the only one who wants Jill back.   But you're going the wrong direction to get to Montana.                     Depending on where you go, there's usually plenty of street parking a couple blocks off the main streets, in the different neighborhoods.   I've hit over 100 on the section between 290 and I-10.               I live in the Alief area and have relied on the Ft. Bend Parkway Toll Road/Highway 90/610 as a quick way to get into and out of the NRG Stadium area, not sure how it is during regular rush hour, but you might want to check it out for commuting back and forth from SL and TMC.                                 Maybe, maybe not, if OP has comprehensive and makes a claim on his own insurance, his insurance company will subrogate the claim and seek compensation from Centerpoint.

Was surprised to see an owl this morning while I was out exercising, first time I've seen an owl in this area of Houston.

The only problem I've had there is I think I'm the only one who asks them to NOT toast my fresh bagels and bialys.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7QF32mxftE   A lot of the people who live in Austin that I've met seem to actually be transplants from places in Texas that are a lot smaller than Austin. To them Houston is too big and scary, but Austin is just the right size to feel they've gone up in the world. The people I know who are Houston transplants ended up there because of work.   I lived there from 94-97, still had some bit of quirk to it, but it was already no longer the Austin of "Slacker." Not long ago, I visited a friend who lives up on the northwest side of Austin and we went to have breakfast nearby, the development reminded me of any mixed retail/business/apartment development in Plano or Frisco.   I've had favorable reactions from people in New York City.                              On a street near where I live I've seen prostitutes trolling for johns before 9:00 a.m. on a Sunday morning. Last time I went down that street, I didn't see any, so guessing they finally got pushed off to another area, maybe.   The actual renaming ceremony is today.      True         Last year I heard George Pelecanos mention that Simon and himself were pitching this idea to HBO, glad to see they're still pushing it.      I'm going to miss Jon when he leaves, not sure his replacement could have done want Jon did after September 11th, after yesterday, after so many other tragedies.      I thought that was more about when they're on the shoulder already providing assistance.   And that's what's so annoying about how they all feel the need to race to the scene, it doesn't matter who's there first.   I won't drive the speed limit, cause I don't like the speed limit, but I do take advantage of blocking wrecker drivers whenever I have the right-of-way (they don't seem to understand Yield signs or the concept of right-of-way).   An accident is a feeding frenzy for wrecker drivers and they all race to get there for a shot at making some money.                    	199
 UPDATE: probably a false alarm if [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ebola/comments/2irvwf/british_man_dies_of_disease_in_macedonia/cl4wwgz) is correct.          That's another thing and is worthy of debate. The survery in OP's link was *explicitly* asking about banning things that don't exist.  Survey Monkey should have asked "Are you in favor of banning entry to people originating from an Ebola stricken country?".    It's worth pointing out that the question as it was posed is moot.  **There are no flights** directly to the US from Liberia or Sierra Leone.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roberts_International_Airport#Airlines_and_destinations  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lungi_International_Airport#Airlines_and_destinations    [Link](http://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Frisco-Investigating-Possible-Ebola-Case-278555081.html?_osource=SocialFlowTwt_DFWBrand)   The person being transported to the hospital is an employee with the Dallas County Sheriff's Office who was in Duncan's apartment, NBC 5 has confirmed.   [Here's more on the Spanish nurse.](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/09/world/europe/spain-nurse-ebola.html?_r=0)   Also from that link:   CBS 11 has confirmed that the patient checked yes to one of the screening questions regarding travel to West Africa.      The patient claims to have had contact with the Dallas 'patient zero'  So many questions on this. If they did have contact, were they on the CDC watchlist, if not, why not? Is this "claim" just bogus?       Frudakis' company, DNAPrint, has yet to turn a profit and may not survive much longer.   [Looks about right...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNAPrint_Genomics)   The company ceased operations in February 2009.    The list is incomplete.  It sure is. There have been 12 fatal shootings by police since 2000 in Montreal *alone*. [Check out the red markers in this map.](http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/policeshootings/index.html)  There are way more in the US though, this is true.     [This study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3298261/) examined dogs in a 2001-2002 outbreak in Gabon and seems to be the main source of information on this, and yes, dogs can be asymptomatically infected.  There is a very interesting thing in this paper:   dogs appear to be the first animal species shown to be naturally and asymptomatically infected by Ebola virus.   Needless to say, it would be *very* useful to know the biological mechanisms involved in that.       You know media outlets update their stories, right? When this was posted the story was *very* short and didn't contain this sentence.    [This comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/ebola/comments/2igp2w/nurse_infected_with_ebola_in_spain/cl23a5d) from another thread is worth reading. I cannot vouch for the translation. Relevant and eye-opening quotes:  (edit: emphasis added)   The infection event is still under investigation; **she went twice into the patient's room**: once to assist him and then after the former patient died. No accidental contact was reported.   The infected nurse went on vacations the day after the former patient pased away. Her husband is being questioned to elaborate a list of people with who she was in contact.   First symptoms (temperature under 38.6C) were reported on September 30th. She has been controlled twice a day since then. She mostly stayed at home.   This is the first actual *infection* to take place outside Africa right?   This is the one Al-Nusra urged ISIS to release. He was just a charity worker. Fuck these guys.   How much turmeric would you have to eat to get their dose of curcumin (500mg twice daily)? Is it feasible?    But, but... Hollywood movies tell me that there are crack teams in hazmat suits expertly drilled to deal with situations like this! Everything I've seen so far leads me to believe that they are hopelessly prepared.         Sounds like a story out of Liberia but no, this is Dallas.   If that's the case it would be Darwin Award level stupidity on his part, if the story of him carrying around an ebola patient is true. I guess we don't know enough yet.      Very relevant, from [this story](http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/10/01/us-health-ebola-usa-idUSKCN0HP2F720141001):  Duncan, in his mid-40s, helped transport a pregnant woman suffering from Ebola to a hospital in Liberia, where she was turned away for lack of space. Duncan helped bring the woman back to her family's home and carried her into the house, where she later died     Agreed, but it is probably worth noting that it was the researchers' University *itself* that chose that title for their press release.

 Lucy, the movie had so much potential but they pretty much completely squandered the entire thing. It was such a cool idea :(   Sarah Kerrigan   is this a joke   It would just smudge the nail piece instead.  	4
 Finally the day has come: The Big Bang Theory premieres its 8th season with not one, but two episodes! What will happen to Sheldon this season, where did he go? When will he return. We know as much as the official synopsis tells us   In the Season 8 premiere (The Locomotion Interruption), Amy and Leonard take a surprise road trip to Arizona to retrieve Sheldon, while Penny goes on a job interview at Bernadettes company, and Howard has problems wrapping his head around Stuarts relationship with Mrs. Wolowitz.  TBBT S08E02 ( The Junior Professor Solution) finds Sheldon who is ordered to teach a class, and the gang is surprised when Howard signs up to take it; and tensions between Penny and Bernadette afford Amy an opportunity to play one against the other.  The Big Bang Theory airs from 8 to 9 pm on CBS.                                 Thanks a lot, again!      Good one! That is why I love this show...it`s filled with these kind of wisdom quotes!

        I feel like a plan to kill 2 million feral cats by Greg Hunt is likely to involve something like importing 5 million feral dogs.  And then they'd have to import 5 million feral wolves to kill the feral dogs...                                                                                                                                                                              **Could you introduce yourselves?**  Hey there, I'm /u/train_subject6188! I've been on Reddit for almost two years now.  **How did you get involved here?**   To be honest, there were three reasons I started the sub, one of which /u/carmabound has already covered. The second was that I joined the Mod Squad at /r/worldnews about a year and a half ago and thought it would be a good idea to learn how to do mod stuff without accidently tripping over the wires and unplugging a default. The third reason was there really isn't a sub out there that will allow me to post my jabberwocky.  **How would recommend your sub to new users**  If you're looking for a place to chill out and hang, pour yourself a drink and come talk story.   **Aims for this subreddit?**  Haven't the slightest clue.  **Favorite posts?**  All of them on /r/train_subject6188, of course!   Yay and thank you to /u/handicapreader and /u/carmabound!  As well as the fine folks at /r/TinySubredditoftheDay    They should consider Vancouver over Toronto if nature is what they're after.  I've never had the pleasure of going over to Vancouver. Have been through Toronto twice, when I drove from Chicago to New York through Canada...talk about taking the long, scenic route!  I really liked the drive and Toronto too.                                                                                                      Lot's of positive vibes coming from these kids and it's good to see that they really do want to venture out of Japan.                                                This story should be used in the travel brochures for Norway because after reading this, I really want to hop on a plane to the Historical Museum in Oslo.      It's always me, isn't it?  	115
    I'm looking to stock up on this stuff so if anyone else sees this and has some used or unused bottles, please let me know!!   I can't believe how helpful people on reddit have been  :)   you guys are awesome   Yes!! Thats exactly what Im looking for!! :)   I will happily get you $5. Do you have paypal? I'm not sure the best way to get you the money but I will message you.   I'm completely ok with the bottle not being completely full. We know how difficult these are to find and shes just going to be excited to get it! :)   Not sure if this is the best subreddit. I'm looking for a discontinued lotion from bath and body works called Breathe Romance. My friend wants it for her Birthday but I can't do $60 a bottle. I was hoping an awesome person on Reddit here would sell me a partially used bottle for a little cheaper.      Please let me know if you guys have any ideas!!! My friend really loves this lotion   Ill take a look at that subreddit as well, Thank you   Bath   Body Works Breathe Romance 24/7 Moisture Boost Body Lotion - Sensuous Amber Myrrh 8.4 fl oz.  So something close Amber Myrrh maybe?   Does anyone remember the Breathe Romance collection from bath and body works? Its been discontiued for a few years and my friend was really wanting it for her birthday. I really didn't want to do the $60 on ebay for a small bottle :/      Do you know of a scent that would be really similar to this lotion? Preferably also in another lotion      Thank you, Ill try posting there as well   Thanks!   	10
 "Don't believe in trees" Ahahah! XD  I swear I'm not laughing at you love, I'm laughing right now because I picture a camper in the words telling someone else they are crazy because "there is no such thing as tress!"  Anyways! I have had these...I'm sorry, but I can't bring myself to call them ghost right now, the "things" have always fallowed me, sometimes it's cause suffering for others, which is a another story I guess I'll post it?  But...I haven't had good luck with people who, try to help me. My Mother and me went to a flea market, it's a big one they have every summer that's two hours away, it's good for bonding time.   While we were there we bumped into this couple who...forgive me but I'm not sure what it's called? It involves crystals and chakras, that's all I know! lol  So while I talked to his wife he did the...crystal thingy on my mom, after that they talked for awhile about which ones were "blocked?" and exercise to help unblock them I guess?   So my mom stands up and pate the table "you should do this" I put up my hand and shake my head no, "Eh...I'm good"  My mom keeps insisting and I keep saying no finally with a dead serious looks she glares at me "you either do it, or you are walking home"   *SIGH*  I get on the table and I'm tense...I'm not nervous because of anything bad I'm sensing from the guy, which by the way...that's another issue of mine! So many issues...  As I'm laying there thinking this whole thing was asinine, he's places crystals on me and I'm stiff as a bored, I didn't relax till he put this big ass crystal in my hands. Some kind of quartz?  So he's doing his thing, I kinda blank out, I snap out of it when he shakily says he's done. He takes the crystals off me and as I sit up I realize how much of a mistake this was...  This nice old hippie is shaking, he looks out of breath, and like he's about to cry. In my head I'm like..."what the flaying batman is going on?"  I ask if he's okay, I can see his wife is concerned and my mother is confused. He says he's fine, but ask if he can have a hug, I cover it up, but I feel very awkward, and say of course, as we hug I throw a not so convincing smile to his wife and my mother.     He steps away from me and sits down in a chair pulls out a cigarette and stars smoking like a chimney, his wife and my mother go over to him and talk, I don't approach because I think I did enough damage...I look at all the crystals they have on some tables, his wife comes over to me and starts just putting certain gems and stone in my hands. She tells me what they are all for, but to be honest I was still worried so I didn't pay attention, tried to pay for them but she shook her head , told me to just take them. After a awkward parting...I was just about to tell my mom off for making me do that when I hear his wife, she runs up to me and says to take this as well. It's a big quarts on this cord that is green and purple. She tells me it was the first crystal her husband gave her, she wants me to have it!  I tell her I can't possibly take something so important, she says I can and I will. Says I need it more than her, she walks away.   I still have it, but to be honest I don't wear it much because the cord is a little itchy.   I guess...I honestly don't know if I believe in the "Supernatural" I do find it interesting, but generally don't think about it.   I just know that there might be something off about me, and I don't want anyone hurt. You know love?  Also! I'm curious about your experiences, I would love to hear some if you are willing to share?    	1

 She says her name and hi but isn't that fantastic at pronunciation.  Sometimes it sounds like she is trying to say a word but I can't make it out   It will go up on Bunwear.spreadshirt.com in about a month and the profits will still benefit the rescue      Spoiled rotten! Just the way it should be. Cool design   Did you finally get him litter trained?!      It totally does!    She cracks us up daily. And I don't know that our mylar coated windows are beautiful - the sunflowers are nice though. Leela really enjoys hanging out on the patio.    Hah! Love it.    Thanks. We are Futurama fans in case you wondered :)   We have a young GCC too - she has been doing a crazy dance with her head more and has gotten more nippy with strangers recently.  Are there other changes we should be aware of?      Moar Rox Cutes https://imgur.com/a/oZ4IE   Here's his sad story if anyone wants the history of the king: http://www.therabbithaven.org/Rox_Appeal_020413.html   (cuz those days are history! boo-yah!)   Happy first Gotcha Day to Dr. Rockso Luther King Senior! That's Rox for short. Done being a medical foster, he arrived at our house as a foster on April 5. He stole our hearts and there was no way we were ever going to get him to an adoption show. We signed the papers a year ago today and never looked back. After attempting some bonding with Walter and Gwen, we got him his very own lovebun in September and he and Izzy are now inseparable. He has come a long way from the sad, abandoned, broken leg bun he was and we are thrilled to have had the chance to get to know him, thanks to The Rabbit Haven. Long live the king! The opinionated, grunty, loving little bun he is!      Loves being anywhere my bf is. S/he adores him (we don't know sex but named Leela so usually gets 'she')  Lucky for me she still enjoys my scritches and affections. Moreso when he is in sight. :-p   I'm renting so it isn't technically mine.   Nor do I intend to have kids let alone grandkids.  Though I may get it a pot - it is pretty cool.   California. I doubt it has ever been inside.    the woman who lived here before us was the landlords now deceased mother and she apparently did the yard. could be ancient.  It does look wild - kinda like a bonsai - stunted growth but old and gnarled. How big of a pot should I get? And should I really prune it?  I don't think the landlord would even know it was gone if I took it to the next house with me...      no idea. the woman who lived here before us was the landlords now deceased mother and she apparently did the yard. could be ancient.   The hanging basket was a gift and survived the winter... they perked right back up.  The thing (jade?) Bursting out of its pot was in the yard when I moved in.      ... but is it organic? o.O      I don't know where you are located - but shelters keep rabbits in pretty small cages and often rely on volunteers to get them out and let them run around some.  And rescues can always use hands or fosters.   hehehe - you have a pic of me in your album. Grats on winning one of the villas! Leith Petwerks donates so much every year - they are awesome.   I was so happy it cooled off for the event this year. Out of curiosity - what are some of the things you thought were nicer?      She wasn't selling them and I don't know if she does or not. I don't even know her last name :-/ Commission someone who crochets/knits?    I bet you miss her. Our Leela is under 2 years old according to the vet (she is a rescue and we knew nothing about her - came in as a stray) so hopefully she will be sharing her adorableness with us for a long time to come!   Thanks! We keep her wings trimmed, but her flight feathers are blue and gorgeous when they are longer.    Sometimes she wants me to get the camera out of her face. Other times she does something cute for me.   I say she because we named her/him Leela Beela. We actually have no clue what the real sex is.   Thanks - I think she's pretty, but then I'm biased  	32
 What highlighter did you use?  I currently use Benefit's High Beam;however, sometimes I feel like it is just too shiny.   All I can say is that if you are in it for the students, you will go far...if you are in it for other reasons you will burn out quickly..good luck!   Most states require you to take a teacher certification exam like the praxis and they typically require you to complete a student teaching semester/s.   Just curious, why do you want to become a teacher? (The degree that you have is not as important as your passion for teaching and your passion for your students)  If you haven't taken any education classes I would recommend doing some reading on teaching, observe some classrooms, talk to an expert teacher etc. Make sure that you want to be a teacher of students first and a teacher of your content second.  	3
 Justin wong vs Chris G off-stream [](/4Head)   Lol bopped off-stream?   I Cross beat ChrisG. Japanese player.   About the last paragraph, I had to put something down for EVO down haha. Didn't want to make my thread look biased towards Capcom Cup lol.   Pros for Evo:  - Most prestigious tournament due to its long-standing history - Insane competition. Have to battle out between 2000+ players - Biggest fighting game tournament in terms of media, attention from FGC and mainstream public and amount of foreign players entering it - Biggest points allocated as a premiere event - Good prize pool   Pros for Capcom Cup:  - Insane competition. Have to battle out between the top 32 players of the entire year. - Dat 120K and biggest ever prize pool. - Points wise and organisation-wise from CPT, this is the most important event because every tournament leads to THIS.  What do you think?    Daigo vs Momochi rivalry has been one of the most enjoyable rivalries for me to watch in Ultra SF4. Their meetings have been real close:  2014 Topanga Ranking Battle - Banzuke (Wakou): Daigo 2-0  2014 Topanga Ranking Battle - Banzuke (Akihabara): Daigo 2-0  2014 Topanga A League 4th - 1st Stage Online: Momochi 3-0  2014 Topanga A League 4th - 3rd Stage Offline: Daigo 8-6  2015 SXSW Invitational: Momochi 2-0  2015 Topanga World League 2: Momochi 5-1  2015 Stunfest: Momochi 3-2, Daigo 3-1, 3-1   Overall: 21-21  WOW [](/Kreygasm)   He's being used as a strike bowler. One advantage he has over other journeyman workhorse bowlers is that he REAL pace, which is why his potential as a legit test bowler is still bright for him.   Remember when you said Momochi's Capcom Cup was self-explanatory? I wasn't sure what you meant so I went through his bracket again to check and he BEAT:  Snake EyeZ, Bonchan, Valmaster, Ryan Hart, Infiltration, Luffy, Xian (x2)  So he beat 3 EVO champions along the way to win the title.

 -Ramsay Snow   you should hear some of the jokes med students make in cadaver lab   Best episode (well, 2 part episode) in the series. STAYIN ALIVE! STAYIN ALIVE! AH. AH. AH. AH.      Wait wait wait. What kind of hat because if its the "foxy grandpa" then sign me up.   If I were you I would sell my house before selling that beautiful car. Please do not sell the car. I want to cry just thinking about it.   The fact that popcorn kernel husks fit perfectly between your tooth and gum is almost undeniable proof that Satan exists.   My dog is the same. Shell pretend to be looking at something in the distance and then out of fucking nowhere shell go in for the ninja face lick that sneaky bitch.   This is awesome and gross at the same time. I cringed so hard but part of me liked it.   I'm glad one person on here can appreciate the Germans without whining about the check engine light.   That's hilarious and all but don't go making jokes like that in the real world you sick fuck.   We got a holiday from school because of it   That snail though. So majestic. So triumphant.   Storytime. Some douche in an admittedly awesome supercharged mustang was driving around Chicago revving his engine and cutting people off and stuff so our cab driver in his Sorrento revved his engine at the stop light and then when it turned green floored it into the parking lane and overtook the mustang. The mustang guy was so pissed he parked outside the bar we were at and waited for at least 20 minutes. It was awesome.   We had a gas mask bong that we used to smoke in the dorms. We were not the smartest.   That's for space pirates dude use your common sense.   But wouldn't it be badass to be a lone ranger doomed to wander the moon forever? Wed sit around campfires telling stories about him and wed tell our children "don't you dare masturbate because the moon ranger is watching."   I had to medicate my reef tank for flatworms so I know this feel. Fucking nightmare.   I'm impressed that you found a way to weasel a pun in here.   In America, your comment would probably get downvotes because we like to compare things to ourselves and we don't like being called out on stuff.   Fuck your stereotypes.

 It's Canada right? Looks like mississauga   It took me a year to convince my boyfriend to let me do this! Something about it is just tons of fun :) it's something we don't have so I think it just becomes curiosity mostly.   no i live in Canada!   i'm not sure, but i'm not even mad.   I don't drink pop but i love my morning coffee haha   But,  it's me :(   i'm half german half asian. Compared to other mixed girls i've seen on here i can barely see it in myself!      I've always wanted to tell this story,  because I feel like it's a way I can kind of thank him. My boyfriend and went to Niagara Falls for a weekend last summer, as a small vacation while we were out of school. We're both in university and don't have all the money in the world, and since Niagara Falls was close for us it was a quick and cheap getaway we could enjoy together. Anyways both him and I love fine dining but don't get the chance to enjoy it very often. There was a beautiful high class gourmet restaurant in town that we decided to try and we were quite excited.   We got all dressed up and walked to the restaurant and it was beautiful. Stunning decor and lighting, and the environment was very classy and comfortable. The menu prices were in the 40's-50's for entres. Since eating out was something that we loved to do but didn't get a chance to do very often, we decided to enjoy it and splurge some money because we deserved it, but still go for the cheaper end of things. The waitress came up and asked what we would like to drink and we both decided on a beer. While we were waiting we noticed a man sitting a few tables down with us, eating dinner with a woman and a young girl that didn't appear to be his. He smiled at us and we smiled back thinking nothing of it, just a friendly gesture!   We then each ordered an appetizer and waited for them to arrive. After the man and his date had left the waitress walked up to us very surprised looking. She told us that the man had put a 200 dollar credit on our bill and payed for our entire meal. I was shocked, we hadn't even spent that much because we couldn't have afforded it. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and I started to cry. He hadn't even know our situation and I'm not even sure why he did it, but with that trip being all we could afford that summer it meant the world to me and all I wanted was to be able to say thank you. We decided to pay it forward by leaving about 50 dollars as a tip from what he had given us. It was the least we could do in the situation. That act of kindness still means the world to me, because eating there wasn't extremely affordable to us and he made the trip so much better.  TL; DR: random stranger pays for our bill at a very expensive restaurant after he leaves, put me in tears because my boyfriend and I had to save to go to this restaurant and he payed our bill   thanks! :)   same as my boyfriend haha, his creativity goes as far as tie dying some stuff, but i don't think it's as common for guys to have costumes anyways!      Awhh that is such a sweet story, love to see a husband and wife post here :) what a great way to get into electronic music, it's really life changing! If you're looking for a truly life changing festival you should look into going to Electric Forest in Michigan. It's a 4-8 day camping festival and gen. admission is pretty cheap for the length of it. But its SO much dofferent than any other festival. Just some friendly advice, id suggest you take a peek :)   Hey no worries, I raarely get a good quality picture with anyone at raves, pics are honestly my last worry. I like the story more than anything, I always love seeing two people adopt shows and festivals together :) keep it going, there are tons more left to experience!   She looks like quite the blast to party with, so I dont blame you. Whatever is going on there I hope you giys always stay in touch and keep it going :) dont lose your fave rave partner!  	15
 Maybe he was lesbian.   What's it like knowing they might even use the same supermarket as you?      Well, they supposedly have 250000 subscribers already so it does seem like they have happy customers.  Technical problems happen with every service. Lots of people have problems with Netflix for instance while others don't. It's just part of the modern world. I wouldn't call Sling a "terrible business" since that would qualify Netflix and HBO Go as terrible services as well since at one point I've had weeks of problems with their services too.   I'd probably ask something extremely uncomfortable like "do any of you masturbate to lesbian porn?" just to see their reactions.   If you go to /r/netflix or /r/televison a lot of people claim that the only reason they still have cable is because of sports. Sling is a perfect substitute for them. They can cut their monthly cost from ~$100 that cable costs to just $20 and stream their sports. It's a good service for some people. I just don't think that the Game Grumps audience is the right group to advetise this too.   Well yeah, like I said, adding it only to sling was dumb because not everybody is going to be interested in it.  The point of my post though was just merely to explain how Sling could be appealing to many other people and that the $20 gives you more than just Table Flip. Being able to stream ESPN is actually a huge deal for many cord cutters since previously that wasn't possible without an expensive cable subscription.   Some people don't like cable but still want to watch sport matches or the news the old fashioned way.  I mean, this is a good alternative for them.   You're not their target demographics. They are targeting cord cutters.   From my understanding, the $20 gives you access to live TV from networks like ESPN, ABC, A E, etc. which is much cheaper than cable TV.  I can totally see the value in the $20 if you're into sports and live TV but prefer streaming it and not pay for cable.  However the addition of Polaris+ and thus Table Flip is really stupid imo.      Er min navle vk?   They've made several videos. Since you can't be bothered doing a 2 sec search on Youtube, here they are:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayd-e3DZI9s  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qF71bp1yZzM  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YeB0NucfXk  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbnsrIMfn2U  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxeM08qvTlU  Their last video was only 3 months ago, not 2 years.   Jeg prvede match.com men der var ikke rigtigt nogen i 20'erne s valgte at deaktivere min profil derinde.   Synes bare ikke jeg fr srligt mange matches s vil gerne supplere det med noget andet.

However because of the price change, your game is now worth $7.5 as opposed to $10.  Also here is one of the videos where they advertise about the website: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YeB0NucfXk  I have no idea if they're still affiliated with them or not.   So now a coin is worth $.75 instead of $1 even though it still says $1 on the website. Many members have because of this lost money because their coins are now worth less. Somebody even tried pointing this out and got banned from their website.  Just putting this out there as a warning to any lovelies out there about this shady website.   Lucky. Wish people would talk to me so I didn't feel so lonely.  	22

 Who watches the watchers?   I'm intrigued. What is this from?   I agree with your diagnosis of the problem, but when you make a post like this, can you please spend at least as much time proposing solution as you do illustrating the problem?  I realize this is a big departure from the the current culture of this subreddit, but without solutions and proposed actions there is absolutely no point to even illustrating the problem.  In fact, psychologically, we were better off before we knew, or when we weren't thinking about it.  I'll start: How can we stop war?  We can make war-mongering politically unfeasible by recalling/no longer electing anyone who supports war.  We can stop paying the portion of our taxes that goes to fund wars.  We can protest.  We can engage in anti-recruitment to ensure there aren't enough soldiers to engage in war.   You don't have to drink it.  There are great alternatives to milk and cheese that don't involved forcible-impregnation, a life of servitude, and early death. Just saying.   It took me a long time as a vegetarian to reluctantly accept that conclusion.  Then I discovered Daiya cheese and nutritional yeast!   Just go vegan. Problem solved.   How dare you post a comment.

If the owner of the property is not charged with any crime, there is no justification for seizure of property whatsoever.  Moreover, we need to end the failed war on drugs and start treating drug abuse like a health issue rather than a criminal one.   It specifically says they must be supervised by a "trained PE teacher".   All children should sit still at their desks all day.  No one should be allowed to walk to school because it is too dangerous.  The only safe thing to do is completely immobilized children to avoid the risk of injury.  Nevermind childhood obesity, less exercise is what kids need!   Good. Please don't go. =)   I hope you Left No Trace.   Be proud of the American people and the spirit of innovation and self-sufficiency and self-determination that is the ideal of America.  Then fight like hell to save it from the plutocrats who have systemically destroyed our ideals in Orwellian fashion.   I'd say government has much more.  Religion has virtually no influence over my life.  One can chose to ignore it.  I can't simply ignore the governments demand that I pay taxes or abide by its myriad other laws.   Again, I didn't say you NEEDED religion to do that.  I already agreed with you on that point.  I just said, it can do that.   meanwhile, everything bad you can do in the name of religion you actually need religion to do that  See my reply to your comment for my response to this argument.  It's been nice chatting. I'm going to bed now.   The same can be said of government.   I never said that.  It sometimes is. I also don't think it's universally a negative force in the world.  At it's worst it is brainwashing and violence-inducing.  At it's best, it brings people together with a knowledge that they can work together to improve the world.  Look, I'm not really a fan of organized religion.  I prefer a more fluid and personal path to spirituality.  I just don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater.   The first statement, I absolutely agree with.  Religion does not have a monopoly on morality.  #2, depends on how you parse it.  For instance, would something like the Spanish Inquisition happen without religion? Not exactly like that, no.  But people can still be zealots without being religious.  Political zealots can engage is mass murder and persecution as well, like stalinists or anti-communists for example.  It's really not possible to distill all the world's problems down to a single thing.  Or if it is, it's something more fundamental than religion, maybe like ego, or fear.   People don't only identify on the basis of religion.  Other example of groups people identify with: ethnicity, nationality, class, idealogy. Come on man, use your head.   If people don't have religious beliefs, you're right, it's impossible to manipulate them on the basis of THOSE beliefs.  But my point is that religious beliefs are not the only way that capitalists manipulate people (particularly into war.)  They also use economic imperatives, non-religious ideology, and and just plain scaremongering.  I'll give you an example of each.  Economic imperative: "We need to go in and open up those trade routes!" or "Fight this war and you get money for college."  Non-religious ideology: "We've got to stop those commies or they'll destroy freedom everywhere!"  Fear: "Saddam Hussein. WMDs. 911. Saddam Hussein. WMDs. 911. Saddam Hussein. WMDs. 911."   That's not true.  There are tons of ways for capatalists to manipulate people.  They mostly do it through economic circumstances. They do it through debt, they do it though media manipulation, they do it through advertisement. I think you have a single track mind.   So if a Jew doesn't criticize Israel, they're a Zionist, but if they do, it's an example of "Jewish Privelage".  What would a jewish person have to do to avoid your criticism?     You're right fundamentalism is a huge problem, but your last statement is hyperbole.  I think you're underestimating the influence that capitalists have over when and how often we go to war.  They often use religion as a tool to manipulate people however.   It doesn't matter which happens more.  They are both problems that feed off of each other.   There are many jews who don't support the oppressive policies of the state of Israel, and many who don't even think a "Jewish State" is a good idea.  A lot of jews are frankly pissed of that Zionist assume the right to speak for them.  This why you have to make this distinction.   Yes it would.  Judaism can be construed as a race or a religion.  If you are anti-any-race, you are a racist.  If you are criticizing the religion itself however, that is not racist.

I had to recreate my Live USB and then I reinstalled.  I did two things wrong on my first attempt to install.  I didn't make a separate /home partition (I'm not sure if this is actually necessary but folks on the irc channel said I should.)  I think the main problem was that I selected sda1 as the boot disc instead of just sda.  After I reinstalled it booted directly into Mint.  After running "sudo os-prober" and "sudo update-grub" it now gives me GRUB on boot with both Mint and Windows present. Hurray!   This is long, but I'm trying to give all the necessarily details to get help.  Currently I can't boot either Windows or Linux.  I had a system with Windows 8 on one partition and Linux Mint on another and GRUB booting.  At some point Linux Mint became corrupt and I decided to wipe the partition and reinstall it. I chose to install Linux Mint KDE 64 bit edition.  So I created a Live USB and boot from that and did a manual disk partition.  I deleted the partition with Linux and created two new partitions in that space.  The first 3GB as a swap partition.  The remaining space became the a partition of type ext4 and mount point "/".  I think it's device id was /dev/sda5.  I selected sda1 to be the boot partition because I think this is where GRUB was location previously (it had a size of 500MB). sda2 is the Windows partition.  The installation went ahead and now when I boot I get this:   Grub Loading. Welcome to Grub! error: no such partition. Entering rescue mode... grub rescue  My first thought was to try to repair GRUB from linux so I put the bootable usb back and.  But now when i try to boot from the usb it gives this:   MDM could not write a new authorization entry to disk. Possibly out of diskspace.   Error: no space left no device.  I press OK and it says:   Could not start the X server (your graphical environment) due to some internal error...  It then goes to a black screen.  Next I will try making another bootable USB on my other computer since it apparently got messed up somehow.  I also tried messing around in the grub rescue prompt but I don't really know what I'm doing there.  How should I proceed? Any help will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!   In that case, we need to also focus on changing that law, which is fundamentally anti-democratic.   Let's start a campaign to recall her and every other senator that co-sponsored this bill.

Democracy is government FOR the people BY the people, not the self-appointed elete. We DO NOT have to take it.   I love you guys.

It's funny how the ocean's ecosystem managed to thrive for millions of years without human intervention, but now it needs humans to step in and "protect it" in a way which is incidentally highly profitable.   Here's the thing. You said a "jackdaw is a crow." Is it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be "specific" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing. If you're saying "crow family" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people "call the black ones crows?" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too. Also, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't. It's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?      This is bullshit - you're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything to the discussion.   That's interesting.  I didn't consider the object bumping into air molecules in front of it and that it would bump into less with the wind blowing in the same direction.  Is there a formula for how much force is applied to the object by the wind based on the object's current velocity, mass, and the wind speed?   tie em to my belt loop.  oh well, it woulda been nice.   Found the vegan!   Somebody give this man gold!   I like what you wrote and I welcome you to the pantheist camp!  I just don't understand what Tyson said in the video that sounded pantheistic to you.  He said the universe is trying to kill us, which is a pretty silly idea to me.   Are saying that if I fire a cannonball at 50mph and there is a wind speed of 10mph in the same direction, it wouldn't travel any further than it would without wind?   That was a good read and I agree with him mostly.  I take issue with the idea that theories which are not falsifiable don't deserve to taken seriously.  Non-falsifiable theories are simply outside the realm of science, but this doesn't make them ridiculous.   This one has in between options: http://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test   Wow, same also.  A trend emerges...   Exactly how was that talking like a pantheist?      RIP in peace your inbox! lol   All aboard the Karma Train! CHOO CHOO!   I'm on the verge of ordering an Extreme Q and I just had the idea to fill up some balloons and take them hiking. Has anyone tried this? How long can the vapor stay active in there? Thanks budddiees.   Drugs, drugs are bad, mmmmk?   All he'll get there is name calling and willful ignorance.   A lot of why marijuana is illegal in the first place is because of the risk industrial hemp posed to the oil industry. So they had to demonize/criminalize the whole thing.  Time to change things.   Bonding over weed is great.  I remember when I discovered my Dad toked.  It totally improved our relationship.   Everything does.  Milk is actually gnarly.  Try hemp milk! Goooood.    The majority of adoptable dogs are never brought through our doors (we refer them to local adoption groups and walk-in animal shelters). Most of the animals we house, rescue, find homes for, or put out of their misery come from miserable conditions, which often lead to successful prosecution and the banning of animal abusers from ever owning or abusing animals again.   As a two year old child, can confirm.   Why do I have you tagged as "Begin Karma Train here"?  EDIT: relavant username?  Eddit: What downunidans really?  EDIT: GOLD REALLY? What a wild ride it's been  Edddit: THat's enough internet for day.  Going to go fap to Robin Willaims the great aethiest  Edit: jackdaw?    I identify as both egalitarian and MRA. They are not exclusive.  Neither is feminists and egalitarian! Double standard much?     Yeah it does and I'll tell you why. Tell a feminist you're pro-male and they will assume you're anti-female and a woman hater/beater/rapist.  Do you not see the irony in this?  You are assuming that anyone is who feminist is anti-male.  I just can't even..   Thanks! They actually wrap around the edges.      Can someone explain what's wrong here? I'm really new to archery.   I never said it was.  But it's important to remember the situational forces at work here.  Yes, at the end of the day, everyone is personally accountable for their own actions.   Pro-feminist does not mean anti-male. And both assertions are far from the reality.   [Interesting Read](http://www.john-lennon.com/whokilled.htm)   This is probably true.  And that's because colonialists made it impossible for them to live the tribal lifestyle they've lived for thousands of years through taking of land by force and exploiting the natural resources.  Now the animals suffer.    something that a certain race does.  This the the problem.  **A certain race does not collectively do anything.**  Individuals do things.  When you make collective judgements about people, this is prejudice.   You'll never be "right" in absolution.  Isn't it great how science always seems to reveal more questions, just when we think we're on the verge of answers?   Firstly, I'm glad you experience the magic of the universe.    How would my world be any more magical if I believed a talking bush told me to commit war crimes?  This is a total strawman.   But I think what really sets us apart is the red pill/blue pill question: could it be that you prefer to hold wrong beliefs that are comforting rather than true beliefs that are not.  What really sets us apart is that you believe in an objective reality and I believe it is more subjective.  That ultimately comes down to a philosophical debate, because it is impossible to prove the nature of the universe to be either way.  But take a look at special relativity for an example of how reality might be different for different observers.  	100
 Don't forget Paris, 1861: Tannhuser received boos and catcalls at its Paris premier because the ballet was in Act l instead of its traditional Act ll spot.      Das Lied von der Erde, conducted by Bruno Walter, with Charles Kullman and Kerstin Thorborg, with the Wiener Phil in 1936. I believe this was the first recording of this beautiful work: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLuXK0WDiaE   Yes!  Good point.  So were Musorgsky and Borodin, according to Russian music specialist Richard Taruskin.      I wonder if those notes that are considered mistakes aren't intentional edits from Horowitz, designed to twist the music in his own inimitable way.   I'm not convinced.  Comparing the photo to paintings isn't a compelling argument. Just look at all the paintings of WAM and you'll see great diversity in the way his features are represented (nose, eyes, etc.)   Also, she would have been 78 at the time of the photo. Where is her gray hair?        Wasn't the Mercury recording released with faulty engineering?  I believe my copy (stored at the moment so I can't check) is entirely in the wrong keys (not Starker's fault but the engineers'.)      Leonore is unique among opera heroines.  How many female leads can you think of who are strong, powerful and rescue the man?  I always suspected that Fidelio was criticized because the world wasn't ready for a powerful, heroic woman like Leonore.  LvB was ahead of his time. Among the great recordings of Fidelio: Toscanini (no dialogue but the singing is superb); Haitink with Jessye Norman.  There is a stupendous opera film of Fidelio from Hamburg with a magnificent cast: Anja Silja, Richard Cassilly, Lucia Popp, Theo Adam, Hans Sotin, Erwin Wohlfahrt, Ernst Wiemann, Leopold Ludwig (conductor), Rolf Liebermann (director).   ... and emphasizes his age, which doesn't occur with Biden, who is almost exactly the same age (Bernie 1941, Biden 1942).  He's in better condition than most Americans in their 50s.  He was a marathon runner, and I'd say this campaign itself is quite a marathon.  Go Bernie!   Did anyone see this on the front page of the news anywhere?  	12
 Was there ever any consequences for them shooting that plane down? It kinda just disappeared from the news over time   Oh got it. I'll keep that in mind for next time!   I like my sauce! Haha to each their own though   I'm going to give this a shot tonight   It was my first time cooking duck, wasn't aware I was supposed to score the skin. Does scoring provide any benefits other than aesthetics?    We first baked two potatoes, then cut one in half and scraped out all but 1/4" of it. We completely scraped out the other potato. The potatoes were then blended with cream cheese, butter, brown sugar, salt, pepper, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg and cayenne. This mixture was then pipetted back into the first potato skin that we cut in half and then baked for 15 mins. Turned out great!   100% recommend   Mmm sounds delicious    What else could I use it for?    We first baked two potatoes, then cut one in half and scraped out all but 1/4" of it.

But for steak the sous vide provides an even medium rare with no overcooked exterior. The meat comes out super tender all the way through when on the skillet it sometimes comes out a little tough    It turned out great! So juicy and tender throughout. Thanks!   I posted the step-by-step album in /r/food if anyone is interested.  http://imgur.com/a/GTe1C             Except you can still get a DUI on a bicycle...   What about its paws though? I can barely hold ice in my hands for more than a few seconds    Brushing my teeth in the shower!   So your wife just took your kid and left while you in the hospital?    I used to work at a car museum that housed many F1 cars. The curator told me they could drive upside down at 100mph   What warnings were they given?   "Crouching tiger hidden bastard"    I couldn't believe that house was only listed at $2.5 million...    That was the worst story I ever read   Does the bill grow back?   I currently work for the State of California. Although I am eligible for loan forgiveness if I keep working here for 10 years, I would have to choose an income-based repayment plan. The problem here is that with the income-based repayment plan I will have my $40,000 loan paid off in 7 years... Meaning that I never get to take advantage of the loan forgiveness at all :(   You're not alone  	28
 I was the same way. I saw a lot of builds before I pulled the trigger. I was worried about skill level and available tools. No need to be. I've got a jigsaw, a drill, and a circular saw, all bought from Home Depot on sale as a kit, some t-squares and rulers from Harbor Freight, and a lot of patience. If you do decide to do it, just remember, go slow, measure lots, and stop if something doesn't make sense until it does.   What kind of rice is that?   Don't listen to the haters man. When my daughter is old enough I'll be doing everything I can to spend time with her and make sure she know's that I'm there, and if that means a few spa days, you can damn well be sure I'll be down to get the princess package myself if need be.   That sounds awesome, I'll try that.   It is frozen, yes. This is the third time I've prepped. The last two times I made some veggies with spices and sauces and good stuff. This week I had no veggies except for this frozen broccoli. I saw last week someone just put frozen in and cooked it that way. They're not even really frozen anymore, they were already fridge temperature this morning. My hope is that they're at least partially steamed when I warm it up, but, we'll see. I'll let you know how it goes.   Check out /r/mealprepsunday   1/2 cup of oats, 1/2 cup of vanilla lowfat greek yogurt, 1/2 cup of milk, splash of honey or agave or whatever sweetener you like, than whatever "toppings" you like. Shake it all up, leave it in the fridge. I also put a half a scoop of protein in it. This weeks toppings are chopped frozen cherries and blackberries. Last week it was banana, PB2, and chocolate chips. Next week I'm gonna try brown sugar, walnuts, and bananas.   I'm so glad I tried this a few weeks ago. This is the best breakfast I've ever had pre-made and it takes about ten minutes to put it together. I eat it cold, some put it in the microwave to warm it up, you can also throw toppings in right before you eat it, like some granola.    Good point. Added details above.    The pulled pork was made following this [recipe](http://www.100daysofrealfood.com/2013/12/03/recipe-best-pulled-pork-crock-pot/) (mostly). Brown rice and barley mix was cooked in chicken stock with a tablespoon of coconut oil in it. BBQ sauce recipe is 3 parts kethcup, 1 part dark brown sugar, half a part of water, vinegar, tomato paste. Some seasonings, mustard, chili powder, garlic, salt, pepper, onion powder, pinch of ginger. Cook everything down about 30 minutes or so and add some blackstrap molasses at the end.   In case anyone wants to keep up on my progress. I'm not a blogger, so it'll just be an imgur album with a few comments.      Downvoted? Did I do something wrong?   Cook all at once, refrigerate in fancy new Pyrex with lid containers, reheat in the oven like a frozen dinner. Don't freeze them though, you will lose any sense of fresh.      I can't tell if you're actually the bigger troll by calling out the obvious troll.   Oh god, thank you so much. Seriously, I've found lots of cool things on Reddit, buut this may be the best time-waster ever.  /p sandstorm all day long...   ha haaaaaaa   Yeah, as /u/shiftthedevil said. It's not a case of it's guaranteed to be poison, but why risk it?   I've asked this question to multiple individuals that have used them or are in the shipping container industry and unfortunately I have always received the same answer. A resounding "Yes."    Thanks   I don't know if it was Brooks' direction, or if Moranis just decided to do it, but using the loudspeaker to talk to the guy next to him and then yelling without it to talk to the guys over on the other sand dune made me titter like a school girl.   I know you said the reason this response is unknown as a response for blood, but what, if any, good could come from having this response to anything. What sort of protection does this provide the human body?   Also, as an additional question, is this the same thing that happens to those goats that faint?    For your second actual request you should share the awesomeness of D D: Tower of Doom.   I'm going to try to to make my own sausage someday. I don't have a meat grinder or a sausage stuffer, but I've been told you don't "need" those things, they just make it a little easier. I'll let oyu know how it goes.   The sausage came from a package, but it is delicious. [Here's the brand, Al Fresco](http://www.alfrescoallnatural.com/products). I've tried most of their flavors and they're all great.   In an unrelated note, San Francisco attacked by Godzilla.   I always thought that sound was supposed to be the elevator. I just re-watched when I bought the digital collection and had the same question in my mind this time around. Admittedly my speakers are better this time around.    Like warm bags of sand...   The monitor shelf and speaker board (below the marquee area) have 2x2 supports. Since this picture was taken I also added full width 2x2's under the monitor shelf and behind the monitor back panel which stiffened everything up considerably. I'd highly recommend that. Also, the base was originally a 2x2 frame, I upped it to 2x4's with cross braces. It used to flex quite a bit at the top, now there's almost no motion in the cabinet when I shake it, the whole thing moves as one.   I actually used [LuSiDs](http://lusid.net/arcade/) plans initially, but made a few modifications. After standing in front of it for a bit and making 'pew pew' noises I'm thinking I might lay the screen back just a little more. I've got enough buddies who are interested in doing some 4-player stuff like Gauntlet and TMNT that I think it's gonna be a little too upright. I may go back another 10 degrees or so.   Awkward to pick up myself, but not too heavy to do it. It's pretty light actually. I'm going to fit some couch sliders on the bottom to make it easier to slide around since I've decided against casters.   This may be the most awesome thing I've read today. The utter non-commitment in your tone is just spot on.    This is before I pulled all the screws out and countersunk them. Up next is some putty and lots of sanding. I'm planning on doing a 48" four player control panel with a trackball. Graphics for the side, control panel, and the marquee, are going to be an Aladdin's Castle theme, since that was the only arcade my parents would take me to when I was a kid.      Also check out Nick Ienatsch [Sport Riding Techiniques](http://www.amazon.com/Sport-Riding-Techniques-Develop-Confidence/dp/1893618072') and his similar article from Motorcyclist in 1991 [The Pace](http://www.motorcyclistonline.com/pace).   Blurred Lines ruling will effectively turn this into a profit for Gallagher.   I thought stickers go the on the lowers?   Cool, thanks. I'm going 48" on the control panel and a 36" LCD. Sounds like I should be okay. Can't wait till I can get some Gauntlet going.   12 in North Carolina I think. /s   Can you make it so I see it more?   Nail on the head. It's okay to see people naked, but society has made us think it's wrong.   Never lose that. Ever. The best is that one day it goes from you holding them to them holding you. My daughter just hit that point. Getting an actual hug from her feels like the best thing in the world.   At work and no sound, but visually, the Prism looks so much better. What's the TL;DR on his review?   Whenever you want, you can come hit up my swing in Cali.    Nice bike, I'm sure it's fun to ride, but I hate manufacturer stickers on lowers unless the lower has a belly pan incorporated and it's on a track.   Unfortunately, outside of his native blog he can only utter these syllables.    How wide is your MAME cabinet? What about the control panel (at the back)? How comfortable is it for 4 players, really? Size and resolution of the screen?  Thanks in advance. I'm just starting my MAME build and this would help a ton.   A bad batch of Kinects you say? When I suggested that in my thread asking if anyone else experienced the same symptoms of mine that had their XBox about as long as I had, I was declared a raving lunatic.   Some other families in our baby group have dealt with this exact issue. Despite the pain involved they stood strong, no you cannot hold him, you cannot come see him. They skyped, and talked on the phone. Finally the parents found the light and got vaccinated.   You are the guardian of that child. You are responsible for the safety, health, and well being of your baby.  Edit: We also had a mother in the playgroup that didn't get her daughter vaccinated. My wife and some of the other mother's politely informed her that she was no longer welcome in the group until she made the right decision. She also finally relented and got her daughter vaccinated. There is only one girl in our group who isn't and it's because she actually medically cannot get them. She's got some other issues that prevent it. Part of the reason to the other mom was that as a group, we're also trying to protect those that can't get vaccinated.   But the MMO Mode wasn't really MMO, right? It was still all offline, just super awesome at being offline?   I was planning on getting Goat Simulator because it's just awesome, but you have made me realize how awesome it is with your awesome background. Thank you. Thank you so much.   Is it bad that I want to poach your view?   This guy is right. I've done all four routes (101, 1, 5, and 395) 395 is by far the prettiest and most fun to ride as long as all the snow is melted, which you don't have to worry about this year since there was no snow, but the trade-off is you really should take two or three days to appreciate it. 5 sucks, it's hot even when the rest of the state is cold and rainy. There's nothing to look at except fruits, vegetables, and migrant workers. 1 is nice, but not really worth it for the extra time. If you're looking for fun, curvy roads, you won't really get it there because you'll be stuck behind cars the whole way. 101 is a nice compromise of all of them. Shorter than most, can do the trip in a day. Once you get down towards SLO it gets really pretty and the curves pick up.    Good job. One thing to remember. If you miss a day of step one, step two is don't beat yourself up over it, just get up tomorrow and try again. Until it's a habit, it's easy to give up. Just keep taking it one new day at a time.   Do you rent or own?   Here's [breakfast](http://i.imgur.com/gbt7B9u.jpg). It's overnight oats, this week I went with Peanut Butter, Chocolate Chocolate Chip and Banana.      I'm actually starting a build on my first MAME cabinet. How wide is your controller? Is it really comfortable for four people?   Where'd you see this. I'm in the Bay Area, I'd love to tell that guy where I'm going to parked at and invite him to come bump my bike over.   Yesterday my wife and I went to the Dr's to get her 12 week check-up and the OB couldn't find a heartbeat. She said by the size on the ultrasound it looks like the sac is the right size, but everything inside stopped growing two weeks ago. She's scheduled to go back in next week and if everything is the same they'll give her some drugs to induce a miscarriage.  My wife is 37 (two years past the magical age when things start being problematic with pregnancies) so we had discussed this up front before we started trying. We have two other great children so it's not a huge deal. She seemed to be in good spirits yesterday, but our one-year old was at day-care all day. She's a stay at home mom, so I'm hoping things still go well today with my daughter home with her.   I know we're not the first ones to go through this, I just felt like I needed to put it out somewhere semi-anonymously.   Edit: I can't say thank you to everyone individually, but thank you everyone for your condolences and advice. It felt good to be able to say it out loud, and it feels good to know that you're all here to get my back.  Edit 2: Wow, thanks guys. I'm glad to see such support here. I mainly just posted this to get it off my chest and to see that I'm not alone is good. It's also nice to see some of the other guys who were unsure about posting having a spot to get some of their own angst out. You guys are awesome.    So I downloaded MAMEUI 32 and everything works good now, thanks. Still kind of weird that it didn't run using MAME.   It doesn't tell me what's missing. Just a generic, you're missing one or more ROM or CHD files. Is there a tool I can use that will tell me?   So I've downloaded MAME 0.160 on a Windows 7 machine. I've sought a few ROMs from some places that say they are definitely for 0.160. Any of the games I try to run say "The selected game is missing one or more ROM or CHD images." I searched google for that error and most people say that it means that those games are not compatible with the version of MAME I have. So I went and tried a different site that again specifically said the ROMs were 0.160. Same thing. I'm feeling a little stupid here since I'm normally pretty good at figuring this kind of stuff out.   Any ideas what I'm doing wrong, or is there a beginner's tutorial anywhere?   When my wife and I moved here that's what she called it the first time she saw it on a sign on the highway. Her brain works in marvelous ways. I thought it sounded good so it stuck, because I won't let it go.   Talk to a doctor if you are at all concerned. My wife's OB was very open with us about PPD and told us if either of us ever thought there was an issue to contact her. PPD can go from symptomatic to tragedy in a heart beat.   Yeah, you get an upvote for that. I mean, you could've went with Pentax K1000 or pinhole camera, but you decided to get real old-timey.    I knew it went to one of the ferries.    It seems like it's gotten better. I don't go that far, I get off at DeLong, but I used to sit in traffic at Rowland, or sometimes even 37 before they opened up that extra lane.   At those speeds it'll take forever to get from Sausagealito to Santa Rosa.   Goal: Drop 60 lbs  Progress this week: Meal-prepped breakfasts and lunches this week, been keeping to my 1500 rule, just need to keep it up through the weekend. Weighed in this morning after 6 weeks of ignoring the scale. Down 8 lbs.    Not to come off like a dick, but do you think stopping the weed for a bit might help? I'm not anti-weed, but there's definitely some ties between smoking it and having the ability to get shit together.   Look into the 100 push-ups site. It's just push-ups, almost no time at all out of your day and after a few weeks you feel ready for more. Than you can look into the 200 sit-ups, 150 dips, 200 lunges, 200 squats, etc... It's all bodyweight, no equipment needed.   Thanks for the info. Price isn't too much of a concern. Long ago my wife and I decided that prioritizing health over things like Starbucks was a pretty no-brainer decision so we can always scrounge up some spare scratch if need be.   Yeah, my job allows me to work from home pretty easily if need be so it seems likely that I could easily fall into the staying home to work and help out with the kids, skipping workout mode since my gym is close to work and I go to the gym before I go to work. Luckily I workout with another guy there and I'm hoping we can get to a point of him holding me accountable.   I've also considered getting something like this [weight rack](http://www.amazon.com/Cap-Barbell-Deluxe-Power-Cage/dp/B00I04Z52G/ref=sr_1_3?s=exercise-and-fitness ie=UTF8 qid=1428509242 sr=1-3 keywords=squat+rack) so I can still do my 5x5's at home. Luckily I have room in the garage/office for it.   You non-Californian water wasters, you're so lucky.    Monday, Wednesday, Friday - Stronglift 5x5's.   Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday - Run 30 minutes (almost 3 miles now), lots of core BS (crunches, side crunches, planks, push-ups, blah blah blah), and a 10 minute cool down on the stair machine thingy.   Once a week, usually on Sunday's we also do a hike in the Marin headlands, I carry the 18 month old in the backpack, and now my wife is carrying a 10 week fetus around, so there's that reason to stay healthy too.   Sorry, I forgot my /justkidding tag. Yeah, I know there's absolutely no way that MS would give away a hololens. I know some people working on the Band dev team and I couldn't even scam a free one of those from them and they're only $200.   All preview members receive free Hololens(es???)      If it wasn't for the idiots using password as their password, we wouldn't be in this mess, now would we?   Do you want to get your house firebombed, because this is how you get your house firebombed.   Sorry man, I totally thought everyone knew about BARF.   Woah, thanks for that. That is what I'm going to do.   I don't have sound at work, so I played Ecstasy of Gold in my head over this video. Worked out well.   Looks like we'll be seeing an update on [http://isdmxinjail.com/](isdmxinjail.com) pretty soon  FTFY   Someone told me these weren't jellyfish, but for the life of me I can't remember what they said it was.

Check out [this article](http://www.latinpost.com/articles/46005/20150403/coconut-oil-and-new-heating-process-could-lower-calories-by-half.htm), read the research, seems solid. I've been told by some people that it should work with all carb (noodles, etc...)    This exactly. I grew up about 12 blocks in the wrong direction from where this occurred. Just north of 47th and Paseo (which I guess doesn't exist anymore, they put a crazy bridge there or something) and were these kids to do this kind of shit down there, the 'karma' they received would've come from a source other than the police.   Netflix has no friends. Classic.   Forget excuses to go to the garage, try finding an excuse to go to the other side of the country.   I can completely understand this sentiment from gamers that have more time or are just better at gaming than others (typically referred to as hardcore gamers, I guess.) This game is not for them. But taken from another point of view, as a gamer who only gets two or three hours a day (if that) to put towards playing, I don't want a game that I have to invest six months (or more) in, like the bigger, longer RPGs (Final Fantasy, for instance). Something like this is just perfect. I'll get a week or two out of it. I'll likely pick it up again sometime later and replay it for the story. It's perfect for me.   It took me a bit to find a system that worked. In fact, I got really good with a team of two characters just in time for that to be forcibly changed and had to re-adapt. In the end, I had most of my people pretty well leveled up and for the big fights I would mostly rotate through my support players who would stack bonuses on one of the other characters that had the big-money attacks.   Uninstall and try again maybe? Dunno, haven't seen anything like that before.   I haven't played Ori yet, but I think Ori is a platformer, right? This is not much of a platformer. In fact, it becomes almost completely non-platform oriented about a half an hour into the game. Other than that though I couldn't compare or contrast the two.    I saw the trailers for Child of Light when it first came out and I thought, wow, looks different, but I don't know if it's going to be fun. Well, fast forward however many months it's been since then to now when it's shown up on GWG for free. On Thursday I set it to download while at work and picked it up to start playing it that midnight. A really interesting coincidence that the timeline of the game also starts on a Good Friday.   From moment one, I was hooked. As a dad, I don't get a lot of time to play so I normally try to spread it around to different genres of games to keep me entertained. Not this. If I had time to play over the last three days, I was playing it. Just finished it up now, on Easter day, which is funny but I won't give away any spoilers.   What a great game. An interesting take on art direction, but definitely one I could stand behind. I honestly had no idea it was an RPG (it's never really mentioned or shown in the trailers) and was pleasantly surprised when the first fight started. The fighting was enjoyable and the animations, while not as over-the-top as the latest FF games, are cool enough to keep you entertained. Using the Oculi to enhance (or possibly completely screw up) your strategy is a nice addition, as well.   The story is great, along with how they weave it all together. Yes, you will probably have the end of the story figured out long before it rolls around, but it's still fun to watch it come together. The writing is also well done and had me chuckling a few times.  The music is spot on and the sound effects aren't over the top. I could easily play this as the rest of the house slept without waking anyone and still hear the low volume level noises easily.   Overall, if I had gotten a demo of this game a year ago, I likely would've spent the money on it up front. As it was, there was none, and instead I just got it free and knock it out in about as fast as I've ever finished any game. Four and a half talking fireflies out of five.  Edit: Also, I'm not a big fan of grinding out those last few levels if you don't need to, but I've beat the last boss and will now be going back to finish my skill trees and collect the last few things I missed.   Step one, stop playing XBox for a week.  Step two, take that time you would've been playing and instead do something really horrible; smoking crack, banging hookers, etc...  Step three, after a week of that she'll be begging you to just play XBox. Then you can sell your leftover crack or pimp the hookers.  Step four, profit.   I was with you all the way through it.   I couldn't watch more than 30 seconds of that guy without wanting to punch him. Can someone give me the break down on what his complaints were? That it was a waste of money for them all to be at the store together?   Check this [page](http://android.serverbox.ch/?p=549) out. Seems like it could be what you need.   Okay guys, we're expecting our third kid (we already have an 18 year old and a 19 month old,) in November of this year and the Toyota Yaris just ain't gonna cut it. So, give me your auto recommendations. We've decided that we're okay with something that's just big enough for my wife and I and the two car seats, but it needs to have good cargo room for packing all the crap. We've been thinking about wagons like the VW Sportswagon and the Volvo V70. Not that into SUV's, unless they're really not-SUV-like. And no mini-vans. We're not going there.

 [i wish to register a complaint!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nIEjt1CPRw)   the doctor was very cost conscious. i took this picture while waiting to see him.  https://imgur.com/5KmjCfQ   it was at a local radiological imaging facility instead of a hospital. the doctor referred me there because he said it would be much cheaper. i asked at the front desk when i signed in and they told me one amount. after i filled out all the paperwork, they gave me the updated amount at a different counter.    it's the insurance companies that middle man all this shit that drives the price up. i recently had to have a ct scan. they told me it was going to be $550 then found out i didn't have insurance.

 YES. OH GOD. I had forgotten this one till now.   I dislike that one too. Not hate with a fiery passion but really dislike. Why. Why is it played so much.   I have nothing against Hotel California. I don't know why she hates it. It's kind of what inspired me to post this, because I like seeing what weird things set people off. I also have a friend who hates the word "moist." In conclusion, quirks are neat and I just rambled a lot.   A friend of mine really really hates "Hotel California." To the point that she'd rather listen to static. I feel similarly about Taylor Swift's "Bad Blood." I've seen posts talking about favorite songs and classic songs, but I'd like to know about the songs you hate!

Some dudes are unhappy because someone said they can't fully appreciate sex because they are circumcised. No one is actually sure this is true because they don't know what it feels like to have sex uncircumcised. Clearly these two issues are exactly the same.   This would annoy me   sorry i didn't know you were the reddit police won't happen again   I thought it was cute my 83 y/o grandpa was playing on this taped together gameboy he's had for like 30 years.

 Netflix wasn't built on winners.    Yea man...  This is kind of weird..  Not trying to be rude but in a time where it's virtually impossible not to be found unless you don't want to be...  Gives me the sense that she doesn't want to be found..   Edit: the more I think of this...  You are really being creepy man.  You just posted a women's personal info all over the Web. You are naming two aliases of hers which shows she has tired to hide her identity. Your account history doesn't ease my stress either being an account that's new and has questionable post history. You have admitted to wrong doings you wish to amend which gives us a reason to believe that there is reason to her not talking to you.    Reggae concert in Tahoe...  Lots of weed. Sick music and good vibes.  Cheap only $45.   No just this one.    Sure but degrees of intolerance doesn't take away that any amount t of intolerance will cause a rift. Just risky to an unstable team   But Karl doesn't put up with bs and Rondo is alot of that.  I believe that's where half of this Cousins drama is coming from.    Karl and Rondo aren't?

Worst case stuff a bad and pipe in your shoe. Play penny slots for free drinks til iration blows your top off man.  Matisyahu never comes around so I'm stoked Bro.     Rondo is a "me"  first player who has turned out two teams...  One better situated than us...  In less than two years.  He is gonna be costly and has no loyalty to the team. Cousins + Rondo techs are way more than we need and I doubt we will be able to keep Rondo contract down.  I don't want him here. I'd rather Lawson and that is saying alot because I'd rather neither right now...    I really hope Rondo stays away...  If I'm crazy please help me see why you want him...    Trippin...  He's not starting caliber. Lawson is if we land him.  Collison is ball smart tho so will suffice for now.    Fuck yea man...  Danny off the bench.  Draymond  will be to much   Yea...  He's a fucking comedian.    Got em!    Fuck your cake day bluhd   You son of a bitch...  Upvote   This guy...

Your lamp is a naked bitch riding a centaur....    Well fuck...    TIL how to Karma where.  Thx   Wrong thread..  We don't care.  This shit was still funny.    Sac is a unique place.  Lots of stuff to do for sure.  I am a huge music lover and have been to 3 festivals last month and have 3 more in the coming up two months.  Sac gets an awesome variety of music. And relatively cheap.   Nice parks all over.  The bike trail is a must. Old folsom, old town sacramento, old roseville and old fair oaks are just cool places to be.  Lots of craft Mico brewers with open mic nights. Alot to do if you do it with the right people.   My girlfriend and I were in old folsom the other day.  She was shooting photography while I skated. We then caught an open mic night and spent $10. Living the dream?  Haha   Good points. Maybe Cousins just lost confidence in the team.  Understandable.     Idk about Miller.  Possibly with his relation to Karl.  We also need to be careful about setting  the bar to high for Vlade. He also is new in his position and has basically made it so all falls on him. Bad decisions happen and I don't want us getting to upset when Vlade makes a bad decision.   We have a huge upside this year and I would be surprised if we didn't make alot of moves tomorrow.    Personally I go out of my way to avoid Grant. So I would have to say no on having to caught his opinion of boogie. Is boogie a bad locker mate?  Maybe.  I'd be pissed off as well if I was scoring 25+ pts and grabbing 12+ rebounds.  I have voiced in here how often Cousins and Gay fight. We have a young talented squad with a young new FO. It takes sometime to settle down and get it right.  Malone was a shitty thing to do and I'm sure that perturbed Cousins but he has to be strict on a team of people who look up to him. Andre miller seemed to help calm Cousins down towards the end of the year.    http://www.reddit.com/r/kings/comments/3awhzz/representing_the_kings_on_the_rnba_mock_draft/  They suggested 6th pick and Landry for 12th pick and Alec burks   No..  No we wont   Now your turning me on   This.  How do you feel about the Milwaukee Burks trade we had for mock draft on /r/nba?    It's been 2 solid days of spamming/circlejerking about a Cousins trade.  /r/kings has great people who have great insight into things like the draft coming up tomorrow.  Let's be constructive rather than doing trade machines for Cousins.    I'm not saying we wouldn't trade him.  I'm saying we are not trading him. Karls statement was taken out of context in April.  He was merely saying we are always looking for opportunities to get better. That is how I took it.  No man above the law.  If a deal was to good to pass up...  It's business.  But it makes no sense trading him right now. Especially what's been reported as trade offers.    First of all... Fuck /r/nba which is a circlejerk to stir up drama/entertainment. Take them for what they are and don't buy into bs.   /r/Kings know our FO better.  I truthfully believe that Vlade won't trade Cousins for multiple reasons.   - you don't trade young superstars to risk landing young superstars.   - you don't trade the best center in the league for pork and beans.   - Cousins resigned because he wants to play here.   - Shit... WE RESIGNED HIM BECAUSE WE WANT HIM!   Karl got 3 months of play with Cousins... [We all know Demarcus is an emotional lesbian](https://youtu.be/m9zdn6E3KbE) and he may have overreacted to rumors.  He's 24. Shit happens. He wants to win and he's frustrated.   Pete is probably leaking shit to tear apart an organization that he despises. Malone may be feeding it too.  Fagan can only capitalize off the drama. Fans are showing true colors by Making claims of "jumping ship". We went from hopes of  a playoff birth to hating the Coach all from Twitter.    Rudy Gay and Stauskas are real pieces on the table yet no one is acknowledging this. Let's regroup.  Calm down.  Prep for the draft tomorrow.  Fuck this Lawson BS.  Fuck this Celtics Cousins circle jerk Fuck you Isaiah.   New arena.  New Coach.  Top pick.  All star Center. Let's get back to real basketball talk.

He could have done it any way he wanted.    Pretty sure that guy just shit himself.    Hate perpetuates hate.    12th pick Sam dekker or Kaminsky if available   As a top rebounding team in the league... We have one of the best 3 position rebounders. I believe that is huge especially since most rank him a top 7 SF.    In all seriousness..  Rondo can ball.  Better than Rubio and other players but he is as much as a megastar as Dwill or Josh Smith.     Personally I don't want his bad attitude, egotistical,  fuck any team I'm on ass.  He made comments about the Kings organizations and showed how he treats team like Boston and Dallas.  That said if he signed one year 5-7 mil I'd consider it. I wouldn't give up anybody of value for him.    Confirmed.  Bad bitch.    Rondo is worth a grilled cheese and a 12 pack of Hanes socks.     I'm with you   Neighborhood confirms.  Bad bitch   Sources confirm...  Taylor Anderson is a bad bitch.    Reports are possibility is for trading for Lawson (which I think is dumb). What do you guys think about him?    Aight haha      I am just as upset. They are people too.  Just to ship them away is ridiculous.    [Woj] "Cousins not actually George Karls cousin.  Turmoil over family relations.  Viveks a bottom. Vlade wants out. Rudy Gay actually gay. Not that that is a bad thing"    You my friend...  Are a true warrior   Because last year was the same way...  So I wouldn't say years like you did....    Strongest draft in years...?  Da fuq?    Sam Amick had a strong point  http://www.sportsgrid.com/nba/are-the-kings-and-george-karl-getting-played-by-demarcus-cousins-agent-dan-fegan/   Could it be Pete?  Trying to stir up turmoil in spite?  Could it be DMC agent in spite of Karl trying to get Cousins out? Could it be someone close to Vivek? Shit...  Could it be Cousins himself??    I renewed another year for season tix but had I known this bs was gonna go on...  I woulda paid 60 a month for daytime cable.

I honestly don't k of why I was gilded but hey fuck it    Glad YouTube did this.  Now I listen to music in a 3D setting      I'd be all over this   Another creative way is to give it to a family who could now get a job with  it.   Edit:Thnx for gold   I was just reasoning to why I started.  You can take JT out of starting rotation after the first couple games once WCS gets acquainted.  But who knows...  Maybe the off season will be enough for WCS to jump right in.    I agree with JT being bench.  I just don't wanna assume that we put our rookie out immediatley and JT has had more time with boogie than Young.    That's fine.  Adds depth to our bench and allows Rudy and Cousins more ball. Young and Williams would for sure cost less than Lawson.    Williams can start over Ben easily.  But you could keep him on the bench if you please. Do you want Mclemore starting?    How would you guys feel about FA signs gs of these two and drafting WCS.  I still like McCallum and feel he isn't a horrible 1 and with us keeping Nik in the mix and developing maybe having a deep 1 isn't  a good idea.     Instead we don't resign Evans and we dump Landry.  Pick up these players.   Starting lineup  - Cousins (WCS)   - Thompson (Cousins)   - Gay  - Williams  - Collison  2nd string  - depends on who officially starts  - Young  - Casspi  - Mclemore  - McCallum (Stauskas)   Bench: Dwill,  TBD.      Mudiay didn't even wanna work out for the Kings if I am not mistaken.   Edit: https://mobile.twitter.com/News10Sean/status/612035460874043392      Into your eyes..

It all depends on Niks attitude this off season.  If he goes at it hard...  We may see a whole new Nik.  If he sags under the pressure,  he will probably be traded.

 A phrase often employed by the boring.     Because they're able to think more than one step ahead and avail themselves of birth control, and/or take responsibility for their actions.  You're kind of dim, aren't you?   I already told you I voted for Udall.  Reading comprehension much?   How cute. You're totes adorbs.   [citation needed]   I guess I would care if karma mattered.  But it doesn't, and your sad little attempt to outgroup me with your sock puppets is really just hilarious.   You know, you'd think you'd take a little more pride in your insult craft.  You just kind of suck at it.   Who said anything about them not having access to birth control?   Good call. Have an upvote.   Funny you should mention that.   I voted for Udall specifically because of his stance on abortion.   After all, women who are conservative or libertarian are not as likely to have an abortion as women who are leftists.   As a result, liberalized abortion laws and free or subsidized abortion can only work in the long-term favor of the pro-liberty outlook.   :-)  In fact, since you have stumbled upon the notion of aborting your political adversaries before they can do you the disservice of saying things on Reddit that make you dispeptic, I've actually given you an upvote.  Congrats, Oscar!   A winner is you!   Name calling.   Way to take the high road!   ABORTIONS FOR ALL.    TIL that distributing a couple of measly press releases is "defending your privacy."   What I find hilarious is how the left honestly thinks we're to believe that someone who can't be troubled to acquire a state-issued ID is also someone who's likely to be a civic-minded and well-informed critical thinker.   I mean, I'd  have more respect for you if you were just honest about the whole thing and admitted that you oppose voter ID laws because it makes voter fraud easier, and enables you to corral low-information voters who otherwise simply wouldn't bother to show up at the polls.       I think the time has come for Molly's family to put her in a rest home.    I suspect that all of the kids who were killed in drone strikes ordered by Obama would disagree with the claim that a vote can't be dangerous.   But they can't, because they're dead.    That's true as far as it goes, but Udall's people have the phone number for the groups running those ads making him look stupid, and you'd think they'd be aware enough to put in a polite request to kindly refrain from making their candidate look like a clueless boob.    I never said I was a supporter of Gardner, the point is that Udall is a fucking lazy 1%er who thinks he can win by playing a single note as loud as possible.  Downvote if you agree!   Evidently it's enough of a concern for it to be laid out in the news (and regardless of whether you dislike Fox News, the points made in the article are perfectly relevant.)  Furthermore, even the Colorado Secretary of State has voiced concerns over voter-related shenanigans.  Of course, it's hilarious to see people like you claim that showing an ID to vote induces voter disenfranchisement, but you have no problem whatsoever not only forcing people to show an ID, but also to drive to specific locations, pay the modern equivalent of a poll tax, and fill out ridiculous amounts of paperwork just to loan a rifle to a buddy for a hunting trip.  The hypocrisy of the left never ceases to amuse me. It's like watching an idiot try to pass himself off as a neurosurgeon.   Yes, because nothing says "21st Century Tactical Relevance" quite like an argument advocating for the tactics employed in a war that started over a century and a half ago.  Current military leaders are constantly trying to guess what the next strategic threats are, and to prepare for a situation where they're not stuck fighting the next war with the last war's tactics and methodologies.  Not you, though. No. You want to fight the next war with the last, last, last, last, last, last, last, last war's tactics and methodologies because you think that putting a bayonet on your (I'm guessing here) surplus Mosin and/or SKS looks badass.   If you don't think the current system makes voter fraud easy to pull off, or likely, you're an idiot.       In theory, it's fun to put a bayonet on a gun and strike a pose in front of the mirror with it.  But you should never, *ever* bring that up in public. It's embarrassing.   You *wish* you could fuck me.  The closest you'll ever get is the spite-jacking you'll give yourself while thinking of me tonight.   I love how you get all butthurt at the accusation that your precious wittle team bwue could ever be anything other than a flawless, unique and beautiful snowflake, but then follow it up with equivocation that essentially endorses the idea of committing voter fraud to win.  The depths of ethical hypocrisy to which people like you are willing to sink is hilarious.  Unable to actually win on anything of substance, you're forced to endorse outright fraud to get your way. It's like watching a toddler throw a temper tantrum.   Yawn.    When you can't win on actual campaign issues, blame the Koch brothers.   God, it's hilarious how transparent and hackneyed leftist talking points have become.   Frankly I'm amazed at the glut of credulous mouth breathers like yourself who are so happy to suck Udall's gold-plated 1%er cock.    LOL, trouble understanding how the mail works, Ashgar?   Thankfully, the party apparatus is happy to stuff the ballot boxes to make up for his poorly executed campaign.    If you need to be told this so close to election day, I'm not sure you're someone who should be voting.    As I understand it, what this would likely do is enable a workaround to the Hughes Amendment.  In order to buy an MG, you'd still be expected to file paperwork with the BATFE and pay the $200 tax.   This is a hilarious line of thinking from the someone who's an advocate for the party that believes in instituting a modern poll tax in order to exercise one's 2nd amendment rights.  The hypocrisy of the left is utterly hilarious, and the fact that people like you constantly wander around expecting to be taken seriously is, frankly, adorable.  If showing an ID to buy a gun isn't an infringement of one's gun rights, then showing an ID to vote isn't an infringement of voting rights.  If this post tweaked your over-developed sense of self-righteousness, feel free to downvote.   There's no need for you reasonable line of inquiry here.  I find it hilarious that the people who decry the very thought of showing an ID to vote are the exact same people who not only demand that you show an ID to buy a gun, but assume you're a criminal and have no compunction about forcing you to pay to jump through a Byzantine background check system under the threat of jail time.  The Democrats in this state are hypocrites of the first order, and the downvotes my post will garner only reinforce that fact.   Really,any of them are pretty great, but I'm partial to the Aimpoint Micro.  I think battery life for most of the Aimpoints is around 30k hours.    I guess monosyllabic words are more your style.   Wow, you really are sanctimonious.   Good for you, I guess.      This reads like the setup to a sketch from That Mitchell and Web Look.    "We hit you for your own own good."  -Colorado Democrats   "don't you stupid, ignorant redneck morons understand that we're going this for your own good?! YOUR OWN GOOD!"  The willingness of so-called progressives to jump up on the cross at the slightest provocation never ceases to be a source of entertainment.    Hopefully the voters will be heard.   Unfortunately, there have been a number of incidents that serum to indicate some democrats are possibly engaging in voter fraud.    Being the only brand whore on the firing line with a magazine stamped with the HK logo.    It's kind of interesting. If you read the official reports on mass shootings, it becomes pretty apparent that magazine capacity is way down the list of things that have an impact on the outcome of such an event.    The ban wasn't overturned.

In conclusion, here's a link to make you happy:  http://www.nationalenquirer.com/   Everyone knows that Breitbart is a partisan source.     Alternate headline:  "Has-been film director pads his demo reel with tax deductible work for stupid political cause."   I love how you can practically see the author's cognitive dissonance in the words of the article.    That infographic is so old it wouldn't need to show an ID to buy a beer.   It quite literally predates the shift to most states adopting liberalized concealed carry laws.             What's it like being the king of person who doesn't know what he's talking about, yet holds forth add if he's a subject matter expert?   Can you do an AMA on that topic for us?    Winner, winner, chicken dinner.    This has nothing whatsoever to do with addressing violent crime, and everything to do with radical gun control advocates pushing for policies designed to harass and intimidate gun owners.    Its already illegal to sell a gun to a prohibited person. Even without a UBC law, your scenario would play out pretty much the same, with both criminals going to jail.   If you actually gave a shit about reducing gun crime, you'd actually make it easier for anyone to conduct a background check and simply allow anyone to submit a NICS request without forcing them to go through an FFL, or you'd mandate that government issued IDs should be conspicuously marked so that anyone can ascertain the legality of the purchaser at a glance in the same way that licenses are marked to easily tell if someone is of legal drinking age or not.   Of course, as a supporter of gun control, you're completely  incapable of seeing gun owners as anything other than an adversary to mock and harass, so it wouldn't actually occur to you too treat then as anything other than untrustworthy potential criminals, rather than as people who have a vested interest in reducing violent crime, and who could be allies in achieving that goal.    Tl;dr: your stats can be right, but you can still use them to lie.   This is one of my favorite tactics employed by the advocates of gun control because it's a very clever tactic of using a lie by omission in order to support the typical left-wing tactic of outgrouping those you dislike.   It's actually quite clever, but I'll do my best to unpack their argument and point out the flaws.   The thing you should take note of is that the article only talks about a decline in one thing: the rate of gun ownership.   Nowhere does it mention a decline in the raw numbers of gun owners, and there's a very good reason for that: solo long as they stick to talking about rate, they're right.   However, trying to claim a decline in raw numbers would be a lie.   Let's break it down with a simple example.   Let's say you have a town with a population of 100, and 45 of the people in that town are gun owners, which gives you a gun ownership rate of 45%.  In the next year, the town's population grows to 150, and the number of gun owners grows to a total of 60. If you run the numbers, you'll see that the town now has a gun ownership rate of 40%, which is a decline of 5%.  In the next year, let's say the town's population grows to 200, and the number of gun owners grows to a total of 70. Running the numbers, we find that gives us a gun ownership rate of 35%, yet another 5% drop from the previous year, and a whopping 10% drop from the first year!   But if we look at the growth of just gun owners from year one to year three, we see that the number of gun owners have grown by 55.5%!  How can this be?   Well, the overall population is almost always going to grow faster than any underlying sub group, whether that's gun owners, runners, or people into collecting Pokemon.   For the overall rate of gun owners to show a positive rate of growth, it would be necessary for there to be a great percentage of new gun owners than new people, PLUS an added number of people on top of that too push the rate past equilibrium. That's pretty unlikely to happen, no matter what sub group you choose.    It's interesting that the ARS article notes that they first tried to sell the gun to civilians before realizing no one wanted it.   Looks like Shannon Watts finally got the memo from Mike Bloomberg telling her that social media campaigns and Facebook Likes are pretty worthless.   Barbados actually does disagree, and if you argue with him he'll actually stalk you in other subreddits.  Frankly, I have to wonder if his hatred for people who only wish to defend themselves is because he doesn't just engage in creepy stalking online...   Please explain how this law will stop one criminal from selling a gun to another criminal, or how it will stop a potential mass shooter who has a clean background check from buying a gun.  Thank you for your time, I look forward to your response.   Shush. The grownups are talking.   Vote your conscious, but realize that FiveThirtyEight has one of the best track records for predicting statistical outcomes in political races.     Gun control isn't about safety.  It's about controlling the actions of the people that gun control advocates disagree with.     Agree. This shotgun's only reason for existing is its own ostentatiousness.   Frankly I'd be much more impressed with a shotgun that simplified the ability to execute a select-slug drill.    They'll probably sell like hot cakes to the same demographic that thinks the Taurus Judge is the best gun ever made.    Or inspired by one.  http://m.imdb.com/title/tt0339840/   What is with the radical opposition to background checks on this sub? I own a glock 19 and a 300blk SBR with a 762 sdn6,  Yeah, and I own a fully-functional A10 Warthog with "da switch."  To conclude:  http://m.imgur.com/NQHKSVE   No,but the facts that nearly every mass shooter successfully passed a background check, and no criminal will bother with mandatory background checks certainly do.    Can't wait to see the trolls here rush to the senator's defense.   http://m.quickmeme.com/img/71/71c3931c1edc4353a0c03ec549753b965872a2c343c09255617f4470cbd924ed.jpg   2edgy4me   I honestly don't know why.   I just know that even if it were legal to still a gun to an ex-convict, I wouldn't simply because playing those odds is a sucker's bet.    Because the system operates on an in-built myth that incarceration equals rehabilitation.   One need only look at the stats on recidivism rates to shatter that illusion.    You misspelled r/gunsarecool   All I'm saying is that if you know someone is a dirtbag with a history of violence, then perhaps you shouldn't sell them a gun.   Likewise, I would not sell a car to someone with multiple DUI convictions or if I knew they regularly drove under the influence.   Voluntarily refusing to sell something to someone isn't denying anyone their rights.    Assuming your information is correct, its completely possible for the general population to grow faster than the specific subset of the population that are gun owners.  As a result, it's quite possible that the numbers of gun owners to be growing, but the statistics would make that group appear to be shrinking because the population of gun owners is growing at a slower rate than the overall population.  There are plenty of other indicators that you're wrong as well. For instance, the numbers of people getting concealed carry licenses continue to grow, safety classes for first-time gun buyers are routinely filled to capacity, and new shooting ranges are being constructed at an explosive rate.  If the ranks of gun owners are shrinking, then you wouldn't see any of those things happening.   Rosie lost her mind years ago.  After all, this is the lady who dressed her kid up like a jihadi suicide bomber and put a video of it on the web.   You should care because you're an upstanding citizen who recognizes that enabling possibly violent people is a bad idea.     Winner, winner, chicken dinner.   One way to get anidea about the person is to ask them to present a valid concealed carry permit.  If they've got a valid permit, it shows that they've successfully passed a criminal background check in the past and that they've got a clean criminal history.  Other than that, you can protect yourself by making it clear you'll be copying their driver's license for your records.  Also, most of the time you can judge someone by their behavior. If the other guy dresses like a dirtbag or acts shady in any way, don't go through with the sale.   It works for Toxoplasmosis, though that's a parasite, not a virus.   But if you just want to make stuff up, that's cool too, I guess.  I'm not making stuff up. Do you honestly think the average cop is going to be aware enough of the law that they're going to say "Oh, well, that's ok, because I'm a walking copy of "Black's Law Dictionary" and I'm completely aware of all of the exceptions."  No, of course not. They'll cuff you, and haul your ass in and let a judge determine if you were in violation of the law or not.   "Entrap" does have a specific meaning that doesn't apply, here.  Fine. Harass will work just as well. That said, grammar pedantry is one of the laziest forms of trolling.  Lol. I just don't believe in the conventional pro-gun circle jerk group-think, is all. So, of course, any contrary (or contrarian) opinion must be an anti-gun troll.  Except you actually are a troll, as clearly evidenced by the fact that you consistently support idiotic things like a law that would make it a crime to fail to report a gun within an extremely short period of time.  Such laws, with no history of demonstrating measurable or significant decreases in violence, and being unenforceable against violent criminals who will simply flaunt it, serves only to act as a way to harass citizens who are only guilty of exercising a civil right.  Of course, if you actually aren't an anti-gun troll, you're certainly welcome to post links to demonstrate otherwise.  In conclusion, someone here *is* furiously jerking off, but it sure isn't me.      I can't see how this is "anti-gun", exactly, but  You leave town on vacation for two weeks. Unbeknownst to you, a criminal breaks into your home, compromises your safe and steals your guns on the first night you're out of town.   You don't find out the guns are missing until after you return from your vacation, and upon reporting the stolen firearms to the police, you are arrested for failing to report the guns stolen within the 72 hour time frame.   That is just the most obvious example of how such a law is clearly meant to harass and entrap legal gun owners.   Your inability to see the inherent and obvious problems with such a law shows that you're clearly one of two things; an anti gun troll, or a blithering dipshit of the first order*.  *Or perhaps that choice is an illusion and I'm simply repeating myself.

My son, when 11 years of age, could not avoid pointing a torch into the eyes of those around him.

GrC?   People still read that sub?   I mean, people other than Towely and his collection of sock puppets.       What's hilarious is that he exactly went on a mid-level rant where the whole subject was how he was sooooo much smarter than me.   Frankly, I really think that CE, and his other sock puppet accounts are a compelling argument for tighter moderation of the sub.   It's clear that these people aren't interested in honest discussion, so there's no need to give them a free place to roam.    Mmmm, Eric, your tears of sadness are so yummy and sweet!    Sample size of two.   That's good science work, Lou!   IPSC. He was the son of a high-level competition shooter in a nation in the pacific rim.    Frankly, it's a sad reflection on who combat effective is as a person.  His posting history reveals him to be a wildly self-involved graboid with a superiority complex and a short temper, but then he thinks he can come in here and preach to all of us dumb ol' knuckle dragging retards about lead safety.   What's hilarious is that he actually expects us to believe that his act actually comes from a place of sincere concern.   For that reason, I hope he never goes away, because his ham-fisted attempts to outsmart a group of people he consistently underestimates is deeply funny.    Did you even read the article you posted?  They clearly stated that the people involved were not following proper lead mitigation protocols and that the range in question was poorly ventilated.   Perhaps if you're so concerned about these issues, you ought to do something about it, like volunteer at a local range with lead cleanup duties, teach a course on proper hygiene, or financially support the upgrade of ranges to use better ventilation and filtration systems.   Aww, look at you. Trying to push an agenda while wrapping yourself in a snuggly, warm blanket with "for the children" emblazoned on it.  Lead exposure from shooting is easy to mitigate by shooting at an outdoor range, or an indoor range with OSHA-compliant ventilation.  Other than that, following basic hygiene principles like washing your hands and refraining from eating while at the range will easily reduce lead exposure to safe levels.  Of course, if you've got proof of an epidemic of lead poisoning occurring among shooters involved with various junior programs, I'd certainly like to see it.   You mean the stats that show the use of guns for self defense far outweighs their use for crime?   Already did.    This link is relevant to your confusion.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSEzGDzZ1dY   If you repeat a big lie often enough, people will believe it.   Shhhh. The grown ups are talking, dearie.    Then why do you want to make people less safe by disarming them, therefore putting them in danger of being victimized?   I think we should just ban the flame throwers that use Dilithium Crystals.    If they want to waste time passing bans on guns that can be categorized as imaginary, I'm all for it.   Frankly, I think the time has come for us to also pass bans on guns that have been imbued with magical powers.   After all, no decent citizen needs a gun imbued with the powers of Satan.    The interesting thing in the comparison between guns and cars is that far more people die in car accidents than are killed with a gun.   If we take at face value the argument that guns are meant for killing, but cars aren't, shouldn't we be actually far *more* concerned that more people die from a machine that isn't meant to kill than from one that is?    Evidently Adam Baldwin is the one who coined the phrase.    You don't know that, and its always a numbers game. Again, when the NRA throws their weight behind a politician who has a less than stellar record on guns, they're essentially engaging in influence buying.  It's not going to work 100% of the time, but it will work far more often than supporting the ideological politician who is 100% progun, but who has little chance of actually winning.  In the case of a Romney presidency, even assuming Romney would have signed a new AWB, you can be sure that the same strategy would be applied on down the line from the most senior Republican senator to the most junior freshman Republican House Rep.  From a strategic standpoint, it will always be in the interest of the NRA to participate in political races and to back the most likely winners.  The game is the game.   This really does apply, given the shameful lack of funding for fusion research.   Thanks for illustrating my point far better than I ever could have.  Have an upvote!  Cheers!   The NRA is going to support the candidate who is 1.) Most likely to win. 2.) Support gun rights.  Romney was and is anti-gun, but there's a strategy to the NRA's support for him. The NRA has a lot of money to buy ads that are favorable to a candidate like Romney. They're also able to turn out a significant number of highly engaged voters during election time.  So, let's imagine if the election had turned out differently and Romney had actually beaten Obama:  A guy like Romney may be an outright psychopath and a gun grabber, but he's not stupid. Once the election is won, all of those millions of dollars in ad buys and millions of NRA votes are accounted for.  When a gun control law ends up on the President's desk, the NRA is going to have a little conversation along the lines of "Hey, Mitt, remember all those commercials we ran for you, and positive coverage we gave to you in our media outlets, and all of the NRA members who showed up at the polls for you? Well, we did you a solid, and now it's your turn to do us a solid and veto that bill."  Even though a guy like Romney doesn't care about gun rights or gun owners, all of the support given to him by the NRA makes for a compelling reason to veto any bills the NRA doesn't like.  And of course, there's always the implied threat. "Hey, Mitt, we supported you when you needed us, if you don't do the same, well, we'll make sure you can't win the next primary."  So, from that standpoint, it's much more advantageous for the NRA to strategically support candidates who are likely to win, even if they aren't the perfect pro-gun candidate, because their support buys a lot of influence and clout, and even if that candidate isn't a fan of gun rights, he's well aware of the fact that NRA support makes it easier for him to win elections.  TL;DR: It's better to support a winner you can negotiate with, than a loser who's completely on your side.      Then why do they never differentiate between lawful gun owners and criminals when drafting gun control laws?   It's either as I describe, or, the only other option is that leftists are so utterly narcissistic that they actually believe they are likely to be victimized by lawful gun owners and feel the need to preemptively disarm them.   One wonders what sort of things the left is up to if they subscribe to a paranoid belief that their behavior could get them shot by a mild-mannered non-criminal citizen.       tl;dr: Progressive ideology is rooted in tearing down old institutions and reshaping society in new and novel ways. Progressives hate gun ownership because it represents longstanding traditions, and your responsible gun handling will not dissuade them from hating you. Progressives are willing to cover for extremist Islam because it's new and novel to them, and the fact that it's non-western automatically makes it better than modern western civilization.  As a result, leftists will happily act as ambassadors for extreme Islam because it's new and novel, but will never, ever willingly acknowledge that there are positives to gun ownership because it's old and western.  ----------------------  "Progressives" will always hate gun owners, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with your safe gun handling and everything to do with the philosophical underpinnings of liberal ideology, many of which are informed by the ideals of Marxism (during much of the early 20th century) and Postmodernism (late 20th century to now).  Left wing philosophy is fundamentally built on the notion that those things which have existed in society for long periods of time are fundamentally flawed, and must be torn down and done away with to make way for ideas, laws, and culture that are novel and new.  Among progressives, an understanding of history or *why* things have been done a certain way is unimportant. What the philosophy boils down to is "new is always better."  You can see this in nearly all forms of left-wing thinking, from economics (tear down capitalism) to feminism (tear down "the patriarchy") to environmentalism (tear down modern society) and on and on. Note that the outcomes from many of these changes aren't necessarily bad in and of themselves.  As such, gun owners are representative of a longstanding civil rights tradition that is deeply intertwined with the founding of the country. As such, civil rights, as embodied by the Bill of Rights, are completely anathema to the ideals of progressivism, and given that gun rights are steeped in traditions that are embedded into the founding of this nation, the average progressive has nothing but loathing for anyone who chooses to own a gun, and outright hatred for those who choose to do so for reasons that they don't personally approve of. The fact that you are responsible with your firearms *just simply doesn't matter to them because what they hate is the fact that guns are a very old school representation of a society they want to change in fundamental ways.*  So, in a nutshell, this is why leftists fundamentally oppose gun ownership and will never, ever recognize or care about the 99.995% of all gun owners are safe and responsible.  So what about the left's apologist stance regarding Islamism?  Well, if your default philosophical outlook is informed by the Postmodernist belief that your entire society is wrong about pretty much everything all of the time, and Multiculturalism has trained you to believe that all societies are equal, and that you, as a westerner, cannot possess the ability to reasonably articulate or even form valid criticism of other cultures, it becomes very easy for you to look outside of your own culture to find novel ways to inform your motives for implementing change in your society. (Remember, Progressive ideology is founded on novelty-seeking behavior and largely assumes that new = good and old/established = bad.)  Criticism of Islamism is a perfect example of where modern leftist ideology goes astray. In Islamism, you have a culture that is deeply rooted in beliefs that are brutally violent, horrendously racist and misogynistic, deeply subservient to religious authority, and aggressively willing to stamp out open inquiry and reason. Despite all of these plainly obvious drawbacks, Progressives will refuse to criticize, or in many cases, even acknowledge these problems because extremist Multicultural ideals have conditioned them to believe that criticizing other cultures is racist or can only flow from a place of western ignorance.  Because Islamism is foreign and strange to a westerner, it has the appearance of being novel and new to progressives, and since new always = better, you end up in a situation where supposedly forward-thinking intellectual types willingly act as apologists for a brutally violent and backward ideology.   $1 million/per year is couch cushion change to the DoD.   If there were any legitimacy to psychic phenomena for military intelligence applications, there would be zero need to spend trillions of dollars on drones, spy satellites, clandestine operations, and cyber warfare.  As it is, in the 1970s and 1980s, the DoD threw a paltry sum of money at at a few "free thinkers" just in case they were on to something.  They weren't.

It gets included in a lot of workout supplements because it has some ability to mitigate "the burn" felt from intense exercise.  It's notable that the article doesn't mention the downsides to taking baking soda, which can politely be described as gastrointestinal distress, or more graphically described as inducing diarrhea and vomiting.  It can also cause problems for people with hypertension or those prone to panic attacks.  I suppose its something that might conceivably be used as part of a cancer treatment, if acidosis is a symptom or side effect of cancer or chemotherapy, but that's speculation on my part, and the author's claims that it's some kind of miracle cure are downright criminal.  If you're bored and want to read up on baking soda, then go here for all the fun you can possibly handle:  http://examine.com/supplements/Sodium+Bicarbonate/   To be fair, you did ask him to prove a negative, which is impossible.

I know it sounds kind of douchey, but can we get a TL;DR?  What do phytochemicals do?   The Makarov is a pistol that utilizes a straight blowback design to cycle the gun.  As a result of the design, there are no Makarovs that use 9x19mm as the cartridge generates too much pressure to safely use a straight blowback operating system. Also, despite the fact that both 9x18 Makarov and 9x19mm are ostensibly 9mm cartridges, there actually is a difference in the diameter of the bullets (.365 caliber vs. .355 caliber.)  Years ago, I read a magazine article where they attempted to fire 9x19mm through a Makarov with some unpleasant side effects, including a tremendous amount of felt recoil and the brass being battered to death. The authors explicitly stated that shooting 9x19 in a Makarov was a bad idea.  There were a number of Maks that were made to fire .380ACP, however, and these can sometimes be found on the secondary market.   But it isn't and you're the only person who cares to argue that something that doesn't actually reduce noise should be regulated as a suppressor.  :-(   And yet, despite the fact that you like to tell people just how very, very smart you are, you're  evidently incapable of telling the difference between something that could be made into a suppressor (by filing the right paperwork and ordering the parts) and an actual suppressor.  Hint: an actual suppressor measurably reduces the sound signature of a firearm.   You obviously know nothing about firearms because the difference between a muzzle brake and a suppressor is about the same as the difference between Carbon and Sarin.   Yeah, I only took the sodium bicarbonate the one time. The results were unpleasant enough that I'm not going to do that again.  For awhile I was wondering if the Yohimbine or the EGCG were causing me nausea in the morning. I've cycled off of the Yohimbine for a couple of weeks, and have noticed that I'll get nausea from the EGCG, but only on an empty stomach. If I drink a protein shake or eat a spoonful or two of peanut butter, I feel fine.   When they can't go after guns directly, they go after magazines, ammunition, ranges and training.   Biden seems to do a fine job of shooting himself in the foot with alarming regularity, and he doesn't even need a gun.   According to Wikipedia, the molecular formula for Sarin is C4H10FO2P.  If you want to ban the chemical precursors of Sarin nerve gas, you're going to have to throw everyone in jail who has in their possession any of the following: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, flourine, or phosphorous.  Given that all humans are carbon-based life forms, that right there should be enough to trip your "imprison anyone with a precursor for Sarin" law.  God forbid they want to drink a glass of water. The average glass of water has both Hydrogen and Oxygen, and in many places, Flouride (an anion of Flourine.) In your world, you'd be calling out the bomb disposal squad and breathless media reporters every time anyone got the least bit parched.  Of course, I guess you'll have to throw all farmers in jail, since Phosphorus is a common ingredient in fertilizer, to say nothing of it's myriad industrial applications, and the fact that it's present in practically all matches.

I realize that you're an idiot, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't project your stupidity on me.  Of course there are forms of rape that don't involve direct physical violence or the threat of violence; drugging someone or taking advantage of someone who's drunk themselves into a stupor are clearly two examples of this.  But you must be completely touched in the head if you think that you can change the behavior of the kind of psychopath who'd rape a blackout drunk college coed by forcing them to sit through a 60-slide Power Point presentation that outlines the do's and don'ts of when it's ok to stick your dick in someone.  The kind of morals that will prevent someone from taking advantage of another person in such a situation get laid down and reinforced in childhood. Of course, leftist idiots in this country have done everything they can to disassemble the notion of instilling morals and ethical behavior into children, and then they get all butthurt 20 years later when their idiotic methodologies lead to 20-something dudebros who don't have any ethical problems with rape.  Of course, that's all fine and dandy so long as someone can get a financial grant to go out and show the aforementioned slide deck to the aforementioned dudebros, isn't it?   Who are the people who think you need to attend a class to learn that rape is bad?  Seriously, what the fuck have you been smoking?   If you don't know that you shouldn't assault someone, sexually or otherwise, by the time you've reached adulthood, you deserve to get shot for trying to initiate violence against someone.   Jesus, the whole "we need to teach men not to rape", like you're trying to housebreak a particularly recalcitrant puppy, line of thinking is not only idiotic, it's an insult to the intelligence of all upstanding and moral men and women everywhere.       His problem is that he was able to build a fairly broad base of support as a folksy moderate Democrat who was pro-business and pro-energy development.  Even the most partisan tea party types grudgingly tolerated him.  It's been all down hill for him since the gun thing started, and his actions regarding the Nathan Dunlop case, lying to the sheriffs, and backtracking on legalizing weed haven't won him any friends.  His problem seems to be that he's trying to please DNC political party bosses to cement his next political career move, and in the process he's managed to piss off everyone from gun owners and law enforcement to pot heads and environmentalists.  Now that people are out to play political hardball because they no longer view Hick favorably, he doesn't know what to do, and his poor choices continue to compound.         When they can't go after guns directly, they go after ranges, ammunition, and training.       If you take the "no compromise" stance, you'll never win even a partial victory.   The FOPA was pretty much the only 2nd Amendment victory from the Reconstruction era until 2004, and without it, you would be unable to order bulk ammo online, purchase ammo art a retail shop without signing a registry, buy long guns in adjoining states, or have legal protections when traveling with firearms.   FOPA also managed to reign in some of the more egregious behaviors of the ATF as well.    The 86 ban was tacked on by a NJ Democrat to The Firearms Owner Protection Act late at night via a super shady voice vote.   It was signed into law because the rest of FOPA had some really necessary legislation in it, and they would have had to throw the whole thing out over the MG cap.    Shonda Rhimes makes shit tv shows, and it doesn't surprise me that she'd try to push a political belief on her viewers.      Once upon a time, I thought that the NRA's rhetoric was harsh and inflammatory.   Turns out I was wrong.  What's actually harsh and inflammatory is the mainstream media's reaction to anything the NRA says or does, no matter how benign.   Frankly, now, when I see some idiot having a public freak out about the NRA, it just makes me chuckle.   All it does is show that the NRA lives rent-free in the heads of these hateful bigots.            Clearly we must ban knowledge of machining techniques and use of tools.   For the children.    You heard right.    From all of the times gun control advocates have tried to shut down training courses held at commercial venues, attempted to have instructors thrown out simply for being NRA-certified, and your movement's attempt to have shooting ranges closed down for completely asinine reasons.    LOL!    Wired is owned by Conde Naste, a publishing conglomerate out of NYC.   What else would you expect?

 Haters gonna hate and anus gonna ain't.   "So I was sitting in my cubicle today, and I realized, ever since I started working, every single day of my life has been worse than the day before it.

Just go through the initial first draft. Once you're done,Then you defy and critisize every word. Comb through the pages, don't just look for cliches, look for plot holes, hanging story lines, out of character actions or words, etc.    Well, done. You know how to make a story.   It could be a love story of a slow car that can never quite catch up to the car it loves.   Why do you think that way?   I didn't say "to despite".    Why?      I try to understand, I do. Whenever, your point is lost because you are trying to pick a fight with me. I am only and just trying to connect with people over social media and you stand in the way like a deer in a stream. Please, I cannot even pronounce your username.    If you were rooting for the mountain, that was a nail biter of a fight.      That doesn't despite the fact that I never said "to win".

Video was good, would improve by editing the cuts with the music more. Just my opinion.   Ahh!....Was not disappointed.   The simple act of teaching your kids to understand how broke you are prevents being embarrassed in front of multiple people.   Something something Jet Li.   Noob here :) : Points?   that's an inhumane way to kill someone.   Cue the 2001 music.   I would love to see an office space type comedy with Edward Norton and Alan Ruck where they are cubicle best friends... with Kevin Spacey as their boss.      I'm waiting for the story to kick in, then the characters notice the camera and I'm like, "no, I'm supposed to be invisible."   The Kiefer   I have a predisposition for 1 word titles, It's  up to you what type of writer you'll be. If you find yourself truly lost You can name it after the protagonist. Or scan through for a conversation or object of interest, i.E. The music box.                                                                                 The little girl is just a grown midget murderer.   Whereabouts are ya?   Scripts, especially award nominated scripts. I always refer to scripts for reference on formatting or I'll wonder how a writer visualized a particular scene. What's fun to do is reading a scene and watching the finished product. Very inspiring to watch.    Yeah, I couldn't wait for the pig sex.   Citizen Kane is my go-to.      It's actually, "I am a leaf on the wind. Watch.. "-*Thunk*   why?

Check with your university to see if they've got equipment they can loan out.   Scheduled, I love that I trust science to predict the Apocalypse more than religions.   It always comes back to him?   (Just my opinion.)   I like the idea. The execution faltered a bit. If you wanna take comedy serious, from what I can tell, you have to be consistent. Always be funny and everyone treats the situation seriously. The main character did well to keep a straight face but the secondary didn't. (Just my opinion.)   I wasn't laughing. The whole time I was waiting for the other shoe to drop but it never did. By the end I was like, oh he's just a dick. That's the joke? (Just my opinion.)  I would've had some comic relief to bring balance to his brashness. Like a fat mentor who can't keep up with perps and tells the intern not to run faster. (Just my opinion.)    I'm not trying to discourage you at all. I would never do that. You frame your shots well and you clearly have a drive to entertain and that's wonderful. Also keep in mind that comedy is the hardest challenge to tackle because it's so subjective.   Hey, Miami!....oh, right. :(   [So many unpaid extras!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FG0fTKAqZ5g)   :o    There's a shot of the sniper character, in the background a person walks from left to right, that was accidental, no?   From what I've gathered in this sub so far, the general consensus to beginners is: find a camera and start filming.   What you could do is engineer a memory for yourself. Take a very slow walk around your block, don't create any distractions for yourself and absorb as much as possible. Go back home and write down what you remember, focus on what stuck out to you and ask yourself why that specifically.   Now remember, films only access sight and sound. It is up to you as a filmmaker to recreate the emotions of memories using only those two senses. Be creative, I challenge you to experiment and come up with something no one else has.   P.S. don't try to crowbar in other senses with dialogue such as "oh this is delicious" or "it smells wonderful in this park."  P.P.S. Smell-o-vision was a thing, did not catch on.   In the behind the scenes footage the crew explain that this trap is very simple to get out of by pushing up the "cuff" of the trap hand, but when both hands are in you need to wait for someone to do it for you or you're fucked.   2 birds with 1 TB.   The Toynbee Tiles.    Watched the whole thing. Having never seen it before, thank you.   Nice, really enjoyed it.   This [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d_jQycdQGo)?   What's wrong with your current viewfinder? Just curious.   Working on it!   My phone records low def and runs out of memory about 10 seconds in.   Well, what's to your liking?   oh man, that sounds cringe worthy. I'm sorry but, hey, live and learn.   Boy meets girl, they bring out the rebel in each other?   In other words, don't write your character into a hole where they can find a shovel.   I'm curious if there's a general ratio of 1st drafts and rewrites. How much more time should be taken into perfecting a story?   It looks like Martin luther king Jr. is reluctantly teaming up with Kim Jong Un to take down space racists...plus 50 shades.    Do you have other films?   Writing question: For shorts 1-5 minutes in length do you guys tend to make scripts for it? I was wondering how much pre-production goes into these.    Also, is there a recommended time for writing?   For example: 1st draft (1-4 months)   That was nice, I bet it would've looked funny to the neighborhood when you were filming.     "Kids these days."   I wouldve link if i was on PC.   Goes by Ponysmasher   I didn't even think about that!   Where's the trailer?   Just saw it. The plot could have been a little tighter, the "dad" person James would go into didn't lead anywhere, whereas the "homeless" and "business" persons were not only congruent but also simultaneous. That and the punching sound effect at the beginning.was a bit jarring and took me out for a second.    Aside from that I was entertained throughout, and I was eager to see how it would end. Fortunately, you guys didn't make the common mistake other filmmakers make where the concept is drawn out and makes you lose interest. In this case, you took a good amount of time to set up your characters and tell your story. Kudos.   do you remember a particular moment or you just eased into what you're doing now? was it what you wanted to do before?   Wanna go traveling?   Thank you, I really didn't know. Have an upvote.   1) All I ever read about are festivals, where can I look up markets in my area? Which of the two are better for networking?   2) I've never made a film before, how should I go about funding my first flick?   3) What's a one sheet?   4) For each level of funding, what type of film qualifies? For example, a tiny 20 minute film about jogging. Would that qualify for pre sales?  5) I know I'll sound like a 1800's era gentleman but on the funding side, who do I see about these things?      What's this meme?   I'm trying to pool together the cash, was looking for a workable timeframe. Thanks, I hope I beat the clock.   Could you be a bit specific about funding? Then a general overview of marketing? Also don't know the difference between festivals and markets.   Where?   Can you elaborate  on funding and  marketing ?   How much longer will the G6 be on sale?   That's the point isn't it? The show is written to be incredibly plausible, in my opinion. Except for the last two episodes.   Black Mirror   "In the arms of an angel..." *must adopt every dog.*   Donate to the European Union, it'd help stabilize the Euro. Additionally, Europe would be confident in pursuing more sanctions against Russia if necessary.   The "Cops" series should be a game.   [Why](http://youtu.be/oulbBdmGH8o).   No.  	109
    As a criminal defense attorney I think this goes both ways. Whenever there is any type of forensic evidence the jurors think, because of these shows, that it is unquestionably accurate and impossible to overcome. I then have the responsibility to try to climb that mountain by poking holes in the prosecution's experts and/or providing my own experts. What ends up happening is I have to convince a bored jury, with preconceived notions, of the flaws in the methods, etc. No matter how many times a judge instructs the jury that I have no burden whenever forensic evidence is presented it is as if the burden automatically shifted. I also really hate these shows for perpetuating the myth of "legal technicalities" and for other things like if you aren't read your Miranda rights that your case is automatically dismissed. It is infuriating.            I strongly disagree with you. There is a significant difference. The video is a duplication of the original. The prosecutor and police had the same ability to get a copy but did not do their due diligence. The defense attorney is not required to provide evidence to convict his client to the prosecutor. In fact, it would be malpractice to do so. Even in the murder weapon example you use the attorney would have to turn over the weapon but could not say how he came into possession of it. To not turn it over would be to hide the evidence since it is the original and only version. Here, the defense attorney never had the original, did not destroy the original, and is entitled to refuse to turn over a copy of his copy.      Just for future reference there is a closer prison and it is not a federal prison. The Manhattan Detention Complex, commonly referred to as [The Tombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tombs), is located at 125 White Street which is right next to the criminal court.                     While I feel your post is insulting by inferring that I am not a good lawyer, I have decided to answer you because, besides the presentation of your questions, your questions are valid. I do not at any time during my representation of client, no matter the client, want them to get any less than the best possible outcome. If at any time that I continue to represent them and I change that outlook I cannot possibly give them the best available defense because I would have to actively work against my own personal view. How can I possibly give my defense of client all I can if at the same time I want them to be convicted? I anticipate that you will claim that this is my inability to make "mental distinctions" but I think you are kidding yourself if you think anyone can under those circumstances.  You said "This does not mean that in my capacity as a defense attorney I should let my suspicion of the client's wrongdoing lead me to botch his or her defense, but were I a lawyer, my existence could be justified only on the basis that I am firmly and fully committed to the idea that justice should prevail" I strongly believe, as do most defense attorneys that I have discussed these issues with, that justice can only prevail if I fight my hardest within the boundaries of the law regardless of the circumstances. It is the role of the jury and/or judge (depending on the case and jurisdiction) to determine guilt or innocence (not guilt). To want anyone to be convicted would distort my role and usurp their roles.  You seem to be under the impression that I do not think anyone deserves prison or to be convicted. I am well aware that some of my clients got the exact punishment they deserve but that is not something I contemplate until I no longer represent them. The only judgments I make of my client while I represent them are the ones that are necessary to provide the best defense. Examples include judging the chances of a successful trial or how he/she may appear if he/she testifies or does not testify.  I would also like to point out, as you have admitted, you are not a lawyer. You cannot fully understand what it is actually like in these situations without having the personal experience. It is easy to tell me what I should or should not do without having to do it yourself. I'd love to see you look a client in the eye, someone who you were assigned to represent, someone who does not know you, does not trust you, and the public and a giant government system have already found guilty pretrial, and tell him/her that you will do everything that is within your capacity to defend them while in the back of your head you hope the justice system convicts him/her.   I am a criminal defense attorney. I have never wanted any of my clients to be committed no matter how guilty he/she may be and no matter how serious the crime alleged. Any attorneys that want their clients convicted should not being representing those clients. It is my job to represent my client to the best of my ability regardless of the crime alleged. Once you forget that it is time for you to retire or change practices. We are an essential part of the justice system and it is important that we uphold our clients' constitutional rights. We have incredible weights on our shoulders; the system would be an even bigger failure if we acted in any other fashion.     	17

 $31 a box on their website, but if I have to start reloading maybe a grendel isn't the round for me   I'd love to get into a grendel. Any tips for that? Reloading a must?   Honestly I think you can get new Core M4s for in the neighborhood of $600. Another prolly $100 in the shitty bushnell scope. All the other stuff has been traded around one way or another so I couldn't really say   God damn I guess you do lol   Core M-4 with a bushmaster varminter 20" fluted barrel I traded my m4 profile for, recycled A2 handguard and stainless railed gas block from an AR-10, green A2 stock and rifle buffer I traded a CTR for and a hogue grip a buddy wasn't using anymore. Cheapest ammo I can find. My folks were generous and got me the Monarch 3 binos for xmas. Gotta love college.       I loved the JP brake I had on my model 700 .308. I can't speak for the person sitting next to me, but let me just say with the large frame model from JP it felt like shooting .223.

 Actually I keep hearing this and it wouldn't matter his age if Charles died and he's just impersonating him. The actor will be making an appearance in the 6A finale. It's been confirmed he will be "involved" in the episodes of the finale or close to the finale. Wren will not be. And those that theorize Cece is Charles assume Cece is transgendered and was once a man. The actor who plays Lucas himself stated that would be a great reveal, but he thinks the network would not approve something like that. So if it's not Cece, the other only real suspect to be A, it has to be Lucas.    They thought Wren was A.   woah so charlie pushed marion? woah nice!!!   http://www.bustle.com/articles/86785-is-lucas-charles-dilaurentis-on-pretty-little-liars-that-anagram-may-hold-the-answer-to-the  http://tremolux.tumblr.com/post/112758824180/uber-a-whats-in-a-name  Though i think the person meant big a not uber a   thank you   tell me about it. We shouldn't have to guess this hard!   I thought it was Wren then I said no because Marlene said we saw A in a black hoodie. I though Jason but then we never did see him in a black hoodie and he did look sincere when they revealed charles. I thought Ezra but then, he was there to rescue the girls. Toby was also unavailable because he was at the station. The only ones left are Lucas and Cece. They both were in black hoodies, they both had connections with Jason and they both were absent a lot but still in several episodes of pll   I don't think Wren is Charles if that were the case then. I don't really think someone could fake being a doctor and treat people all within the timespan of 2 years.  	8
    I don't get it. The name of the article you cited is "Russian stocks are a best buy amid global turmoil."  Yes, over the past couple/few weeks Russian stocks have declined. Big deal. The Russian government runs a trade surplus and relies much more on resource extraction than it does its stock market. Given the massive deals with China over the past couple of years -- deals that will take a few years to really kick in and pay off -- the article's headline undermines your point.  I think /u/right-again is dead-on with his analysis. And his #1 assumes that Iran is willing to play Washington's game. Iran has a long history with the US and has many valid reasons not to trust the US. Iran is not immune to economics, but they're also not eager to benefit the US unless the payoff for Iran is *huge.*  And with China being the new, big and growing player on the world's economic stage, I'd say Iran would be much eager to fully embrace China's Eurasian "Silk Road" ideas than Iran would be to do deals that would benefit "the Great Satan" and continue our hegemony over Europe.      Wikileaks revealed documents which outlined the US started a "regime change" operation a couple of years before people started opposing Gaddafi and the US/NATO sought the no-fly zone and started the war.   Benghazi was a symptom of bad intelligence and planning.  Simply karma coming back to bite. Blowback from US skulduggery is common and should be expected.   While possible, I don't think this can be blamed generically on corporations.  To me this is just an example of someone/some people using our plutocratic government to rig laws to make themselves rich. And it would not surprise me at all if the people doing this like to smoke weed (the same concept of some weed dealers opposing legalization) -- it just seems their primary priority is greed rather than justice or the public good.   Clearly the problem is he's not pushing it in hard enough -- just force it. That works on all computers, right?   I hope Responsible Ohio loses. The plan they advocate is *not* "legalization," it's a sham designed to make the political insiders who are awarded the 10 farms to grow marijuana filthy rich.  And home growers have to pay $50 for a license to grow 4 plants? 4 plants is absurd. That means the vast majority of home growers will still be subject to arrest and raids by the police.  This petition should be defeated and die. Ohioans should be demanding *full* legalization or some semi-sensible half-step like Colorado has.   Because it actually doesn't legalize marijuana.  It sets up a limited cartel (or monopoly) to produce weed to generate tax money for the state. The insiders that get one of the 10 allowed farms will become filthy rich.  It allows home growers to grow only 4 plants -- thus making the vast majority of home growers still subject to raids and arrests by local police.  In short, it's an abomination. It's not even a half-step when people should be demanding full, unfettered legalization.   To *deter* China...  Ahh yes, despite having no modern history of being an imperialist country, after centuries of lying low those dastardly Chinese are preparing to *pounce!*  Those petty artificial islands China, Vietnam and the Philippines have been building are the key!  China has no doubt lusted about taking over the Philippines and seizing that key [copra](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/copra?s=t)-producing country.  And Vietnam? Vietnam will be *easy* to take over -- a piece of cake! And just think of all the low-quality, farm-raised fish the Chinese will enjoy then!  Those Chinese are diabolical! Diabolical I tell you!   "In the past our politicians offered us dreams of a better world. Now they promise to protect us from nightmares." -- [BBC](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/3755686.stm) documentary "[The Power of Nightmares](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Power+of+Nightmares)"     The Netherlands aren't the US's puppy  We have a fundamental disagreement right there. *All* NATO countries are US vassal states. We give them the appearance of independence, and we give them the freedom to disagree on various minor issues. But when push comes to shove, NATO countries are satellites -- they follow US orders.  For a recent example, we only have to see the cowardly response to the US' spying on some NATO countries' national leaders. Were those responses the reactions of sovereign, independent countries? Of course not.  If we go back to the 1980s we saw the CIA and its European stooges wage outright terrorist attacks -- bombings and murders -- on our own NATO allies. This was a "[strategy of tension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Gladio#Daniele_Ganser_and_.22Strategy_of_Tension.22)" to push NATO countries to the political right and thus support Reagan's confrontational Cold War arms buildup against the USSR. Just like the vassal states they are, despite finding they were attacked by US, the EU and NATO states did nothing. In this way it's exactly similar to the more recent crimes (kidnappings, torture) committed by the US in the so-called "war on terror" -- European countries do nothing except offer up some nationalistic PR rhetoric.  These are not the actions of independent countries. These are the actions of governments cooperating with the US and offering up nationalistic rhetoric to placate their local populations. In the MH-17 case NATO countries are just creating a PR "echo chamber" to create an appearance of international support for the US narrative.    Whats the goal?  Uh-oh. That's a deep question. Hope you're ready for a long answer. :) I'll try to make it worth reading...  It's the same goal the US has had all through the Cold War, or for that fact, that the British Empire had since the 1850s Crimean War: The breakup and/or *control* of Russia and its economy.  The US has adopted the same view of Russia that the British Empire had -- that Russia is the key to control of Eurasia and that Ukraine is fundamental to Russia. High-level US geo-political/national security strategist [Zbigniew Brzezinski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zbigniew_Brzezinski) outlines this thinking clearly in his famous book "[The Grand Chessboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Chessboard)."  The US government has bluntly stated its goal. For example, US Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Paul Wolfowitz famously wrote in official documents in the 1990s that "Our first objective is to prevent the re-emergence of a new rival, either on the territory of the former Soviet Union or elsewhere, that poses a threat on the order of that posed formerly by the Soviet Union." The US put this into its official doctrine of "full spectrum dominance" and the US Congress openly debated a bill called the "Silk Road Strategy" during the 1990s which advocated that the US establish hegemony in the Caspian Sea and central Asia, replacing centuries of Russian influence there.  When looked at from a geo-political perspective, US actions around the world are clear -- and like I said above, we've bluntly and honestly have stated them. We are seeking to control the entire Middle East and have nothing there but US vassal/client states. Jimmy Carter first laid claim to the Middle East in his late-1970s "Carter Doctrine." Carter was able to bribe and take control of Egypt, but US progress there was slow until we invaded Iraq, the key country in the heart of the Middle East. (These large geo-political strategies typically take decades to implement.)  And we invaded Afghanistan, a required country if we want to get Caspian Sea and central Asian energy supplies out to Pakistani ports, and we started the process of establishing US hegemony in various central Asian *stan countries.  Since as Brzezinski and *many* others have long felt Ukraine is a key to Russia, we poured money into Ukraine to fund dissidents and win people's affections, and we have overthrown the Ukrainian government *twice* in the past 10 years. We don't really care if the new government in Ukraine is backed by neo-Nazis and nationalists, as long as they hate Russians and want to to join the US-western alliance. We'd prefer that Ukraine would be run by liberal neo-democrats, but as we see all over the world, the US government doesn't hesitate to work with outright fascists and dictators.  The bottom line is the US is trying to take over the world. We don't want *independent* countries. We want countries that will follow US orders on major issues. Countries like Russia, Iran, Syria, Venezuela, and now China do not follow US orders sufficiently, so they are demonized and are set up for "regime change" or breakup.  The problem for the US is that many in our government are only semi-competent and that the world is increasingly opposed to US wars and our geo-political skulduggery. Plus -- and this is a *big* plus -- the debt from our wars and our weakening economy puts the US in an increasingly weak position to carry on our global conquests and wars.   "I get the feeling that no matter what the Americans touch, they end up with Libya or Iraq." -- Russian President Vladimir Putin.   Why is it Russian propaganda -- because it does not parrot the narrative coming from the US government? Because the author *dares* to draw an analogy to and remind us of other US government snap judgments and lies to the world? Seriously.  The author is an American, an award-winning journalist who broke key stories about international crimes committed by the Reagan administration. His sources are the typical "unnamed sources" used by most reporting of this type, but his sources seem to be mostly American intelligence sources.  So why exactly are you claiming this is "Russian propaganda"? Because my take on your comment is that you're just smearing the guy with an ad hominem attack simply because he is not sticking to the narrative laid down by the US government and our NATO vassal states.   Chomsky is not some sort of mythical all-knowing demi-god, but sometimes he cuts to the chase and speaks the plain, blunt truth in such a way that shocks us and makes us think we're stupid because we never thought of it that way.  Once upon a time I was a tenure-track compsci professor. That experience thoroughly disgusted me about higher education. Teaching at public and even private schools was *far* more honest and honorable in comparison. In public schools grades are basically honest and may only *sometimes* be based on who your parents are or if the teacher likes you or not. At the post-secondary level, grades revolved around financial aid.  For example, the grade of "D" was essentially eliminated. I had to have a very, very, very good reason to flunk a student. The reason? Because financial aid required the student to maintain a "C" average. Though state institutions and non-profit, the administrations understand who is paying the bills -- the federal government via financial aid. And those non-profit institutions subtly/tactfully changed to reflect the fiscal reality.  What sickened me was to see the system up close. As a veteran, I could not help but to see the analogy to military recruiters/salesmen lying to clueless teens to get them to join the military -- the system was that corrupt and dishonest. It simply is a way of preying on the young and inexperienced.  The system of allowing clueless young college students to rent absurdly expensive off-campus apartments with student loans paying for them was insane. Students routinely got "kickbacks" of student loan money to go on Caribbean vacations -- again, all rolled up on student loans. I knew those students were hanging themselves, but the entire system is corrupt. It seems to me to be designed to make banks rich with risk-free loans via saddling students with debt peonage/bondage. Chomsky's quote offers another angle of discipline.  An aside: When I lived in Germany I was shocked that Germans gave young people an *even* *longer* period of time for paid vacations than older workers. The Germans' thought was that they're young and carefree, they should enjoy life, and there will be plenty of time for them to work their asses off when they're 30-something and have kids. I thought that was a nice attitude.  Here in the US we see things differently. We see young people as clueless and merely as people to screw over and exploit extra hard.   Feel free to copy and post it there if you want.  My guess is that it would be downvoted into oblivion because it (a) goes against mainstream thinking, and (b) raises fundamental/systemic issues of equality and justice.  Seriously, give it a try and see if my guess is right...  **Edit:** And (c) there are a lot of Reddit users from the UK. With UK people indoctrinated from birth to have deference to the monarchy, any question of the legitimacy/logic of the monarchy is akin to asking an American about the legitimacy/necessity of wars waged by the US or the amount of US defense[sic] spending.   Headline translation: "They consistently say things we don't like. So we're plugging our ears and are loudly saying 'Nyah, nyah, nyah' as we try to ignore them. And since we're the WASHINGTON POST, you should do the same thing."   Ignoring the Bellamy salute, for the life of me, I cannot figure out why the British people (and the other nations with royal families) still tolerate having a monarch be officially in charge of their country.  Sure, it might have made sense in the centuries after the Roman Empire fell when the King was the guy with the most lethal army and the people did not have much of a choice in who their leader was.  But in the 21st century?! The idea that some person gets to be the titular "leader" because of raw luck of birth is an insult to the idea of democracy and equality.  Is it celebrity worship that keeps the monarchy in power? (That seems to be why the US corporate mass media is so fascinated by reporting about the "royals".) Is it too many stories about Frozen princesses for children? Like the lottery, a way to keep people distracted and dreaming of a better life?  Seriously, why would people support such an immoral concept in the 21st century?   The 2nd Amendment does *nothing* to stop the government from spying on us or from trashing the Bill of Rights, and it certainly does not help to stop the epidemic of police murders and police brutality that goes on from coast to coast.  If you think that civilians with AR-15s, pistols and hunting rifles can take on the combined might of the US military and police, you're nuts. The 2nd Amendment is doing *nothing* to stop government tyranny -- in fact, it does the opposite.  The 2nd Amendment is what the government uses to justify the militarization and heavily arming of the police. *That* and to ensure we have a sky-high murder rate is the 2nd Amendment's only real purpose.   and make it illegal for cops to carry any sort of firearm. Batons only,   This is the key. We are *long* overdue to disarm the police. No more firearms, no more torture tech toys (e.g. tasers) to inflict punishment on the population. We need to disarm and to decentralize the police.   Just don't call things like this "political assassinations" or imply that it is any sort of political persecution/suppression.  After all, we live in the "land of the free" where we rights and a government "of the people" all that good rot.  /s   It's that way almost everywhere. This is just a sales line urging schools to chase the taillights of the tech industry and to waste a lot of money on new tech toys to "revolutionize education."  Tech companies *love* using this line as it results not only in a never-fulfilled promise of better schools, but in lots and lots of sales to clueless schools who are then distracted from their primary mission and who cannot afford to implement, retrain and support the new technology.  As soon as the next/new superintendent or technology director comes in, the projects are then scrapped and the cycle of buying the "next new high tech system to revolutionize education" starts all over again.  **Edit:** And what is the source of the "study" that reported these "shocking" findings? Some teacher working on their dissertation or doing a thesis project for their master's degree? A government agency perhaps?  No, it's a "study" from a technology company. I'd call the entire article nothing but generic commercial spam.   Is anyone actually surprised by this?  Capitalists own *both* halves of our ruling political duopoly, including Congress *and* the White House.   "And the banks - hard to believe in a time when we're facing a banking crisis that many of the banks created - are still the most powerful lobby on Capitol Hill. And they frankly own the place." -- Illinois Sen. Richard Durbin, May 8, 2009.   Probably?!  Oh, I get it -- you're leaving room for a minor slap on the wrist. Smart call.   A tax break? Wouldn't we apply that $4.5b drop-in-the-bucket to our massive annual budget deficit? Or have we given up on that and decided to just let banksters and the rich take over and we just make Treasury bond payments?    Definition: "US foreign aid": When you take money from the poor people of a rich country and give it to the rich people of a poor country.  Since Israel isn't really a poor country it doesn't completely apply. But you get the gist of it.    There would be no war in Eastern Ukraine if Russia did not invade the country.  My guess is that Russia is supplying weapons and support, volunteers, and perhaps some specialist troops, but it's far from what anyone can call an "invasion". And again, Putin makes a valid point when he says he could easily take over the country if he wanted to.   And if you honestly believe that story about how Crimea was taken over,  Yes, I followed the events pretty closely from multiple sources. Are you saying the Crimean parliament did *not* do those things? Are you saying the Crimean peoples are marching in the streets in opposition to reunification with Russia?  Or are Crimeans *thankful* because they're better off, more free, and they're not going to have to endure the austerity that the EU will now inflict on the Ukrainian people?   and if you honestly think that the US overthrew the Ukrainian government twice (especially in 2004. Dude, are you kidding me?),  As one of our diplomats bragged, we spent $5 *billion* in Ukraine since the 1990s. The US government does not spend that kind of money on nothing.  We have a long history of overthrowing governments all across the world -- we've done it *many* times since WWII. We are *experts* at funding dissidents and protesters, manipulating internal grievances in a country, and overthrowing governments with so-called "colored revolutions." Ukraine's 2 coups just examples of our skulduggery.    The Russian soldiers fighting in Ukraine seem to suggest otherwise.  If there are Russian forces in Ukraine, there's not very many of them. And the act they're doing is to stop Ukraine from slaughtering people in the rebellious eastern provinces.  Putin was correct when he said he could take Ukraine in a couple of weeks if he wanted to. *Obviously* he does not want to.    So did the ones who invaded Crimea.  Crimea wasn't invaded. Let's honestly look at what happened: Crimea tried to become independent in the 1990s but Ukraine refused and instead made Crimea an autonomous republic with their own parliament.  When the US/west overthrew the elected government (the 2nd time in 10 years) of Ukraine last year, the Crimean parliament voted to secede. The Crimean parliament then voted to *re-*join Russia, and then a referendum was held in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans opted to *re-*join Russia.  What is to complain about in the Crimean scenario? That Putin played fast and loose by using Russian troops in Crimea -- troops which were allowed to be in Crimea under a treaty with Ukraine -- to ensure that there was not the same chaos and murder that we saw in Kiev or Odessa?  Crimea has been Russian for longer than Texas has been American. Crimeans opted to re-join a country with a much higher standard of living and a far better social safety net -- from a selfish perspective, the Crimean decision was easy.  Crimeans today enjoy 3 official languages -- Russian, Ukrainian and Tartar. Contrast that to Ukraine. In Ukraine roughly 1/2 of the country speaks Russian in their homes. Yet the only official language in Ukraine is Ukrainian. Why would Crimeans want to go back to being part of poor, bankrupt Ukraine which doesn't allow them the freedom to speak the languages they want to speak?  When looked at objectively, the Russian *reunification* with Crimea was *much* more democratic than the US overthrow of the Hawaiian government and our subsequent takeover of Hawaii.  Since Crimeans seem quite happy about their present situation, who the hell are we to complain about their status?   The article makes good points.  We don't want to admit is that the Obama administration pulled the trigger on a war based on lies and propaganda to overthrow the Libyan dictatorship. The war was just as evil as our war on Iraq.  The key difference is that we did not kill as many people and we did not put thousands of ground troops into Libya -- only a small number to direct air strikes. Most of our ground fighting was done using Muslim fundamentalist proxy forces just like when we allied with Muslim fundamentalists to attack Afghanistan during the Carter and Reagan administrations.  But we "won," right?  We succeeded in overthrowing a dictator and turning the African country with the highest life expectancy into a feuding hellhole. The Libyan people lost -- big-time!  Yay Hillary and Obama! Yay USA! :(   "I get the feeling that no matter what the Americans touch, they end up with Libya or Iraq." -- Russian President Vladimir Putin.   While the condition that no inspectors can be American because of the crimes, spying and skulduggery that American inspectors committed against Iraq during the 1990s is logical, Iran is not stupid. Iran *has* *to* know that to trust Germans or Canadians or other NATO members' inspectors would be foolish. Those countries are our vassal states, and even non-NATO inspectors can be bought off.  Still, since the US forced Iran to accept inspectors, compromises had to be made I suppose.   No country has invaded Ukraine. We've overthrown their elected government a couple of times in the past decade, but no one's invaded them.   He's rich, so it's okay. In the US the rich get to steal from the poor and especially from the government.  Just ask Eric Holder or some of the many banksters that he and the government refused to prosecute.   "Theres class warfare, all right, but its my class, the rich class, thats making war, and were winning." -- Warren Buffett, the 2nd richest man in the world.    are we saying that there is no problem with Russia taking control of parts of Ukraine?  Crimea tried to become independent in the 1990s but Ukraine refused and instead made them an autonomous republic with their own parliament.  When the US/west overthrew the elected government (the 2nd time in 10 years) of Ukraine last year, the Crimean parliament voted to secede. The Crimean parliament then voted to rejoin Russia, and then a referendum was held in which an overwhelming majority of Crimeans opted to *re-*join Russia.  What is to complain about in the Crimean scenario? That Putin played fast and loose by using Russian troops which were allowed to be in Crimea under a treaty with Ukraine to ensure that there was not the same chaos and murder that we saw in Kiev or Odessa?  For Crimeans it was a simple decision. Crimea has been Russian for longer than Texas has been American. Crimeans opted to re-join a country with a much higher standard of living and a far better social safety net -- from a selfish perspective, the Crimean decision was easy.  Crimeans today enjoy 3 official languages -- Russian, Ukrainian and Tartar. Contrast that to Ukraine. In Ukraine roughly 1/2 of the country speaks Russian in their homes. Yet the only official language in Ukraine is Ukrainian.  When looked at objectively, the Russian *reunification* with Crimea was *much* more democratic than the US overthrow of the Hawaiian government and our subsequent takeover of Hawaii.  Since Crimeans seem quite happy about their present situation, who the hell are we to complain about their status?   Well, it seems like it should be in either the Entertainment or the Finance section. Trump seems pretty good at making money off being a celebrity -- Sarah Palin could learn *so* much from him...   The decline of what Americans would call our normal or traditional civil liberties since 9/11 is stark and dramatic.  This has been going on slowly for years, but 9/11 kicked the decline into overdrive. And Americans are protesting/reacting to this change in many seemingly strange ways -- like the guy in this video getting himself arrested.  For example, a huge part of the pro-gun movement is due to the suppression of civil liberties (along with the police brutality and murders that are routine here). Many -- even many Americans -- find it bizarre that one reaction is the "open carry" movement to carry guns everywhere.  I mean really, what would your reaction be to some guy on a street corner in Rotterdam with an assault rifle slung over his back or a pistol strapped to his hip?  Here that is a form of protest against the government's suppression of civil liberties. And I'd also say that a good chunk of the attention given to things like this sub-reddit is also due to the suppression of civil liberties that is going on in addition to the police violence.  We in the US don't have political parties nearly as strong as in Europe, and people here are probably more isolated (belong to fewer clubs or social groups, etc.) so many are groping at different/odd ways to express their outrage at the suppression of civil liberties.    Where I live (Netherlands) I can't leave my house without papers, and we are obliged to be able to identify ourselves at all times.  I'm sorry to hear that.   Is this different in the USA?  Very different, but first some background.  The phrase "Papers please" and asking for a person's papers was used for decades as an illustration of totalitarian or police state rule -- the idea that common citizens were somehow beholden or held some sort of responsibility towards the police, and that the police were above innocent citizens.  For example, in many movies and TV shows Nazis would be seen asking the resistance fighter or innocent person for their papers -- and that was considered a form of tyranny. Anyone over a certain age has seen those sorts of movies and has had the idea ingrained into them. Many in the US still take their civil liberties seriously, despite the bi-partisan moves in recent years to roll them back.  Here in the US (all states? most states?) it is illegal for police to ask someone for ID unless that person committed some form of crime. That's the focus of this video, a guy doing nothing wrong but being asked for his ID and then being wrongfully arrested.   Hey, Ronnie already had a very warm relationship with the Iranians!  That relationship started when him and George committed treason and made the "[October](http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article3862.htm)_[Surprise](https://consortiumnews.com/archive/xfile.html)" deal with Iran to keep the American diplomats held hostage by the Iranians to prevent Carter from freeing them before the election.   How to finish her education?   Student loan debt peonage honey -- you're going to be living in debt like the vast majority of college students do and working for years to pay off banksters...with interest.   "Students who acquire large debts putting themselves through school are unlikely to think about changing society. When you trap people in a system of debt they can't afford the time to think. Tuition fee increases are a disciplinary technique, and by the time students graduate, they are not only laded with debt, but have also internalized the disciplinarian culture. This makes them efficient components of the consumer economy." -- Noam Chomsky.   Terrorism is the new buzzword used to smear people brave enough to respond to US wars and crimes. The core of the issue is that we expect to wage endless wars, slaughter people and attack other countries but to have no one dare to counter-attack and harm US soldiers.  We saw this in the US persecution/prosecution of 15-year old [Omar Khadr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Khadr) fighting in Afghanistan. Khadr was fighting for the Taliban as a low-level grunt soldier long before 9/11. When the US refused the turnover of Osama Bin Laden and instead chose war and to invade Afghanistan, Khadr continued to fight for the Taliban. In a firefight with US Marines he was accused of throwing a hand grenade that killed a US Marine.  Guess what? That's what soldiers do in a war. They shoot at each other and try to blow each other up.  But was Khadr treated like a POW? Or even a "child soldier"? No, we was sent off to be tortured in Gitmo for years.  It's sad that the Marines in Tennessee died. But those Marines are members of a military engaged in unapologetic torture and wars of aggression. Those Marines *volunteered* for that military. As one old book I read said, live by the sword, die by the sword. May those Marines rest in peace -- and may our criminal government end its many wars and stop trying to take over the world.    i think that's part of the definition of terrorism.  No, that's part of the definition of *war.* Soldiers of an army engaged in wars should expect to be shot at and perhaps killed.  This is what we don't seem to get. We want to pretend that our soldiers are some sort of mythical Greek gods and should be immune to harm by others, no matter how many countries we attack or people we slaughter.  We saw this in our attitude about the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon. Sorry, but if we can bomb radio and TV stations in other countries, bomb water treatment plants and factories, etc., etc., and call them "legitimate military targets," then most certainly the Pentagon is a valid target for destruction by others.

 I like how they are going in reverse chronological order starting from their most recent albums all the way to their first.       seconded. Ive seen this a few times and each beer has been super tasty.    Anytime!   Leedle?      thanks for that!  edit: will be driving around to this soundtrack later   Try it out sometime. The beer ended up being very balanced and full bodied. Not to mention very refreshing after a long day at work. Will brew something similar again!   Irish Stout. My favorite beer by far for any season. After months of conditioning, it was so great. Refreshing and tons of flavour.

Contrary to popular belief, there are farms in New Jersey.    That guy must really hate the Orioles   By 'correspondence' I am sure they meant 'bladder'.      M m m m m man ray!

 This is my fear.  I'm sorry, but hang in there xoxo   When I was between 16w and 26w, I would go a day here and there without anything and it would totally freak me out.  A doppler is what really gave me piece of mind, but I know it's not for everyone.  Just relax, I promise it's normal!   Same with me, did progesterone this time and now I'm 32 weeks!  Yay excited for you!   Well, you're not the only one.  When someone mentioned "The Anthem," I still think of their song ["East Coast Anthem."](http://youtu.be/Dx9WnY7DGsM)   How exciting!   Yes exactly, it's about disguising the clips.    Well, yes I agree about the smoking part completely.  I was asking her age because for someone in their late 20's to act invincible or not act like they are pregnant at all is a little surprising.  I know "maternal" instincts are arbitrary.     Thanks guys.  Just so nervous about when labor starts.  Xoxo   See, that is what is weird.  I never thought discharge could be compared to thin liquid, but it totally is.  Sometimes you will get a tiny gush, especially the further you get along.  Well, call him, I'll be thinking of you!  I'm sure it's nothing.   I'm about 32 weeks, just chilling here on my couch and I feel very subtle period - type cramps.  I'm talking, very subtle.  No stomach - tightening, or what has been described as Braxton Hicks.  But it's just freaking me out a little.  Anyone?  Edit: of course I have a typo in my title, lol.   I wish I could be of more help, my Dr told me that whenever I thought it could be fluid to lay on my side, and when I were to switch sides or sit up, I should feel a gush.    Does your Dr have an on-call number?   Take care of yourself.  And take as much time as you need to do it.  Xoxo   Great profile, isn't it exciting?!   How old are you guys, if I may ask?  Maybe once she gets a little further the maternal instincts will kick in.   This is so tough, because no one can make her quit but herself.  :/  As hard as it might be, try to be the positive force around her, instead of being repulsed and obviously annoyed.  Just remind her how important  this life is.  I'm rooting for you!   I like how the show would give real-life examples of micro-expressions and cut away to political figures.  [Crappy, but best trailer I could find for the show.](http://youtu.be/pbOgHa34Ec8)   He lives in Seven Hills.  I was doing a random search of the area on the Henderson website for sex offenders and his house comes up.   Is that the target on horizon and green valley?   Very exciting, good luck!   I was really into this guy,  but I was married at the time.  I told him I had to stop talking to him to see where my marriage was headed.  After I got divorced he was willing to give me a chance, and now we are married with a baby on the way.    I feel very lucky that he still wanted me.    Gorgeous picture!   I feel like I've had that kind of luck on other sites too.  This one just makes me the happiest.   That's a good point.   Absolutely agree.   Dude, you were the one who put    it means any drug really.  Everyone was just trying to tell you it doesn't.  You're just arguing with everyone when you were originally wrong.  I can't speak for anyone else,  I just get annoyed when someone doesn't know how to appreciate constructive criticism.     These people are trying to explain something to you, and you're not willing to see that you're wrong.  You might have always used that term as interchangeable with all drugs, but it's just not.     What is baby center like?   I told everyone that early, lol.  I would only maybe stipulate to them not to tell the world.  It is nice having a close support system if anything didn't go as planned, but it is beyond soul-crushing to relive pain every time you'd have to explain any not-so-good news.  Do what you feel is best :)  But I understand completely that it is hard to contain this news!  Edit: Forgot.  I told everyone before the pee was even dry on the test, so I didn't have a grand or interesting announcement.  But I do wish that I did!  It seems like fun to make it really special.   Oh how exciting!  Love the little hands.   I love this so much.   It just depends on if you're willing to take a small risk.  Pasturizing kills germs so you don't have anything to worry about.    I didn't really take any risks in the first tri, but after all the crucial development, I might let stuff like that slide once in a while.     How do you feel about IPA's?    Just wondering. I like porter, stout, and wheat beers, just hate every IPA I've given a chance to.   That's a cute profile.  The ultrasounds only get more fun, prepare :)  We did one at 14 weeks and she looked just like a tiny baby, we saw her face in 3d, it was so cool.   My god, I know!  I was just thinking the same shit.  From butternut squash to carrot, wtf mate.   My first positive was more faint than that!  I don't really think there are false positives, only false negatives.  You are pregnant, congratulations!    I have seen the article.  What I got from it was that extensive use of ultrasound machine can slightly heat up body tissue and/or form air pockets.    I have had 4 ultrasounds this pregnancy, two were from my Dr, 2 were elective at the boutique - type places.  I'm not a medical professional, but my logic is that if high-risk women get them quite frequently to monitor baby's health, the Dr wouldn't do anything to add harm to baby.    I'm sure some people are excessive,  I wouldn't electively do one twice a week.  But my Dr says they are perfectly safe.   So you're getting real close then!  Thank you.   Seeing another person being genuinely kind.   I feel like I should know this already.  But what does effaced mean?   I have the same one the other poster has!  I loved it, but the same issue as her, it was bulky and no clothes could hide it, unless I had a huge sweatshirt or something loose or big on.    Another thing was, it would stay in place perfectly as long as I was standing or walking, but every time I would get up from sitting down  I'd have to take part of it off and readjust.   But oh man, if you've been having back pain, it helps so much.  Right when I put it on, it relieves pain, I have no idea how it works so great.  I tried putting it on before I read instructions,  and I was so wrong, lol, so be sure to put it on right and it will work for you!   It looks like a very nice bed too.   [Omri Katz.  He was always cool.](http://www.imgur.com/gDtTH4A.png)   Yea after I researched more, it is all connected, it's crazy.  Thanks for the input.   Sprout is cute!  The What to Expect app has gotten really awesome too!   That's exactly what it sounds like.  Well, my car makes the noise when any door opens, I assumed it was connected to the keyless entry system.  It continues a similar amount of time whether the doors are closed soon after or not.  And sometimes it will randomly do it while I'm driving.  So It was really stumping me.  Man, that guy on youtube even explains how to fix it, I wonder if I should attempt that.  But thank you very much!   Just wondering if anyone else has had this problem.  Bought my car new in 2011.  Just recently there has been this annoying clicking noise coming from what sounds like behind the dash.  It starts right when I open my car door, before I even turn the engine on, and lasts from around 10 seconds to 1 min.  [Here is video of sound](http://youtu.be/dLuLGokek-Y)   We are very close due date buddies.  Yes the past few days, it has been happening in the morning.  I was laying in bed the first day and all this acid coming up in my throat was making my mouth water.  Then 10 seconds later I had to run and puke it up,  that's the way it's been for a few days.  Not fun :(   They look for measurements to determine any abnormalities.  I wish I would have known at the time exactly what they measure.  My tech wasn't too vocal, just kept saying everything looks good.    I read online that they measure the femur, if it is shorter than its supposed to be, that could be a marker for downs. They see if a nasal bone is present. Check the lips, for cleft. All limbs in general. My tech looked at the heart a long time, not sure how much they can tell about it on a 2d ultrasound, but they really study the heart.  Those are just things that I wish she would have told me she was looking at so I could know what she was doing.  It was still very fun watching.  Good luck!   I'm almost 29 weeks and mine is still just stretching, not an outtie yet.  But it still feels different and trippy.   If you don't experience a miscarriage,  I don't think you fully understand how earth-shattering it is.  The same goes for experiencing how powerful "triggers" are.    Let the ones you love help you through it and empathize, but don't be upset when other people aren't as gracious.  They aren't being malicious, although it might hurt.  You have to be strong,  it takes a lot of time to feel normal again.       The odds are with you, it's very common to have a mc, but 2 is a lot more rare.  I'll be thinking of you, good luck!   I've experienced one, it's pretty awesome.  The only lack - luster part was the dryer, such a low blowing airflow that it was pointless.  I was still impressed though.   I think it is cold.  They sell really expensive versions that heat up water, and even have a dryer, [it's crazy](http://gizmodo.com/5887473/the-swash-1000-bidet-toilet-seat-review-this-will-change-the-way-you-poop).   Oh yay!  Glad he's here xoxo   [What](http://www.imgur.com/qNa39gw.gif)   It takes my breath away sometimes.  But when she kicks higher, it's fun and very comfortable lol.   I second random pulse being a great description.    Oh god, good luck!   Only if the blinds are *open*.     I've done it 4 times so far this pregnancy!  Those places are great.   I came in here not too interested in making appetizers...  now I want bacon-wrapped dates.  That sounds great.   Great idea!     And his wording on the welcome page.  We share a great-grandfather, makes it sound a lot closer than, it's Abe's great grandfather and my great-great-great-great-great grandfather.    Yea you're right, but the line after says, "What if I say I'm not just another one... (pause)... of your plays?"  So there might be a way to make that work.    I know right, I have had that Grohl pic in my library for a long-ass time, definitely an older pic, but nice gesture to site sources.   [What if I say I'm not like the otters](http://www.imgur.com/yjM43hA.jpeg)   I was so hesitant to listen to more from this band, because I hated "The Dog Days Are Over."    But I love her voice.  So much.    Be strong, one of the preparations for motherhood.  Thoughts and prayers always with you.   I miscarried last year.  I was surprised to see how common it is.  My heart hurts for you, and I know what you're going through.  Just know that the odds are in your favor that it goes smoothly next time.  Having one miscarriage might be common, but more than one actually isn't.     I agree it's not about the gifts, and if you've given them support in the past, they should jump to do the same for you.  :( ::hugs::   I'm so sorry, thoughts and prayers are with you xoxo   Love everything about that room!   Does that cause permanent damage?  How bad is that pain?  I just didn't know it was possible to break a penis.   Well she looks perfect! Xoxo   How far along are you? That's a great shot!  I can't wait to see a good 3D pic of our baby.   Yea, you'd have to do a screen shot or something.  But there are other apps that show the 3D picture week by week.    Fucking [Lights Out](http://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/382194/lights-out-a-terrifying-horror-short-film/)  Any scary movie I've seen in my adult life hasn't scared me as much as this stupid short film.  And I'm pretty embarrassed to say that because all it is is a few jump scares.   You're doing a beautiful thing, and it is nice to see you're passionate about it!    *Well raise the bar why don't you*,  lol.  That's the cutest thing ever!  She's adorable!   My birth plan is: do whatever you need to keep us both alive.    Some people say you shouldn't get one, because if you can't find the heartbeat it would cause more stress.  But I got one when I was 10 weeks,  and I've been able to find it everyday since.  I'm 24 weeks now.      Forgot about that part, ha!    "You want me to *move*?" -Starts dancing in place.   I'm not as far as you yet, but this sounds interesting.  Dying to know what it is.   I have this cute, little, white soft gown that ties at the bottom.  My friend got me a cute dress and cardigan newborn outfit that I love, but I think trying to put all the different pieces on a baby would overwhelm me lol.  I don't have to deal with the low temperatures like you do though. Lol.  But I do think this is the one time we can splurge xoxo   Oh. Good to know,  thank you.   Good one!  So bad now.    The looks on all their faces...     Well, adding to that, you have to pretend you have a squirt gun under your tongue and try to flex the muscles under there.  It really does help me to eat something sour first.   Oh man, this is a good one.  Very beautiful.  My favorite lyric:  "If I had a box just for wishes and dreams that had never come true;  The box would be empty except for the memory of how they were answered by you"   It's possible, like others have said.  When I miscarried,  I didn't bleed for 3 weeks. But be positive, the odds are in your favor!     Are they nice?  Because I want to hug one, now.   Hey now, don't include me in that generalization.    A good hairstylist *or* barber will give a proper, short consultation before they do anything to know how much time you do or don't spend on your hair.   It is cheap though.  I go there for the prices.     I just remember realizing that it takes a minute to catch up to you.  I kept downing shots and wondering why I wasn't getting drunk, then 20 minutes or so later I was so fucked.    Maybe people in /r/funny just want stuff to actually be funny.   That's very heartwarming, actually.    The next part where his black girlfriend calls him ashy is even better.    But the song is called "Still."  I'm sure there are even more songs out there with the lyrics "die motherfucker" in them.   It's the Geto Boys.   It's so depressing to live in the desert where we NEVER get to experience fog.    I guess Fr Elise is better than silence.   I greatly appreciate this despite how fucking done I am with Halloween costumes.    That's the MGM in Las Vegas.    	103
 Wow that's crazy, the dark hair on hair made my boner for her even harder, as a blonde i find her closer to natalie's scale of attractiveness, which is only a few notches below dark-hair emilia.     Damn beauty is in the eye of the beholder...natalie is definitely not as visually pleasing as Emilia, it might be natalie's annoying face.   I actually take very nice videos at festivals, OP probably records vertical.   Used to love Coke, then high-school buddy got diabetes, could only drink Diet Coke, and ever since I became a Diet Coke drinker, I LOVE the taste.  I'm sure there were better ways, but a nice Diet Coke was a great way to keep my ass going to the gym and dieting properly.  I guess I used it as a tiny reward, although I can say anecdotally that Diet Coke probably does more harm to my body than good, it's just what my body tells me.   Doesn't matter if I'm in skinny or chubby mode, Diet Coke all day every day, I'll probably get cancer.   whine much?  i think you just need to git gud.   I had just started watching the lakers, it was fun to see him play, but they never made it over the hump; too young to understand much.  Although something neat happened, I made a pretty stupid move trading away a michael jordan north carolina rookie card for some shiny nick van exel card...   my are you dense.   No way is this guy NVE 2.0.  Doesn't got that swagger, remember Nick the Quick sticking up for young Kobe?  Guy doesn't fuck around, just ask that ref he pummeled.  	8

Thanks   G^O^O^D^B^Y^E   I mentioned below, but I think a taser would be ideal in this situation.  Once he got so close I'm sure the officers adrenaline rose and he literally has to make his one second decision now before either him or his fellow officer get hurt.    They do not know if the guy has a gun and if he had a gun would you want to be holding a taser?   Yes. I think that would be more ideal.  I can't speak for those officers because I honestly wouldn't know what I would do.  I'm sure everything starts happening so fast.  Either way someone died and you can't reverse that.     *There's a smudge on your ring, let me clean it*   No problem   "As officers arrived, the suspect turned towards the officers and started to walk towards them clutching his waistband. He then pulled out a knife ... and told the officers, 'Shoot me now. Kill me now,'" the chief said.  http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/19/us/missouri-police-shooting/index.html   The guy had a knife.   Although I  do agree using non lethal force first, but how close do you let someone get to you with a knife?   I heard he had a knife.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKQtlyKGiaM#t=32   He'll fit perfectly in my pocket.

I zoomed into they eyes n stopped blurring/shifting my eyes n saw 2 sets of eyes.  Next, I went to the lips and did the same thing.   They still kind of blurred, but I think it was from the color of the skin and lips.

After reading everyone's replies I feel as if you don't really need reddit's advice.   Sounds like you have the mindset to dump school n start working full time, so your husband doesn't have to lose time with his kids.

My bike showed up and ended up being sold to someone I know.    Whose family was a lot less fortunate than us.   My dad let the kid keep the bike and he cried tears of joy because of that.

My friend was in a pretty popular punk band and they were on there last tour.  During their concert I was getting drinks for them and walking them back stage as they performed.  The security guy out of no where grabs me on my 3rd pass and tells me I can no longer walk anywhere.  Even when the show was done I could not stay with the band.   Even some of the members would be playing and walk over to the security guy and I next to the stage and ask what the hell was going on.     I never really hold grudges, but the ego tripping security guard in MN was a complete d-bag.    If you are that d-bag security guard and you somehow stumble across  this.

I cannot roll the windows down with the switch inside the car, but if I do the key in the door I can get all windows/sunroof to roll up and down.    The blinkers do not work but the hazard button still does.    Any ideas?   A boner in plane site.     Well there is a whole warehouse where you can buy all the car parts.    So it would be pretty understandable if they just bought everything to make this beast.        Tl dr: lazy ass    Also, to answer your last question about an exit in the basement is to walk outside and look at the exterior of the building for a door. If you can not find a door look for a window that goes to the basement.    Why don't you have the gf call her dad and tell him to go outside.    My first trampoline was inherited from my mom when she was a child.  It was rectangle and I think it had a total of 7 springs.   Every year one spring would rip right through the material.   Even had a hole in middle from cigar burn back in the 80's.     When you jump you would basically touch the ground and the flimsy trampoline would fight to make you bounce.     I miss that thing   Want a $1000 also?    Sometimes my SO will sneak up on me and if I catch her she shrugs her shoulders and make a quick smile. That along with the defeat in her eyes makes me adore her.         Buy a dog n name it Talent   Did anyone else think of ODSTs during this scene and how awesome of a movie that would be.      She  is with the person to the right of her. They tagged these to thinking they were a couple. The guy realizes it right away and fkn kills it.      ...dude   DUDE, DON'T EAT IT!       He has a turd by his leg         I love when someone has that bathroom fan.      At first I thought "suit" as in Batman, but I'm pretty sure it Bacardi    Op is nothing but a bundle of sticks in that big yard   Replace the baby with some shattered bricks.       She is, but I don't think you'll wanna date her.  She is over weight.  Have you ever dated a fatty?    *Carter was here*   What's the girl behind him doing?    I work in a bar and the whole place erupted when he fell in   Storm Pooper    Dude, that site was so fucking Halo.     Unfortunately I feel we would go through a phase of people stealing/breaking these.       Same thing at the place I work.  (also a pizza place)   We have items that can only be used with gluten free meals.   We cannot have any cross contamination.       This is going to get buried, but my cousin drew the genie in Aladdin.  He actually drew a lot of Disney character before he moved to WB.   He worked on movies like Spider-man and video games like NBA streetZ.      My grandma used to have a picture of genie with some nice words in text to my grandma.     I also have some original Drawings and prints.     Some of the movies include.   Osmosis jones  8 crazy nights  The lion king Aladdin   Anyway    Either is spiderman   I didn't read the title and clicked the pic.   I swear I thought the first pic was a safe in the floor.   Went to the second pic and saw it was a PS3 built into the sub floor.    Now I pondered why these ppl hid the ps3.   Or did this person just stumble across it.    This lasted for awhile    Similar story, when I was a wee lad I received one of those earth day baby pine trees.   I planted it right away in my parents from lawn right by this rock, so it wouldn't get mowed over.      Flash forward  12 years, it was 2008 and my parents house was foreclosed on.   It all happened so fast, but we ended moving 20+years of stuff to a rental.      One thing I did leave was that tree I planted.    It was a little bigger than myself.     Time goes by and new ppl have moved into our home and I just try and forget about the whole situation.   Until one day I was going to show my new gf the house.    I told her all about that tree and what it meant to me and I was excited to see hoe much it grew.     Well, the new homeowners cut the bastard down.    Was a sad day that my tree had to leave.     Retape that box dammit    Venoconscrition and vr   I meant more of how can someone else buy these peelers and sell them.     How did he get started?    Just curious on how people stumbled upon something.     Who asked if it was illegal?  Thanks for the insight.    We might have them I just never came across one.      Nice try, ghost Joe    It's true.   I don't play soccer, but would play catch with friends.   Anyway one summer day my younger sister was tormenting me while playing soccer with a friend.      She would run up and throw water or whatever she could find at us and run back up our grassy hill to the pavement steps before entering the wooden door.    Finally I was fed up after she just soaked me from a glass of water.    On her retreat just as she was making her way to the peak of the grassy hill, I kicked the ball towards the house.     The ball was in flight until it hit the side of the hill and started speed rolling right towards her feet.    She took 1 step before that ball went between her legs, and on her opposite leg swing her ankles hugged the ball and her knees buckled.  Slamming her to concrete from a full sprint as the water glass hit the wooden door.    It was awesome   	113

 goosebumps here all over too. wahh...  	1
 It wasn't me! You have no proof.  Wait....what are we talking about again?   How is that milkman?   Never heard of them until this sub but anything in 3mg. Also like seeing you're sending a bottle to a soldier as well.   Testing: Duracell 9V   It's horse meat. A medical journal said it so it must be true.   Sounds like a bunch of unknowns, mixed with a misguided medical journal, and ending on a somewhat positive note.  Also couldn't they find a better pic for it? lol        Oh God I have tears in my eyes. If I could give you more gold I would.   That must have been one hell of a nic fit afterwards.   That's what I started on back in culinary school. I'm so ashamed.   Local news down here in St. Louis had it on. Called it a popular place in the KC area.   It had so much potential but left me very disappointed. Hell the color is just one if many problems.   Oh it is and in the bathroom you can smell the smoker.   It's being recognized so I call this progress.   That would be it.   Thanks and like I said total noob question. lol   Posted   Example pic: http://i.imgur.com/XyoCQkP.jpg   Stupidest idea I've seen because last time I checked the thugs are still using live rounds. Also this is good for one round and surely a cop is going to shoot more than once.   I keep seeing pic after pic of coil builds with this Vaseline looking stuff surrounding them. What is this stuff and what is the purpose of it?   Well until they put you in the friend zone saying Fish are friends not food.   There's a vid around this sub some places of her fucking some Asian guy and she looks like shit. This is also the latest video of her known.   The bone-in smoked pork chops from Iron Barley. If it wasn't in such a shitty neighborhood(had a drug deal go down right in front of me) I'd go get it again.   That he should but sadly common sense is no longer common.   $100 on reached into the fryer.   The way you described it it sounds like a live action ratatouille.   This was the very first kitchen tricks that was passed down to me. One of those things you take and use it/pass it down for life.   Ahh ok thanks.   What juice is that? Label reminds me of froot loops.   Not what I'm asking but thanks for the info.   What the number display in there for if it's not viewable from outside the box?   Don't have kids yet but if I did I would much much rather hear that they're vaping instead of pill popping or drinking.   Has a Men In Black vibe to it.   Player 1 Press Start   Oh damn we hugged it to death.   Same here.   No, he's using the force to make them glow.   Went down the discounted items aisle at the grocery store and they had about 12 pez dispensers all  99 each. These were the only two Star Wars ones they had.      :'( Never Forget!   Barry White      Was it this one: http://www.wltx.com/story/news/2015/02/13/one-person-shot-at-magnolia-mall-in-florence/23389549/   You don't have tell these women to get in the kitchen because they're already there.   We need a banana next to it. Ya know for reference.   Oh whew when I saw finale I thought for good not season finale.   True but Mark is either loved or hated depending on who you ask.   She single???   I might get down voted like hell for this but I have to say #62. I will always remember where I was when the news was announced. I was at Lambert waiting on my brother's plane to land, and when they announced it over the PA system the place erupted in cheers.   With it being a small town I'm thinking funding for upkeep.   3-sided wet stone   Sounds like you got canned on the first night but then again it sounds like he's not sure about it. Shit I'm not even sure about it.   This on a shirt, I need.   Didn't he pull this before during the Extra Life stream?   Go to their page click on show in newsfeed and like a couple of their post. Problem solved.  Also can't look at the name and thinking Shit instead of Chit.   Any update on how the first night went?   In most kitchens cambros are the main storage containers for already prepped foods, stocks, and sauces.   I 2nd Chef Wear on the crazy ass designs.   TIL Warwick owned a great shirt and that there's a website called This Is Not Porn.   The movies are already planned so maybe the scripts are as well thus giving him material to work with.   "In St. Louis County, an ordinance passed in 1999 requires all people who handle, touch or prepare food at businesses such as restaurants, day care centers and schools to be vaccinated against hepatitis A."  Ok not state wide but it is county wide.   I know here in Missouri it"s mandatory that you get a Hep A shot of you're working around food. Thought it was Federal too. My mistake.   Was listening to him this morning and I didn't even know it was his birthday.   My thought exactly and last time I checked it was a federal law that you have to get a hep A shot if you work in a restaurant thus not making this possible.   Saying he has to close if you leave gives me the impression that he has no confidence in the place.   Hell I still remember everything about the Oklahoma city bombing and I was 7 at the time. Same goes for Columbine.   There's always vehicles being broken into up there along with houses. If there's ever a foot chase in Florissant it's usually in that area. Lived here all my life and my family has lived here for 60+. Also having a police scanner helps so I know about most of the stuff Florissant wants swept under the rug.   Trainwreck  Saloon in Westport. Sit back by the dancefloor and you have a great view of just about the whole place.   Max's Meats in Florissant has some good andouliee as does G W(I think that's what it's called.)   This and White Birch in Hazelwood are two great courses.   Make sure your car is clear of personal belongings. Might be a good course but not the safest park in Florissant.   The cocky lil bastards who are still green yet think they know more than you.   Double wrap it first. Plastic wrap and a latex glove works in a pinch too.   Actual country, hard rock, classic rock, and 50s pop/rock.   You working for Amy from Kitchen Nightmare aren't you? lol   Workman comp claim in 3..2..1.   It's called ramen noodles and dollar store.   So... basically you want us to create a burger for you where if it wins you take the credit and we get shafted?   Umm yeeeeeah NO!   You sure said co-owner isn't either 1.) Related or goid friends with "Kevin" or 2.) Getting a kickback for having him on the books?   The usual flatware and plates.   I was thinking more along the lines of Peter Griffin's Who The Hell Cares.   Cut myself on a scale one time in Culinary School. Showed it to the Chef and he looks at me and asks how the fuck do you cut yourself on a scale?   Actually teared up seeing this posted. Even though GO, Let's Build, The Know, and Five Facts were posted earlier for some reason seeing this brought some sense of normalcy to me.   Hit up quizlet and search for servesafe. That should help with the refresher.   Heard it was a very limited run to test them and nothing became of it.   Damn learned something new today.   Great job.   The YouTube video announcing it just disappeared on me. Are they going ahead and doing sponsors only or what?   Feels like somebody punched me in the stomach. RIP Monty   TIL RT has a production truck.   Fried Tuna from a can. Put it in a skillet with no oil and some lemon pepper, cook for a couple minutes, and dump it in two pieces of wonder bread.   Well alright then.   Better hope she's can take a joke. If not better hope she doesn't get a receipt with that on it.   Hobart attachment is perfect for this job but since that's not an option I'd go with the first comment and get something from a hunting store like bass pro or Cabela's.   Great site an cheap as can be if you're a club member, but yeah any grinder from a hunting store is going to be a beast just about.   Most places I've seen have somebody on night shift come in to man the smokers or they have a pellet smoker outside with an automatic hopper.   I'm a 6'3" 375lb man and i'm sitting here in tears over this. Best wishes to Monty, his wife, the rest of his family, and the whole RT crew.   Well it has a mocha like flavor with a roasted coffee aroma so that's why I said it, and I'll be on the lookout for the Imperial Coffee Milk Stout.   Milk Stout Nitro by Left Hand Brewing  It was the first beer I finished a whole six-pack of. Plus it goes great with some chocolate chip cookies.   That awkward moment when you realize the story is worldwide.   Great movie and they need to add Chef and Whites to Netflix bother good shows IMO.   With her annoying ass too bad it didn't bite her tongue off.   ABC's of Death It was by far the worst movie I've ever seen.   Did CHL get a new name or something?   Reading that was like looking at a PowerPoint presentation sans clipart.   I have no clue wtf I just read here.   Hate to break it to ya but a mass majority of that is part of the job. It's a high stress think on your toes job which is why numerous cooks/chefs use drugs and alcohol to relieve said stress. Not saying you should at all but what I'm saying is if you're going to get depressed and pissed about this then maybe this industry isn't the right fit for you.   Thanks for pointing that out. From that it looks to me they found the card on the site and printed it out for themselves.  	108
 You'd definitely be living in the moment if you were hanging on a cliff. Much like the hand being offered, it would feel far sweeter than any hand I had felt before except maybe my kids hands for the first time.   This seemed fitting: A man traveling across a field encountered a tiger. He fled, the tiger after him. Coming to a precipice, he caught hold of the root of a wild vine and swung himself down over the edge. The tiger sniffed at him from above. Trembling, the man looked down to where, far below, another tiger was waiting to eat him. Only the vine sustained him.   Two mice, one white and one black, little by little started to gnaw away the vine. The man saw a luscious strawberry near him. Grasping the vine with one hand, he plucked the strawberry with the other. How sweet it tasted!   Any hand would be sweet when I am ready to fall to my death.   I am a very impatient person, especially on the road. I used to get smoking mad on my drives into work.  I finally redirected my thoughts and said to myself, the traffic you hate so much is actually an excellent opportunity for me to practice patience.  Now when I get frustrated in traffic, I redefine it as an opportunity to practice something I am lacking in.   One of my favorite Zen sayings is "It is useless to show the gold piece to the cat." One of the meanings I get from this quote is how futile it is to try to get others to see things they do not want to see or understand.   Also, there are some people who get their kicks from disturbing, hurting, frustrating, others. They are just not ready for their spiritual journey yet.  Your behavior and actions may give them a point of reference if they hit their spiritual maturity.   I recently read something about religions and Zen.  The article stated that people who follow religions like Christianity, Islam, Judaism need the regimented absolutist view of religion. Everything is fairly well defined and mapped out if you want to reach heaven. It's only as our concept of spirituality and self develop that we can see beyond them and start to appreciate, and even need, growth outside the God-Follower concept.   In other words God is sort of like Santa. While you believe, it all seems so simple. When you dive in though, the act if giving and sharing is about far more than Santa and as long it is framed that way, their ability to see beyond Santa's gifts is difficult.   Regarding this Zen Doctrine of ours, since it was first transmitted, it has never been taught that men should seek for learning or form concepts. "Studying the Way" is just a figure of speech. It is a method of arousing people's interest in the early stages of their development. In fact, the Way is not something which can be studied. Study leads to the retention of concepts and so the Way is entirely misunderstood.   Huang Po   I think our kit bag of sorrows and frustrations allows us to continue to be mired in the past and provides us an excuse for why we are stuck where we are. As long as I can pull something out of my kit bag I carry around to explain my inaction, I have an excuse to maintain the status quo and not push my growth.   It is useless to show the gold piece to a cat.   I use an electric teapot. I put my hot water in a 20oz travel mug and put a strainer on top with my tea. When my tea is ready, I pour some in a ceramic cup to drink. That way my tea in the travel mug stays hot longer. When I travel for work, I fill a thermos with hot water and make my tea before I go on the job site. A good thermos will keep your water hot enough to make tea for many hours. I've gone over 16 hours if I don't open it. Once I remove some water and let cooler air in, it gets cooler much faster. For the most part, I can make tea twice from hot water in a thermos before it gets too cool to make good tea.   If only one side works, you probably have a short in a wire going to that side. See if you can feel a break in the wire.   I got a DBX3 for Christmas one year and I thought it made all my music sound like it was running through a wah wah machine. I returned it and got a TEAC reel to reel and a pair of AKG headphones. They were the best headphones I've ever tried.   And imo Bose makes speakers that mold the sound more than I like. No one would ever confuse them with studio monitors.   Yes, I have a sound card with speaker plugs. I think you need powered speakers or you'll need a powered amp for your computer, as others have said. Your computer does not have an amp to drive speakers.   The best analogy I have heard is comparing it to old .32 dot pitch monitors. Our eyes would blend the pixels to see the image. We do the same thing with digital music. Instead of a curved line, we have a series of steps. Our ears blend those steps into a somewhat smooth wave. But here is where digital loses, the effort required to translate the steps to a wave diminishes the pleasure of the music. They hooked monitors up to people's brains and had them listen to both digital and analog music. The pleasure receptors in the brain were more active with analog music. Like the .32 dot matrix monitors, the image is recognizable, but it is not the same as seeing the original.   Listening to a Marantz tube amp driving Klipschhorn speakers. And for lossless, it was trading concerts through the web. Maintaining the exact copy for the next person in the chain was critical.   Ann Arbor: Teahaus. They have a nice variety of tea, are all fairly knowledgeable and they have a nice tea time. I like their single estate Darjeelings. They used to sell an organic Yunnan gold but since I've started ordering from Yunnan Sourcing, I haven't bought their Chinese teas.   Royal Oak: Goldfish Tea. It's a nice little tea shop off the main street. They have a decent selection of Oolongs and green teas. I get my Jasmine green from them as well as a relatively inexpensive TGY. I actually like their mid grade TGY more than their high grade.    compost   1-Avoid the monsoon season. Google and wiki both have information about seasonal weather around the world. Compare temps, humidity and rain with flight costs by different times and find a match that works best.   2-Fly, ferries have spotty safety records in East Asia. Ha Long Bay is about 2 hours from Hanoi. Book an overnight excursion with a good company. The overnight boat tours are supposed to be excellent.   I've read a lot more now. What you've told me throughout this thread allowed me to know what information I needed to examine in more detail. As well as possibly saving my next receiver or amplifier by not running 4 speakers and overtaxing the system. Now I have to do a cost-benefit comparison for 2 channel vs 5.1 or 7.1. I don't have a use for the other 2 speakers knowing what I know now unless I try to integrate them into a 5.1 or 7.1. Thanks again for all your time and information   btw, I am looking on Amazon because of gift cards, credits through travel cards, etc.   Apparently I was confused about impedance as well. I thought you'd want more efficient speakers if you are running 2 sets.   The additional advantage beyond the problem with the A/B use of going to a 5:1 would be DVD's on TV. I didn't realize the issues I was causing and the lack of benefit I was getting from using the A/B switch with 4 speakers. At least going to a 5:1 system, I would remove the A/B problem. At least now I know what direction to look.   Does Yamaha still make good mid range receivers?   http://www.amazon.com/Yamaha-RX-V477-5-1-Channel-Network-Receiver/dp/B00ILCS11E/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8 qid=1433179705 sr=8-3 keywords=yamaha+5%3A1 is $249 and looks decent. The next levels up appear to add options but not clarity to the sound itself.   There is a Marantz 5:1 http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0081N916M/ref=psdc_14269301_t3_B00ILCS11E for $399 that I may be able to squeeze in budget.  Does Marantz still sound like they did 10+ years ago? It looks very intriguing.   I travel the world by myself for business, and I'm always too worried about getting a doctored drink and end up in just my socks in some alley. I almost did it to myself in Amsterdam but not with a drink. Passing out in a coffeeshop as a tourist, alone, is a bad idea. Oh here, let my get my friend out of here... same end result   Like the blue haired ladies when the Red Cross shows up at work for blood donations. The joy when they actually hit your vein for both you and them.   We're all 18-20 at some time. It's just a matter of having the right partner to keep your incentive up. Come to think of it, that is about the same time I became interested in Zen readings.    I was even more idiotic than that. They have brass connectors between the low and high. If you intend to use both, you are supposed to remove them. As long as the connectors are in place, it didn't matter which set I used. It's amazing what you can make yourself see/hear/taste if you are looking for and expecting a difference. I thought I could hear a difference when I switched them.   So is it a problem to use both A B together on a system with the connections for 2 sets of speakers? Would a 5:1 A/V system add different equalization or tone to the 2 sets of speakers or does a 5:1 work different than I am thinking when playing music from a cd? I guess like a movie, it would need to be mastered for 5:1, 7:1 or something. Does the receiver itself modify the equalization between speakers on a 5:1 A/V system so even on a cd it would equalize the speakers different?   You've really helped me understand a lot of things I was confused about. I've read a lot online but finding that middle ground useful for an avid, but well out of the loop, audiophile of sorts was challenging. We were 4th generation piano players on my Mom's side, so I grew up with live music. I never became much of a player, but I still look for the clarity you get from a live piano, horn, stringed instrument or percussion in stereo's.   I had Nak equipment because I was a collector of concerts and they were traded through the mail on cassettes. I ran a Nak DR-1 and DR-2 for tape to tape recording. Since I wanted the Nak decks, I got the RE-2 as well. It was a marked improvement over this JVC I'm back to using. When we switched to trading concerts in cd's I got an NAD dual cd burner. After about 10 years it quit working and it was 100 bucks to have our local shop open it up and then the cost of repair. I sold it for 50 bucks on craigslist to someone who had confidence it was an easy fix. So then I was back to my 25 year old JVC cd player. It just happens to have the same DAC as their higher end models, so it's a decent player.   Hope that wasn't too long. Just more information for a better idea of both my cluelessness and the sound I grew up with, and try to reproduce.   Edit: for clarity   I just read more detail about the high-low settings and I guess there is a jumper that makes it so I am using both regardless of which ones I have my speakers connected to. I guess I was using them wrong and misunderstood what I read when I got them.   Thank you for your response.   All of my previous integrated amps or receivers had A/B switches for the speakers. It allowed you to run just A, B or A B. I assumed since it had the option of running 4 speakers, it was built to handle 4. I guess I am really confused now about the 4 speaker connectors I've had.   On the back of the B W's there are 2 sets of terminals to connect the speakers. They are labeled Hi Freq and Low Freq. In the owners manual it said something about how it adjusted the frequency setting. I assumed it was more balance to one or the other. Treble/bass. Am I also confused about this?   If I switch to an A/V 5:1 receiver will that make use of the additional speakers without putting them "in parallel"? I have no interest in a sub but I would be open to getting a center channel to bring the 5:1 to use. Thanks again for your advice and information.   I have a narrow room about 16' x 10'. The couch and my computer table is on one long wall and my tv and stereo is on the other long wall. It leaves about 7' between my computer chair or couch and speakers and tv.   The B W's have a high freq and low freq setting. I have the low freq set between waist and chest level next to the tv and the high freq in the corners, pointed towards the center between shoulder and head height. There is about 1' of clearance above the corner speakers. I'm sort of limited in locations and heights.   I ran them in the corners of the room when I was set up using the length, but the furniture layout just didn't work when my wife added her computer table to the room.   The room is fairly bright with wood paneling, tile over concrete, and a drop ceiling. I've added carpets and cloth wall hangings to soften the brightness a little.   Regarding integrated amp vs receiver. It was not money I was hoping to save but getting more bang for the buck. NAD has a couple integrated amps in my price range, but they are set up for only 2 speakers. I have an AB Switch box I could use, but prefer not to.  I've noticed some receivers have DAC's built in so you can run a hard drive to them. I would love to be able to integrate my tb drive to my stereo.   I guess in order of priority is:   1-Ability to work well with existing speakers.   2-Clarity. It's my understanding speakers are usually the weak link in a system. It's a lot easier to get 20-20k and sub 0.01 distortion from from a cd player and receiver than speakers.   3-Price to cost benefit. With bookshelf speakers I don't need a lot of power, but I do want to be able to rattle the picture frames on occasion. I'd much rather have a warm natural sounding system than something like Bose which does more modeling or molding of the sound.   Thanks   Just to start, you recommendation of those JBL's is excellent. Their Studio Monitors are incredibly clean and precise speakers.   My problem/question: My Nakamichi RE-2 died. I'm temporarily forced to use my old JVC POS and I get better sound from my PC now.   I haven't searched for stereo equipment in probably a generation and I'm worried about considering brands that were once high-mid quality, that are now Chinese POS.   I run 4 B W DM-602's and I'm currently using an old JVC CD player with a nice warm DAC that I am satisfied with. It's not a weak link in the system like the receiver is. I do not need a receiver, unless wanting to connect to my TV/DVD player requires one. I don't know if the AM/FM receiver is also used by TV and/or DVD's. I ran an old Nikko integrated amp until I blew a few transistors in it.   Since the added components of a receiver have to cost something, is there any price savings by going straight to an integrated amp?   Are there companies that are worth looking at that I would not have looked at 10 years ago.   I've had decent luck with NAD, Nakamichi, Nikko, Denon and Marantz products in the past. I think NAD and Marantz are out of my budget this time. Any recommendations anyone has will be appreciated.   I'd like to stay under 500US and closer to 300 is even better. My main interest is clarity and the ability to adequately drive my 4 speakers.   I listen to jazz, rock and some folk/bluegrass.   Thanks for your time   He's the Michael Jordan of soccer/futbol. His skills are so amazing, it brings fans to the game. We don't get La Liga games on our cable system but I'll watch any match he plays in when it's available.   I'd like to see him join the Premier League so I can watch him more as they do show those on our cable provider.   I was comparing it to the Enquirer. And I don't really consider tabloids like the Enquirer and Mail as journalism. Just low brow entertainment. Sort of like the sports pages.   Have you seen the National Enquirer?   Irish Breakfast, English Breakfast, something like Twinings Darjeeling (I only say something like Twining because single estate and high end Darjeelings can be pretty mellow), Orange Pekoe, Ceylon are all very tannic and astringent teas like coffee is. They will make a dark, strong tea.   My wife and kids are all coffee drinkers. Most of my friends are too. The Breakfast teas are strong enough and give them the kick they are looking for and can stand up to milk or whatever.    From there my son grew into the more subtle teas. I even have a friend that switched to Yunnan black tea. Like oolongs, their diversity and complexity is amazing. Puerh's are still too earthy for me. I think some tea's are like fine wine or something. It takes an appreciation of the baseline before you can develop an appreciation for the subtleties.   Since it's France, I'm surprised it's not someone's full time government pensioned job to remove tourist locks from bridges.   ;-p   One is the British version of the National Enquirer in the US the other is for news.    I have the Mail linked under entertainment along with reddit and imgur. It's not news, but it is humorous. It's like our National Enquirer. My wife likes it for the stories about actors and fools.   I was expecting something to get shot, broken, imbedded, etc. Turned out a bit more messy than that.   How much pressure was there to avoid pointing fingers in your work? Or if not pressure for where not to look, but where to focus your energy?  Like the oil companies, there is a lot of money riding on the line with these bans, limits, etc and companies like Bayer have huge budgets to create reports, propaganda for the media, testing that gives the results they want, etc. It was almost insulting when BP was making all those commercials, after they poisoned the gulf and destroyed the businesses all up and down the coast, talking about how much they care about the environment and the local communities.   An example; the neonicotinoid's themselves are not necessarily killing the bees. It just affects their ability to orient themselves and to fight parasites and disease. Place the bees in a sterile environment where they are not forced to forage as far for food. Where there are no parasites and no diseases. In that environment, there would be little difference between the baseline hives and sprayed hives. Therefore Bayer proves their chemical does not kill or harm the bees.   There are a lot of distortions about what is causing this because the blame falls on a very powerful industry.  Mites, parasites, illnesses, etc have always been part of caring for beehives.  Now it's like they all have AIDS and cannot fight anything off. Things that may have killed some of the bees are now killing the entire colony.  There are literally hundreds and hundreds of articles about this and like Climate change, some of the information is paid for by the people responsible to whitewash the issue. Neonicotinoid's are the smoking gun. The EU has banned use for 2 years to do comparison studies and the US is considering it.   You are right. I didn't realize it was from Thailand. Oriental Beauty is specific to Taiwan I believe.   Our large Portuguese clay dish that we used for all casseroles that was a Wedding present 30+ years ago. Cheesy potatoes are not the same in the metal dishes and our Corning dishes are not big enough.   It looks like Oriental Beauty Oolong. Bugs munch on the edges of the leaves and it makes the tea have a very rough edge to the leaf. It also discolors it a bit.   https://teacology.files.wordpress.com/2014/10/oriental-beauty-oolong-tea.jpg   Itty bitty strainer. No oolongs for users of this imo.   That yellow tin is Oolong?  The Chinese restaurant we had near work sold a tin that looked like that and it was a very nice oolong for the price.   I grab a different black tea from my cabinet at home every couple of weeks to have as my main drink at work. I always keep a good Darjeeling and a decent oolong there too, just in case. Like today I have a sore throat so I broke out my oolong instead of the black Lin Shan or the Wu Liang Mao Feng Yunnan   We went there the first time to get spices. We stayed for lunch at their little lunch counter. I forgot about it again until you brought it up. I need to make a trip there again soon.   I usually only buy bottled tea or water when I am on the road so I do not drink these teas very often, but there is no comparison to any US brands. As others have said, this is tea. Not a tea beverage like what we get with Arizona, Lipton, etc.   The one that comes up was a writer for the Thieves World collection. Some of those books were written by several authors. They all had male names, but some of them were female. I believe I found the same thing with the Annual Science Fiction short stories book. Not the title of the book, but it was a collection that came out each year with excellent SF short stories.   India was eye opening for me as to how cheap human life is. People all over on the verge of starving. Kids being sold. I wonder how many of these kids have been sold to the recruiters? Kids being 18 - 20 year old's.   Any water soluble drug can be absorbed through the skin, Acid is extra effective because of how little you need to penetrate. A mixture with coke would have something but not enough to work through a squirt gun.      I was ignoring a glaring variable you point out. These people are really being conned by recruiters. I was blind by thinking there was   A) Access to information and the ability to read for these workers.   B) An inability for the recruiters to hit enough different villages and areas in the cities for them to keep the business going when word comes back to their community about the con.   C) Following B, I thought enough people came back to the community successful that others joined willingly. Even knowing the dangers and hardships.   D) Through ignorance thinking there are some general international labor laws all countries had to follow, which is why China was pressured to quit using child and jail labor. I'd think what Qatar is doing is comparable.   E) Assuming it was just some shady recruiters, working with some shady sub contractors, and more the exception to the rule than the standard.   F) And finally, forgetting how little groups like FIFA or even Coke and the other advertisers care about human life when there is huge profit involved.   Can I down vote myself for earlier ignorance or upvote you twice? Thanks for raising my awareness and connecting dots I was not considering and removing some of my misconceptions.     ehh, cheap for the right people. Probably not you or I, but it's cheap to make. And it gets absorbed through the skin. No need to get in mouth or anything.   If my neighbor was given part of my back yard by a 3rd party to build buildings and tear out my garden, the cops already chose to do nothing.   Someone needs to drive by with LSD in a squirt gun and spray the WBC protesters. That would change their viewpoint real quick.   With the caste system India used for so long, nothing really changed then. Blame the group, not the individuals. The group itself is bad, as are all members of the group. You know, like FOX news does with Muslims.   Suggesting it is good enough? You must have special glasses that allow you to read between the lines or something. Please explain where I say this should be good enough for them. What I said, is what they are coming from, is not much, if any, worse than what they are living in in Qatar.  I also said, this may be their best opportunity to make money so they can get married, raise a family, buy a little land, etc.  They certainly do not have the opportunity for work in India to achieve those things. Yes, it's terrible that people are dying on the job in Qatar. Do you really think people are not dying on the jobs in India too?  Do you think India is like Europe or the US where labor laws protect people from harm in the workforce?   "the International Labour Organisation (ILO) estimates that at least 40,000 workers lose their lives at work each year in India."   I travel there. I am not speaking from what I've read. I'm speaking of what I've experienced. How about you, have you been to India? Have you seen how close to the edge they live?  Do you have any concept about how many people die of malnourishment every day in India? Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a job in India if you are on the bottom rung of the ladder?   Once again, I am not excusing Qatar. I am just saying framing this in Western standards is a distortion. Qatar is not the US as far as labor laws and India is not the US as far as how close death is there for a significant portion of the population.   And just to be sure you know; I am not excusing it. I think Qatar should have the World Cup taken from them and have it moved to a country with the infrastructure to handle the reduced time; like Germany, the US, France or even the Benelux countries. (Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg. It was given to them because of bribes, they cannot have the games during the right time because of the weather, they have to switch up league play to handle the change in dates to accommodate Qatar. They treat their workers like slave laborers with little safety protections and causing many people to die.   Every time a tribe conquered another tribe in Africa, they sold them to slavers. But tribal living in Africa was much like native Americans so it was a pretty decent life. In the modern age, you have people living in cities with no running water, toilets, places to sleep, no food to eat.  It's incredibly depressing walking around India and seeing how low some people live. Garbage trucks don't go to dumps, they dump them along the side of the road, and people separate the plastic, paper, etc and eat the food.  People are crapping along the side of the main roads. Something like 50% of people in India have no access to a sewage system and use the ground.   The people that recruit these people may be feeding them a bunch of BS, but some of them are going back home with maybe enough money to buy a little land or a little business. If you're at the bottom in India, there is not a lot under you. And unlike the western nations, heat is not something that you can use as a reason for not working. When I visit Ahmadabad, the temps are usually in the high 90's or low 100's. Everyone who does outside work in the industrial sites, are all working in any weather. I just got back from Vietnam with the 100 degree temp and near 100% humidity. I could barely walk around the city because it was so miserable. Yet all over, there were street vendors, sweepers, cleaners, etc all doing their thing. Putting a western frame around the behaviors and living of the 3rd world is like comparing apples and wrist watches.   Shibumi by Trevanian is excellent but more about an assassin and attempting to find perfection. But Travanian is an incredible author and highly enjoable to read. Von Lustbader: The China Maroc Series and The Nicholas Linnear/Ninja Cycle are all quite good and may be a little more of what you are looking for.   Maya Angelou; I know why the caged bird sings is excellent.   I think you may be surprised that some of the authors you think are men, are actually women. I can't remember the author now, but the books were written under a male name, but I found it was a female author who published under several names, like many successful authors.  	57

 No, every dual enrollment student that finishes their degree at valencia automatically gets accepted to UCF and I think a few other florida schools.   What's that?   Yah, I'm thinking either Computer Science or Math.   That is exactly why I was asking. There is this program that will allow me to be automatically accepted to UCF after I graduate as a Junior but I wasn't sure if the schools I actually wanted to go to would let me do the same.   Thanks, I think that is what is probably going to happen to me.  	5

 Thanks, forgot about checking the Criterion!   Thanks, I used to watch death note when I was younger (15/16), and I don't mind gore, so I'll be sure to look up Living Hell and Battle Royale.   I've never watched foreign comedies, does the humour translate well over subs? Or would it be best to search for a dubbed version?  	2
 Ok awesome thanks for the good info and quick response! Would you see any interaction between the 'done and this?  Based on what I told you, you would recommend the Bali?  Also how many mg's should I dose at first time I try?  Sorry for all the questions- i've known of kratom for about a year but I am still a bit hesitant to try it mainly because I read to many things on the net comparing it to bath salts and the like so I kinda scared myself haha. thanks again bud!!    Where can you get kratom in the states? At a headshop type place or  you think they would just call me a junkie and say F off haha. What kinds/brands are good? I have heard that the capsules are crappy.  How much should I try for never having tried it before?  Also I am on Methadone so I don't even know if I should try it since I am on it.   That would be called a trigger   picture?   Not at all. For some reason it makes me super upset that most of these people never use gloves!!!   well for what it's worth, the past few years in the states its been harder and harder to get a legit script for any kinda narcotic pain reliever.  I even had my own script for 120 Norco a month for about 2 years then I was cut off because my doctor was all worried and scared about DEA, me getting addicted to them, etc.  Now I am on methadone thanks to that situation.     damn won't ship to the U.S.  I heard that the laws against opiates in the UK were a lot stricter in general than in the U.S.  Is that true?  Pertaining to prescription opiates.   dude i've dealt with several people that read the big number on the pill (500, 325,etc) and use that as the amount of good stuff in the pill.  I am not positive if these people were trying to get over on me but I would lean towards them just being dumbass stoners who never sold pills and therefore know really nothing about them.   yeah dude it's over. sorry to break it to ya. haha i don't know just go and pee. i would say use fake pee but the methadone clinic i go to tests the fucking temperature of it so you have to get the pee right within the correct range it should be when leaving your body.   I don't think she tried to jack you I think she was honestly that stupid.    ahh the good ole motrin 800 deal. most doctors go to when they won't give you opiates.  been down that road many times-that shit sucks.    so what did they give you?  i actually had down on my file for about 7 years I was allergic to codiene but recently had them change that.   ha i was asking myself wtf pubrenorphin is too.  some kinda drug i'm not hip too? haha    probably because pharms require a script and heroin doesn't.   how'd you find this site?!?! no script!?!   oh ok yeah i've seen pics of them.   pink? were they shaped liked norcos? never seen those.   I have been down both of those paths.  I never really thought of it though.  I can tell you though that i enjoy opiates way much more than alcohol any day.  I used to not be able to go 1 day without booze and likewise for opiates.  I just got sick of drinking so I gave it up cold turkey and luckily felt a lot better with out any kind of withdrawls.  I drank everyday for about 4 years straight.  Now with opiates I was doing some form of them for about 5 years straight too.  I was scripted norcos for a long time but thanks to doctor's getting scared now about scripting anything I got cut off. I now am on methadone.  To answer your question is a bit hard actually now that i think of it.  I don't think I could give you a solid answer other than repeating that opiates are always #1 to me over any other substance.    lol i've been in that situation before where they read the amount of tylenol in it and believe that the more apap in the pill the better!! fucking idiots.  just play stupid too and try to get the best deal if they don't know what they have.   I am on both methadone and paxil   75 is a good ass deal but depends on the potency of it.  If its been cut to all hell then its not that great of a price although i have been paying 60 for .5 g lately.  I've been getting really good stuff lately tho.    depends. that is actually what made me move to bth is because of the sparse pill scene and the cost of pills.  I'm sure places like SF where I used to live its easy to score either pills or H.  When I lived near SF I didn't really do opiates so I never bothered.  Now that i live kind of middle of nowhere so not many pills and i have to drive almost an hour for bth.   i believe its bth mixed with a powdered cut.  put both in an empty plastic bottle and shake away.   I haven't done anything to sleazy or immoral at least in my eyes haha.  I've done a bit of pawning which I kind of regret since pawn shops always give you the lowest lowball shit price for whatever you are pawning.  Scrapping metal.  I have a small truck- Ford Ranger so I can only put so much in but I usually am able to get around $40 each haul.  I have a couple older neighbors that have a bunch of stuff and they just tell me what to take and I get the whole profit since I am getting it off their property.    i actually had less of an appetite on most opiatesi used recreationally but now that I am on methadone I crave sweets.   Could be. I really don't know that much about how the cartels operate as far as where the dope ends up.  I do know that you should never get involved with any Mexican cartels.  After seeing numerous photos and videos of what they do to people who cross them even in the slightest way makes me believe that they are probably the most ruthless organized crime association ever.   i'd say 98% or more of the dope in California is coming from Mexico.   agreed   I seriously contemplated this especially after seeing the pic of the foil and straw!!    in california i've only encountered bth and gunpowder but I haven't been messing with H that long.  just maybe 6 months after making the jump from pharms.     I have to disagree at least partially because 95% of the people that I see everyday at the methadone clinic look fucking haggard.   lucky man seems like everyone including myself these days is getting cut off.    ok i was just wondering if there was any other advantage to shooting it.  so you are shooting your liquid take homes?   I'm not surprised since that's what most of us here would love to be able to master/attain.  It's tough, at least for me to balance it out.  Well not really anymore since I have been on mmt for about 3 weeks.   how come you shot methadone?     ok seems to make sense.     i smoked some bth once since being on mmt and it wasn't as much of a rush or high as usual but it was there for sure- the high but it was weaker than normal.  also could be a bit of placebo effect know that methadone is supposed to block other opiates.  I am on 50mg currently only on mmt for 3 weeks.  I slipped up because it's just the ritual of smoking bth that I love.  I have norcos at my house and I haven't touched them since starting mmt.   so you are saying that if one 1 day of the week you double your dosage and it gets you pretty high?  How is that been working for you i'm not at the point of take homes yet and i'm only taking 50mg right now but I have a feeling the dr is going to up it.   why does everyone say that? is it because cravings for food- sugary types specifically are a lot higher when on mmt?  I have been on only 3 weeks and I am doing good with it but getting large cravings for sweets is what I have noticed.   yeah see that's where I am kind of not knowing what I should really do since I do have actual pain and xrays and my in my medical file it lists that I have "chronic pain syndrome".  Has said that for the last 5 years.  At the same time though my body is physically addicted to opiates and probably a bit mentally too.     i have been on opiates legally prescribed to me for about 5 years.  I recently moved so i have a new pain doc who was giving me norcos.  in the recent last few months my using was getting a bit out of control- buying on the street, even smoking a bit of tar and I thought to myself i should do something about this.  I have done suboxone in the past but they just didn't work for me.  I researched methadone for a couple weeks then I went down and started on the program.  I made an appoinment with my pain doc about a week in and told him what I was doing (in my state the law states that if you are in a clinic you do not have to tell your doctor.  But i went ahead an was honest to him and he was actually really proud of me and encouraging.  I was pretty nervous and the appoinment went by so fast that I forgot to even ask him if he would prescribe me it.  Probably not now that he know's I was in a clinic but I am trying to really be "clean"  now instead of spending all my money on pills or H since my script was not making it even close to the end of the month.     Ok thanks i'll maybe look in my area for doc's that prescribe methodone.  my pain mgmt doc I have now might even be able to do it for me.   yeah I agree with docs not wanting to write a script for opiates as I have been playing that game with docs for about 8 years.     I've been on done for about 2 weeks now.  It's a clinic deal and I have to drive there 7 days a week to get my stuff and I live about 30 mins away.  I was wondering if it would be possible to get a doctor to script me done instead of doing what I have to do everyday.  It's a bit expensive on gas with the drive everyday.  I did some research and I think that it is possible to get it from a doctor instead of going to a clinic everday and dosing.  Just wanting any feedback if anyone has tried to get scripted thru a doc.  I have a history of chronic pain that is documented and have a current pain mgmt doctor.     I just started it last week but i'm doing it to get "clean" so I am in a program and go everyday to get my dose.  I am on a fairly low dose (50mg)  and i have yet to really feel a high from it. more just like it keeps most of my withdrawls and cravings at bay so I can get on with my life and not worry about how i'm gonna hustle up $100 a day for H.  If you were to have no tolerance to opiates I could see it as being ok but never understood why people would ever do it recreationally.   same exact thing happened to me basically last fall.  we are living in an era now that we will be seeing a huge decline in prescribing pain meds and it's going to fuck shit up worse because people who would never had before will now be trying heroin.  my doctor just gave me the go to answers: DEA cracking down, Obama Care and the fact that a small amount of dumbasses had to go and OD and fuck it up for the rest of us responsible people.  As for advice, fuck it just go to the street and find some H, that is what I did when I got cut off my pills.   what i would do is at least quarter the op 80- the more pieces the better and put it in a shot glass of cola. the longer the better. i would usually do it overnight.     i'd say it depends on who you are talking to but yes alcohol seems to be a lot more tolerated than heroin or any opiate in general.     are you talking about putting oc's in it overnight??  if so yes I have done it.  I think basically anything with carbonation and citric acid help but I always do prefer coke.   i just found these for instance.  good deal?!?!   http://www.webstaurantstore.com/regal-bulk-poppy-seeds-25-lbs-case/102708404.html?utm_source=Google utm_medium=cpc utm_campaign=GoogleShopping gclid=CNjqv5qNib0CFa5DMgodoUsAag   ok i'll check it out.  i have tried to make PST in the past and have failed but I think mainly because i got regular poppy seeds.  Any more input on this!?!?   Just wondering why more people don't do this.   i just checked looks like they won't ship to the US though hah. is there any morphine still in the plant? i am a noob when it comes to poppys.   wait so you can just order these and they are legal?     Well then i'd like to see that!! haha. but yeah maybe if you at least stopped shooting it?  did you build up to that from smoking/snorting?   This is the 1st time i have commented on a girls pics on this sub so you caught my attention.  Amazing you have been able to keep it up that long and still look that good!   you look too healthy to be a shooter. how often do you indulge?   seriously man F that!!    i think that is all of our major concerns lol.  I mean i'd rather get burned or beat up by someone than have any law issues.     How is a rainbow made?? how exacty does a posi traction on the rear end of a plymouth work?? It just does!!!    yeah i did and it feels good like a smoked a blue.     i'm in california where powder is hard to come by    ok i broke down and just did.  feel a little light headed and high but good.   it's black tar. you would smoke it off foil. that's at least what i would do first.    Looks like it's time for a lot of us to move to the UK!    OK this was on wiki:   Under the chemical names diamorphine and diacetylmorphine, heroin is a legally prescribed controlled drug in the United Kingdom, and is supplied in tablet or injectable form for the same indications as morphine is, often being preferred over morphine due to its lower side-effect profile.[citation needed] It is also available for prescription to long-term users as a form of opioid replacement therapy in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark, alongside psycho-social carein the same manner that methadone or Suboxone (buprenorphine) are used in the United States and Canada[10][11]and a similar programme is being campaigned for by liberal political parties in Norway.   It smells like vinegar.  My friend gave it to me and I really want to try it.  I have had it since last night and havent touched it since I have not broken my H cherry yet.  should be no big deal?!?!  He smoked some last night and said its really good stuff.  its a tiny amount, smaller than a dime.      yeah i was thinking they would mainly be used for maintaining/not being sick more so than recreation.    ah ok 8 mg codeine? what amounts can you buy them in like is there a limit?   i have heard that it is sold in certain counties in prescription dose supposedly.  This is not from my experience.   This has been discussed some I think before but does anyone know exactly what is legal and where?   For instance I have heard that codeine for the most part be it cough syrup or T3's I hear is legal in Canada.  I have also talked to people that tell me pharmacutical opiates such as norco and oxy and more or less legal in Mexico at most pharmacies.  I have even heard as far as some counties in the US will sell products with codeine OTC!?!?    norco. but i do oxy when available.   OK cool.  do you know how that would relate to a 120mg hydrohabit?  mine is not quite that but has been upwards of.  i am just trying to figure that out. i will start small of course.    lol almost did that swallowing technique    that seems like a good price. how long would that last you.  250 would get me like 9 blues. smh.   so you were shooting it then? i am trying to see how it would convert as well but its hard since heroin is cut with god nows what whereas pills are always a sure thing.   and i think it costs about 4cents a piece to make them or less.   true!   i think you would loose way too much smoke that way.  i'm not sure though as I have only smoked blues a handful of times and it was thru a pen tube.   yeah i would think so as well but i dunno.   OK thanks. i've been around the stuff i can get ahold of and I hear that it's pretty decent stuff i have just not tried yet cause I was still wasting $$ on pills.     yeah i'm in california so i can only get tar i believe. i think there is powder but harder to come by    OK i was thinking a large tooter like a pen.  i know at the beginning i might loose a bit.  I never did get down smoking blues that well either haha.     This is the epitome of pill porn.  Finally a good example!    I've been doing pills for about 5 years now.  Everything from 5's to OP 80s.  I'm getting sick of paying out the ass for pills. $200 for like 8 blues is not my piece of cake.  I know where I can get tar heroin.  I assume that the H would go a lot farther than buying pills financially speaking?  I also would plan on smoking it and I assume you would foil it?  I have never done H before and want to know how much to try at first.  I would think like a pin head size?   Getting on subs and getting clean is my long term goal but before I am done with opiates I would like to just try this once.  Please don't criticize me, I just want some honest advice here!!! thanks guys. and oh my tolerance is decent.  lets say 120mg oxy daily but could handle more without completely nodding.  	85
 Thankyou so much, that means a lot. I just need to stop feeling sorry for myself and feeling like I've pulled the short straw when I see other people in happy relationships going on holidays (which we had plans for and have had to ignore) and days out. I would be more miserable without him though, he's my bestfriend. I'm going to try and ride the storm and be supportive and just be there until I I can't do it anymore and hopefully it'll get better. Thanks again for your help and your words.  	1

 Its a sad result of hunting,  I admire Macro meats for only shooting the males. At least then the joeys can have a life too. They are excellent names. Are they your photos?  They're such cuties.    I've never been but I've heard that police in Thailand are pretty bad   Same. I thought it would be a fun kids movie,  I was so very wrong    I'm vegetarian and I'm particularly fond of kangaroos, they're beautiful animals, the thought of them being hunted often upsets me. But this company actually seems really good,  if kangaroos must be hunted I'd support them. I've seen and heard too many stories about shooters wounding and not killing and the killing of joeys is awful.   I'm glad there are good ethical hunters out there.    I got a Samsung flip phone 8 years ago, i gave it to my dad when i upgraded, he ran it over twice with a forklift... still works   I put  the pro in procrastination.     I'm 100% satisfied with cups.    ...how?   [Yes]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal)   I did,  i didn't even contact the manager or anyone.    I was incredibly depressed, the job was soul crushing retail and i was starting to seriously consider seriously injuring myself so i could have a legitimate reason to not go into work.    So i drove 6 hours back to my parents house instead of going to work one morning.  I regret nothing. It all ended ok   I've been terrified of tsunamis for as long as i can remember. But in my entire life I've only spent about 1 hour in a place where a tsunami could occur.    Ive been to a few events that won't allow you to bring in your own water then charge $8 per 600ml. Its completely stupid. But you have to pay or pass out from dehydration.    A framed photo of me and my family's old dog having a nap together when I was about 8.     Geez, tough day   The whole octomum saga. Ridiculous.    My thoughts exactly    Well i have seen about 20 spiders, 1 snake and a few kangaroos today. .. so...   I say feb-ree   Yep, the worst. It just makes every aspect of their personality so dreary, everything they say is dull.    Its sad in a way.  But amazing, mind blowing.     Its not all bad,  but stuff like [this]( http://www.mamamia.com.au/news/adelaide-house-of-horrors/) and [this]( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowtown_murders) and the occasional shootings, stabbings, arson, drug abuse etc.     What's spi?

I love my boyfriend, to me is he perfect and I wouldn't change him for anything, but my best friend and I vent to each other about our boyfriends. if they overheard, they might be upset, hurt, offended etc., thats why we dont say it to their faces.   It sounds kind of harsh, but it's what friends are for, for venting to and joking with, nothing malicious is meant by what we say.     They are treated with respect/ displayed respectfully in museums, plus the educational value outweighs any reason for keeping them buried/ entombed.   But realistically, there is no valid reason to respect the dead, they're dead.    once I saw a guy selling slicer things, he was missing a whole arm, those things are dangerous.    you're wife might be crazy. sorry.    Symetry in the mall doesn't usually require bookings   But.... they do...   KI kangaroos are such cuties. great photo!   Plural, like 500 of them   *lady   a stalk. babies for everyone!   My aunt hit her head on a rock (after being tripped over by a pig), she had recurring dizziness and nausea for a year or so after, it wasn't weird, but it wasn't anything to worry about either.   head injuries can cause all kinds of lasting affects, sleep walking is one of them. not sure about the peeing though... maybe you're just lucky.    I counted sheep once and did not fall asleep.    Kind of weird, mostly insanely dull.    do as Australians do. We survived a decade long drought.

I don't buy them for kids,  but as a non-religious 26 year old, i will be pretty darn disappointed if my mum doesn't give me any eggs tomorrow.   Because, dammit,  I like chocolate.    Once when i was about 2 I was hugging the legs of my dad,  but then he spoke and I realised it wasn't my dad at all, it was a total stranger. Worst day of my life to that point.    My sister asked me to keep her kids easter eggs at my place so they didn't find them.  I didn't give all of them back...  But i did replace them,  so I'm not an awful aunt.

My friend has invented "clock bracelets" and "water cars"   I grew up in rural Australia, we got our petrol and other basic goods from road houses. I moved to a city where you get it from servos (service station). I had no idea what a servo was and people didn't understand when i asked where the nearest road house was.    Some Australians do this or the variation "wheres the shop to?"   I often say 'not today zurg' and sadly, quite a few people don't know what I'm talking about.

 Human Centipede   I was the Vice president of our RC club (NVRCC) for a year.. Hated the job.. Actively told other club members that I dont want / would suck at the job back when the nominations came up.. (This was 2003) I'm horrible with politics. I speak my mind.. I are who I are.         I can see that with the OTs, they is, who they is. Its alright to me. I just hope I don't become one of them..   36YO here.. :-)    I can see that side of the argument. (Yeah, I'm not a huge fan of uncle sam having yet more authority over private matters) However, being both a landlord, and a homeowner of a house in a HOA, I think (if nothing else) awareness needs to be brought to this. If it requires a law to be enacted to do so, then so be it. In my short tenure as an amateur radio operator, i've come to understand just how important of a civil service hams are in the event of a disaster. Living in the bay area CA, we all know all too well that we get shakers all the time, and every time I experience one, the cell towers are jammed, landlines typically wont work, and power can be out for up to a few days. In the case of an apartment, or condo complex, having an amateur radio operator with usable antennae would be of a *huge* benefit to the locals.        I think its a good thing for someone to point out these facts to the HOAs so they can make an *educated* decision on allowing (or not) an antenna to be erected. Hearing this argument from the guy who wants to set up the antenna will generally fall on deaf ears, no matter how well reasoned the argument. If the federal government can step in to raise this awareness, then all the better IMO.   I think 4chan and 14.313 are a match made in.. well.. somewhere? :-D   My reddit-fu is not strong :-D        Thank you a ton!    PM Sent!   I give you Lactarius Indigo.  The Blue milk mushroom.        http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lactarius_indigo   This has been posted here before, but heres a (stunningly) visual example of RF "burning" stuff (in my opinion).. Its a vid of a couple Russian kids burning grass on the base of a local stations radio tower.        You'd think, "Its radio frequencies, how can it hurt me?" But, even whats going on inside your microwave is all RF "burning" asymmetric molecules.           Check the video out. (Yeah, RF, especially at any power, needs to be respected.. It will bite.. ) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Scm-tKTHls        ..Mendnwngs   Well, kinda.. But, within the context of your original post, a pair of baofeng handhelds on a simplex freq won't get out all *that* far. Maybe 10-20 miles. Likely, you won't find any activity other than the other person (who also must be a licensed ham). Regardless, you can identify the other party by your callsigns.        You can limit whom you receive, and who can receive you by using "tones" (For instance CTCSS). This is a set of sub-audible tones that get transmitted along with your voice. If you set up your radio to only listen to a signal with a CTCSS of 100.7, then only someone who has set up their radio to transmit with a CTCSS of 100.7 will "get through" (open the squelch) of your radio. Anyone in the area transmitting on the same frequency with a different CTCSS tone will not be heard by your radio.        It sounds complicated (maybe) but its really not, and you will learn about it while studying for your ham license exam. If you have any technical know-how, or background, I think you'll find the info needed to pass your Technician is really easy, and pretty trivial.   Edit 1) Clarification..   Do!        Its a fun, and rewarding obsession.. er.. I mean, Hobby.. Plus, with your license, you can use your baofeng on any of the simplex frequencies, at the full output power of your handheld without breaking any laws!! *YAY* :-)        You may find that the 5W output on 2m simplex gets you much further distance between radios as "walkie-talkies" than the other (quite limited) MURS, FRS, GMRS radios, so theres that as well.        Looking forward to hearing you on the amateur bands once you get your ticket!        -73!!   Greetings /u/nvertedflyer!        Firstly, (and most importantly) a warm welcome home to your daughter. The hospital is no fun. The train_subject7402 family sends warmest wishes for a speedy recovery, and no more pain. :-( As a chronic sufferer of pain myself (lower back..Ugh) I know all too well the suck of hospital time, and dealing with pain issues.        Secondly, I dont know how to 'prove' it, heh, but I've been helping a visually impaired friend get on the air with his kenwood radio, and JAWS software. I used to set-up assistive technology for the visually impaired many moons ago, Back when Dragon (not Naturally speaking, not even dragon dictate, but just plain ol' Dragon) and Vocal-eyes were the leading edge software for voice readback, and voice control. (downright brutal compared to todays technology). We're playing with his Kenwood TS-2000, and Kenwood ARCP-2000 software.        My cousin (a silent key now, KD6WXE) was blind, and used Vocal-eyes. I'm kind of channeling that history to help my friend currently.        Thank you for running this ham-it-forward 'esque contest. I'll follow this thread with great interest. And good luck to all who are entering. No matter who takes the prize, the simple encouragement to help out fellow hams makes for a lot of wins. :-)           73!  	11

 Looking for a place to rent (open to renting it for the night if not just for a few hours) for a party with about 40 friends. It can either be a room or a house or whatever else, I'm open to options!  Not really interested in a private room in a restaurant because my friends can get kind of rowdy.. something private that we can decorate/clean/manage on our own without owner interference would be the best!  Any ideas? I'm willing to spend up to $200! Thanks in advance :)      added links in my edit!!   Hello! If you are a male and you like to sing, you should think about auditioning for Dallas' only competitive South Asian a cappella team this coming Wednesday, Jan. 21st! For more information, check out the [fb event here](https://www.facebook.com/events/919252438098475/?notif_t=plan_user_joined)  Edit: You can find our recently released single [here](https://soundcloud.com/dhunkimusic/royals-dil-se-re) and check out some our live performances [here](https://www.youtube.com/user/DhunkiMusic) - and just as a note, the live performances on our YouTube channel, except for the 2 most recent ones, are extremely outdated and we have almost an entirely new team and have made a LOT of progress since then!!     My boyfriend would love to play!! He says he hasn't played Searfarers before but would love to. When are you available?  	5
 I'm surprised there is any fondant on it. Certainly doesn't need to be.   Well, on that note, it's your own damn show. Invite whomever you want.  This week wasn't for me, but next week will be better.   I had one crash the first time I played it (launch day), triggered while playing the Gwent card game. Otherwise, I have experienced no technical issues. I think what you're seeing is a developer who is unusually responsive to community feedback, rather than a game that is unusually buggy.   I'd be very sad if Tabletop Time got the boot.    Do you see a lot of stories about broken indie titles on PSN? I buy a slew of them and have never had any issues, so I'm curious.   Haha, this is fun. :)  If that foil is edible, though, I will be astounded. Aside from the way it's reflecting the light, the texture looks impossible to achieve with edible material. But I think a foil wrapper is fine--no different than a cupcake.   If by "wrapper" you mean tortilla, I think it actually looks more like marzipan (but is probably fondant). The foil wrapper must be actual foil.  To me, the beef looks like chocolate rocks.   All evidence to the contrary...   I would be very surprised.   Tastes vary, obviously, but I disagree. I'm not very concerned about whether the show outpaces the books (since it's such a different beast now), but the show is definitely the second-stage act for me. The showrunners have all the subtlety of a dirty brick, and I doubt they can bring this thing to a satisfying close without a detailed roadmap of how to get there. When they have completed books to reference, they make some nice choices (generally), but when they're forced to move the narrative along on their own they suffer.  They're fine with hitting the high notes, but they get lost and muddled for the remainder of the season. "Hardhome" made me more optimistic, but it doesn't fix the big misses for the rest of this season.   Tastes vary, but I agree.    Frankly, if you want to play one of the older games, you're probably better off playing Fallout 1 or 2. That way you get a flavor for the series, but you don't get burned out on the Fallout 3 style. Fallout 3 is fine, but I expect Fallout 4 will just be more of the same.   Yeah. If I were looking for a smooth, 60fps bet, I would not put my money on Bethesda. Great games, but they are far from slick.   It probably has a lot to do with the way that the trailers are structured. The Battlefront trailer is a bombastic action set piece that looks very far removed from how actual gameplay is structured (in any game). The Fallout trailer has a lot of slow 'camera-walking-down-the-street' shots that look a lot like how these games actually play.   I personally think the Battlefront visuals are going to be incredible, but the 'slow pan' style of the Fallout trailer is more convincing. It certainly gives the impression they're just showing off the environment, in-engine, rather than using the engine to create a heavy-action cinematic.  	14

 You might need to watch First Blood again; it's brilliant, and the only death is accidental.   It works both ways: it's better to live for something than to die for nothing just as it's better to die for something than to live for nothing.   I can't think of a lot of movies I've seen in the theater where people actually stood up and cheered. When Rambo went HAM toward the end (spoilers?) the whole audience was going nuts. There was way too much testosterone in that room...    He literally helps the ~~Taliban~~ the Afghan people  FTFY     It was better than Rambo: First Blood Part II ***and*** Rambo 3 but failed to top First Blood.  I just realized what a bizarre naming convention this series had:  1. First Blood  2. Rambo: First Blood Part II  3. Rambo III  4. Rambo   I'm not arguing a single thing, but lots of citations needed here.   I'm appreciating this novel with each reply such as yours. Thank you for this.    knowing the context of the book is important  I'm beginning to get that, and that's exactly why I posted to begin with. *This* is why I love /r/books. I get so much more out of reading by having this kind of post-reading discussion.   It's like being a member of the world's biggest book club without anyone giving me a reading list.  Thank you sincerely for taking the time to write. I really appreciate it.    he made me fall in love with Brett  Then I am spectacularly your opposite and this is the kind of thing that makes reading fun. It is so interesting to me that this book had that effect on you and quite the opposite on me. I loathed her. I couldn't understand these foolish men and boys fawning for her. Maybe that's a big part of the reason I didn't get it. I didn't like Brett.   In terms of the actual events that transpired, I found the bullfighting descriptions somewhat interesting albeit appalling, but little else of consequence. Their conversations seemed asinine, although I'll give Hemingway tremendous credit for capturing perfectly the way drunk people actually converse.   I felt constantly wanting for more drama. When Cohn finally threw a punch, I was ecstatic! It felt like the most exciting thing to happen in the course of the novel. Perhaps there's some disconnect between a man of 2015 and values and ideals of a generation a century past.   That's a wonderful explanation and I am grateful for it. What perplexed me throughout the novel was what seemed to be a lack of any explicit conflict in need of resolution, but you seem to be saying the conflicts were, in a way, the characters themselves. They all were in pursuit of something and failed at attaining it.  I suppose I didn't connect very well with these characters. I found Brett absolutely awful, Cohn pathetic, Mike an ass, Jake spineless, and Bill... well, I suppose Bill was alright. I didn't understand why Brett was so sought after, why Mike seemed downright amused by Brett's affairs, or at least tolerant of them, or why Jake was so whipped by her that he loved her and yet stood by her as she was drawn to every man like a moth to flame.   Why *was* Brett so sought after? Was it her title? Was she really that attractive? It seemed every man wanted her and would put up with her.   I read this because I recently read and quite liked his Old Man and the Sea. I left it impressed as Hemingway could take such a simple story and have me riveted even though I have no interest in fishing or old men and only a glancing interest in the sea. I read it in a single sitting.  The Sun Also Rises seemed amysmally dull from the start, and I would not have finished it had the author not been Hemingway. I always felt sure it would get better, and when I read the final sentence, it was like a kick in the teeth. Really? That's it? All that for that?  I don't get the title either. I might have titled it "Drunks Repeating Themselves."   Yes and no. When they first created their Captain Marvel, they did so in a vacuum. Fawcett couldn't use their Captain Marvel anymore (Billy Batson) because DC sued claiming their Captain Marvel was a knockoff of Superman. Insane as that was, they won. Until Fawcett was bought out by Charlton Comics which was then bought out by DC, Marvel had the one and only Captain Marvel.  Once DC decided to incorporate the old Fawcett/Charlton character into their own lineup, they couldn't release anything with the title "Captain Marvel" because Marvel now owned that publication title, but because the character preexisted and predated Marvel's, they were allowed to keep the character and the name. Hence the series title "Shazam!".   After skirting this issue for decades with the odd "his name is Captain Marvel; his comic books are Shazam!" scheme, they finally just gave in and officially named him Shazam with the New 52 relaunch.   As for Marvel's Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers as Captain Marvel has become one of their top properties over the decades and has a movie coming out, which means Marvel's Captain Marvel will be far better known as *the* Captain Marvel to most audiences. Funny enough, the current release date for her movie coincides with the Warner Bros. film "Shazam!".   Thunder God by himself should be able to handle all of them at once with the exception of Darkskull, and that's only because Darkskull is half Darkseid.   So you're still wrong. As I said, Captain Marvel *has* appeared outside of a DC Comic, Marvel Comics has had numerous Captain Marvels of their own, and DC's Billy Batson has not been known as Captain Marvel since 2011.   If you're still talking about SHAZAM! as in Billy Batson, you're still wrong; he was created in Fawcett Comics and was quite prolific there for 33 years before ever being integrated into DC. For a time, Fawcett's Captain Marvel was more popular than DC's Superman.   It didn't close either door. You can clearly see the arm of the person inside close the door before the tire gets to it. The same person then opens the other door.   This is what happens when I'm involved in too many conversation threads. I apologize.   If you want a good discussion on this but don't want to wait for responses, check the threads of the other 52,000 times this quote has been posted on /r/batman.    the fans voted for Wolverine, so they had no idea how to have Wolverine win  You're right about that. Lobo was (I don't know anything about [New 52 Lobo](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11113/111135277/4084955-9940480525-lobo_.jpg) and I'd prefer to keep it that way) functionally impossible to kill. Legend has it that Czarnians can only be killed by other Czarnians, and since he killed all the other Czarnians, there is no real threat to him. Heaven and Hell literally won't take him anyway.  Unfortunately, the bar cop-out made it look like they hid a sex scene off panel and Wolverine found the Rogering so satisfying he required a smoke immediately after... the cigar Lobo was smoking.   For context, I have to explain that I am a "white" person and that one of my best friends is "black."  I went over to his apartment one time, and when I walked in the door, he was sitting there eating watermelon. I burst out laughing, and he realized what was up, we both had a good laugh.  Another time we were out and I suggested we get something to eat before we move on to another bar. He suggested KFC, which again, provoked a laugh out of me and then him. He punched me in the arm and said something like, "Don't act like you don't love KFC. I was suggesting it because ***YOU*** like it." Which I do. It's a silly stereotype, because most people I know enjoy fried chicken, regardless of race.  None of this is bad, and none of it is racism. At all. This is basically what people these days would call a "meme," a popular thing to reference that goes way back to some sort of basis in reality.   Truthfully, I don't know why nor do I especially care about how black people came to be associated with things like watermelon or fried chicken, but we all know of the association, and it's not exactly a cruel or insulting stereotype.   And what possible agenda could it serve? Who benefits from these stereotypes? Who suffers?  No one. So fuck it. Let's just have fun and be cool to one another. It's not hard.   You can be anything you want to be!   /r/Unexpected   /r/UnexpectedThugLife    The world really is shitty and the world really is wonderful depending on what you focus on.   Yeah, but there's a very negative connotation to the word "prejudice" even though it's really just pre-judging, which is a sensible thing to do in a lot of situations...  We need a word that's for non-racists to have fun with stereotypes, like black people can dance/white people can't dance, white nerd culture versus black gangsta culture, etc. all while keeping a friendly, tongue-in-cheek tone about the whole thing.  Somehow both of these subreddits do this expertly with only a rare asshole downvoted straight to hell.   Humorous Stereotypes  Brainwashing   S'all yours bro.    Yeah, the FF might be my least favorite Marvel property as well.  Of course, we don't *have to* watch the new movie...   They do have collected volumes, at least 3.    Though my art style was basically a carbon copy of Phil Bourassa's work on Young Justice.   If you're going to copy an artist's style, at least you chose wisely.   I used to be an adventurer like you until [I took an arrow to the eye](http://www.1066online.co.uk/hastings-photos/battle-of-hastings/photos/arrow-in-the-eye.jpg)...   Now I want to see Grodd in Thor's getup, helmet and all, wielding Mjlnir.   Vandal Savage: And that, my legion of supervillians, is how we are going to take over the- ***CRASH***  Randal Savage: Saw-wee...  Vandal Savage: God damn it Randal...   Based on the history of the shield in canon, I would say no, neither Hulk nor Superman could break it or rip it apart. [It has absolutely withstood a direct blow from Hulk more than once,](http://i.newsarama.com/images/i/000/093/888/original/Capt-America-Shield-Block-Hulk.jpg?1364317923) and, as you can imagine, Hulk attacking Cap means Hulk has completely lost his shit.  As for Superman, the only circumstances in which the shield has been broken has been by literal gods or those endowed with all the power of god, and once by a guy who literally controls all matter at a molecular level. All Superman can do is hit it, and the shield just deflects force. Adding more force is useless.  Basically, consider the shield a force multiplier and the multiplier is zero. Hitting with a force of 1 results in 0. Hitting it with a force of 999,999,999,999 results in 0. Anything times zero is zero.    Which raises an obvious question...   Promethium is fairly significant.   I heard there was once a Cable fan who was so dedicated that he actually understood Cable's origin and powers.   He's now committed to an insane asylum, but good on him.   That's also how Youngblood happened; he was working on a reboot of Teen Titans, got canned, and then started Image with a bunch of guys who actually had talent. Instead of scrapping the work he did on Teen Titans he changed some names and presto. He made shitloads of money.   [Yes?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJUhlRoBL8M)   Really? I think the SHAZAM!/Thor mashup is the most overpowered of this bunch.   I'm not the artist, but you can always ask him: http://ericguzman.deviantart.com/   As of 2011, his name is SHAZAM!, not Captain Marvel. All rights to the name "Captain Marvel" have been relinquished to Marvel Comics, a subsidiary of Disney.   Greenova Corps.   It would take an amalgam of Sentry   Superman to even strand a chance.    Joker + Goblin = Mark Hamill.    Nah. I liked it for what it was. I still have the full collection of both series.   Exactly. It's entirely possible, [though not always attractive...](https://shechive.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/body-builder-29.jpg)   What's really cool is both characters are rare in that they've both displayed knowledge that they're comic book characters, i.e., they both have been shown to break the fourth wall.   [Dat Grayson ass...](https://36.media.tumblr.com/379420b3a9834bb6f739151909f0b64b/tumblr_ni65gyAmIG1rtprkqo1_1280.jpg)   It gets so much worse than that. Dr. Otto Octavius turns into Dr. Octopus? A guy is legitimately Dr. Doom? As in that's his fucking birth name? Really? Kyle Nimbus becomes Mist? Seriously?   True, but Captain Krypton was a much different interpretation than Super Soldier. There's really only so much you can do to combine Darkseid and Thanos considering how similar they are to begin with.  Now mixing Darkseid, Thanos, Apocalypse, and Mongul might be interesting.    Correct; I am not.   True, but Captain Krypton was a much different interpretation than Super Soldier. There's really only so much you can do to combine Darkseid and Thanos considering how similar they are to begin with.   Now mixing Darkseid, Thanos, Apocalypse, and Mongul might be interesting.   Ew.   It's too bad Wolverine VS Lobo was the weakest fight of the whole series. If they had done it in a post-Comics Code Authority world, it would've been insanely bloody and lasted a good four or five issues.   Mr. Diddle is *not* approved by the Comics Code Authority.   Like I just linked to...   You need to know what you're talking about before you try correcting people.

I've been frequently surprised by the amount of users on /r/comicbooks  that are completely unaware Marvel VS DC exists, let alone Amalgam.   It's the crossover I've always wanted to see.  Instead I had to settle for the crappy Daredevil/Batman one.   Carefully?   Season three lives on in my heart...   Also he's missing an eye now, so there's that...   Yeah, I'd agree with that assessment.

Only after Joe Kelly made Deadpool different when he got his own series. Before that, Deadpool was an elite assassin who brandished a sword and had enhanced superhuman abilities with fast healing and a mysterious origin.   He was Marvel's Deathstroke. The silly Deadpool we know today didn't come until his own self-titled monthly.    Green Arrow is a Robin Hood Rip off.  Technically Green Arrow is a Batman rip-off with a Robin Hood gimmick, but all good points.    Doom Patrol/X-Men is more debatable because their timelines were close  That actually seems more like evidence that X-Men *did* rip off Doom Patrol than didn't. X-Men came out three months later, which is enough time to see Doom Patrol and copy it.  Superhuman misfits, led by a paraplegic in a wheelchair, dedicated to protecting a world that shuns them, The Doom Patrol debuted in My Greatest Adventures #80 in June 1963, three months before The X-Men #1 with near-identical cover taglines and the names of their arch-enemies with The Doom Patrols The Worlds Strangest Heroes! versus The X-Mens The Strangest Super-Heroes of All! and The Doom Patrols Brotherhood of Evil versus The X-Mens Brotherhood of Evil Mutants.  They're nearly identical. I don't believe in coincidence in general, but certainly not to the degree of a damned near carbon copy just three months after the original.   All good points, and let's not forget copying Marvel's mutants with metahumans.    TIL   Rob Liefeld's entire career is "accidentally" ripping things off. At some point, you begin to doubt the "accidental" part.   Or Mr. E. Nygma (Mystery/Enigma)   They are: http://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_double_contractions   Fanfic. The actual Amalgam was Batman + Wolverine = Dark Claw and Lobo + Howard the Duck = Lobo the Duck.   Cautioning parents against creating a horrific fate for their children does not equal hating fat people.   Lex needs the suit if he wants to throw down with Superman; [Kingpin ain't afraid to scrap](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/10/104794/2122102-kingpin.jpg), and he damned sure ain't worried about what he's wearing.

I knew what you meant ;-)   Has anyone really been far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?    You are a genius.   They don't get the respect they deserve. I still wonder how The Incredibles got away with Elastigirl.   Lex Fisk or Wilson Luthor.   He'd basically just be a bigger, stronger, Lex Luthor, which would look just like Wilson Fisk.   More like Deadpool was a direct rip-off of Deathstroke that a talentless hack named Rob Liefeld "created" until better, more talented people came along and gave us the Deadpool we all know and love today.   Funny that the Batman VS Spider-Man's villains things has already been done (Batman Beyond).  Blight = Green Goblin  Shriek = Shocker  Drek = Kraven  Spellbinder = Mysterio  Inque = Venom   Batman actually has a suit that allows him to go toe-to-toe with Darkseid, so I don't think he has any use for Tony Stark's tech, money, or resources.   Inertron, Promethium, and Radion come to mind.   Seriously, [read this.](http://www.popmatters.com/post/176291-thor-who-its-beta-ray-bill/)   Not really. It's not the density of the bullet; it's the force with which it's projected.   Also, The Hulk has been so ridiculously overpowered in recent years that nothing surprises me anymore. I'd totally expect a story where he's tossed into the sun and he eats his way out.   You probably would've gotten it if it had been:       (Bane's real name) + Venom = Bane  Unfortunately, no one knows Bane's real name...   Rob Liefeld never "accidentally" ripped off anything; he just ripped shit off wholesale because he's a talentless hack.    And isn't Deadpool supposed to be a ripoff of Deadshot?  Deadpool *is* a rip-off of *Deathstroke*, not Deadshot, and no, he's wasn't "supposed to be." Deadpool was initially "created" by Rob Liefeld, a talentless hack who is notorious for ripping off characters and art. Fabian Nicieza was the first to realize it and he's the one who gave Deadpool his real name "Wade Wilson" as an obvious parody of Slade Wilson. In his early outings, he was a lethal assassin with enhanced abilities and healing with a mysterious past. He was Deathstroke in Spider-Man's costume.  Joe Kelly is probably most responsible for the Deadpool we know and love today. What started off as a total rip-off turned into one of the most original and fun characters in comics.   I actually prefer vanilla, but I'm not going to get all upset about it.   Eyeball muscles is the best superpower I've heard of since [Arm Fall Off Boy](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/15659/3097751-arm-fall-off_boy-edited.jpg).   I always felt like Marvel missed out on "Doctopus."   Scarlet Red Spider Hood!   It sounds like the device nullifies anti-life though, which would mean it's really a life equation. The double-negative bothers me.   I underestimated the potency of 2CE once and that's the only time the kind of psychedelic experiences you see in movies ever happened to me. At first it was the usual abstractions, geometric patterns, animations, but as the intensity turned up, I went out on the balcony to smoke and I watched a tree across the street turn into a fire breathing dragon. When I went back inside everything was way too animated and out-of-control. I decided to go to bed and try to sleep it off, which eventually kind of worked. I had never had a bad trip before and wasn't eager to start.      Don't act like there wasn't any superiority implied with your constant insistence that "well, yeah, maybe but Marvel still does it more"  There wasn't, but you're more than welcome to continue thinking there was.  I said Marvel has ripped off DC more than DC has ripped off Marvel, which is true. I went on to cite examples. Not once did I say or imply either brand is better than the other. That would be akin to saying chocolate is better than vanilla.   Anti-Life Gauntlet could've worked though.   True, but SHAZAM is a straight up wizardry not to mention a ridiculous powerhouse in his own right. I really think a SHAZAM/Thor hybrid would destroy Superman.   I think Bucky/Jason Todd is an even more obvious parallel.   You're reading a lot more into what I wrote than what is actually there.  Relax? I couldn't be more relaxed.  Admit that there's more than I think? I'm pretty sure I just did since you were able to think of a few DC rip-offs of Marvel that I didn't.  Stop waving around my big dumb DC-is-better flag? I was never doing that to begin with so I can't very well stop now can I?   Saying Marvel has ripped-off DC properties numerous times and has done so more than DC has ripped-off Marvel is not the same as saying DC is better, although fantastic arguments as to which brand is better can certainly be made either way. I don't claim one is better; it's a matter of a taste. Personally, I prefer DC.    Right, but Deadstroke is new; Thanoseid has already been done.   I don't get their reasoning in adding the Ultimate Nullifier. That device is most strongly associated with Galactus and Reed Richards.   Finding the Anti-Life Equation by itself would make sense to impress Death.   A Batman/Spider-Man team-up against Riddler   Mysterio has great potential for exactly those reasons.  Too bad we don't get Marvel/DC crossovers anymore since the buyouts.    [It really is.](http://th01.deviantart.net/fs70/PRE/i/2014/060/7/e/the_scarlet_speedster_by_robertmacquarrie1-d78ikq1.jpg)   [Truly.](http://orig14.deviantart.net/eccc/f/2014/191/e/7/amalgam_comic__wolverine_and_lobo__by_alexbadass-d7q5zzr.png)   [Probably.](http://40.media.tumblr.com/c095c474a0f6aa64209f5d125c521917/tumblr_nicsefdDri1r811rmo1_1280.png)   Working onomatopoeia into a character name.  I like it.   You're right; I thought /u/lovers_acid was asking about something else.   In an ideal world, Disney and Warner Bros. would say, "Hey, Marvel VS DC and the subsequent Amalgam Comics was a pretty big deal in the 90s. That was *before* blockbuster summer comic book movies were a thing. Imagine the riches..."   [Like this?](http://orig06.deviantart.net/2ed8/f/2009/078/b/6/b61d7b68b5c17f9ff2f62217a106d916.jpg)   You mean I'm not the only one who thinks [this](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110710044111/marvel_dc/images/f/f4/Supergirl_Vol_6_1_Textless.jpg) look ridiculous?   It was a tough week for Peter Wayne.  Or Bruce Parker.  Thank goodness for Aunt May Pennyworth.   You could probably add the modern version of [Despero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Despero) as DC's rip-off of its own Mongul which was a rip-off of Marvel's Apocalypse which was a rip off of Marvel's Thanos which was a rip-off of DC's Darkseid.   We'll always have [Iron Lantern](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/6/67663/2169758-iron_lantern.jpg).    Hyperion is part of Squadron Supreme/Sinister which is an intentional send-up of the Justice League in response to people accusing the Avengers of ripping off the Justice League.  Which is hilarious on Marvel's part and a perfect response.  In return, DC Comics has "[Earth 8](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Earth-8)" as part of its 52 world multiverse, which is a blatant [Marvel parody](http://www.dccomics.com/characters/earth-8).   What's wrong with Flulk?  You wouldn't like Barry Banner when he's angry.  Or Bruce Allen.    [The Amalgam Universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amalgam_Comics), the result of [Marvel VS DC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_vs._Marvel).   Under Warner Bros and Disney ownership, I doubt we'll ever see anything like that ever again.   It was cool coming of age in the 90s...   Some of these are pretty good, but some are way off.  Swamp Thing   Man Thing debuted within weeks of each other and there's no possible way one creator could have been aware of the other's creation. Call it a cosmic coincidence.  Black Mask is nothing like Red Skull. For one, he wears a mask as opposed to Red Skull being a deformed freak. The first word that comes to mind when I see "Red Skull" is "Nazi." The first word that comes to mind when I see Black Mask is "gangster." Red Skull is basically Hitler whereas Black Mask is basically Al Capone. Red Skull does things as lofty as attempting world domination and even cosmic conquest. Black Mask concerns himself with organized crime in Gotham City.  I get the Blackest Night/Marvel Zombies comparison, but they're really quite different. For one, MZ was an out-of-mainstream continuity story and everyone was zombies. Blackest Night was in-canon, did a lot to further expand the Green Lantern mythos, created a top villain out of a forgotten B-side villain, and the only "zombies" were already deceased DC Comics characters.  The Jason Todd/Red Hood   Buck/Winter Soldier thing is superb.   Might as well say The Flash + The Hulk = God. There'd be little practical difference.   Moon Knight + Midnighter = Moonighter?     I always thought Batman and Moon Knight were the most obvious mashups, but they combined Moon Knight with Nightwing to make [Moonwing](http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix/moonwing1.jpg).   [It's been done.](http://amalgamfanon.wikia.com/wiki/Iron_Bat)   Fixed it; thank you.   A bit on-the-nose, but yeah.   Yes, but that's not a comic book company ripping off their only true rival. Also, DC's Batman and Superman both had a number of inspirations, neither was a direct rip-off of anything else. That's patently different than two major companies existing as direct competition to one another and one far more often than the other ripping off its rival and doing so blatantly.  Bumblebee is really the only DC Comics character that I've noticed who was just outrageously obvious a rip-off of a Marvel one.   The Creeper has been around since the 60s. I last saw him in an issue of Katana within the past year or so.   Right, but Thanoseid already exists as part of Amalgam; Deadstoke didn't.    Pow Wow Boom Boom Smith  By far my favorite name to come out of the whole event.  Also, I absolutely loved the way [Magneto](http://i.imgur.com/Q7kZaSU.jpg) looked.     True, but Thanoseid is a thing and Deadstroke isn't.   Yeah, just in the Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel styles.   Yeah, but you can't blame Marvel   DC for combining their two best-selling characters at the time (Wolverine + Batman = Dark Claw).   Plus, combining The Creeper and Nightcrawler made visual sense. Still, Wolverine   Creeper's powers are fairly similar and they do have a nice visual complement.    I didn't, but when you say this:   I am positive I could identify a counter example to each one listed, thus showing that it is much more even.  and then don't, that's pretty weak.  You're basically saying, "I can totally prove you wrong, but I don't feel like it."   He could positively wreck Superman. Thor is already on threat level to Supes, but add magic? Might as well give him a pocket full of Kyptonite while you're at it.   [Steel.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steel_%28John_Henry_Irons%29)   Party, yes. Clark Kent is based on Harold Lloyd and his name comes from Clark Gable and Kent Taylor. Inspiration for Superman was drawn by stories of Samson and Hercules, Flash Gordon, Philip Wylie's novel "Gladiator," and Doc Savage. Metropolis is so-called because of the classic Fritz Lang science fiction film.   Funny you mention the "Biblical" aspects; Superman is an easy parallel to Moses as well.   [Here.](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Thanoseid_%28Amalgam_Universe%29)   Yes, [everything is a remix](http://everythingisaremix.info/), but I disagree that it's pointless to debate. Actually, it's downright interesting in many cases. If anyone really cares about a character, it's worth noting what inspired said character, rip-off or not.   To fair, Amalgam had some terrible names too.  Skulk  Winterstick  Abominite  Two-Faced Goblin  Bizarnage  Shatterstarfire  Ra's-A-Pocalypse  Aurora Trigger  M-Parasiteplate  Northstar Trigger  Pow Wow Boom Boom Smith  Shaggynaut  Thunderchick  Fin Fang Flame  Medusa Moonrider  Ultivac the Multi-Robot  Mandarinestro  Chemodam  Paste-Eater Pete  Scavulture     I have the entire collection.   And they say Superman is overpowered...   True, but Deadpool looks kind of cool with a half-mask and pirate boots.   [Link](http://www.amalgam.wikia.com/wiki/Super-Soldier) for the lazy.   I'm not Eric Guzman, but it's funny you bring up Apocalypse because Apocalypse is a rip-off of Thanos is a rip-off of Darkseid. To get even weirder, DC ripped off Thanos, a rip-off of their own Darkseid, to create Mongul.    Yes and kinda.   No argument here.   Because [Thanoseid](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Thanoseid_%28Amalgam_Universe%29) is already a thing and because [Thanos is a rip-off of Darkseid](http://comicsalliance.com/knockoff-characters-comics/), hence the similarities.    True, but if you go all the way back to DC's earliest stuff, they weren't ripping off Marvel of course, but Batman and Superman both take their inspirations and some vital characteristics from other works of fiction.  For example, the original Batman was a mix of Sherlock Holmes, Zorro, a Leonardo da Vinci sketch of a bat-winged flying machine, The Shadow, and even a pulp fiction serial called The Bat.   No problem. If anyone knows of any other times it has been broken, feel free to correct me, but I'm pretty sure that's it. Marvel has been pretty good about sticking to "the shield is indestructible" canon.   [Yes I have and it was one of the happiest comic book moments I've ever had.](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_super/11/113883/2164436-deadpool_vs_deathstroke.jpg)   1. I've been following both brands for three decades and I can think of way more examples of Marvel ripping off DC than the other way around, as I've shown.  2. Please do.  3. Exactly right. For example, although Deadpool *was* a blatant rip-off of Deathstroke when Rob Liefeld introduced the character, Slade and Wade are nothing alike and the characters have much less in common now than they did then. Plus, things like The Avengers being a rip-off of the Justice League are fairly superficial. Whether DC thought to combine a bunch of their A-list heroes or not, someone would have thought to eventually.   Now we just need to combine Riddler and Kingpin...  ...oh, yeah.  [The Big Question.](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Edward_Fisk_%28Amalgam_Universe%29)   You're not wrong, but more often-than-not, it's more fair to say Marvel rips off DC.  Deathstroke - Deadpool  Green Arrow - Hawkeye  Darkseid - Thanos  The Penguin - The Owl  Suicide Squad/Checkmate/Secret Six - Thunderbolts  Deadshot - Bullseye  Green Lantern Corps - Nova Corp  Doom Patrol - X-Men  Catwoman - Black Cat  Superman - Gladiator/Hyperion/The Sentry  Justice League - Avengers  That being said, DC ripped off Wasp with Bumblebee and Namor with Aquaman. There's probably others, but Marvel is much more thieving of DC than the other way around.   Being that [Deadpool was originally a Rob Liefeld rip off of Deathstroke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpool#1990s), the similarities are already blatant.  Nicieza contacted Liefeld, saying "this is Deathstroke from Teen Titans." Nicieza gave Deadpool the real name of "Wade Wilson" as an inside-joke to being "related" to "Slade Wilson," Deathstroke.   [Can't unsee.](http://www.timetravelcostumes.com/images/sci-fi-monarch-henchamn/monarch00.jpg)    They are too similar.  [Because Thanos is literally Marvel's rip off of Darkseid.](http://comicsalliance.com/knockoff-characters-comics/)   [It's been done.](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Thanoseid_%28Amalgam_Universe%29)   [Thanoseid has been done.](http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Thanoseid_%28Amalgam_Universe%29)   Captain America's shield is physically indestructible under normal conditions; while cosmic and godly opponents have broken the shield, the shield proves strong enough to absorb Hulk's strength, and repel an attack from Thor's mystical hammer Mjlnir without any visible damage.  It has only been destroyed a few times.   1. Molecule mean destroyed it, but reassembled it. He has absolute control of all matter, so that's a special exception.   2. Dr. Doom broke it, but he had the Beyonder's powers at the time, so he was basically a god-like being with limitless power. The Beyonder proper reassembled it like new.   3. Thanos, already possessing godlike power, was able to shatter it with the Infinity Gauntlet, which is again unlimited power. Nebula fixed it when she used the Gauntlet to undo everything Thanos did.  4. Thor has broken it twice, but required Odinforce the first time and Rune Magic the second time. The first time he fixed it, the second time that particular timeline was undone, so it's like it never happened.  5. Serpent, the Asgardian god of fear and Odin's brother broke it with his bare hands, but he's basically god. It was repaired magically and even stronger now.  So basically, you need omnipotent power and/or magic to destroy it. Due to the enhancements since the last time it was broken, magic is probably useless. Unless you have all the power of god, you can't break it.   To see more of Eric Guzman's art, click [here]( http://ericguzman.deviantart.com).

 Amen. i've been in the kitchen for years because I actually love what I do.I think some people just see it as a job and become bitter.   On my days off after a hard week I like to spend a few hours on video games on easy.I just want to blow stuff up, win races,kick some ass and not be challenged.It is a great way to blow off steam.   For a beginner Victorinox.   Never went,not in debt.   Not sure, but the few times I've tried to get into another line of work I just found myself wandering aimlessly on weekends and holidays wondering what the fuck to do.   Yhea,alot of fan boy type nonsense over there. So far I'm very happy with the Richmond.Mine is a 240mm extra tall in AEB-L steel,factory edge shaved hair but dragged a bit when I tried chopping instead of my usual rocking,a few strokes on a ceramic stick did the trick.I do plan on dressing this up with some stones and strops and expect it will take a pretty sick edge that can be maintained with a strop.Handle could be a bit fatter for my taste but not really an issue with a pinch grip.One thing that really impressed me was the nice edge rounding on the spine and below the handle,you rarely see this on a sub $100 dollar knife.Bottom line,I'm happy with this knife,but the saga continues and looking at the second tab I have open,I simply must have one of those sweet looking Northwoods.   Ha HA! Thank you for your interest. Yes this is a different photo from the one you saw,I posted this one to FB for some freinds. One knife I use all the time at work is a (GASP!) Guy Fieri knife,a tiny step up from the white handle crap you find  in any kitchen, but the ergonomics of it are great,I love the handle, it doesn't hold an edge well, but I can give it a good edge in a hurry off the back of a plate or a steel,nothing wrong with that, and it looks good to the custumers when they they walk through my kitchen to use the bathroom.I work in a tiny and very busy diner so this is importent. The bottom two in my pic Are what I use the most when we are rocking,these sit on my sandwich board and  chop/slice onions peppers shrooms ect.. on the fly. I like to give them fresh. I also use a Richmond Artifex for prep before we open.The top knife  is a Masakagi  and it will never see the diner,that one is a piece of art. I carry med stuff because I've had to wrap up too many kids with paper towels or whatever.Thank you again,it was good to get an intelligent response to one of my posts.   Recently was thrashed on another sub because I use low to mid-range knives at work and leave my good stuff home.Took this pic for FB and saw that it validates my choice.      Every time I'm asked for a recipe I chuckle to myself.Many years ago I asked my first boss,Mr Budini,about a recipe.He said and I quote "If ya gotta lookada recipe ya don know watta f***k ya doin,recipe for da baker ya dumb bastard!"I still laugh about that! Anyway I posted my "method" in a seperate comment,thanks for the interest!   I don't really use recipes or measure much but here goes,adjust amounts acording to how much you are making.Brown 2#of sausage links or rope and set aside(brown over charcoal if you want to go the extra mile!).Julienne 1/2 large onion and 2 large green peppers,chop 2 or 3 cloves garlic.Pour 2 cans stewed or plum tomatoes into a bowl and crush with your hand,(I prefer stewed).Saute' onions garlic and 1/3 of the peppers until nice and brown,deglaze the pan with beer,wine,water,whatever,cook of excess liquid and add tomatoes.Chunk up the sausage and add that.Simmer for 2 hours then add Italian spice to taste(I like a little cayanne for some back bite),and the remaining peppers.Simmer 1  more hour or so. Can be served over pasta or eaten on rolls. Hope this helps, thanks for the interest!   Use stew veal instead of sausage and you have a delicious old time favorite.This was a staple in italian restaraunts years ago but I don't see it done much anymore. I just buy the bread,flour and i don't get along!   Sausage and peppers, soon to be served over tortellini with big slices of buttery bread.      Victorinox has good knives in the $50 range.   My favorite toy was my mutha fukin fire truck bitch!   A modern version of Road Rash.   That everything is all about money. That is the bottom line,it's pounded into our heads from childhood on.   I know what you mean,I used my Masakagi at work a few times and spent the whole day worrying about chipping it.   If $100 is too much then Victorinox for about half that.   These are all $100 range and very nice. Richmond Artifex 240mm, Shun Sora 200mm and Kanetsugu Pro M 210mm. These are thin, (about 2mm) laser class blades with nice comfortable handles and good steel.The Shun had the best factory edge but after dressing them up on some stones they are about equal. One note, the Shun has a VG-10 edge and it is brittle, if you drop it it can break the tip.The other two are a high carbon moly stainless with the Pro M being sub zero quenched. Several months use with all three, and I can say I'm happy with all of them.      This was late 60's.   Dog fight snoopy.      Red Green.    Cable.   Thinkgeek has tons of stuff.   I tell them to seek counciling   Old Yeller,sniff.   Oh fer chrissakes,just wash the dirt off a bunch of live worms and pack them into a can!   I agree, the correct term would be ...Smoking or Chain smoking?   Bye the way, his yard is about 5 miles away.   Heard it on the scanner that day ,but couldn't place it.Next morning, I find the bill and say,They finally got the grease? Yep... and they dumped it right in my yard!   Yep, and DEC.       Wood chucks, because wood chucks must die.   Sooner or later yes,and then thugs will wear skirts above their ass   Steak tar-tar and artisian bread,what are you guys bitchen abought?   Better than selling oregano for pot.    Back in the 70's there was a helmet law protest in my home town, about 5,000 bikes showed up for this ride to the capital sans helmets. After some speeches and political stuff everyone went on a ten mile jam down the highway to a state park to party. Oh my God,kegs every where,naked people running around and general debauchery! There were several different clubs there and soon there were drag races going on the road and everyone was loving it. After a few runs the H A organized it and had guys directing traffic, flagging the racers and timing them.Then the city police showed up,guess what? They took over traffic control and let the races go on! Best day ever untill some asshole threw a bottle at a cop car and it all ended in a cluster fuck.   Dam! I've been wasting pancake mix all these years!   I use my good stuff at home.   HA HA! I am drunk now and your comment is making me laugh! If I treated my dick like my good knives I would be fucking high end classy girls. If I treated it like my beater,good lord, who knows what would happen! Thank you for your input and interest!   Ever see a kid cut herself real bad on a can lid or whatever,and the "First aid" box is empty as it always is?    Good comment,I understand super glue, but cornstarch?? Please inform me.   I work in a one man kitchen that can get insanely busy and there is not always time to worry about knife care.That is why I keep a beater knife around.   In that time I have chosen 3 knives that get the job done at work and my high end knves stay home.   Hey you never know when you might cut your dick!   For those interesed,Top is a Richmond 9 1/2" Artifex I use when I have to do a large amount of prep.Middle is a(GASP!) Guy fieri knife I use as a beater,I can throw it around, drop it whatever, doesn't chip or break and the shit steel will take an edge off the back of a plate or a steel.Bottom is an 8" Shun Sora that cuts like a laser. I use this on station while doing orders. Don't really need tongs,spoon,ect...as I gave up saute and night shifts years ago. I'm a chef in a small diner and my work is mostly soups ,stews and specials. First aid stuff because every kitchen should have that.   HA HA! I used to work with a tongs in pocket guy,we called him greasy ass!   Nope,that's my beater. No way I'm using a $150 Masakage in a 100mph kitchen.   Yhea I know,I take alot of shit about that but it's comfortable,takes a working edge off of anything and I can beat the shit out of it.   Fuck you noob,I've been in the kitchen longer than microwave ovens.   Just basic first aid stuff.   I love that little guy! Kind of brittle though,I've had to re-grind the tip twice.   Nah,but we have kids working here and there is never a band-aid when you need one.   Octopus and minnows and some weeds from out back,YUM!      This is so fucking old I saw it in readers digest long before the internet.   Both,my glass is half full but my bottle is half empty.   That bastard sure could cook!   fUCK YOU,You are a whiner. This is not the Opera show It's real life.   Asshole,do you think prices only go up for you?   True ,but if your books cover shows me a scarey  warrior type image,I mght be inclined to distrust you.    Fuck you ,you meatist!   Excuse me,have you reproduced?   Making coffee and bacon on a wood stove.   Nope,(pulls out giant Bowie) now that's a knife!   My response was,"Yup and you could squash alot of people with your truck,but that's not what it's made for."   Show boss my Kershaw scallion,"Oh, you could stab alot of people with that."   Dude,you're the cook fer chrisakes!If a server gives you shit,give that person a nice HOT plate once in a while or make their order vanish and claim they forgot to give it to you.If a fellow cook gives you shit,give that person a tap on the hand with your Hot spat,pan, whatever and say"Oh, sorry asshole".   Not really.if the knife starts to drag, a few strokes on medium then fine put it right.That is for good steel. When my beater(soft steel) starts to drag,It will take a working edge on just about anything.That is why I use both.This is maintence,all knives need to be sharpened on stones at some point, and questions abought stones and burrs are better asked of someone more informed than I am. Thanks for your interest!    It's a ceramic rod that I use for the for the beater knife in the middle,the other two I just strop now and then.   I'm an American,and while I may not agree with what you're fucking,I defend your right to fuck It.   To carry my knives and possibles to work.      No wonder Ken Block blasts through there at 100mph!   Tourist,"I'll start with a mucho hoyty latte de femme and I'd like to see your gluten free vegetarian options". My waitress,"OK,regular coffee and a bowl of oatmeal then?" Happens all the time at my work!   You don't get "Murdered",you commit suicide by shooting yourself twice in the head.    If you were not born in Ireland,you are not Irish.    Been there done that!   Blah ,Blah a whiney piece of shit,at least he inspired Allison chains.   Fuck you ,a person who shits in a box has nothing to do with smoking.I can't believe this shit!   Hint B.V.   Rules say no names, hint B.V.   A very famous singer, dancer, entertainer from the 60's and 70's chewing his son a new ass over some equipment  screw up at the local theater.It struck me funny that the guy I grew up watching sing and dance on TV with the 50,000 watt smile,was calling his son a motherfuckin stupid son of a bitch. I still laugh when I think about that.    Mr Bones!   Dubai and China town NYC come to mind off the top of my head,then the sex trade,drug trade,ect you name it.It still goes on      Drop some shrooms in her Dew and try again!   There's a Dog house over yonder,that's where my baby stays.   HA HA! Had this happen to me in a bar on a third date,first date was "I've got a hit of acid and I love to fuck when I trip!".That was 30 years ago and we're still together,I say go for it!   The "under God" part was a politcal stunt passed in the 50's I believe.   It depends on your needs. Fine grain high hardness steei is good for kitchen or craft work while a softer  easier to sharpen steel would be better for camping and such as it is less brittle.   This idiot...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXRaboSo70A   Adressing me as "chief","boss","sport"...ect.   Better than you would think for such a small blade.      HA HA! I'm a chef and can truthfully say that you just described most of the celebrity chef shows on TV!   Got a good laugh at this!   Spot on!

 Thanks for the shout out, Merica!  Oh man...who would I choose for my actors? Honestly, they probably wouldn't be big name actors. Lee I've always pictured as Alexander Skarsgard, probably because of his role on the HBO series Generation Kill (great book and show, btw). But the others I really never came up with casting wish lists for.   Well, that depends on your definition of "kid." When I was too young to read for myself, my pops would read Lord of the Rings to us kids. Which was awesome. When I learned to read, I thought Bunnicula was amazing. And I still do.  Then, when I actually got into adult books, I devoured anything by Dean Koontz. Then I had a Chuck Palahniuk phase. Still think those are all great books. Hard to choose a favorite among them though.  I wasn't allowed to watch TV as a kid. So...that was probably why I loved reading!   No rest for the wicked, brotha. I quit my job, so it's write or die now! I got a stand-alone book out being shopped, and I'm working on part one of three of a new series.  Thanks for reading!  	3

 Probably way too late for the party again but here it goes anyway:  When I was little, about 8 or so, I lived by the coast of Belgium (still do) A coasttram would drive along the coast in loops, stopping in all cities. Now, this thing drives in a bedding between the 2 roads the follow the same route, so naturally, alot of people cross it daily. There have been accidents before but they're pretty noisy so you can hear them coming wich gives you quite some time (they don't tend to go fast).  That day, I was on my way to the store when an eldery couple ok bikes wanted to cross the tracks. A tram was coming but they still had more then enough time. The man went first and got over just fine. His woman was next and the tram was getting pretty close now.  She fell because her front wheel got stuck in the tracks. Being old and less mobile, she couldn't get up in time.  The tram was too close to come to a standstill and ran her over at maybe 15 kmph but still, it was enough to run her over and drag her for a meter or 10. I watched it all in what seems like a slow-motion and stood there untill an ambulance showed up and put a tent over her remains. Needless to say, it wasn't a pretty sight.  Ps: sorry for bad formatting, on my phone      In that case, they're not doing a really good job in my experience   'Graves no flash'   Yes, buried..   Why do things like this always get made by asians people? More particular the Japanese? So twisted..   What??   I have an entire skeleton made of real bones and 2 skulls, 1 fake and 1 real one. And yes, it would fit in my closet! But why have him there when I can have him next to my bed with a tie around his neck?   Probably way too late here but whever.. I have a skeleton in my room. Not a metaphorical one but an actual skeleton. My mother gave it to me a couple of years ago. She bought it when she was in uni, because she had to study all the bones and such.. Apperantly they're pretty rare now, since you can no longer buy them that easy.   Subtle, I like it   First one that came to my mind aswell, beyond messed up   One of the best hip-hop albums of the moment in my opinion! Love his style   'I'm on that weird part of Yt again..'   Blue side seems to be OP on kata   Make that 10, go check out /r/lounge!   I love this game, so rewarding finally beating the zombie one on brutal!   I totally agree, this was the first time I felt sincerely bad for a player recieving this kind of hate on reddit as he seems to be the one that deserves it the least, such a nice guy   You don't have to make a new account every time you do this, just use www.10minutemail.com. Also very usefull for when sites demand you to register in order to do something but you don't want the spam that goes with it   Same-sex marriage and marihuana. Those 2 combined is pretty rare I'de say   To be fair, Z at the end of WoL was kinda bs once they got to broods/infestor   It' NSFL, meaning Not Safe For Life. The more you know..   Watched Notorious again today for like the 8th time but fuck, what an awesome movie   I don't feel like this is normal anymore aswell: http://img547.imageshack.us/img547/9623/lolprob.png   I chuckled   It's not as simple, they're both doing it for obviously very different reasons, one to exploit the system and gain undeserved elo, the other one to have fun playing with some fellow LCS players. And honestly, I doubt anyone on the opposite team would of cared, thing are more relaxed   Nope! Like Griffie said, it's called Mayday and actually a pretty good read, would definatly advise!   Tyler?   My most used way was to write formulas/key notes on a metal ruler with a pencil. Not only do you hardly notice it from a distance, if you're afraid you might get caught, 1 swipe is enough to remove everything. Bonus: very easy prep   Drive over the speed limit on highways. Quite a bit, here the limit is 120km/h, left lane usually goes around 130-140 but whenever it's 'safe' to do so, meaning I have the space, I set my cruise control anywhere between 160 and 180, depending on traffic, 200+ at night when the road's totally empty.  I guess I do it because I like to go places fast and believe 120 is way too slow, look at Germany, simular sized roads have no speed regulation at all (or 250..)  TL,DR: driving fast on highways, 120 km/h is bs   Is it the book in wich the army accidently shoots a commercial jet, leaving some survivors in it and then debates wether if they should shoot it down to get rid of the evidence? Because I liked that one!   Ezreal definatly gets my vote. The flash-E dodgesn max range Q's.. Sounds awesome!   I have found that if you can get to late and have a team that actually peels for you, Kog wrecks anything   I'm at  148 and feel left out :(   If he can continue doing stuff like this I feel like Riot doesn't stand up for the values they stand for (or claim they do)   Is it just me or is this final alot more predictable then the EU one?   Perhaps because the only time he gets to 1v1 is when the opposite team's top is on equal or higher level as him. Thus resulting in more losses. If he would get 1v1's in all matches, I bet he would stomp most opponents   This is brilliant, I wish there were shows like this here in Belgium, would make politics alot more interesting   Heca top here I come   Thank you! Can't watch twitch vods on mobile   This my me trip so bad   You should take all of your poems and bundle them, they're awesome   I have found mine. Somehow I ended up in a relationship with it, every day is a fight. [Patience] skill almost maxed in the process tough   Thank you for making me laugh like a retard while having dinner with my parents in a otherwise very calm restaurant   Saving this for later!   This.Is.Epic.   You shouldn't have I'm afraid.  	46
 i would disagree, wizards already puts out the basis for magic the gathering as an animated property with its set trailers,  animated does not necessarily mean for children,  look how clone wars is done or avatar,  you can have serious themes like war and politics with humor and it still be an amazing show.  that being said magic's already expansive cast of characters would be amazing on screen, plus planeswalker action figures   i was thinking more along the lines of a show based on the lore of the game as opposed to the game itself   So i was watching the mtg set trailers, and it made me want a magic cartoon series soooo badly.  does anyone else want one as well?   do yo think that there could be a viable t.v. series of fear street marketed to the older teen aged crowd?  ghosts of fear street is still my favorite series of books to this day   again when ours were opened i saw two u/b walkers come from the same pack and several other instances of random in the seed pack,  mine was random   saw one opened not two hours ago and a r/g pw and elspeth in it   those of you opening the pre-re packs they are random not predetermined like previously thought   its an animated short that feels very much like D d and its silent, i saw it posted here before but i cant remember the name   actually i do classic enchantress g/w with armadillo cloak and ancestral masks         i think he is a free agent  	12
 Yep.i would have taken it over that shirts ending.    I see what the problem is. Never live on a farm that looks that creepy.

Yet, I work in an open kitchen and the questions I get sometimes make my blood boil.   "is there any dairy in the new England clam chowder?"  "do you have gluten free bread. No? Okay, I'll just get the wheat"    I thought only in America he acted like this?    Or its "reality tv"    In the trenches of Vietnam we not only got swamp foot, we got ourselves swamp gas.    Hear hear.    No! That shit still looked horrible.    Whatever, tater salad.    That last Indiana Jones movie was a travesty but there have been some amazing movies filmed here. Off the top of my head there is Amistad, It Happened to Jane, Let's Scare Jessica to Death, The Ice Storm, The Family Stone, Revolutionary Road, The Stepword Wives...im sure plenty of others but some good shit has been filmed here.

No questions needed. I understand the platform this sub wants. The majority spoke. Thanks for showing me your liberty bell ways. :)    Good point. Back to the dark side...soon.   agreed, yet someone is always going to be upset about something being removed. Again, I am going to mod the fuck out of this sub when it comes to anything you mentioned...because the majority agrees.    /r/ctbeer   elephantitis?   I could have ignored it and done what we have always been doing but the majority was upset about this stuff. This is what I'm talking about.    The post came from a local clubs reddit account. How is me removing that childish?    it's too bad for some people. You guys spoke and a certain someone doesnt like how its going and many of you agreed (a majority) so I deleted a few things. They had upwords of 30 upvotes and were about a cool band playing around here but sadly the post came from the venue. :(    it seems the majority of this sub doesnt like this kind of post so its being removed.    Believe me it does.    I met the Easter bunny   It's about time.    Always interesting when Lyme disease comes up as I live in old Lyme.    I had one on the tip of my dick.

That was amazing.    never been able to find Kattan doing Oates.   seriously, whats a guy to do to find the Kattan skit of Oates?   and stomped with soccer cleats.   *sort of*   Well, the death is still pretty funny too.    All I really had cable for still was AMC and local news. I learned that my location wouldn't pick up my news station. So, I went to there website and they stream it live.  The side effect is no commercials. It's just goes to a blank screen saying well be back shortly. I stream it to my smart TV and  I'm all set. Yay.   All in all I have noticed a huge difference in my screen time. I used to have a habit of turning on my TV, my laptop and my ipad to record music etc. Now my entire TV area is unplugged and I only turn it on to use Netflix of the random ps3 game. I bought a chromebook and the battery is amazing. Definitely saving on electricity for sure.    Ruth seeing her husband and first born before dying.       ah, great. thank you.

It's not like incognito makes your searched invisible. Just that they don't show up in your history. They still use that data I believe.    Oh and if you're invited to a wedding and fail to mention one of your many allergies to the couple don't be upset that when it's dinner time it may take a bit to get the plain boiled chicken you asked us for (2 minutes into dinner servive) as we are putting out a duet of short ribs and salmon for 200 people.

 At a rave in southern California called Escape from Wonderland in 2014.   Armin would be fantastic because of all the other djs you would meet. I'm not so sure I would want to listen to every one of his sets though. Haha   You probably wouldn't play many shows then, since he doesn't really like spinning that much.   PvD was drunk off his ass the last time I saw him. His mixing was horrible and only topped by his, even worse, track selection. A huge disrespect to the thousands of fans he is PAID to perform for.   Art is so subjective   Crack head crimes   If you knew anything about making fresh pasta, you would know that you cannot make it "al dente." Fresh pasta should have a slight chewiness to it.  Al dente is not even an Italian "thing."    I would disagree. Yes, the questions are topical but what John says very much reflects my sentiments.   People should embrace change and advances in technology. It applies for everything else in the world, and so too for the dj world.   You just typed a transcript of my entire sexual career.   [Here's one I recorded over the weekend. Tracks from Lostly, Indecent Noise, John Askew,   Liam Melly] (https://youtu.be/xBBf9xeiFqY)  Let me know if it sucks.

Its actually relatively easy to do it yourself. Go into any Auto zone and they sell a oil change "deal" that includes all the things you need including an air filter for a reasonable price. All you really need is a screwdriver and to get your hands a little dirty, but an oil change is super easy.   Air filter?  Screw driver?    Last time I checked,  you don't need an air filter for an oil change.  Maybe you meant oil filter?     Gato   Using five 20% coupons at once would save you 67.232%   Are you done yet?

No, but seriously, I did turn off notifications afterwards. It's annoying that the default of the app is to bomb you with notifications.   So you don't think attention to detail is important?  Do you think it's okay to make small, preventable mistakes? It would seem like it from your attempts to rationalize the whole thing.   A massive wall of notifications from the redfin app   /r/djs is definitely the sub for beginner djs and all around noobs! Or at least that's what one would deduce from most of the threads posted here.    I give a shit about spelling because it reflects on a person's character. Someone who can't be bothered to use the correct pronoun contraction not only shows their lack of education, but it shows they lack the attention to detail required to function at a high level.  Sometimes a mistake is a mistake, but why let a simple spelling or grammar error undermine your whole argument?      I'm more upset that no one seems to know how to use this meme. This is "malicious advice mallard" aka a duck that gives bad advice. It's NOT an angry duck.   Make the distinction people!  /rant   (cat 2 was a fat old fuck)  Excuse me!?

You have the job now, it pays well, stay with it since it makes more sense financially. You always have the option to go to college later on.  Not having a degree won't impact your hireability (is that a word?) since you'll have your work experience to back you up.  To paraphrase a friend.     You may be a college graduate applying for the entry level manager position, but the guy that dropped out of high school to work for the company, applying for the same position, has 6 years experience on you and he already works there.

And the actual word I'm trying to type never even appears on the suggestion box.   Somebody's been watching too much food network.   A urologist perhaps?    So do I.   (   )   I think your estimate is off if you are truly walking around on your whole shift. When I used to be a nurse, I'd walk something like 14 miles in a shift.

 Startup  Sell out  Cash in  Bro down   Yup, that was the retirement plan.  Buy a house for $400k, wait 15 years, sell it for $2M+ then move back to our rental house where cost of living is less than half and no traffic.   I know they are transitioning companies, they are waiting for "him to leave".  It looks like they are trying to re establish proper business practices.  It did seem very seat of their pants environment until I dealt with the managers   I love the hyperbolic way any drag race video is described.   "Lambo gets annihilated by this dude " and it's like a 1 car length win.   I'll never stop.   However, the place that is serving this probably isn't in Phoenix and also not a place you would go immediately after clocking out.   I've applied, but I still haven't received my Handi Cap.   I was just there last week.  They were looking into buying things that I sell.  They had all kinds of misters all over the place and workers hosing down places everywhere. I didn't see any dust while walking around.  They are recycling materials that they get from other divisions of the company that do construction and demolition    It varies from state to state.  After the recession ended, most of the states stopped the extensions.  The federal unemployment is 6 months.   I can control my Spotify on my 360.  Just basic skip and what not, but that's all I was looking to do   The fact that Bend, Or didn't even make the list makes me doubt the validity of there magazine   Hey, Hillbilly.  Not now...Not EVER   Looks more like a modded Ferrari 360. But maybe that's the point?   MAKE ME A BICYCLE, CLOWN!   And the big 4 are?   Or Seattle   Yeah it's right around $25k   http://i.imgur.com/Z77ZMKc.gifv   Isn't that hearsay evidence?  If the cop that scanned you wasn't the one to write the ticket, how can the cop that pulled you over give you a ticket to something he personally didn't witness?  I'm sure both the ticketing cop and the one that operated the radar gun would have to come report to court if you challenged it.   [Speed kills...your pocketbook](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BKdbxX1pDw)   Yeah, that's a new update, but the traffic incidents and accident alerts have been showing up for a long long while for me.  Seattle could have been a test market.   http://www.danielfashions.com/   Daniel   My factory charging cable was DOA, so the VZW store gave me a 3rd party one.  This one has a little LED that lights up when you hold it and goes off when you are either charging or not touching it.  After a few days, the light will stay on all day every day, and then after a few more days, the connector got to 135 degrees.  I  swapped it out for another one and it is doing the same thing, but not getting too hot yet.    I think the turbo charger is breaking this aftermarket cord.  I've ordered some longer non-lit ones and hopefully it's going to be ok.   I have a guy that only works on referrals.  I was able to get a shirt, coat (with custom lining and embroidered), pants, cuff links, 2 ties, done in 2 days or less for $500.  All high quality custom stuff.  The main catch?  He's in Hong Kong, but does visit the states in the summer for new/existing clients.   Not too sure, but Project Cars is the closest thing to simulating it.   The BBB is yelp before yelp.  It's a private organization that you pay to have a rating on.   I took my 10" sub and the 1000w amp from my old car and just had a shop custom make an enclosure that fits behind the wheel well and the rear of the trunk.  The sub is under the floor board.  Everything else is factory.   Been working like a champ for years    Opensignal.com  Good site.  So here's my issue.  I travel for work, so I'm all over the states that I cover.  Sometimes these locations are out in the middle of nowhere and I need to be able to pull up their info from salesforce.com or call them to make sure we are still on or have to change the times we are scheduled to meet.  If I only lived and worked in the bigger city ( Seattle...Where T-Mobile's HQ is, Tri cities, Spokane)  Then it would be a non issue since they are mostly the same.  http://puu.sh/hWZa1/d288744fcf.jpg - Verizon 3g/4g coverage  http://puu.sh/hWZfE/4f575d052e.jpg - TMO 3g/4g  http://puu.sh/hWZhm/4bd0419c6f.jpg - Sprint.   If you look at all the little pockets of places where VZW has decent 3G/4G coverage, it's clear that there is way better coverage in way more places in WA.  It's even more apparent in Oregon.  If you zoom out a bit more, it's laughable.   http://puu.sh/hWZEn/181dd5fcbe.jpg --TMO http://puu.sh/hWZGS/e7252bc5fe.jpg --VZW.  I would love to stop over paying VZW, but where I go, coverage is king.   I used to sell all the major carriers from 2008-2010.  So that's the last back end exp I have.   We dealt with AOL's all the time and the new credit check was the only thing that stopped people from swapping owners.  The kid would have to have a $400 deposit in order to take the line over.   Hadn't heard of the selling of accounts.  I guess those bastards ruined it for the rest of them.   I'm in the same boat.  My business phone is Google voice.  So I can't lose that.  I also don't know if Fi will have the coverage I need.  I travel all over for work.  Vzw coverage is just too good in rural areas to leave as it is.    I'd like someone to try it out before I do   I don't see how that is allowed.  That's the whole point of the AOL.  Same plans/phones...Just new person responsible for the bill.  I know it'll be pending a credit check, but that's no reason to force a plan change   pretty sure this was the deleted scene that wasn't allowed on TV.   I doubt it would hurt it.  Remember, everything is only worth what other people are willing to pay.   The stillen exhaust is really nice for subtle sound vs stock. Decent power gain too   I passed it today also. It was just west of Richland wa.  Probably heading to central wa on i90   I passed that same car today. About 10 miles east of Richland wa.   What's your usage been like?   Any modifications? (rom or what not?)   I've heard that matte finishes are NOT for daily driver cars.  They really collect and hang on to every little bit of dust/dirt/grime out there.  That and it's hand wash only.  I remember going to the international auto show a few years back and both BMW and Hyundai had matte paint jobs on their display cars.  They were roped off and you weren't even allowed to touch them.  Looks cool, but I wouldn't want to deal with the day to day of matte.   Yeah, I'm saying that all commuter cars should be automated.  Only those of us that actually LIKE driving will be out there in control. My sports car / touring car will always have me behind the wheel.   If they even report it.   Update: the Att store was able to reach the houstonian and they are going to ship the phone to them   I was looking in to an Anytime Fitness Franchise.   Everything in the contract stated that I had to pay no matter what happened.  Even if they do things to hurt my membership numbers.  Similar to Quizno's, they could have upped the rates of all the equipment used to run the place at anytime and there was nothing I could do about it.  They control the entire process.  They also wanted an unlimited personal guarantee. They wouldn't budge on this.  They wanted to be able to take EVERYTHING I HAD, unlimitedly, in order to get what the contract stated.  On top of that I had to sign another similar deal for the lease of the building.  In the end it would have cost over 1 million in startup and fees over 5 years, and I wouldn't have anything to show for it because I really didn't own anything. I was leasing everything.  I could see if you had the money to startup 6 of them in decent areas, you could make a pretty penny, but it wasn't right for where I was at at that time.   That's disheartening   That's the standard practice for those of us that want to keep our GV number.  You should be fine   Yup   Airport lost and found won't know how to take the IMEI, lookup the  account and call the owner to let them know where it is.   I came in to Seatac very late last night and I found a high end smartphone sitting on a bench while waiting for the shuttle to pick me up.  The battery was dead, so I charged it up and turned it on, but it had a lock pattern, no emergency contacts and the SIM card was already cancelled.  I went to a local store that matched the carrier and they said that the person was from Houston. I left it with them, so they can contact the owner.  **TL:DR  If you are/were visiting Seattle in the last day or so and lost your phone, it's at the carrier store at the mall in Lynnwood, Wa.**  Good luck.   Not done yet because I still have some mods I want to do. But there is a local shop that specializes in the vq motors   I like how it was David, Michael, Chris, back to Michael, then Jose for a long while in Texas.     The most popular is uprev.  A tuning company installs the software on your cars computer over writing the factory parameters.  Then they adjust things to get the most HP out of the mods you have installed using a dyno. You also get better throttle response and you can have different modes for different used ( more fuel economy, race gas, etc)   The most bang for the buck performance wise is the same as any na car.  Intake/exhaust and CPU remapped.    I like stillen parts personally.  Most power and best (not Rice like) sound   Call the ones that are currently running in different cities.  Ask if you can speak to the manager or owner.  Once you get them on the line, tell them what info you are after and if they don't have time right then to go into it, schedule a time where you can talk for longer.    Make sure to have specific questions to ask and write everything down so you can recall it later   Our mortgage on a brand new 4bd house is about what op is looking at in between Lynnwood and bothel. It's an hour to downtown most days, but the park and ride helps to not pay for parking downtown   I sell equipment to scrap yards.  They ID everyone and over a certain dollar amount they send checks.  They also have to hold stuff from the public for a certain timeframe before selling it.   Isn't that also called 2?   My friend got hit with something similar from another mod.  All the reviews said it was good, but the accounts were 1 day old   I'm 35 and lived in a place that is known for having tons of amazing local breweries.  I can't stand anything but the ciders   No, you don't. But you should do a refresher if its been over a year   I did my stillen cat back on 2 jack stands. It would have been way better on a lift, but it was doable   Idiocracy anyone?    I bet that the CEO would blow $500 on a single dinner.  In drinks alone.  I am willing to bet that if you were 5 minutes late(measured by a machine) that some asshole manager shit on you and put you on probation.  At Best Buy, that was the one thing people got fired for like 90% of the time.  Easiest way to get rid of problem workers, and an easy way for middle management to show upper management that they were actually doing something.  In a more serious note, there might be something to the "entitlement generation" but I see it more as a generation that was told "you need to go to college so you don't have to have a laborers job.  Those jobs are for losers"    I'm in the 1978-1997 generation and that's all I was told by my parents, my friends were told the same thing.  Now we are the same people that have over $1 Trillion in college debt with blue collar workers aging and declining.  Someone with a masters degree in education might make $40k a year and have 6 years of school to pay for, while someone that was an apprentice electrician for the same time could make twice that after reaching journeyman with no debt.  But we sure as hell weren't given that as an option.    THAT is the actual result of this "entitlement generation"   I think that was shrapnel from whatever exploded. It seemed to be from beyond the truck where that guy was.   "learn to swim..."   Well it does what I wanted it to do. I had the same application, landscape CD player mount in the car and wanted to have the home screen in landscape mode   Will this work like normal, but everything will be either landscape or portrait depending on the sensor?   The leading statement when you question things in a corporate environment.   "Help me understand why..." this policy is in place etc.   It's hard to over state my satisfaction   I kinda had the same thing but sooner.  19, move out  21 making $600/wk take home while going to school  22, have kid  23 move back in to parents house  25 finally get a job with health coverage  26 buy first house  29 making the most I've ever made  30 fired from good job, now trying self employment, but no longer have child support to pay (longer story)  31 barely making any money, have to refinance the house  32 meet future wife, get married  35 this months paycheck will be larger than the median yearly income in the US, own 2 houses and both cars are paid off.  lots can change from year to year.    I heard they aren't even touching his story line this season   Women report false rape claims, man goes to jail.  Even when it's proven that it was false, they don't get any real punishment.  so yeah, things like this can happen, but it's usually not going to go viral if it's a false accusation.    Moved from bend area to Seattle area last year, they are both better than most places I've visited   The fact that someone now has to do such a thing because of shitty parenting is not a small matter, especially when this is compounded when more people do it   It's the principle of the matter.  Don't go around and deface shit that isn't yours, especially while visiting.    My (or the park rangers) time is worth way more that 2 cents.    I really hope they don't get identified, but I do hope they see this and realize that this is not a small matter, and either change their ways or never come back to central Oregon.     I hope they see this, but don't actually get identified.  That'll be enough.  Either they change their ways or never come back to central Oregon, both outcomes are OK with me   This is in my hometown, so I'm more passionate about this than the Utah thing    A ticket wouldn't change the behavior of these people.  Now they might think twice before letting your kids be vandals, RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU.   They left evidence, have a witness, and a photo Id of the culprit.  That's enough to be charged with vandalism   Holy crap... The amount of people that think vandalism is OK and no big deal blows my mind.    Sure it's a few scratches in some man made thing, but it's the principle of the deal.  How disrespectful is it to visit somewhere, and then deface it?  Kids will be kids, but when they do it IN FRONT OF YOU, you should do your fucking job as a parent and teach them to respect property that isn't yours.    How is this a hard thing to grasp?   It was all over my friends that live in Bend Facebook last week   I'm blown away at all the "it's a tradition!" responses.  Who the fuck has a tradition to deface shit everywhere you visit?  How is that ever allowed to be OK?  Kids do stupid stuff, sure, but a parent being complicit in doing it, IN FRONT OF THEM, is just abhorrent parenting   "You come to my homeland and deface it? How'd you like it if I defaced your stuff? "   This is central Oregon, people take their nature pretty seriously   It's made of stone or wood if I remember right.  I used to live 10 miles from there   It's the principle of the matter.  Don't let your douche kids vandalize property, especially when you are visiting somewhere and that somewhere is featuring the natural beauty of the area.   Orthopedic surgeons are the construction works of the medical field.   Yeah, voice number from normal dialer is fine, I was heading out of the country and wanted to try the WiFi calling feature   I had thought about that but there wasn't any really good documentation I could find on how project Fi works software wise.  The FAQ says   If you're not using your Nexus 6 and you've opted-in to use your number to talk and text on other devices, you can make calls over Wi-Fi using your number through Google Hangouts.  So this might be an issue people run into that want Project Fi but don't have a Nexus 6.  I have the app, but no invite, so I can't test it out to see what that app actually does and how it's different from Hangouts or the regular dialer.   *footing the bill   Doesn't bode well for the project fi future then.  Hopefully it'll get worked out.  But there is a feedback button, so I suggest using that   In preparation for the Project Fi, I wanted to see what it'll be like using Google Hangouts as VoLTE or Wifi calling.   Today I took the phone off the charger at 11am and had to take a 2+ hour conference call.  I called in to the number with the Hangouts app, then joined the meeting and had the screen on most of the time as I needed to mute/unmute when needed.   I had expected the screen to suck down the battery pretty bad, but when I was done with the call, I looked and I had 50% battery left.  I go in to the battery stats and the screen and the hangouts app both had the same amount of battery useage at about 16% each.  Under the hangout app, it said it had 2+ hours of CPU usage time.  I'm pretty sure if I had used the normal dialer for this call, it wouldn't have used near what the hangouts app did.  I was on my home Wifi at the time, not LTE.  The phone is the Verizon branded version and the rom is stock, but rooted.  Is this something that anyone else has experienced?  I've tried searching around and nothing has specifically described this issue.     I have the driving thing done with tasker that reads texts if I want it to.  I'm not sure what else it did   Hey, Hillbilly...not now...not ever   and how much tires do Canadians buy?  I'm good with like 1-2 sets of tires every 5 years.   Chamber?  I think that was an auto correct for camber. right?  If you have it lowered, then you usually do need a camber kit.  If not, and you are having alignment issues, just take it to a place that does alignments.

 UGHHHH I am continually disappointed in the lack of level 5 armor and racing upgrades for this masterpiece. You should be able to soup up all the diesels at least a little bit.   You guys are great.

 You know what would be really great ? A mobile app you can snap a picture of any car in a handicap spot or firelane, and submit to traffic enforcement for some sort of automatic violation.    I'm in some wealthy burbs, I park my car out and walk even when I was wearing a boot on my leg, and inevitably there's be some self important asshole parked in the firelane to drop off their cleaning, get groceries,  handicap spots too - they don't care.  THey're more important than everyone else.    well those probably aren't the *only* things you'll need or want, but they're definitely on my "don't forget" list   that's a great idea!   livetatas   ok, so basically it's another clearance channel ... I'm used to those and know how to shop accordingly. 'preciate the education !    I wear lenses, so I buy them on a regular basis.  They're just empty used ones.  I'm also saving some larger bottles (travel sized soaking solution bottles) for use.   They're all quite good at dispensing indivdiual drops, and very leak proof ... more so than the "drop dispensers" I've seen for sale.    If you don't wear lenses, you can buy these drops in any drugstore or box store,  and you get to buy the cheapest since you won't actually be using the solution.    Now watch closely as OP's joke mysteriously levetates to the front page.   wha, little tobasco in the eyes never hurt anyone ;)   but seriously, is this a useful tip? I was really excited when I discovered it - i can now take just what I need and save a bit  more size and weight.  For me I guess it's more  important because of the way I pack, I need to keep my 10 essentials and my hygiene size to a minimum, I like smaller packs.    hmmm, if you end up not being able to find one there may be help in /r/myog building your own.  I would imagine a rain poncho is a pretty easy myo project.    Is steap and cheap always a "safe bet" in terms of a deal or do you need to do your homework first like with Massdrop ?    After my last trip I pulled an AAR on myself and started lookiing through what I didn't use, what I brought back in leftovers etc and realized that sometimes even 2oz of something is just way too much.  I like to bring Bronners and Tobasco with me, but I just need literally a few drops a day and [those tiny lense rewetting drop bottles are the perfect container](http://i.imgur.com/aOrCtkx.jpg).       The Infantry has a way of ruining outdoor recreation for sure.   And then my dubmass hiked for years (civilian hiking) with a fucking e-tool and like 12 pounds of water because I thought that's how you hike.  LoL.   yeah, I'd imagine call for fire quickly became "assholes 500 meters out, 120 degrees, light 'em up"   Make sure you have the ten essentials, including spare batteries for  your flashlight, and I'd brush up on the map reading skill ahead of time as well.  Primitive camping as in no stove ? Bring at least two different sources of fire. I bring a lighter (it's easy) and a magbar/flint strip (not as easy, but guaranteed to work).  Some firestarter cubes would also probably be very useful.  if you're going on your  own, leave a trip plan with the family and check in with them on predefined basis ("I"m still alive" calls)    Next time, setup close to the house.  You'll probably still hear a bit of the "normal" sounds you're used to, maybe a tv running quietly at night, or pipes pinging, whatever.  You'll also psychologically feel safer being closer to home.  In other words, try to reduce the amount of change so that really the only thing that has changed is you're on the wrong side of the wall.   Then once you're comfortable with that you can venture out a bit further.  Remember too that with actual backpacking, you're typically pretty darned tired by the time you get to rack up ... I hit that hay and I'm dead asleep   I started  hiking like I was still in the Infantry, never understood why I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I should.  Enjoyment factor up 500% when I bought newer lighter gear  and stopped packing for World Domination.     yeah, I would imagine that there's a very real possibility of waking up to a mauled kayak that won't float.     I guess I could understand that. I personally preferring eating over fishing ...    /r/creepy   That's what the punchbowl is for.  And by punchbowl I mean beer.   And by beer I mean whiskey.    oh dude, for the type of trip you're going on, you don't even know.  Foods the best part.  It *all tastes better* when camping.      Just be sure to get right back on that wagon and avoid whatever (or whoever) is providing you with the opportunity for that "just one" before it turns into more.   I'm 3 days on the wagon after falling off big time for a month, I'll tell you it's never easy stepping on that bus, but it's definitely easier the second time round than the first.   odd.  no cold medicines or stimulants ?  maybe it's actually just the exercise.  Perhaps if it happens again you may want to ask over in /r/running.     coffee used to be a HUGE trigger for me, but no longer.  I still can't drink much at all without cravings, so I stay away from that as much as possible too.    Sometimes you have to kind of improve everything at once, like a giant karmic clean sweap. Start exercising, eating better.  It all ends up going hand in hand for me.  Good luck.     I  have to constantly brainwash myself into being the most rabid antismoking dick on the planet, because my fucking brain is constantly trying to tell me how nice it is.   I  have a bud around the corner from me, can't see him for a while since I put them down again.  He gets it, not offended.   I have to have it out of site and out of mind.     Maybe if your roomate is cool and supportive he wouldn't mind stepping out instead, or something else so it's at least not like right.there. infront of you.    Heat definitely impacts your running performance.  Regarding the palpatations ... do you by chance drink alot of coffee ?    that's one way to interpret that wording.  Given the other multiple references to "natural" I don't think that's necessarily the correct interpretation though, but it is a rather slippery written article   that *is* interesting as fuck.  The enlargement viewer is mildly infuriating though.    I'll admit, it was pretty nice.  And considering it was a blizzard (we're fools) we had the entire park to ourselves. Yeah, it was pretty nice.    Let me just go ahead and add "buying intravenous fluids on Ebay" to my list of things not to do.    oh god, THAT.    I find it contempuous that the judge would threaten him with contempt for displaying his contempt for jury duty.   I think the "three years" reference means she may have been at the school for three years, as in "wtf, I've been here for three years and all of a sudden they're bitching about my hair".     [Relevant] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Q1CaPHx90)   TIL: I could be a doctor in Mexico.  But then, so could my Terrier.    wow, that's not only pretty fast charging time, but seems like you're getting really good mileage about of your battery too.    oh yay, first Snake House reference I've seen on Reddit.  And yep, your approach is *exactly* the one I had in mind.  "Oh hello, home owners insurance company ? Yes, my house burnt to the ground.  And also it was infested with snakes".    You may have a bit more luck posting this to /r/Maryland or even /r/Camping, just since Assateague is pretty far from Baltimore. Enjoy your trip.    they need increased legal protection by engaging in a work slowdown.  Gotcha.   Do you think it *really* boils down to legal  protections though? The LEO BoR and qualified immunity doesn't cut it anymore ?    oh bro, that's the best kinda backpacking trip.  Just some slow easy hiking, lots of goofing around.  Every play frisbee in the woods ? It's like frisbee pool.   PB J tortillas sounds pretty awesome.  Oatmeal for breakfast is great.  What kind of food do you like ? If you don't mind buying prepackaged food from the grocery store there's all SORTSA of stuff you can take... I've seen instant rice dishes that you just boil up, there's hamburger helper type stuff that you can just leave the meat out of.  I've seen pouched indian food that only needs to be heated (and they're awesome too).   I'm a big fan of the tuna salad that comes  in the foil pouches.   It's actually pretty decent and doesn't need to be refrigerated.  Also, like some salami and a block of cheese and some crackers can be pretty awesome.  It's really all about what you like and your imagination.  Just keep it light weight since you have to carry it.  Try not to bring too many foods that already have a lot of water in them, like fresh fruit, apple sauce cups, stuff like that since they get soo heavy.   There's also /r/trailmeals for more inspiration. enjoy !     Workers rights ? Could you expand on that?   I see this more as a policy issue.      There's a reason for the adage "don't go into business with family or friends".  /u/NinjaCoder's right.  Just walk away.     So, I was getting ready to offer some advice when I go to the final paragraph. Don't know what the fuck that's all about.   I'll be damned.  Downvoting my own comments to upvote yours.    I do know of a local handyman service that charges 65 an hour.  I haven't used them, but a friend did and recommended them to me.  I'm considering using them for some work but 65 an hour seems a bit high ... I don't know ... is that reasonable ?    also OP, if you're in Wild Lake I have plenty of tools to lend on Neighborgoods.net. Lend, not rent, as in free just please be neighborly and take care of them.    oh that's good to know, thx!  9 yds is a good bit, but at least they don't like require a bolt at a time.   It depends on the trip goals.   Last trip I took, I was shooting to do a 4 day trip in 3 days, and really out to train more than anything else.  Solo hiking, decent cool weather, my goal was mileage so I tended to eat on the move only cooking oatmeal and coffee for breakfast.  Dinner wasn't necessary, I'd constantly hit high protein stuff while I was hiking.    I brought mountain houses, never fired 'em up.   Didn't bother making a "lunch" as I was constantly noshing anyway, so everytime I stopped to filter I would grab some new food, throw it in the pants pocket.   On the way I met folks who were doing the whole trip in one day; they literally just had cliff bags and water and literally never stopped moving.   OTHERS were there to chill, play in the woods and would bring lots of food and goodies ... so it all depends on what you wanna do.      Oh you know, dress like a zombie, go golfing every day.    Note to self-  don't spook the kids; they can't take a joke.    This sub appears to be [very against whole life] (http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/search?q=whole+life+insurance sort=relevance t=all) policies   /r/investing    If you've never gone camping, or basically you just want to spend a few nights out having fun this summer and aren't sure if this would be a recurring hobby for you, than I'd suggest you consider going car camping instead of backpacking, and saving a TON of money on new gear.  The new backpacking gear is really nice stuff, but it's pricey, and alot of that price is paying for lightweight materials that don't weigh much and pack up small ... neither of which is a concern if you just want to go car camping and get some fishing in living in the woods for a few days.    In the dead of summer around Washington DC you don't need much at all to go car camping. You pack up whatever you have at home, throw it in the car, drive up to your camp site and pitch camp.  -Something to keep rain off you while you sleep should it rain.  This could be a tent rent from school, and in the summer months REI and other stores may rent them.  Or it could just be a tarp you tie between trees, or a cheap nylon hammock.  I've spent many a summer night sleeping directly on the ground when I was a young man. Even when we had "tents" they were really just rain ponchos that we would tie together and improvise into shelter.   - Something to lay on while you sleep.  This could be a 200 dollar air mattress, or it could be several blankets from home that you fold into a soft spongy mattress layer.  Or it could be an air raft, or a yoga pad.   It doesn't have to be fancy, just comfortable. Remember if you're car camping, you don't have to carry it- size and weight don't matter.  - Something to keep you warm while you sleep.  This could be an 800 dollar down sleeping bag, or it could just be the sheet off your bed in the summer months, or a blanket.     - Something to cook with.  This could be a hundred dollar titanium cookset with fancy utensils, or it could be a pot and a pan from your kitchen.  I spent years and years hiking out with like a 5 dollar cookset.   -Basic hygiene stuff like TP, soap, etc.   - Food.  Go to the grocery store - there's endless amounts of food that just need heating up or that you boil.    -A styrofoam cooler and a bag of ice .   Be careful wtih beer though, alot of parks don't allow it.  Not saying I've never enjoyed a cold one in the woods, just saying don't keep a styrofoam cooler sitting out where a ranger could easily see it.    So really, unless you plan on backpacking out, I wouldn't get too caught up in gear.  Just get out there however you can and enjoy yourself.  If you love it, and you decide this is your calling and you really want "proper" gear than you can start saving for it.   Either way, hope you get out soon and enjoy that fishin.     Outside of Acadia on the quiet side are some really wonderful harbor side trails.    enjoy those years while they're there. They'll be over before you know it.    How do you personally use this effectively ? Even at 2amps, it means keeping the stove running a LOT longer than I normally would to have any meaningful impact on a battery.   Which means either now I'm carrying extra fuel which could have just been a battery pack, or I'm cooking over wood.        hahah to me it looked like a booby trap.   I was looking for the pizza box bait.    We're all good until you try to serve me green eggs from a tray pack.    The fancy sets tend to be more expensive lighter materials.   I tend to draw a pretty strong distinction between camping and backpacking, because backpacking stuff is pricey and relatively non-durable compared to the stuff you can bring camping.  I mean, car camping ? Haul out the 30 year old unbreakable 40 pound stuff right ?    I heard some folks talking about Cuben and it was stated that they don't sell their fabric, they license it's usage in manufacturing much like Gore does.     I'd be interested in recommendations on this as well ... pretty sure I'm going to have to replace the entire kitchen within a few years at this rate !   We've been using Pet Vet (Dr Hall) forever.    Also, in addition to the dog parks, there are several state parks nearby which allow dogs on certain trails.   enjoy and welcome to Columbia !    Hmm, not me. I get "millions falling into poverty".  But I did find the article by searching http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/women-posing-with-shawarma-is-now-a-thing-in-russia/523454.html   and I guess I have to rescind my comment, because apparently it actually *is* a social networking group thing for them.    And this winter a couple buds and I went camping in about a foot of now.   One of them had made "hobo meals" at home - pot roast in aluminum foil.  While the rest of us setup the tent and our bags, he started a huge fire and threw these things in to cook.   A few minutes later we were sitting around the campfire in like a foot of snow, eating fresh pot roast out of aluminum foil, sipping gourmet cocoa with marshmallows, than out came the vodka that was sitting in the snow chilling.     I must admit it was a good day.    Multi-family car camping a couple years ago... suddenly there was a massive breakfast buffet line going with like 4 or 5 stoves, all cooking up a ton of breakfast goodness; pancakes, eggs, bacon, sausage.  It was unreal.    Article seems to be gone now, which is a shame as it seems that Russia is now living real-life subreddits.  /r/womenposingwithSharama.     Honest question ... not a waterman and barely a fisher ... what if they just had a mortorium on all recreational fishing for a year or two, and licensed only actual watermen who made their livelihood on the water ?  Would that help anything ? Or are they basically already doing that ?  I know my seafood intake's been steadily going down for years, and pretty much nothing I get anymore seems to be local anyhow, so why not make that official for a bit in the name of rejuvenating the populations ?    so close to my car that I can't even see his hood. Sunroof + Pennies.       yeah,I really do think of fancy cooksets as "stove only" ... one of the luxuries of car camping and big old campfire is being able to bring out the cast iron ;)  Well, maybe that isn't a luxury for some.  I know when I'm camping with the family the starc contrast between the minimalist backpacking I enjoy makes me wish we didn't bring so much ...!     So bad choice of words for meaning "you don't really have the same needs as someone who's like spending every single day hiking long distances" if you're only hiking to the camp, spending 4 days there than hiking out.    1. Anything that doesn't have any plastic bits on it should be fine on both.  You'll want something that sits well on the jetboil ... beware though that alot of backpacking sets do have plastic bits up top, where the flame of a jetboil would never hit or heat up too much... with campfires you're potentially talking about a lot more heat.  I've been looking at the various [GSI sets] (http://www.amazon.com/Bugaboo-Camper-Cookware-GSI-Outdoors/dp/B006ERSCNA) lately...     2.  In a good cooler if you don't keep opening it and closing it we've had ice last at least 24 hours during Memorial Day... dead of summer probably less.    3. No clue,sounds like the kind of thing you wouldn't be allowed to bring on, but that would be readily found wherever your camping destination is if it's actually needed there.   If you're only hiking in and out than you probably don't need to be overly concerned with like calory to weight and space rations.  For your first camping venture out, I say take food you like, and enjoy yourself.   I would do something like fresh sandwhiches for the hike in, hobo meals (roasts wrapped in aluminmum) for first dinner since it's an easy way to a luxurious dinner, than standard "add boiled water" meals from the grocery (you'll find a very wide range of tasty foods that just require heating, ranging from latin to Indian) as well as a Mountain House or two.  Oatmeal and coffee makes a good lightweight easy breakfast, you could brings eggs as well.  For snacks I like high protein options like tuna (in pouches) and beef jerky.   Use your imagination, and have some variety.  Truly, folks eat ranging from very plain ( literally saw a post that was "Here's my food for 4 days" and it was basically 3 ziplocks of snack food) to gourmet (espresso machines, ovens (not Stoves, OVENS as in bake bread on the trail, yes) and everything in between.  Just remember that you have to carry it on your back, and if you aren't using to carrying a pack the weight *will* add up, but you're talking about a really short hike... if I were doing a very short hike in and out, but staying there for 4 days, I would definitely be willing to hoof in a lot of extra food weight that I normally wouldn't want to.    To keep things cold: if you're ok with the added weight you can use small insulated lunch bags and an ice pack, but I'll warn you that "cold stuff" is generally the province of car camping, not backpacking or camping hiking in.  Still, for the first night you could probably keep something relatively cool  that way... something only semiperishable and not immediately perishable I presume.    Bottom line is there's no right or wrong in meal planning, there's only preference.  Backpacking gets a bit more serious as the size and weight considerations become critical.  But for what you're doing, what's really important though is that :  A) You enjoy your first time backpack camping.  B) You enjoy your first time backpack camping. C) You eat well, and start thinking about what you did and didn't like, what you would and wouldn't bring again, all while enjoying your first time backpack camping.   EDDIT: DANGIT, can't believe I forgot to mention that's there a /r/TrailMeals that's perfect for inspiration.  Enjoy !    There ya go, strap the poles outside (vertically ! - you don't want them sticking out sideways) and then just shove the rest of the tent inside somewhere.  Be a little careful with the pegs too - you don't want them poking into the tent or backpack material too hard.  You don't have to put the tent inside a sack before going into the sack either, you can just shove it on down in there, and shove everything else on top and compress it all together.   I do that with my tent and sleeping back and it makes everything fit the pack better  with less wasted space.    Sounds like a photographers vest.  Just instead of lenses and film canisters packed with other goodies.     Seems rather unnecessary if you're carrying a pack though.  If you want to rest, your pack will be at your feet (or under them).  No need to stop walking to check a map unless you're particularly bad with maps.  If I want to drop my pack and actually leave the trail (like to do an extra 3/4 side trail to water) than I grab my small pouch of essentials out of my pack hood and carry it in my pocket.    Run away.  That has sketchy written all over it.      it's completely worth it to not deal with Massdrop's long and often unpredictable shipping times.   So is Massdrop kind of "you'll get it when you get it" ? LIke old school mail order .... "6-8 business weeks" loL.    but it's not sold by Amazon, so that's not really a good comparison price wise  Im confused as to why, but I"ll take your word for it. I'm not spending 20 some bucks on a pot anyhow, titanium, sterling or otherwise.    Although, it's oh soooo light .... so tempting.       So, in addition to having inadequate carbs, I just looked at my splits on Cardio ... even though my overall time was horrible, just terrible because I bonked and actually had to walk sections (so sad ... ) apparently my 1st mile split was the fastest I've ran.   So that combined with the bad fueling would explain why the rest of my run went so horrible, and why I'm still in DOMS like 4 days later despite stretching, protein, massage, etc.    No fuel, poor pacing... I was killing myself. dumb.    Yeah, I guess there's some logic to that.  Except the people camping in Ohiopyle probably aren't actually *from* Ohiopyle.   And there's definitely a lot of people in that park area during peak months, but point taken ... I suppose it's really more about foot traffic than anything else.   Holy Hornet Batman !   This sounds like extortion.     Thanks, we're good on locations, just wondering how safe it is to leave stuff out.   dude if you're retarded with money, like you're totally compulsive, have lessened self-regulation capabilities, stuff like that, than open up a savings account with no checkbook, no ATM card. Make it *hard* to get to your money once it's in there, so you'll only go to it when you really really need it.  Then ask your employer to put a certain amount into it with each direct deposit so it never even goes into your main account and you never get a chance to be stupid with it.  Out of site, out of mind.    [this] (http://www.amazon.com/TOAKS-LIGHT-Titanium-650ml-Pot/dp/B00SMFNAZW) isn't the same product ?       I'm a stay at home Dad and my wife works  MY HERO.   You've brought tears of joy to my eyes.  I SALUTE YOU for obtaining a position I once thought to be mystical.  Please don't screw it up, I still go to bed at night dreaming of the day when *I'm* no longer the one working 60 hour weeks.    If you honestly and truly just completely suck at cooking, then you'll want a beginners cookbook that introduces some basic concepts and techniques.   The [Better Homes and Garden cookbook] (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553577956/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_dp_ss_2?pf_rd_p=1944687602 pf_rd_s=lpo-top-stripe-1 pf_rd_t=201 pf_rd_i=0470560770 pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER pf_rd_r=0F2WSEY2CKQVQ5PT9HMB) got me started with some really basic recipes, and basic techniques.   When you're graduated from that, [The Joy of Cooking] (http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Cooking-Irma-S-Rombauer/dp/0743246268/ref=sr_1_1?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1433985417 sr=1-1 keywords=joy+of+cooking) is a timeless classic.    In terms of meal planning, there's loads of recipes and meal plans online.  Right here in Reddit there's /r/MealPrepSunday and /r/EatCheapAndHealthy along with plenty of other food and cooking related subs.   Be nutritionally sound too though.  There's /r/nutrition for advice; figure out your families caloric needs, and base meal planning around that.      yeah, just toss it.    It could be just extreme settling, but if you have another can nearby I'd play it safe.   I'm assuming the can wasn't bulging, didn't "whoosh" air when you opened it, no cracks or any other signs like that ?   Any chance you could post a picture ?    vodka sauce ! how could I not think of that... it's only like the best every tomato sauce invented.    oh, and you can't say "deglaze" without mentioning gravy !   It didn't overdo it for us, but use your own judgement; that's the great thing about learning how to cook - you get to make everything exactly as you want !!     We're in Howard, south of Baltimore.  I had told him that if he doesn't want to make a whole weekend of it we could shoot up to Patapso just Friday or Saturday evening, spend the night, do a short hike after breakfast or something.  I'm trying to make it as easy and non-committal as possible for him.  I think I'll just suggest something out 70 instead though.   Sounds like you're spending in a lot of other places.   Make a list of everything you spend money, and come back with more details. Include debt amount, monthly payment and interest rates.   Be sure to include groceries, gasoline, plus other stuff that costs money but that you probably don't want to tell yourself actually adds up, like weekly beers etc.    yep, we have five spice lying around I'm sure.  Never thought of smoking tofu.  I've smoked all sorts of meat, fish and cheeses... I guess smoking tofu is a bit like smoking paneer. I'll give it a go !    Sure will try this out - thanks !       I don't even have audio and this was entertaining. Someone was enjoying their 15 minutes of attention.    I'm guessing it would make more sense to put it into retirement but without  more details it's only a guess.   What's the interest rate on the loans ? What's your income, cashflow, total worth like ?  Is there matching on the supplemental or is it tax advantaged ?     yeah, if you're close enough to a store that's definitely your best bet.  Ask if you can take it to the backpack section, and ask for someone who's knowleadgeable about fitting packs.    it could be the pack just isn't the right size too ...did you go into a retail location and get fitted, or buy online ? Sorry,it's hard to troubleshoot a pack fit without pics ... I know  I'm basically between the two most common lengths and have to buy adjustable length.  Having the straps hit your arms in odd spots can be an effect of wrong length.    I think tofu makes sense.   Thanks for the tip on drying it .... it's definitely difficult to fry up without thoroughly squeezing and drying it.   The boiling salted water trick sounds neat; I"ll try it.    It's not a correction, it's clarification. Am I right ? Are you a private pilot looking for a camping spot you can fly to ? I don't think that would be immediately understood in /r/camping from your original post.    you don't want to feed your hammies and quads some nice delicious protein and glucose while you're hammering them ?    Squats and cardio for sure.   I also did a lot of straightleg deadlifts, and my pack just felt like nothing.    fake meat battered and fried, as opposed to simply leaving out all battered  and fried elements altogether, and keeping it simply bell  peppers, pineapple and sugar sauce.    I did 3 days no problem in a 50 liter, but just packing for myself.  BUT I was solo, so I carried everything.  Stove,tent, pad, bag, food etc.  Actually downsized into a 36 liter... the 52 was more than I needed.   the meat itself is likely to be a bit tough for fast and high temp cooking.  You could try a variety of slow/low temp techniques like roasting it, smoking it, etc.     No, I'm asking, "would a vegetarian prefer a faux 'sweet and sour pork' that is the normal dish just with no meat, or would one prefer a faux 'sweet and sour pork' that batters and fries a non-meat to take place of what would have been the battered and fried pork"    Ah bro, really don't know any way to get there without a private car.  I was looking for similar to get out to the Great Allegheny Passage and found a couple bike clubs that do like hosted van trips but they leave out of DC, don't necessarily go where you want them to go, and they're pretty pricy.   If you really don't have a car or a bud who's willing to do the drive (it's only about an hour each way, maybe hour and a half) then maybe you could find a Meetup in Baltimore that's heading out there, and carpool with someone from the Meetup group (they do that) and then just not return with them ?  You could take Marc to Frederick (but by way of DC) and get closer to Pen Mar, but you'd still be a hoof away... maybe close enough for an expensive cab ride though ?   as a tip to help you in your transit search though, few folks who don't live right in that area or hike the AT will recognize "Pen Mar Park", but it's like 2 miles from Ft. Richie which is a little more recognizable.   good luck man.    Carne Guisada is a dish itself ...  you don't like Mexi ?    put a couple porkchops in a pan, put a couple stars of anise and splash them with white wine, cover, cook low.    I once roasted a goose, and in a pan reduced prunes and their juice, chopped chestnuts and brandy for the sauce.  It was beyond words.    Washington DC area here. Our hardware stores don't even carry proper hardware.  But you can get some fancy lamps and dishwashers in 'em.   I'm on the hook for dinner tonight and I'm craving some sweet and sour pork.  I've made it at home in the past and it just killed.   We're a mixed household ...  should I just leave the fried pork out of the vege one, or do you think it "needs" the fried bits ? What would you fry to add to it ? Tofu ?  I've made kung pao tofu before and it kills, but I've never done it in sweet and sour before.     My first paychecks of the year go into maxing my 401 as well.  We just came off the holidays, no need to spend anything.    The left over is anemic until it's maxed, but then I'm good to go for the rest of the year.  	113

I would not advise that, our insurance only authorizes services from approved providers, I'd be flabbergasted if any place like that was authorized for services.    Wow that's outrageous, I've never heard of any of that before.

Virginia is on that list but not sure if that plan would cover it. I agree with /u/cakeisatruth that ABA is not the only way but has been found to be beneficial by the U.S. government take that as you may. Additionally, Temple Grandin has came out and said that ABA is beneficial but the more important part is finding what your child loves and use that as a motivator. I have noticed that when therapy is provided that is what happens during ABA. Speech, and occupational therapy are added benefits and will compound those self life skills. I'd be more interested in reading /u/cakeisatruth comment about masking their symptoms and making children seem more neurotypical.  http://www.autismhealthinsurance.org/37-states-now-require-autism-health-insurance-mandates   What are these abusive methods?

David will be missed by the masses, a cultural icon.    I'm interested to see how Dwight settles in as the series goes along. Steph on the other hand seems like he's on autopilot. Should be a great series.    Sounds like a good idea.    My son is starting to act like a neuro typical so the future is bright you'll see.    My son seems to enjoy it, play based therapy. He's been there not being able to sleep at night, he kind of just grew out of it. We try and get him outside for physical exercise so he's a little worn out and seems to work as he's tired. Youll be glad with the ABA therapy, some days your child will surprise you as they grow is worth it. Your doing this right by staying young and ensuring independence as an adult.    History repeats itself, good graphic.    That is pretty cool.    Interesting.    What gets me is how can going to the casino and charging to the taxpayers constitute as official business.

Have you ever been to Disney Land, there is no such thing as getting on other rides with short lines. So you show up to the ride and are given a return time but in the mean time you can't ride anything else as the lines are just as long. Additionally you can't get another return time for a different ride because you still haven't returned for the queue yet. I don't claim to know how Disney Land works but at Disney World most waits times are an hour plus. http://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/wait-times  What is Disability Access Service and how does it work?  DAS is intended for Guests whose disability prevents them from waiting in a conventional queue  environment. Once issued at specified Guest Relations locations, DAS can be used to obtain a return  time for an attraction comparable to the current conventional queue wait time. As soon as a Guest  finishes one attraction, they can receive a return time for the same or a different attraction.   Was acquitted.    Great song.    Do I need 4.4.4?

"I once made a movie, rather tongue-in-cheek, called Psycho. The content was, I felt, rather amusing and it was a big joke. I was horrified to find some people took it seriously. It was intended to make people scream and yell and so forthbut no more than screaming and yelling on a switchback railway (rollercoaster). I'm possibly in some respects the man who says in constructing it, 'how steep can we make the first dip?' If you make the dip too deep, the screams will continue as the car goes over the edge and destroys everyone. Therefore you mustn't go too far because you do want them to get off the switchback railway, giggling with pleasure." - Alfred Hitchcock in a 1964 interview   They all set up environments through editing, better than many feature films out there.

"What we're doing here, really, is just designing a ride at Disneyland."  Twenty years later it was a ride at Disneyland.  I'm not sure why Spielberg keeps talking about Disneyland because this plot seems far grittier than the other Disneyland rides.   He was a great director when he filmed THX 1138 and American Graffiti.  Also the USC shorts he directed are very well done.

Pretty insane on that first drop.   Also, watch POV videos online and imagine you're riding it.  Maybe do other activities like biking or rollerblading that involve sudden direction changes.  Learn about the physics of inertia, acceleration, weightlessness, and then maybe the rides will be less threatening if you know what's happening to your body.   Start small and work your way up!  Also, keep your eyes open and relax.  If you want a less intense ride, sit in the middle of the train as the front will go faster into hills and the back will get pulled over the hills faster.  I've ridden every coaster at Cedar Point except for Jr. Gemini and they are all great.  Pretty sure everyone here can give you lots of information on the park if you need it.  Try the wooden roller coasters first; they are less sickening than Corkscrew or Gatekeeper or Mantis (rougarou) because the transitions are less intense.  I actually puked last time I went to cedar point because I rode the Skyhawk swing ride twice after breakfast.  Sudden acceleration and deceleration on a full stomach is dangerous... So take time to digest, haha.  What was the roller coaster you puked on?      I really want to experience that turnaround now.  I love specific breakdowns of rides, thanks.

Start with a new game file and work your way up from the beginning.  Continue to night 6 and 7 if you make it that far!  My personal record on mobile is Night 6, 2 AM.  If someone was able to complete all 7 levels in one go that would really be something.  If this catches on we should keep a High Score list on the side of the sub for FNAF 1, 2, and 3 on PC and mobile.

In the first game, the animatronics get directly in your face only when you die.  In the second game, the old ones are in front of your face almost every time you put down the monitor, and in the third one the hallucinations are always jumping right on you.  So the first one is the only one where there is the legitimate suspense of hoping to avoid that dreaded face to face encounter.

 Not wanting to date a woman with hairy legs isn't on the same level as, say, refusing to date black women, but the thought process probably stems from (and certainly contributes to) our patriarchal society. That's not your fault, but it is something you need to be aware of and try to correct.  So, if your preference is for shaven legs, you're wrong and should change.   o/      WHATCHA GONNA DO WHEN DISFUNCTION RUNS WILD ON YOUUUUUUUUUU???

Do you bite your thumb at me sir!?   can anyone see 16 being legally unacceptable in the United States?  In no way shape or form would I allow minors to engage in a "cuddle comfort" website.  18 and up only.   Except in the prosecution of the crime, which is what the OP's questions are limited to.  Even in the prosecution of a crime the prosecutor owes no duty to the victim.  Only to the state and the court.  The prosecutor is NOT her attorney.  He does not owe her any of the duties that normally arise from an attorney client relationship.    You have a lawyer - the prosecutor.   This is a common misconception. The prosecutor is NOT her attorney. He represents the state. There is no attorney client relationship between the prosecutor and the victim and the prosecutor owes her no duty.    I've had it when eating out at restaurants. Still like my way.     plain pasta with sauce on top.  That's how I like it. Come at me bro.    Everyone who hates to be "that guy" fucking loves to be "that guy."   It takes all kinds. As long as you don't judge someone for not being into the things you're into its no big deal.    i would normally agree with the statement about 93 being excessive but i was definitely not out of line with the traffic on the road. i was just pacing everyone else around me and got singled out.   This does not matter one iota in court.   Fallout 3 was wildly popular and critically acclaimed. You can say you didn't like it but you can't say it wasn't any good.    Food seems more about indulgence than than taste and the possibilities of new experiences and good company.  My only issue with foodies is they seem unable to understand how someone could be uninterested in "new experiences" with food.  I think being into food is a hobby like anything else, and if you're just not into something new and different and are happier with some grilled chicken and rice for dinner then you shouldn't be judged as somehow ignorant or missing out.   Normally what's said in mediation is confidential and cannot be used in later litigation.    Your first link refers to conduct. Saying something is a statement. Conduct is an action. Even if saying something is a threat they are words, and words are statements.    LETS GO METS!!   I honestly don't understand what you're talking about. Shouting fire is a statement like any other statement that is subject to hearsay rules.    If you're in an emergency situation where life and limb is at risk you don't call any of those other people though. You call police and fire.    Any statement by a party to litigation is exempted from the hearsay rule. That's just the rules of evidence. There's no rule that says an out of court statement has to alledge a fact to be hearsay. It only must be an out of court statement by one other than the declaration used to prove the truth of the matter asserted.  The truth of the matter asserted is not the overall proofs of the case but whatever the question asker is seeking to prove at the time.    Q: Why do you think the defendant wanted to kill the victim?  A: he said "I'm going to kill you!" To him  That's hearsay, except it's an admission of a party opponent so it would be admitted.    Mailmen protect the life and property of the public?   I don't think any of these positions are comparable to a firefighter. A firefighter responds to an emergency and must make split second decisions to save life and property. Those other jobs are certainly admirable but not to the extent of a firefighter.    Like what?    Plenty of people do jobs that are as dangerous for much less.  Are those jobs devoted to protecting the life and property of the public?   Yeah, I missed that.  Hearsay within hearsay.  You're right.    I love the way this sub is turning into a circle jerk of starred users mocking OP.   You're certainly free to make your own legal advice sub where everything is super serious business and every word a poster makes is the gospel truth.    Check the other posts made today.  All useful advice, no mockery.  Sometimes mockery is deserved.    how often do you leave the house (especially if you are not getting in the car) without your id  Literally almost never.  If I'm walking out the door I have my wallet with me with my license in it.   It's a party admission and is specifically not hearsay.   M'officer *tips fedora*   YOU ARE THE MAN.  SOLVED.   It seems to come up often when discussing the actions of political figures.  Someone will criticize the action of an elected representative in a big picture, general sort of way, and then another person will explain the details of the issue and why the person may have made that particular decision.  Sometimes you'll then see a third person make a sarcastic comment like, "Wait, you're telling me there are "blank" here??"  Thanks!    So what attracts you to the suburbs?  You understand my town is a suburb and has all these things.  The suburb I live in has a walkable downtown with all those things I mentioned.  I don't need to live in a city for them.   Less traffic.  More nature.  Less crime.  Better schools. Lower cost of living.  Small town feel.    Maybe the town you live near is total crap, but I couldn't give up the live of having anything I could want being a healthy walk away.  Do you mean isn't?  We have a great downtown in my town with restaurants, comic books shops, a newstand, and different unique gift stores that's all walkable.    but not until people move out of the shitty suburbs  I love living in the suburbs.  I would never want to live in a city.   I would imagine for most people in the U.S. the advice is more inapplicable than it is applicable. On average people live 25 miles from work. That's a long bike ride in all kids of weather.     from people who call creepers clown shoes  They look like clown shoes though. They were the most ridiculous part of those outfits. I feel like the vast majority of people would think they look silly.     But like, do you really think things are that different today on that front then they were in 1965? Really?  Yes. I think things are much much better.   That's a ridiculous interpretation of that interview.  No I think it's a pretty valid interpretation.      So you supported the jailing of MLK Jr?   Nope. Blacks under Jim Crow had little to no voting rights.   You were fine with the internment of Japanese-Americans during WWII?   Nope for the same reason. Little to no voting rights.   Do you think civil disobedience is legitimate, or that the only thing that matters is following the law in a nominally "democratic republic"?   Civil disobedience can be useful, but if you don't think the United States is a democratic republic then there's not much else we can discuss here.   I mentioned David Betrayus (Petraus), he got fucking PROBATION for something that in 1965 could have led to a  Yeah I got your brilliant pun  Petraeus didn't commit the same crime at the same level that Snowden did. He revealed things to impress his girlfriend. Snowden released information to enemies that threatened our country. He didn't read what he turned over. He admitted to John Oliver that this was a mistake.    If someone lived in a democratic republic where they have the opportunity to vote freely to choose their legislators and executives, and then decided to break the law, yes I support their jailing.     He says he would be happy to come home to a fair trial.  He has no other defense. He DID do it. The law does not permit you to break it even if you personally decide its for the greater good except in very limited circumstances. This isn't one of them. He won't come home because he knows he could get the best attorney and all the due process in the world and he'd still be convicted because he broke the law.     The patriots of history you like, the ones of today you hate.  No, we like lots of patriots of today.  Snowden just isn't one of them.    Washington dragged everyone into a literal war where tons of people died, though.  No he didn't.  Who decided Washington could start a massive conflict? Just him and his buddies, but apparently that doesn't matter for reasons.  He had little to do with starting a massive conflict.  But since Snowden leaked some documents with a minimum of harm to all except the egos of politicians in order to further a goal as noble ("people should have a degree of self-rule over their own lives"), it's the complete opposite and he's a total traitor for taking initiative like that?  I consider Snowden a traitor.  He released classified information of legal activities on the part of the NSA.  I'm happy John Oliver finally called him on the carpet regarding the consequences of his actions since reddit seems to treat him as a saint.  Snowden got trapped in Russia. Wasn't his fault.   Yes it was.  He could have stood trial like anyone else that breaks the law.  because some American pols are being vindictive as fuck.   That's not why he would stand trial.  He would stand trial because he broke the law.   This is from 2 years ago.  If you check that user he's still active and still arguing that smoking isn't that bad for you.    Do minors have different rights in this situation?  No    You're joking, right?  Nope.  Totally serious.    I am an asshole. An asshole who doesn't like being shaken down for money or passive agressive bullied (that's essentially what the fence removal was...a way to make me spend money)  Sure.  And you were perfectly within your rights to put up your own fence.  But you were an asshole about it.  Adults don't (or at least shouldn't) act like that.    I STILL have clean hands. Florida has no spite fence laws.  But you seem like an asshole.  You don't have to break any laws to seem like an asshole.  You've lowered your standing in the eyes of any judge or jury who would look at your case.    One or two stories today.   Out of the millions of residents and hundreds of thousands of police interactions.      Same question I asked jcar128, how can simply telling an officer I know my rights are being violated hurt more than help?  Officers have wide discretion on how to handle a traffic stop.  You could have committed three infractions but a cop might only ticket you for one since you were polite and respectful.  If you go through with your plan, the cops won't cut you any breaks.  When you go to court, the cop will communicate with the prosecutor regarding your behavior meaning the prosecutor won't cut you any breaks.  Also keep in mind you can be arrested and taken to a police station for something as small as speeding.  If you're annoying enough, a cop can do that, and it would not be illegal in the slightest.   Isn't this a double standard?  Maybe.  Who cares?  How, in the eyes of the law, can an animal be treated at property for civil purposes, but as something more than just property in other circumstances?  They are treated as property that you have restrictions as to how you can treat it.  There's nothing wrong with this.  Legislators are allowed to to create laws that have specific categories.  There's nothing in the constitution that says "if something is property you cannot restrict how a person treats it!"    Yeah, that's a spite fence.  You were probably in the right regarding the initial dog bite issue but you've decided to act like a child and up the drama level (while also posting all over reddit for the attention).   People with attorneys go first.  Then you line up with other pro se individuals.  If you are offered a plea deal you will go in front of a judge.  The process can take anywhere from an hour to several hours.   Again, if you try to fight it, you'll likely lose and won't be offered any plea deals by the prosecutor.  Go to the prosecutor and ask if he can offer a deal.  Don't try to offer a defense or excuses.    is there a downside to contest it when the day comes?  Show up at your court date, dress nicely, be polite and reasonable, and speak with the prosecutor.  Ask if there is a plea deal he can offer you.    Is there a reason why the state police did not catch me previously?  I have no idea.  could i use this to reduce my fine?  No.  That's like saying, "I speed on that road all the time your honor!"   You do, in fact, have a right to effective counsel.  However, if your counsel was ineffective, you do not automatically get a new trial.  A court engages in a two step analysis-first, was your counsel ineffective?  Second, was there enough competent evidence introduced at trial that even if your counsel was brilliant, you would have been convicted anyway?  So, even if your attorney sleeps through trial, if the state had you dead to rights and F. Lee Bailey would have had no chance, you don't get a new trial.   It doesn't matter if you've done it before, or if other people do it.  Closed means closed.   Yes. Whoever took that photo owns the copyright on it. You cannot use it on a shirt.     As a male in a domestic assault situation, it's scary to call the police.  It shouldn't be.  Call the police.  You have a recording.   If the introductory consult discussed the situation at hand, he may already be conflicted out.   Yeah that's not how it works. Like at all.    There is no issue with the ticket. You can be issued a ticket at any time up to the statute of limitations which is measured in years.     Hundreds of people who criticize TV professionally happen to support that opinion.  Do the people that downvoted you mean that you're wrong?   I'm a lawyer. I love it. Small firm, reasonable hours, decent pay.     There is no sound reasoning to just sit here and admit guilt when i could fight it and potentially get it dropped.   You are highly unlikely to succeed in fighting the ticket.  Instead, show up on your court date, dress nicely, be polite, and try to work out a deal with the prosecutor.   How did you try to get the car unstuck?   It's likely that your employers believe that you just want to have long hair and are saying you're totally a Germanic pagan in an effort to avoid cutting your hair.  In order for your religious beliefs to be accommodated they would have to be bona fide religious beliefs.  These beliefs do not have to be reasonable, only sincerely religiously held.  A judge would likely look to the totality of your circumstances to determine if this is bona fide.     TIn the United States, is it illegal to to through someone's phone without permission?  It depends very much on the circumstances.  Also, do the police only have rights that US citizens have when it comes to searching? If it would be illegal for a citizen, would it also be illegal for them?  No, of course not.  A citizen cannot walk into someone's house and start looking through their stuff.  A law enforcement officer can obtain a warrant and do just that.   You should ensure the judge is aware of your age and that you are a minor.   It is very unlikely that a minor will be permitted to represent themselves in court.     We want to see the questions answered, not a bunch of people competing for comedy upvotes.  Can you provide some other examples where people did not get any advice whatsoever? I read almost every thread and I can tell you that's a small small minority.   	75
 Yes.  Bullshit.   Do you think Verizon is some kind of company run by Santa? Giving out free phones and all? Goddamn you people are ignorant.  It even says full price of 599. Your paying that 599-199 over the course of 2 years.       Thank you!!    Ball shake twitch leg.    http://i.imgur.com/54HBvgX.jpg   This bullshit again.   You cannot buy the device outright for 199. You still pay the 25 Verizon Edge over 24 months.   The phone got a 199 discount,  which still pretty sweet. You did not get it for free.   You kids need to grow up and realize the price of the phone is calculated into your monthly fee.

I had to fire one of my new hires after he posted to his public Facebook that "safety feature X for car Y"  was a complete piece of shit. He hired to work on that team.

 Back when I was studying for a degree in anthropology (and hence studying evolution), I was astounded by the number of intelligent people who would ask me whether humans had stopped evolving.                        Check out the bar/restaurant [Solar](http://www.solarberlin.com/en/) - its hidden away off the main road (you have to access it through the car park next to a carpet shop)  and doesn't look like much from the outside, but once you go in you go on a glass elevator up the side of the building to the top and its really awesome. Amazing city views, cool interior and great food. A bit expensive but totally worth it.                                                This is a very important clarification. They do completely different things to butter when hot.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          I misread this as Pot Noodle. I was trying to figure out how that would work!   The article is based on a [press release](http://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/201412/14-118E/) Sony released today, so I assume there must be something new about it.       [This is the press release](http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-12/bmj-ian121214.php) it was based on. It's one of the most poorly researched releases I have seen in ages - honestly I have no idea how it got funded.   Plus its waay out of date as moral panic-fuelling research goes.            True - here in the UK we have problems with coastal erosion in some areas, and if the cost of preventing it is too high, it's standard practice to let houses fall into the sea. (Obviously is relatively uncommon, but it does happen).   We have to be practical about when it makes sense to save a settlement, and when it is better to cut our losses.                                          I'm not involved in this personally, but the point is once they have the lantern they can keep accessing new content, not have to get a new lantern (or in your version USB stick) each time they want new data.         How are you going to get it to people? The value in Outernet is its ability to be used by people in remote areas with little infrastructure - sending them all USB sticks would be incredibly expensive and a logistical nightmare.    I really like this site - it feels way more unique than most!   I would also like to know if anyone has tried it, but bear in mind this is not the full internet - it's a broadcast selection of articles and bits and pieces, so it won't be a replacement for a dastardly service provider.    Blocks it on Chrome fine.       What did he say?            Yes, but you can use it to print lots of cars, and these machines are going to drop in cost far faster than a traditional automobile.      	137
 I think he means "max the loot" on the storage's. I'm pretty sure that's the highest level of storage's you can have at TH6.   And why is there an archer tower in range of your townhall? Just drag it out further otherwise TH7's will get pissed off and 3 star you. If you want a free shield then don't trap your townhall.    Just drop trophies and put your loot in the middle.   ha GOLDEN ha^ha^ha^ha^a^ha^ha^ha^ha^ha^ha   I take them outside for 10 minutes, they don't go and then they poop in my room 5 minutes later.   http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/381tpu/6_minutes_of_a_gorilla_throwing_up_and_eating_it/   [Stallling..](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84lCal8IC88)    [It's driving me bananas](http://40.media.tumblr.com/36bd44c5a542bd73b5c4a1af536f92e3/tumblr_n6d0qtSt0b1qewacoo1_500.jpg)   oh jesus! thank you!!

 I'm fine with this posting. Extreme weather anomalies are part of the climate story. And frankly, my guess is that the vast majority of users on this particular subreddit have no questions at all about the science in support human-induced climate change. Most of what's posted here is about the latest science and about how rapidly it is occuring. Extreme weather -- the continual blow-out of records, whether drought, floods or heat, over a relatively short period -- is certainly interesting and relevant.    You can contest it, but you may have to attend an administrative hearing.  They may cut fine in half, and you will lose a half day at least in the process. Been there, done that. Not worth it.   The emergency parking signs ticket complaint is a common issue. The city feels it's your responsibility to check on your vehicle periodically.              I wouldn't include social media prowess as a tech skill. It's more of a multi-tasking skill, IMHO.    Bravo for carrying a double major. If by art, you mean art history, I think that's great for all it brings with it: analytic skills, research, problem solving and critical thinking. Being able to draw on art and history may enrich your writing. If it's art as in visual design, graphic arts, or anything else, that's great as well, since much of journalism is visual presentation.      I always assumed it was at the discretion of the conductor because there's no logic to it. I've seen some metro cars close their doors while people were still lined up and boarding, prompting actions by passengers to attempt to hold the doors open. I've seen this happen on the green line more than any other line.          It is, but what is interesting is that this no-advertising blog -- which is very popular in DC -- has thought hard about this issue, sets standards and even has its own style guide. Aside from presenting often compelling topics, most of the pieces are readable. That may be the more important takeaway.    Maybe she was just trying to strike up a conversation. You know meet you, and didn't realize you are just another crazed biker with a 24x7 camera looking for drama.   Here is what she said (from your transcript) "Her: (Shouting from behind me) "We're going to a red light. What's the point man."  This is what you said: NOTHING.   She speaks up again: "Why pass me to a red light?"  You give the most dorky possible response: "Why not?" (Why not -- WHY NOT a disarming smile and some kind words in response?)   What you should have tried, perhaps, was a little self-depreciation: "Sorry, I was just trying to impress you." And you smile warmly, don't give her a maximum dork look with your stupid camera, and ask instead  "How come I haven't passed you before" ...   And she called you a jerk, how sad.            It is odd that a state which has much to loose is resisting taking a leadership role on this issue. You have to believe that as the shoreline damage mounts, mitigation cost increase, and the realization that large parts of Florida will be uninhabitable, that Florida's residents will elect leaders who become advocates for national action on climate change.     I clicked on the above link several times and keep getting a dead link. The NYT may have changed the link, because I've never seen this syntax before: http://op-talk.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/07/15/when-climate-change-floods-your-heart/   It's a real plus that you have a job freelancing with a local pub. The pay versus time/effort probably is hard to deal with, but having clips and working is great. Some of this is newspaper work, but some of it is the economy. The unemployment/underemployment rate for new college grads is not good.   http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/05/08/unemployment_and_the_class_of_2014_how_bad_is_the_job_market_for_new_college.html  Be persistent. When I was stringing, I would gather clips every now and then and just show up at the daily and drop them off in person. I would bug the TV station as well. Friendly persistence can pay-off, especially if they begin to recognize you. This isn't much help, I'm sure, but good luck.         The place was packed, wall to wall. Two photos here: http://dcblogs.com/?p=10278         I bang my head on my desk. I imagine life unemployed, desperate, and sleeping under a bridge. That can work. But more often chit-chatting with sources sparks, more often than not, ideas. I also scour newspapers far and wide using search terms of various topic areas.    You can write for the college paper, take some journalism courses, and major in what you have heart set on. Majoring in journalism is like taking on apprenticeship; it won't challenge you the way philosophy, history, economics, science, etc. The secret of success in journalism is passion and creativity.        You can bring folding bikes aboard Amtrak. You can't put them in the overheads, but there luggage racks in some of the cars large enough to handle them. And there's plenty of storage room at the ends of cars.    there are no legitimate opposing opinions.       This isn't reflecting the state of journalism; it's reflecting the state of the nation, and the conservative embrace of anti-intellectualism.           In the 1970s, Enfield centralized all its retail development. The idea, one supposes, was to keep the residential areas residential, quiet, and free of stores. The end result is a community that was designed for cars and not for people. It is not friendly to cyclists and walkers. The problem is apparent in the mall area. There are major intersections with no walk lights or crosswalks. It is difficult to cross in some spots and hazardous. The concept of bike lanes hasn't even registered. This needs to change. I see more adults cycling, or at least trying to. Some may not have cars. Others just want the alternative, but Enfield is utterly blind to the needs of pedestrians and cyclists in the retail areas. I think this would be a good campaign issue, because discussion is needed.  Enfield's approach to planning hasn't changed since the 1970s. (EHS grad 1972), It's time for the town to change.    This list makes sense, actually. Journalists are clumped around professions and occupations that can make people uncomfortable and suspicious about motives: lawyers, charity collectors, clergy, taxi drivers, ceos, real estate agents. Based on how the occupations are ranked, it would be just about impossible for journalist to be ranked among the top 20.        Let's see what happens with Keystone. Stopping fracking strikes me as a lost cause, but the pipeline is another issue.    Metro is great. It's far cheaper to use than a car. But the never-ending weekend track work is grinding. The single tracking, long waits, really discourage you from using the system on the weekends.    You can submit a query to http://www.prnewswire.com/profnet/ which will send it to members. Make your query specific. You are looking for someone in the tape, adhesive industry; then add that you interested in hearing from manufacturers, distributors, re-sellers, and academics who may be researching adhesives.   You can also try ssrn.com and do a search on academic papers to see if anyone has published researched. Email/phone contact is usually included with the papers.   If your deadline is in a few hours profnet won't help, unless you are trying to get help on a high-profile topic, such as legal help on a SCOTUS decision.  But if you get a query -in before 9 a.m.., generally you'll may get what you need for an afternoon filing. The quality of the responses vary, but over the years I've gathered some gems for contacts.       There is nothing that prevents a company from replacing U.S. workers.   There is no requirement that a qualified U.S. worker be hired first.  See: http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/FactSheet62/whdfs62O.pdf  Now, if an H-1B employer is classified as dependent it has to make an effort to first try to fill the job with a U.S. worker. But it can bypass that requirement by paying a salary to the H-1B worker that's 60K and above, or filling the job with somone with an advanced degree.  See:   http://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/FactSheet62/whdfs62Q.pdf    The company is required to post an advertisement for the skill, to make sure there aren't any natives available.  That's not the law. There is nothing that prevents a company from replacing U.S. workers. That's an urban legend.   There is no requirement that a qualified U.S. worker be hired first.

Politicians who embrace denial are on the wrong side of history. Unfortunately, it will probably take another generation before the leadership changes with members in Congress -- in both parties -- with the conviction to take this issue on.    I think Hartford hit a home-run with the UConn expansion. That's bringing in 2,000 plus people in Hartford daily, and it may do more to encourage supporting economic development -- restaurants, cafes and the like -- than a stadium. It may also work as a catalyst for more housing. People want to live in downtown areas; close to amenities, mass transportation, and entertainment. Hartford is heading in that direction.   There's also the real possibility that UConn students may use Hartford as an incubator site for new business start-ups, jobs that have real potential unlike hot dog vending.   The stadium is weak by comparison. There's no guarantee it's going to hit attendance levels (attendance projections have yet to be made public from what I can tell), or generate significant economic development. But it will be a drag on Hartford's budget.   The public turnout at this council meeting was an early indication that the stadium project is a very hard sell, something I don't think Hartford officials (or the Courant) realized initially.   I'm glad the public hearing on this project isn't happening until July 21. That gives the news media (assuming they care) enough time to FOIA out all the documents that need to be delivered.   By the way, I'm really impressed with Real Hartford's report on the public comments. It gives a full airing of what was said. Hartford needs alternatives to the Courant.        love that google thingy   Was this classified?         	45
    I can catch a cold over a telephone call. I like this.   I've already jumped ship back to Firefox. I push the save button and I can't figure out the exact location of where it saved, nor could I change the location of the "save" where I wanted it to go. The big and blocky "manage bookmarks" blows, because I just want simple functions like "edit name" and easy to understand "drag to folder" functions.   I got two today. I was excited. I need to get a life. I hope they keep them around.   There is always a point when I'm looking through "Mildly Interesting" when I physically laugh out loud because it is the perfect three way intersection of:  1. Me realizing I need to get an actual life.  2. The mind numbing randomness of this whole subreddit.  3. Then seeing a great post like this one and saying to myself "hey, that's pretty cool".  And all is right with the universe once again. This was that post. (And the dryness of the title is the trigger).     	6

 Wordreference translates it as fortress, palace, or castle. I guess it's a mix of palace and fortress.   I never implied that. I was answering to your blatant assertion that we don't know about a part of our history that lasted for 8 hundred years and makes a part of our culture. Maybe you think we have something against muslim history and culture, that in the school they lie about it or silence it, telling us we were better.   So, the same country were Al Andalus stayed for 8 centuries doesn't know about it. We don't have experts, teachers, historians, museums, archeologists, historical centers, investigations, books, touristic routes specialized in the matter.  Yeah, sure, mate.   Yes. Unfortunately we have to deal with media that are eager to find shocking news and don't give all the information and even distort it. The best thing to do is read articles from different sources to get all the different details, even reading independent people that have investigated and gathered all the info and maybe wrote some post in his blog.   But... He's not a clown. I win.   Even if she went crazy, there is still the question about how impossible it was for her to close the tank lids from the inside.   Where did you learn about "pre-Spain" era? Are you some kind of expert or made some specialized studies about that matter? Not trying to be sarcastic, I promise. Just want to know who I am talking to.   Also, you still didn't provide any source using the "pre-spanish" term. I googled it and only found stuff about Philippines and Chile.   Yeah, I guess you are better informed about Spain history than the spanish educative system itself.  We are taught about Al Andalus since primary school. Nobody denies it.   Those aren't proof  The Iberian Peninsula being called Hispania in the year 27 b.c. is not enough proof for you?   I'm sorry but I'm from Spain and I've never heard this "pre-spanish" term applied to Al-Andalus. In fact it would make no sense to a spanish person if you tell it. Could you give me some source where this term is used?  "Pre-spanish" implies that some spanish quality came after the muslim occupation. As /u/SNCommand is explaining you, this part of the world was called Hispania (Spain, Espaa) by the romans before the moors came here.   I would like to know what exactly is considered the "pre-spanish era".   I read about this happening first in France, but the date of [this article](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/10/clown-killer-quest-ce-que-cest/382092/) and the ones this guy ([1](http://www.reddit.com/r/creepy/comments/38zrih/its_a_creepy_craze_in_california_now_mysterious/crz6oid)|[2](http://abcnews.go.com/US/mysterious-clowns-terrorizing-california-city/story?id=26157014)) posted are the same.  In France clown bands were really attacking people with weapons, provoking the creation of anti-clown patrols.   ... our lord and savior John Wayne Gacy?    they use to sneak onto the roof all the time with their girlfriend. Apparently the alarms rarely went off.  In the Cecil hotel or another building?  just saying that bipolar can often cause SERIOUS cases of psychosis.  I'm not sure if I got it right because I still have some problems with my english, but I think they say in the video that the family denied Elisa having mental issues.   Yeah, that's just one of the many strange things in this case. Even the elevator behaved in a weird way.   [In case anybody is interested](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXM6OgrZl3U)   You are gorgeous. The true definition of "androgynous hottie".   This is a very interesting case. It seems to be very famous, but I didn't know about it.   This is very useful for graffiti artists.   What exactly were you trying to communicate with this video? What what it's objective?   I didn't said "the universe itself is the product of their minds". What I mean is that there is a team of people that had to addapt the content of the books to the screen, and in that process they created some things. New events, new dialogues, sometimes new characters (who immediately die, lol). But, of course, the world that Martin created in compare to what we see in the show is huge.   Of course it's derived from his writings but not totally. Some part of it came from other creative minds. Let's say 10%. I don't even know what I'm talking about.   I mean, yes, of course, all the characters and this world and stories and places came from Martin's mind. He is a genius, I admit it. But there are a some more writers creating memorable dialogues and plots that aren't included in the books.    everything we discuss on this subreddit and everything in the show and books     Probably it came from the minds of a whole team of writers. I don't think Martin is writing the whole tv series by himself.   How can that guy eat his spaghetti while watching to this horrible creatures?   Meh. This is the kind of shemales I don't like.   Actually I have started liking shemales recently. I prefer traps. I need them to be cute. I don't like guys with long hair, fake cheap tits and a dick. Bailey Jay and Natalie Mars got me into this.

I know this sounds like bullshit. Actually there are many fake rumors about this guy, but this asylum fact seems to be true.    You hold your pop in a box?   What? Aren't you afraid that one day you will... Ooooh, I see...   I think it will be more like a new ice age.   I've seen all kind of serious shit in the internet, and it usually doesn't affect me.

People aroused by drawings of anthropomorphic animals swallowing things... It's just too much for me.   He died because of a cerebral edema while the filming of "Game of death" wasn't still finished. In that movie there is a scene where Bruce gets shot. Maybe that started the rumors. Some people still believe that's the scene where he died by accident, when a fake gun was actually loaded. I guess this rumors originated after his son died this way in the filming of "The Crow".   Death knows this and tries to not having any major celebrity in her list on April fools.   Maybe this, from "The taking of Deborah Logan"?  https://33.media.tumblr.com/df7a7f89dc0e179dbe580a11e7ed9dfd/tumblr_ne5dc0N4Bt1tsy6uyo1_400.gif   Eating like, with fork and knife on a plate?

I haven't visited it for awhile, though. I guess I got tired of going through all the memes and reposts.   Is that a reference to that article about the size of the printed version of Wikipedia?   I work in a public library. It has a big press section. Sometimes they throw away useless or old stuff and sometimes I pick up some magazines or books I can later use to make collages. One time I was attending this section and had a look in the recycle bin. I found a thick old magazine celebrating the anniversary of the death of Francisco Franco -Spain dictator for 30 years. I leafed through the magazine and found inserted in one of the pages a very thin and flexible disc. It turned out it was a compilation of recordings of speeches of Franco through history. National speeches, victory speeches, militar speeches. His galician accent, his special voice pitch and the particular way public figures used to spoke at that time of history makes listening to this a very special experience.  It's the rarest piece of my collection.   [Death Grips - Ex-military](http://www.discogs.com/Death-Grips-Ex-Military/release/3267383) One of my favorite albums by one of my favorite bands.

[Have a nice life - Deathconsciousness](http://www.discogs.com/Have-A-Nice-Life-Deathconsciousness/release/6024716) I love this album and it's quite common, but since the original recordings were destroyed by accident and only 128 kbps files were left to use for re-pressings, I'm only buying this when I have a lot of money and can afford it.

    It's so much of a ripoff of YouTube that when YouTube adds a new feature like playback speed control, it gets added to YouKu within a few days.   3AM is is really early in the evening. Where's your god now?!?!   Yeah but it's at 108,201 right now. What if I'   On the farm we used to use an unintuitive tactic to get metal fittings unstuck when we didn't care whether they came out damaged. You'd take the welder and put a bead all around the inner side. As it cooled the hot ring of welding material would contract and often the fitting would pop right out. It was really cool   Just imagine how awful that elevator ride would be with a hangover.   Are you sure? They may have said the same thing if they were safe at home too. War tends to bring evil out of people where it could not be previously imagined.   I grew up on a farm, and I still very vividly remember our chemical sales rep telling me it was safe to drink after I asked him whether it was dangerous. I of course didn't drink any of it, but that's not something you should tell a kid. Either they were so brainwashed they believed it to be true, or they were out right lying to us. It still bothers me thinking about it today.   If a mother is/was taking antibiotics while pregnant I presume it also affects what kind of gut flora is introduced to the infant during birth?  I'd be curious to see studies investigating the sterility of birth facilities and/or mother antibiotic use in relation to autism rates.    After you're done with that can you come wrap your big arms around some of the stumps in my yard and pull them out of the ground too?   I'm currently renting a house up on a hill with a lake and city skyline view in a really wealthy neighborhood. The house is much older than those around it, and my previous landlord sold it last summer to a guy that plans to build a mansion on it starting in June. When he came over to check out the view, he was annoyed that the neighbors chimney and part of the roof obstructed some of the view. So he bought the neighbor's house, and is going to tear it down so he can have a better view.  I make a reasonable amount of money through my salary and investments, but this guy is rich like I've never seen before.     With all their hot air they won't need to use helium!  I'll let myself out.

Saudi Arabia is just about one of the most misaligned countries in the world.  Strategically keeping an alliance with Saudi Arabia is important. But ethically... Fuck them.   I think it's due to Russia. Now it's more important to have more friends than it is to have the ability to crush and restrain potential enemies. I suspect we'll see a push for an alliance with the Syrian government sometime in the not too distant future just to counter Russia's growing friendship there.      Just when you thought it couldn't get any worse... comes the sequel: "Bedtime: The Concussion".    Let's not be too quick to judge those responsible for such bureaucratic failures... I mean who among us has not lost track of a gigantic cargo transport jetliner before?   I personally believe that whole "asteroid mining" operation Planetary Resources isn't far behind. They are doing great work in advancing some key space technology, but their charter of mining asteroids seems like a market gimmick. Yet people buy it up and throw them funding every time a new article pops up about the mining of the future.      From the way they are handling him in the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBGHLPzuSAk feature=youtu.be) and based on descriptions it seems like it may have just been severely mentally unstable person having a breakdown. In which case I could see multiple reasons why they wouldn't called it an attempted hijacking... Mainly that the airlines don't want to spook passengers of other flights, and because if it's mental illness they may not want to label him a hijacker and make things worse for whatever he's going through.   It's free, with the caviate of sponsored links/ads. They aren't intrusive at all however.  I'd recommend using Mint.com to anyone that wants to track their finances.

Installing posts on with a height marker spanning between them, much like those before fast-food drive-thrus. That way there is a non-destructive warning instead of disaster with that stationary guard.  Surely it's worth the cost. The liability alone for the city must be huge without it.    The options seem limited. The police can pull out to fortified positions and let the protesters potentially cause mayhem and destruction, or they ensure no protesters are on the street by implementing a curfew and also cracking down on congregating groups. They probably won't be exclusive either...  I really don't foresee anyway this will deescalate without some form of martial law.

Why are you are you smearing bacon grease all over the door handles?"   Successfully accomplishing nothing with style.   I think it's a trade off between the risk you're willing to take. To get those kind of returns in the current market you'll likely need a somewhat aggressive fund, which presents a relatively high risk. The past few years have offered great returns on most mutual funds, but I think things are starting to slow down and volatility is returning.  If you own the property and it's insured, your risk there is low, assuming you can continue to find renters. What region is the property in? I'd suggest checking out a site like Zillow to get property value estimates and see what kind of appreciation is occurring in your market area. If appreciation is high, you'll get multiple bonuses... As home prices go up generally rent prices rise as well due to higher demand, and of course you'll be able to get a better return when you do choose to sell.   It's also tax free, so it's the route that should always be taken in contrast to the indirect method of selling your stocks and buying more in another account (which will cost you a big hit).  Not all funds can be transferred in this way however. I'm not sure about the exact definition of what can or cannot be transferred through ACATS, but in the past my transfers from one brokerage to another did not allow some foreign stocks from a mutual fund to be transferred. Those foreign stocks had to be liquidated, and the funds transferred separately.   The SEC really cracks down on that type of thing with fines and/or jail time. I'm sure there are stock advisers that do this, but it would not be trivial for someone with a high profile to do it without getting caught, or at the very least investigated.   I think for some this could be even more traumatizing, so care should be taken to ensure such a gift won't cause more breakdowns. For example my great grandmother had Alzheimer's, and as it advanced she lost more and more recent memories, including the death of her husband. When she'd see a picture of him, or hear his name, she'd become excited and ask for us to call him and have him join us (at family dinners). She'd be so persistent that she'd have to be reminded he had passed away, and each time it was like she was being told for the first time.. it was very traumatizing. We tried to keep discussions relevant to current events in order to avoid such triggers. I think in cases like hers, providing photos of the past may be better off avoided.   I'm fine with batteries losing efficiency with charge cycles over time, as it's a limitation of today's current technology and there is no way around it. But I'd like to be able to replace those batteries once they do become severely degraded. Having to buy an entirely new device just because the battery isn't removable seems so silly (outside of the business sense).   I wish phones/devices with non-removable batteries would get the same scrutiny. Even though I know I'll upgrade my phone a year or two after I buy it to stay up on the latest technology, I hate the fact that with many devices I am **forced** to buy a new model simply because the battery will be degraded so much it'll be unable to hold a decent charge.      Maybe I'm just cynical, but your account is only 10 days old and most contributions are related to electric vehicles and also investing in general... This seems like a pump-and-dump, and I think people should be extra wary of this rumor.   Many people owning Tesla shares are financially worried about the Apple electric vehicle news and what it means for the future of the Tesla stock, and because of that I think we'll see a lot more false rumors on the horizon in an effort to inflate Tesla prices so major stock holders can jump ship or re-balance with Apple.   Why such a large CPU cooler?   I had a TV when I first moved out on my own that had a broken power switch, and occasionally it would get stuck when I turned it off and release at a later seemingly random time. When it did it would turn the TV back on to the antenna source, and I didn't have an antenna hooked up. So I'd wake up and hear static, and walk down to the living room to see the TV on lighting up the dark room. Even after I realized what was happening it still freaked me out, there were multiple times where I'd be so freaked out that I'd just turn my lights on, close the door, and go to sleep with the TV still on downstairs.

I had a friend that did this, except instead of glass it was his bare ass.  After screaming his brother's name at the top of his lungs, the brother that was asleep raised his head straight up into a face full of dirty bare ass.  They were teens at the time, and they continue to provide awesome brotherly antics even into their 30s.    Thanks. Much better source. The OP's link leans towards blaming the police as being the culprits. They left out a lot of important information, including statements from the family saying she was unstable.   countercurrentnews.com? That sounds like a completely trustworthy and unbiased source. They might as well be the onion.         I started tracking my sleep 2 years ago along with other health indicators so I could better make 'tweaks' and see a response in the data. Right now I'm at 5.6 hours of sleep on average (and that's with a few nights of 8 hours in there too) for the last 14 days, which is nearing an all time low. Now I'm paranoid about the lack of sleep and being unable to get back on track... which makes me more paranoid that I won't be able to fall asleep, and therefore I can't fall asleep easily due to the anxiety.   I think the worst thing someone can do for sleep is to start to worry about the sleep. It's what always sets it off for me. If I don't have to wake up at a specific time for work or an appointment it's a lot easier for me to fall asleep, but the moment I have an upcoming responsibility that's dependent on getting a good night of sleep, everything goes to hell in a handbasket.  If anyone has any tips for avoiding negative thoughts about sleep, that'd be awesome.   I'm on the team of a prominent software company that develops  prominent security software, and as such I have access to articles and the latest research in the security inner circles. Most of the news reports concerning this malicious firmware are inaccurate due to misunderstanding in both the general media and the general population.  This is a targeted attack, not an attack that affects everyone with a recent hard-drive. This is malicious firmware being flashed onto the devices AFTER manufacturing and packaging. Not during. This isn't the first time we've seen such malware, the difference this time is that the targets are so clear. What's happening here is that there is a middle-man between shipments from the hard-drive manufacturers and/or the retailers selling to the governments in question.  It takes a lot of resources to intercept drives, flash them, re-package them, and send them on their way. It's also possible a 'fake' seller/retailer has been granted sale contracts to these governments. The common user has no reason to worry, unless they work for the Russian government in a high profile position.

Seriously I wouldn't want to enter a house like a grain bin just because of all the horrible memories of suffering... No thanks!      Maybe it was a red cell operation, or just a citizen concerned with how vulnerable transmission lines are...  We cannot switch to a decentralized grid fast enough. I really really hope energy storage and solar takes off on a per-home basis, because our current power grid is a pending disaster.   I love the fear you can hear in their voices and the overall ominous feel as they know they can do nothing to stop the punishment they so deserve.       The title is Fubar. I work at a prominent software company on a team that develops prominent security software and systems. Whatever the system is, they are not going to be able to use it to pull password DBs and protected pages out of thin air or encrypted communications.   What I suspect this is, is simply a monitoring system on an existing surveillance network, where the new tool crawls sites that are revealed through non-tunneled or encrypted requests. It's definitely not going to kill the 'dark web'. It'll just make it easier to discover criminal sites where the addresses were previously not revealed outside of the user base.   They may have been despised because they were so successful. People thought they were pushing non-Jews into poverty. The current extremist Muslim situation is much different, people despise them because they are killing and terrorizing citizens of their countries... not because they believe they are pushing others into poverty.   I have over a dozen speeding tickets (most minor speeding and never in a truly dangerous area) in the US and get pulled over a lot because my license plate will often become unreadable after driving on dusty roads. All but one officer has been extremely polite to me, and that includes city officers in addition to sheriffs and State Patrol.   Most of the US videos I see where the officer is being an 'asshole' the person with the camera is not being polite either. Saying "am I being detained" over and over is not going to result in a polite conversation. I think with cops in pretty much any developed country, if you treat them with respect, they will treat you with respect.   Pretty soon these terrorists will get what they want, more conflict, but god I hope they are crushed without mercy when the masses of people begin to rise up and exterminate them.

It'd probably sound like freight trains crashing all around you, with smoke, choking dust, and fire thrown into the nightmare.  Even being underground would be horrendous.

                   My understanding was that they weren't happy with the compromise. Is there a source somewhere saying that they supported the compromise?                     That's what I thought. I've never seen confederate flag merchandise at Walmart. Lots of duck dynasty and camo merchandise though.    How will they do that for Lucky Charms and Trix?          Remember last fall she defended the flag because "CEOs hadn't complained about it"   [source](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-ceos)       Another Fox hatchet job                               Pretty big deal because last fall she defended the flag because "CEOs hadn't complained about it"   [source](http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/nikki-haley-confederate-flag-ceos)       I guess CEOs complained              I didn't like Jurassic World , the whole thing was predictable    Don't give them  any ideas        I'm shocked    Does the NRA know of the concept called "PR"? Because it seems like they don't.    Why did Norway give all of their oil to 'murica ?   How did Germany kill Greece?    When did he get political? This isn't me defending his political beliefs I'm legitimately curious as to what he has said and how this may have hurt him. There are loads of celebrities that have made political statements and it hasn't hurt them, so why Jim Carrey?       Lets be honest he never had a real chance to win the nomination.                            nothing of value will be lost             The last one is my favorite      The recent incident that led to people criticizing the Police: www.courier-journal.com/story/news/crime/2015/06/13/lmpd-shooting-near-3rd-and-oak-streets/71178888/                  But the ban on Men's basketball tourney games taking place there remains.    First time a short had me in tears. [The song and tune reminded me of Over the Rainbow by Israel Kamakawiwo'ole](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z26BvHOD_sg)     The NCAA doesn't let any tournament events go on in South Carolina or Mississippi because of their embrace of the confederate flag. This has been official policy since 1999. Since then SC has added major production facilities for BMW and Boeing and just announced a new plant for Volvo (even Mississippi has added a production facility for Toyota), and Gov. Nikki Haley has said that no CEOs have mentioned the flag to her as a problem. I don't see anything changing in the future.    It doesn't need to be banned. It just shouldn't be flown on the lawn of the South Carolina legislature. There is too much baggage associated with the flag. If you think it's "southern pride" then fly it on your own property. That flag was flown by traitors who rebelled against the US government. No state should embrace that flag   [(this applies to Mississippi as well)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Mississippi)  Note: Born and raised in Georgia and always associated that flag with racism.   edit: spelling and grammar.    That scene had me laughing because their reactions were hilarious. Leave it to sadness to realize the solution is falling on your face.

       This actually needed to go to the state supreme court?                     Because they have personal insecurities they don't know how to deal with so they lash out at others to make themselves feel better about themselves.  That and they have low self esteem.   Is this CEO of reddit effectively calling all 150000+ users of FPH "idiots from that toxic shithole" ?  Her and many others.     Yes, if it is shown in court he is real and has potential to cause harm to property.  So what you're saying is that we don't really know if this guy is legit or has the potential to cause harm to property?    And are you also saying that a seller should be required to tell a potential buyer about **possible** things that could happen to the property from outside forces?  Give me a break pal, you're grasping at straws at this point.  First you say it's required for the people to report it to a buyer but you can't support that with factual evidence.  Second, you want to fall back on 'the courts have made exceptions before,' which still doesn't show how this would have been required.  Third, you're not even reading what the hell they mean when they use the terms "material" and "property" but instead think your own personal opinion on what it should mean is the true definition. Fourth, you think people should be required to report things that **MIGHT** happen to the property in the future from outside forces?  Really?!   Materials can be any relevant information that can be deemed hazaroudous to a potential buyer.  About the house and property.  You have yet to show how this person is an actual, physical, legal component of the house and/or property.  Murder/suicides are not relevant  Ones that occurred in the actual house/property apparently were.  Lightning has the capacity to cause damage to the house.  Should the seller be required to tell the buyer that too?      material facts or who hide information about their property  Exactly.  **Material** facts about the **property**.  He is not part of the property.  The house and land is the property.  Hell, NJ courts decided that even previous murders/suicides in the house don't need to be disclosed.  UNLESS the potential buyers specifically ask about it.  In which case the seller would then need to disclose it.  Here's the [NJ Seller's Disclosure Agreement](http://www.marybajwa.com/IS2/Data/AgentSites/64976/property%20disclosure.pdf).   he can affect potential resale of the property... thats enough  Possibly.  However he does not fall under the requirement of needing to be disclosed.  Unless the buyers specifically asked about a problem that he would fall under, the sellers were not required to tell them.   If the former owners daughter is afraid of a ghost in the house, and its anything from a squeaky floorboard to literally nothing,   The squeaky floorboard is the only thing that would need to be disclosed as it's an actual defect to the property.  "Hauntings", past murders in the house, or past suicides in the house are not disclosure requirements in NJ unless the potential buyer asks about it.  the realtor is required by law to disclose.  And what New Jersey law requires them to disclose an annoying person who is not part of the property?  Hell, you're not required to disclose a murder or suicide that happened in a house in NJ unless the potential buyer specifically asks about it.  I'm pretty sure the only thing they actually can't disclose is the racial makeup of your neighborhood.   Homeowners can disclose whatever they want.  There are certain things that they are required to disclose about the property and they are required to also disclose things that the buyers ask about.  That's it.  If the HOUSE is being harassed,you can bet that falls under duty to disclose.  Source?    It requires disclosure.  No it doesn't.  Show me the law in New Jersey that requires this.       Not the same principle.  The chemicals in the soil at the house I would have just sold you are and actual part of the house/property that I am selling you.  The bozo is not a part of the house/property.      That's along the lines of what I was thinking.  Anything pertaining to the property?  Yes, absolutely that needs to be disclosed.  The bozo isn't part of the property being sold.   I would imagine they are under no obligation to disclose that.  But that's just me.  Like you said, it's a gray area.   What are they suing for?  The previous owners were selling the house.  The buyers bought the house.  Are homeowners supposed to provide crime stats and profiles of all people in the neighborhood now?   Title incorrect by the media source based on the story.  Says they were *released* in Memphis but article says:  Not only is the agency setting the criminals free, **it's also not keeping track of their whereabouts.**        Ban Ham!   Towns across the country have reported the appearance of KKK fliers **with bags of candy on residents lawns**  Skipping out on [the recruiting van](https://punditonline.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/free-candy-truck-1.jpg)?             He's sorry he got caught.      Because it was reductive as shit.  Because the answer goes against your ideal you're talking about here.  You're trying to rip the carpet out from underneath that power structure, not kiss it's ass and hope it goes away.   Burn buildings, ruin other people's livelihood, and vandalize.  Yeah.  Let me know how that works out for you.  You're only making the "power structure" stronger.  Racial inequality will go away  Good one.  when people stop compromising with it's enemies,  Actually that's how things get solved.    not when they water themselves down to accommodate them.   Who's saying to accommodate?  It's called working together.    But hey, it's obvious your goal is merely to be a vandal and cause chaos that is not going to do anything except make people more pissed off at you.  Good luck with that.    You didn't read it very closely then.   Still waiting for you to show me his **goal** was positive tension.  The man's legacy has been whitewashed. He might have been a pacifist, but he was also no pushover who went around demonizing rioters like so many conservative pundits keep assuming he did. You can go on google and find plenty of quotes from him (especially towards the end of his life) defending the actions of looters during the detroit riots or property destruction.  He was a christian and thought being non-violent was gods way. But that doesn't mean he lacked understanding.  I might add that MLK was far from some sort of holy prophet who's alter we must bow before.   Yet, you want to quote MLK yourself.  Amazing how you dismiss something he said when it doesn't fit your ideals.  Nobody ever gained liberation by asking politely. Nobody. There is no dialogue, because at the end of the day the powerful have no reason to listen. The oppressed are not meant to grovel before their oppressors for freedom, because they won't get it.   You didn't answer the question.     Porn   I check their reddit account to see if they like to rip off hot page posts.   Letter From A Birmingham Jail.   Yes.  I read it.  Show me the source where he says his goal was to create positive tension.  Since MLK Jr. has been brought up, what's your take on this quote by him?  *Now what I'm saying is this: I would like for all of us to believe in non-violence, but I'm here to say tonight that if every Negro in the United States turns against non-violence, I'm going to stand up as a lone voice and say, "This is the wrong way!"*   Think about it for a second.  Who are you more likely to work with hand in hand to bring about change?  Person A: YOU make someone's life miserable.  YOU discriminate against them and make their life miserable.  You discriminate, etc, etc, etc.  They come up to you and let you know the issues you are causing and want to start a dialogue.  Person B: YOU make someone's life miserable.  YOU discriminate against them and make their life miserable.  You discriminate, etc, etc, etc.  They come up to your house and break windows, spray paint the house, etc etc etc.         Martin Luther King said his goal was to create "positive tension"  Source?  Additionally, pointless vandalism that does nothing but get people more angry/resistant to others does not bring about "positive" change.  Missed all the rallies, protests, marches, and **riots** this past year, did we? And that's just the public face, never mind what's going on behind the scenes.   Rallies, protests, and marches would accomplish something.  Much like MLK Jr. did.  Riots?  See my comment above.        It shocks and appalls people  And just gets people more pissed off at the people doing it and resistant to wanting to do anything for said people.  There has not been a single movement in human history that hasn't been accompanied by the occasional act of vandalism.  Key word there being *accompanied*.  What else is accompanying the vandalism?   Direct action fights oppression.   Explain to me how spray-painting/vandalizing fights oppression and accomplishes anything.   Really helping the cause I'm sure.   The question itself was born of allegations made by the **conservative author**  I'm shocked!   all lives matter  Why the hell would this piss anybody off?   Oh good, now we get to have different classes of terrorism.     Give the offended people a trophy.  They'll be OK.   Taste the rainbow.   However, Owens says Republicans in Congress have made it virtually impossible for the IRS to revoke the tax-exempt status of political groups after the recent, so-called Tea Party scandal. Republicans criticized the IRS for what they said was inexcusable targeting of conservative 501(c)(4)s. And the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration said the agency had employed inappropriate criteria in scrutinizing some groups tax-exemption applications.    Remember the days of picking up a phone and actually talking to someone?      He's under the care of the police.  He complained of hunger.  Inmates are required to be fed while in detention.    What's the issue?  It's not like they gave him Filet Mignon.   And this has what to do with the First Amendment?      You're still avoiding the question..........  But in response to your silliness up above, I'll direct you to my usage of "I," "me," and "I'd."     Continual avoidance of the question only serves to answer it for you already.  You're answer is **no** but you don't want to actually state it because then you reveal yourself to be a hypocrite.  Oh... FYI, The SC Legislature just agreed to take up a debate on the subject of removing the Confederate Flag from the Statehouse grounds.  Yes.  I know.  That story has already been posted a few times now in /r/news and I already commented on it.  At the outset, I think it's a joke to have a vote to discuss something to then have another vote.  Just do it already.  However, this is a symbolic vote in my opinion and once things cool down after a few weeks, I don't believe it'll change.  It's the typical politician "kick the can down the road until people forget and we can move on" ploy that we see all the time as it is.   California Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation on Thursday prohibiting selling or displaying items bearing the Confederate flag.  Not sure if you purposely left out some essential information or not but in case you didn't:  Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation last year **prohibiting state agencies** from selling or displaying items bearing the flag  So where exactly is the First Amendment being encroached upon?   Trying to change the subject once again?   No.  Asking you to respond to a question I've now asked three times.     The First Amendment (Amendment I) to the United States Constitution prohibits the making of any law respecting an establishment of religion, impeding the free exercise of religion, abridging the freedom of speech, infringing on the freedom of the press, interfering with the right to peaceably assemble or prohibiting the petitioning for a governmental redress of grievances.  Right.  And where exactly is any of this happening?   Are you going to answer the question I directly asked you twice already?  Here, in case you forgot.    **Do you also support banning the U.S. flag? If no, why?**    I do not agree with banning the flag but you really need to read and understand what the First Amendment actually means.   Why imagine? Ask them. I would imagine that if it upset me that much, I'd move elsewhere to any of the other states in the country that don't have the flag and not stay there.  However, at least recently, when issues arise I see pictures and videos of black people burning not the Confederate flag, but the U.S. flag.  As I previously stated, the KKK flies the U.S. flag at rallies.  Such as [here](http://betanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/75967545_copjvo8a.jpg), [here](http://www.authentichistory.com/1921-1929/4-resistance/2-KKK/19250809_Klan_March_on_Washington_version3-Capitol_Steps.jpg), [here](http://www.rulen.com/kkk/kkkflag3.jpg), and [here in this flyer/poster/whatever it is.](http://pictures.ozy.com/pictures/450xany/8/7/9/70879_42-15780039.jpg).  And let's not forget our slave-owning forefathers as well.  Do you also support banning the U.S. flag?  If no, why?   I've considered the reality that this flag is all over the place and the solid majority don't go randomly shooting people because of it.  However, one person does it and it gets banned?  Really?    Why not ban the U.S. flag while we're at it?  The KKK, who have hung blacks, typically wave the U.S. flag around.  Let's ban the Bible.  People who attack/bomb abortion clinics are doing it because of what they perceive the Bible to say.    To blame this on a flag is outrageously simplistic and characteristic of those who don't want to work to figure out the real problem.   I doubt the removal will happen.  All of this crap is going on right now because it's the shiny new object.  Give it a few weeks and everyone will forget about it.   Would all this flag drama be going on if the shooting happened in a different state?  It amazes me that suddenly everyone gives a damn about..........a flag.  All this does is give that symbol more power than it had before.  Then again, this is the kind of crap this country does when things go wrong.  Focus on the non-issue and ignore the real issue.   I find the government having to take a vote to discuss something before taking another vote more infuriating than a flag.            And why is this news?  Probably the same reason you posted an article to /r/news about the [Attorney General meeting Gray's family](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/34z2zz/attorney_general_loretta_lynch_meets_freddie/).      because all conversation in the comments MUST follow the topic of the title. There CANNOT be any side discussion.   Yet you're getting spun up claiming that **I** derailed the topic.  Now you're defending it.  Make up your mind pal.  Two or three news stations running a story EQUALS the whole country being thoroughly informed.  Two or three news stations cancels out your claims that the media made no peep of it.  Additionally, if you think those few, to include the #1 circulated newspaper in the country were the only ones, you're deluding yourself.  As I previously stated, I grabbed the first five I saw on the first page of a Google search.  Anyone that had 5 Hour Energy in the last 5 years and never heard of this should feel quite betrayed, by the media, stores, and FDA;  Uh, yeah, OK.  Oversensitive much?  fuck off troll  What?  No facts to support your claims?  Eh, I guess when not only I, but you yourself show your claims to be B.S., I guess this is what you resort too.  Toodles.   For fuck's sake all this time I've been talking about the crime not the indictments!!!  Then, when the title of an article states *Caffeine crime: 11 indicted in a massive 5-Hour Energy scam* with the indictments being the news of the story, you shouldn't start your first response with **"This** happened 3 years ago."  Yes I was talking about a topic, and you tried to derail it with misdirection talking about something totally different, the indictments.  Wait, so, you trying to talk about media conspiracy is **NOT** trying to derail a subject but talking about the indictments, which are the main point of the news article is?  Uh huh.  OH.    You've added nothing to the conversation, just trolling.   I've provided factual information.  You have yet to do so.  Yes there is a literal conspiracy if many TV media stations are sponsored by 5 Hour Energy and ignore news about it.   I already asked for the proof of this.  Are you going to show it or not?  If not, well, we all know you're full of crap.  That is the definition of a conspiracy.  Proof?  Evidence?  Conspiracies happen all the time.   Oh boy.  How many tin foil hats do you own?  Your attempt at using "conspiracy" as a derogatory label is laughable.  And you're only supporting it.  Yes, of 5 links, you linked one news paper's online page. The rest, as I said were garbage. I also graciously pointed out that Fortune covered it too.   They're only garbage because you don't want them to be credible.  Why?  We'll get to that in a minute.  Graciously pointed out "Fortune?"  Fortune was cited in the article up above genius.  I guess you didn't read it.  You seem to be trying really hard to disprove something that isn't here.   No, I didn't have to try hard at all.  I already disproved the below statements you made with the five links I provided and the Fortune article that this news source cites.  Oh, and you citing Fortune yourself just kills your own conspiracy topic.  Was the public notified?   it is that the public never heard one peep from the media about this 3 years ago    5 hour energy sales would have tanked if the public knew  See?  The public was made aware.  Wasn't hard to shoot your theory out the window.  There is nothing here  Yes.  I know.  I've read your posts.  but you being confused and trolling.  Says the guy playing conspiracy and sadly trying to redirect the point of the article.  You are just a time waster.   I sure am!  Come on back now ya hear!   Relevant text:  If a fruit cake contains alcohol, it could remain edible for many years. For example, a fruit cake baked in 1878 is kept as an heirloom by a family (Morgan L. Ford) in Tecumseh, Michigan. In 2003 it was sampled by Jay Leno on The Tonight Show. Wrapping the cake in alcohol-soaked linen before storing is one method of lengthening its shelf life.      Relevant text:  Devils Tower (Lakota: Mat Thpila ("Bear Lodge") or Pteh  ("Brown Buffalo Horn") (Arapaho: Wox Niiinon [5]) is an igneous intrusion or laccolith in the Bear Lodge Mountains (part of the Black Hills) near Hulett and Sundance in Crook County, northeastern Wyoming, above the Belle Fourche River. It rises dramatically 1,267 feet (386 m) above the surrounding terrain and the summit is 5,114 feet (1,559 m) above sea level.  Devils Tower was the first declared United States National Monument, established on September 24, 1906, by President Theodore Roosevelt. The Monument's boundary encloses an area of 1,347 acres (545 ha).  In recent years, about 1% of the Monument's 400,000 annual visitors climbed Devils Tower, mostly using traditional climbing techniques.  The name Devil's Tower originated in 1875 during an expedition led by Col. Richard Irving Dodge when his interpreter misinterpreted the name to mean Bad God's Tower, which then became Devil's Tower. All information signs in that area use the name "Devils Tower", following a geographic naming standard whereby the apostrophe is eliminated.             You say this just happened  Yes.  The **INDICTMENTS** just happened.  Or did you not bother reading both the title and article themselves?  but then you list 5 links proving it happened up until 2012  Please provide me the sections of each of those five articles that state the indictments happened in 2012.  You keep trying to misdirect the conversation into being **about the indictments**  You mean what the posted news article is about?  which I was never talking about  Then why participate at all?  Oh, yeah, media conspiracy......  Just say, "oh, I thought you were talking about the indictment, not the actual crime."  The article is about the indictments.  You trying to go elsewhere is just preaching conspiracy from your soapbox.  Additionally, anybody who reads your first post knows you weren't focused on the crime itself.  Again, conspiracy.  Half of your news sources are unheard of crap.   Yet they remain in existence today meaning that people are paying for it.  One is a local news source.  Well, you've got two that include the 11th and 28th rated media markets in the country.  And two other sites that reported on it that, again, remain in existence today meaning people are reading it.  US Today is the other  USA Today, the country's most widely circulated newspaper.  Fortune covered it at the time too.  So you just identified a 6th one.  Just because a couple websites covered it doesn't mean the majority of TV news which is frequently sponsored by 5-Hour Energy didn't conveniently ignore it.  Can you provide proof that others "conveniently" ignored it?  I mean hell, one of the sources was a Fox affiliate.  The very organization that would probably be least likely to go against anything corporate.  Oh, then you had this gem:  The point is not and never was that the indictments happened 3 years ago, it is that the public never heard one peep from the media about this 3 years ago  Which you just invalidated yourself by identifying one source.  Nevermind the first five I grabbed from the first page of a Google search.  Keep drinking the conspiracy Kool-Aid!       Done.  Sorry about that.   This happened 3 years ago  Title of article: *Caffeine crime: 11 indicted in a massive 5-Hour Energy scam*  Date of article: *19 June 2015*  Thus, the indictments did not happen three years ago.  They **JUST** happened.    Corporate control of the media in action. 5 hour energy sales would have tanked if the public knew the market was flooded with dangerous counterfeit products.  You mean like:  [This](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2012/11/20/5-hour-energy-counterfeit-operation/1718391/)  [This one too](http://www.mlive.com/business/detroit/index.ssf/2012/11/metro_detroit_based_5-hour_ene.html)  [Another one](http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/counterfeit-5-hour-energy-operation-shut-down-179989061.html)  [Lookie here!](http://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/news/2012/11/fake-5-hour-energy-shots-seized.aspx)  [And another](http://fox5sandiego.com/2012/11/20/5-hour-energy-makers-id-counterfeit-projects/)  So, yeah.  Learn to read and comprehend a title.  Additionally, do a simple Google search before you start yelling conspiracy.   And when did the indictments happen?   Actually, no, that's not the point of the article.  You should run along to /r/conspiracy.     Did you even read the title of the article?  You know, the main point?  Where it says "11 indicted" which is the point of the article?  This happened 3 years ago  Did the indictments happen three years ago?  No.  They didn't.  Thus, this **DID NOT** happen three years ago.   You didn't read the article did you?  Were the people indicted three years ago?

It promised to purify American politics by limiting or ending the influence of Irish Catholics and other immigrants, thus reflecting nativism and anti-Catholic sentiment. It was empowered by popular fears that the country was being overwhelmed by German and Irish Catholic immigrants, whom they saw as hostile to republican values and controlled by the Pope in Rome. Mainly active from 1854 to 1856, it strove to curb immigration and naturalization, but met with little success. Membership was limited to Protestant men. There were few prominent leaders, and the largely middle-class membership fragmented over the issue of slavery.The origin of the "Know Nothing" term was in the semi-secret organization of the party. When a member was asked about its activities, he was supposed to reply, "I know nothing." Outsiders called them "Know-Nothings", and the name stuck. In 1855, the Know-Nothings first entered politics under the American Party label.      Relevant text:  The death of Jesse James became a national sensation. The Fords made no attempt to hide their role. Indeed, Robert Ford wired the governor to claim his reward. Crowds pressed into the little house in St. Joseph to see the dead bandit, even while the Ford brothers surrendered to the authorities but they were dismayed to find that they were charged with first degree murder. In the course of a single day, the Ford brothers were indicted, pleaded guilty, were sentenced to death by hanging and two hours later were granted a full pardon by Governor Crittenden.  The governor's quick pardon suggested he knew the brothers intended to kill James rather than capture him. The implication that the chief executive of Missouri conspired to kill a private citizen startled the public and added to James' notoriety.      Relevant text:  Tajiri first thought of Pokmon around 1989 or 1990, when the Game Boy was first released. **The concept of the Pokmon universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of Pokmon, stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Pokmon executive director Satoshi Tajiri enjoyed as a child.** Players of the games are designated as Pokmon Trainers, and in the main series Pokmon games, these trainers have two general goals. These are to complete the Pokdex by collecting all of the available Pokmon species found in the fictional region where that game takes place; and to train a team of powerful Pokmon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers, and eventually win the fictional Pokmon League. These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the Pokmon franchise, including the video games, the anime and manga series, and the Pokmon Trading Card Game.

Relevant text:  For three months Curcio observed a Brinks armored car make its deliveries to the Bank of America branch in Monroe, Washington, and he took notes of the schedule and diagrammed locations of the banks cameras and the armored cars blind spots. He also estimated how much money was being transferred to the bank and how much was being removed via ATM machines.  When he considered police protocol in responding to robberies, the location of the bank and their containment of roads he realized he needed a good getaway plan. Thats when he decided on using the local river to escape.  After weeks of hand-dredging the river (Woods Creek) and a failed practice attempt using a jet ski for the getaway, he changed his approach and created a cable pulley system to quickly pull himself and large bags of cash, upstream in the river using a connected canvas-wrapped inner tube.  Curcios planning culminated with an advertisement he placed on Craigslist a few days before the robbery. The online ad sought 15 to 20 workers for a fictitious city cleanup project, promising $28.50 an hour. The laborers were told to wear jeans, a blue shirt, work shoes and a yellow safety vest. The ad also told the applicants they needed to bring safety goggles and a painters mask. The ad directed them to meet in the Bank of America parking lot at the exact time Curcio planned to rob the armored car.  On Sept. 30, 2008, Curcio, dressed identically to his decoy applicants, pretended to work the grounds near the bank. Wearing a blue shirt, jeans, yellow safety vest, work boots and painters mask, he pepper-sprayed the Brinks armored-car guard who was pushing a dolly loaded with money into the bank. The pepper spray forced the guard to reach for his eyes and release the cart that held the money. Curcio grabbed two bags of money, containing more than $400,000, and ran toward the creek. Meanwhile, police arrived to find the banks parking lot filled with men matching the robbers description.  At the waters edge, Curcio threw the money into the inner tube, and he pulled himself down the creek with the cables he had previously strung. He travelled about 200 yards downstream and exited the creek behind several businesses on the opposite side of the highway as the bank.  Curcio removed his wig and construction outfit that had been attached by Velcro revealing different attire underneath. He hopped in a getaway vehicle and left.  Curcios careful planning and unusual getaway gained national attention. The timing of the robbery came just days after announcements of the governments $700 billion bailout package that included Bank of America. The unique robbery techniques created folk lore for the mysterious robber who was referred to as "D.B. Tuber" after famed hijacker D.B.

 Just curious if this has happened to anyone. All of our other network devices are behaving just fine. Our echo just suddenly stopped responding.  How did you resolve? Just yank the cord and wait a few minutes? Did it come back on its own? Or did you have to re-setup your echo?   Sadly, they do. The one downside of the modern NRA is they have been hellaciously defiant when it comes to any legislation that would enforce any sort of training requirements for gun owners. So there are a ton of folks who get robbed, buy a gun, load up a magazine, and put it in their closet where it sits for years until they need it next. Sadly if they ever try to use it, the barrel is so clogged with dust that it misfires, or worse.   For inside a residence? I would recommend either a low/mid gauge shotgun (16 or 20ga should be fine for inside a home), or a mid caliber pistol. We have a single 9mm with JHP cartridges for my wife and I in case of emergencies (whether the human or animal kind).  You want to stay far away from full metal jacket cartridges at all cost for home defense. If a shot gets fired, FMJ bullets can pass through the target, into and through a wall, and into the adjoining home potentially hitting anyone on the other side. JHP will mushroom and either get embedded in the target or at the very least lose so much kinetic energy that it can't travel through the wall.  Note, whether or not JHP cartridges are legal varies by state. I know that in New Jersey, home defense rounds (JHP that have notches cut into them) are illegal, but in PA they are legal.   Thanks for pointing this out. I sent in a suggestion to be able to request stock ticker information, and maybe a portfolio summary. It would be great to say, "Alexa, what is the current stock price of GOOG" and get a response like "The current stock price of GOOG, google, is 500 dollars and 75 cents, up 50 cents from the opening bell."   We use it constantly, and honestly I would say it's worth even 200$ now that the wife and I have made it part of our workflow. We use it constantly.  * Bluetooth speaker for our phones * Shopping list - my wife and I are cooking geeks, and you always realize you are out of something when you are in the middle of cooking. The problem is that doesn't always mean you have a chance to write it down. It's extremely easy to just say "Alexa, add smoked paprika to the shopping list" when your hands are occupied. * Todo list - this is awesome. If we find a small issue with the house, just throw it on there and then we have a hitlist for the weekend * Time functions - being able to ask the time, set timers, and set alarms is awesome. The only improvement I could think of would be if you could create multiple timers (alexa, add a 30 minute timer for beef, alexa add a 10 minute timer for bread). Usually when we are cooking we have 4-5 different dishes going at once, and trying to remember what device is the timer for what dish can be a little complicated. * Radio replacement - We used it to remove a clunky old under-cabinet radio that was PITA. Between tunein and iheartradio we have access to all of our local radio stations in perfect clarity, PLUS we have the ability to use pandora which is awesome. I wish there was better spotify integration though. * Home automation - After fixing some hokey wiring done by the previous homeowner, I realized that several rooms of ours were daisy-chained out of a single 1-gang electrical box. Fixing the issue to bring it to code meant that I effectively cut power to light fixtures in 2 rooms. I have since put in lamps in those rooms using WeMo switches - Alexa is wonderful for controlling them (especially after their firmware was updated). The biggest improvement here would be a wider range of support (hello nest!), and it would be REALLY awesome if they would release a remote that had a speaker built into it.  Worth the price at 99?

The timing between her post and your post is just too perfect not to ask.   Pretty simple question I hope. I need to create a part, but I don't have access to a 3d printer. This is a rather rare instance for me, so it is hard to justify buying a printer for one small part.  Are there any decent, cheap companies that can print a part for me if I send them the file? Specifically, I need a liner for a plant pot created because a decorative planter doesn't have any drainage holes, and no off-the-shelf pots fit the planter, so it would need to be foodsafe plastic.   It does, so you would lean towards the 75/25 allocation instead of pure 50/50 based on the current market conditions.   There are bond funds out there, most of the major mutual fund companies offer them. Be aware though, they tend to have higher fee schedules than stock funds for some reason (maybe someone out there knows why). I personally participate in the Mellon Aggregate Bond Fund.   The basics never change, and the markets still operate more or less the same way.   As for allocation, check out the book "The Intelligent Investor" by Ben Graham - it discusses ideal composition of portfolios re: bonds and stocks. Basically in an ideal world you would have 50/50, going so far as 75/25 in either direction based on market conditions. You make slightly less money off of it, but you also greatly reduce risk exposure if one market tanks.   Golly, that was his house?

The day I got my driver's license (literally), I was driving home when some idiot tore past me on the highway. I heard sirens in that same lane, and I turned to look. Being a brand new driver, as I turned, my car started to veer into the other lane in the direction I was looking. Coming up fast behind me in that lane was a local cop who had been chasing that car. He slammed on his breaks,  threw up his hands, and waved to pull me over. He realized I just got my license and made a stupid new driver mistake and basically told me that I needed to practice looking around while I was driving because it could literally get me killed. No citation or anything, he just told me to be more careful and get some more practice time in.  About 5 years later I got busted in a speed trap in a little podunk town in rural northern PA. The officer asked me if I had ever been pulled over for speeding, to which I responded no. He came back to my car a few minutes later and asked why I hadn't mentioned having been pulled over for speeding. I didn't know what he was talking about, so I asked him if he could be more specific. Apparently the original officer who had pulled me over the day I got my license had put down "speeding" in whatever database they use to keep track of stuff. I explained what happened - no idea if he believed me or not.  So, at least in PA, based on my experience there is SOME amount of information sharing that goes on at a state-wide level because I have been questions about it. I am not a cop though, so I'm not sure how much is logged/kept on file.

He had me pick up the Christopher Parkening method books and we have been working through that along with learning things like composition and travis picking.  I feel like steel string and electric can be pretty well learned on your own, but classical really requires a teacher, even if just as an occasional check in.   We have an adopted greyhound, who was on the track for 6 years. He has a ton of issues because of it. Not the least of which is absolute terror of shiny floors.   "Love on the Rocks with No Ice" by the Darkness   McConnell stated that if he went past midnight it would have screwed up the schedule bu pushing friday vote and discussion out a day, and the house adjourns friday. The discussion for the NSA spyung stuff was also scheduled for friday. So if he went to migbight the program is effectively killed. Per CNN.   Why the hell would he leave it with 11 minutes left? Why not go to 12 and kill this thing?   We are actually really REALLY lucky to have a ton of limestone in our area, which leads to tons of small naturally filtered springs. If I was scooping out of a river I'd absolutely filter. But most of the documented springs in our area (SE PA) are safe to drink from directly.   Basically just what the title says. I got home and somehow got in a really really shitty mood. I figured practicing might help to relax me a bit, but I just couldn't get myself to relax. Because of it, trying to play anything felt like banging my head on a wall. Not only didn't I make progress, but I feel like some stuff I could play well before I just sucked at tonight. That just made me more frustrated, and I found myself in a downward spiral.  When I found myself about to smack my classical guitar out of frustration, it was time to call it quits for the night.  Are there some nights that are just "toxic"? What do you do? Do you just walk away for a day? Can they actually screw up your progress?   Or Contra. Or COINTELPRO.   It is, but not with the other mixer ingredients mentioned above. You can clean a wound with whiskey, its a lot harder to clean it with a pia colata :)   Except the water can be used for any number of things outside of alcohol. If you only take alcohol premixed youre kinda screwed if you need to, say, clean a wound or give a dog some water.  As for hiking, most trails I have been on have a bunch of natural springs that are safe to drink from so you may not necessarily take extra water in with you.   Out of curiousity, if it appears that the HOA is maliciously prosecuting someone and evidence can be obtained, couldn't the HOA be sued for harassment?   I like pineapple on my pizza, and am quite well to do. Bring it, Coonty McTittiepants.   God damn, it's picture series like this that make me love this sub so much. I'm so glad she found you guys!

In the end you have a nice low cost basis (you will buy more when prices are low and less when prices are high automatically).   Network R D engineering for a major telecom. My name is on several IETF RFC's and I actively participate with several of their working groups.  I started out in college as a computer science/psychology dual major, but I couldn't work 2 jobs and still meet the required number of hours so I had to drop the CS major and become a psych major (I could get A's in psych just doing the reading).  The entire time I was in school I was doing technical work - network engineering, systems engineering for the school, hell, even help desk. Luckily this is one of the few arenas where companies are more often concerned about experience and technical certs than they always are about degrees (so long as you have one).   For my wife, it adds that plus horrendous nausea. I haven't seen a 3d movie for nearly a decade :(   Sadly that only works until the next administration comes into power, says that your department hasn't done anything to stop piracy, and fires all of you. They then hire people to do the exact same job and be just as unsuccessful.   It's not that much more difficult. It's essentially switching a few DNS records.   That's extremely difficult for them to do the way that safe harbor provisions are written currently.   Lehigh Valley here, though I was in Lancaster 2 weeks ago.   I have a liberal arts psychology degree. I work as an engineer. Life is full of interesting twists.   To add to this - some of us have SO's who are allergic, and live in areas with ordinances against hives (considered agricultural animals in this context) so we can't have them. However, as suggested, apiary societies are amazing.

After some success with growing basil, parsley and lettuce indoors under 6500k bulbs I would like to start augmenting my home growing system. Howeber I am unsure about the way to proceed. There are a lot of ways I could go - ebb flow, aeroponics, drip, etc. I haven't really found a good text that summarizes all of the different systems and provides info on how to build them.  Can anyone point me in a good direction?   Superbly done. I have never been able to get them perfectly round, not that I haven't tried (I just don't want to buy a pan, and trying to fill a circular template isn't always exact). I just figure my amoebae shaped macarons look homemade, lol.  They look gorgeous!   Honest questions from someone who was pretty disgusted after completing the vanilla story mode.  First, I have no friends on PSN, is there finally decent matchmaking? Or at least a way to easily communicate with other players to find people trying to do the same thing? Or am I still expected to exit the game and rely on PSN messages in the middle of a firefight?  Second, has Bungie provided any decent means of support? I was having major issues and kept getting directed to post on their forum - where issues went to die without ever seeing a response. I paid for a product, I expect support.   I have a very early edition of the Boston Cookery School Cookbook (what would become fannie farmer cookbook in later editions). When I bought it there was a lovely postcard from a visiting family to their hosts. Postmarked 1910. I now have It framed.   This reminds me of the veggie sandwich at 5 Guys Burgers. Kinda proves that you don't always need meat and cheese :)   GOD DAMN SINGLE PLY   That's really all you get out of it? I use my echo constantly.   Next time don't stick your dick in crazy.  This is a rule for you to live by. No one has the right to assault you. You are better than that.   Pay off mortgage and student loans, invest half in mutual funds, the other half in high dividend yield closed end funds and live off dividends.   We picked up a single WeMo switch, attached to a den lamp. The device is entitled "den lamp" and was added to the group "den lights". If I use the WeMo app and then try and use the Echo, it works just fine.  However if I wait an hour or two and then say "Alexa, turn off the den lamp" or "turn off the den lights" she responds "OK" and that's it. Nothing happens. The light stays on.  Is anyone else encountering this?   Welcome to the waiting list with the rest of us :) The only downside about the echo - lots and lots of waiting! It's like the disneyworld of the technology arena :) Mine arrived and I also started looking for SDK access, but now I'm on that waiting list!   Pip meets Miss Havisham, from Great Expectations. Sorry for the length.  This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told from within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed from the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady's dressing-table.  Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no fine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the strangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.  She was dressed in rich materials,satins, and lace, and silks,all of white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid than the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about. She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,the other was on the table near her hand,her veil was but half arranged, her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the looking-glass.  It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if I could.  "Who is it?" said the lady at the table.  "Pip, ma'am."  "Pip?"  "Mr. Pumblechook's boy, ma'am. Cometo play."  "Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close."  It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.  "Look at me," said Miss Havisham. "You are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born?"  I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer "No."  "Do you know what I touch here?" she said, laying her hands, one upon the other, on her left side.  "Yes, ma'am." (It made me think of the young man.)  "What do I touch?"  "Your heart."  "Broken!"  She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept her hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they were heavy.   I bet it would be good braised, shredded, and put in tacos or burritos   Northeastern US - we say "sodder"   From the thumbnail I thought this was a pie.  It is definitely not a pie.

It probably sucks a lot for those guys. But hey, dinosaurs will die.   I an app in mind. First, my wife and I have a hell of a time figuring out where to eat on date nights. I want to register restaurants with Alexa, and when we can't decide, be able to ask her for a random item off the list.  I have some other ideas in mind, but that's the one I think would be most fun.   Honestly, I would suggest you start learning some music theory in addition to Rocksmith at this point. Justinguitar offers an awesome book on music theory for guitarists, and learning that will give you mastery of not only the fretboard, but knowledge of how chords and scales work and how they're created.  The way I look at it, Rocksmith teaches you to play songs on guitar, it doesn't teach you guitar or how to play guitar - it's a subtle but important difference. It's a great tool but it can't do everything.   I applied to be a developer yesterday because I have some app ideas that I'd like to figure out how to implement, but haven't gotten a response yet.  Has anyone gotten an invite yet? How can you share apps once they are developed?   Such a shame. I'm glad I got one last visit in last week. Thankfully everyone got out in time and there weren't any injuries... way easier to rebuild buildings than people.   If it is easy, why don't you open a silkscreening business? I mean, it's easy to put down someone else's work as easy when you aren't the one doing it.   Note: you may not have success with southeast-Asian foreigners. Chewing with mouths closed is largely a western thing.  Source: used to work for a Korean company and spent a fair bit of time in Korea.   Dog was fed first?   Burn in righteous fire.   I actually am a r d engineer in the tech industry, at a reviled "evil" corporation that relied on vendor lock-in. So I am extremely familiar with how it works from both perspectives. That negative sentiment builds up like grain dust. Think it doesn't matter? Look at the Comcast/TWC merger which was brought down largely because of customer sentiment.  Your line of thinking is traditionally correct, and would have been correct about 10, maybe even 5 years ago. Hell it is correct just about everywhere except the tech arena, so please don't think I'm saying you're wrong. But it doesn't work as well with the modern tech industry landscape. The industry on the whole is moving towards an "internet of things" model, relying on lots of easily accessible api-driven services.  Fighting that tide has very real tangible costs. Support calls require paid support staff to field all of those "how do I get X to work!?" questions (in my industry a call costs anywhere from 8 to 10 dollars between payroll and fallout). When you tell a customer something can't work with your product, their initial reaction will be to think your product is crap. They will then look at your competitors to see if they work with it. Your competitors capitalize on your bad decision by marketing all of the services they do allow interoperability with and slinging some mud about how you are dated and noncompetitive. You start bleeding out customers, and end up losing a large number of them to a small company that used an open approach from the beginning because customers want freedom to use what they want and that company understood it.  At this point you sorely regret your decision to force your customers to play in a sandbox instead of taking an open approach and leveraging current technology to its fullest, all necause you wanted to squeeze a few months of profit instead of building a platform for a lifetime of revenue.  I wish I could say I was unfamiliar with this, but I have lived through it.  The traditional business model fails terribly time and again in the tech world. Look at Roku and OpenStack are both great examples. It especially fails when other competitors exist because they will gladly brutalize one another, and they do. Siri, Cortana, and Google Now are all competitors in the same niche, albiet slightly different. Why would any company want to give customers a reason to go to the competition?   Give a fuck about what? Wanna go ride bikes???   I dont think anyone is expecting accuracy beyond a ballpark figure. I am well aware I need an appraisal to find out the real number.   My concern is more that something caused the value to plummet 35k according to their estimate, and I am wondering what could have done that (their algorithm isnt published).   My issue is getting rid of pmi, which is based on current home value whether or not I am selling.   My issue is getting rid of pmi, which is based on current home value whether or not I am selling.   To be fair, reduce does not mean the same thing as eliminate. You still are coating your throat and lungs in oil, and pulling particulate matter (stuff that can pass your screen, if you have one). You may also get some minor exposure to combustion byproducts if your vape has a hotspot.  I can corroborate OP's experience (at least part way). Regular vaping causes my throat and lungs to feel "off" - there's something there making them dirty. Enough that I occasionally try to cough it out.  However unlike smoking I can still train for running while regularly vaping. I don't seem to have the same issue with lung capacity or if I do it is so minor that training compensates for any loss.   I use about .08g/day with either a MFLB or arizer solo. I have an orbiter water piece but only use it with the solo and not the mflb.   Hopefully this is the right place to ask. In November 2011 my wife and I bought our house.   In 2013 our neighbors had the idea to sell their home and move into an apartment to save money.  Their house never sold, and as of a few days ago notice got posted on their door that the house was in foreclosure and up for sheriff's sale.  Looking at the zillow estimate, around midway through 2013 our home value dropped from 195k (the professionally appraised value) down to about 160k and is slowly crawling back up.  The only things we did were remove an above ground pool and add fill/sod, and replace the oil heater with a far more efficient one.  Did the neighbors going into foreclosure smack us? Was it because we removed the pool? Is the zillow estimate completely wrong? I am asking because we want to get rid of pmi but the dropping home value is making it a moving target, and our mortgage company demands we pay for an appraisal to have it removed early. If we pay for an appraisal and it IS down to 160k in value, not only are we screwed on pmi but we are out the cost of the appraisal.    Reading horror stories like this makes me feel like the only safe way to sell on ebay is to be a lawyer who can threaten a lawsuit and negative publicity and actually follow through without a huge personal cost.   I was under the impression this was up to the state?   Can confirm. In PA your boss can fire you for being anything but straight.   Heat should have done this for you. Gay-Lussac's Law states that as temperature increases, pressure increases. Throwing it in the oven upside down and cranking the heat should be enough to pop it out.   There is an unofficial API, but leveraging something like that for a product is really not a great idea. It's kind of odd because it seems very un-google-y.    I'm picturing the Echo team cringing at these words.  And I'm picturing users not caring. A user doesn't care about business objectives - they care about user experience. And ultimately, Amazon is asking users to vote for them with their dollars. When a company starts diminishing user experience and making excuses about trying to contain the user in their ecosystem, users rebel. It's such an outmoded way of thinking in today's tech world. Remember when IOS pulled out google maps and replaced it with their inferior product? Google announced a separate maps app, users flocked to it, and ios maps got torn apart for being shitty in comparison to google maps. The only way to make it work is to offer a truly superior service to other available options.  And I'd argue that Siri and Cortana are both direct competitors, with the additional capability of being mobile. I can ask siri to add a timer, to add a todo list item, and more.   As mentioned in other posts, what will really set this apart is not trying to limit users, but enabling as many API's as possible.   As of now the wife and I both have the echo app installed. We are aiming to use this as a replacement for an ugly old clockradio in our kitchen that has the ability to set timers and create our shopping list (for now). Also, checking traffic, news, and weather would be helpful.  I've gone through tunein and iheartradio and added all of our local stations. Does Alexa to know to check both of them when I ask her to play a station?  Can my wife and I both set up traffic reports? Does Alexa know whether it is my wife or I asking her who needs the traffic report, or do I have to log into the app every time a different one of us needs a traffic report? From what I am reading I need to open the app, enter a destination address, and then it will tell me a traffic report. However, my wife and I work in completely different directions so the traffic report would be completely different between both of us. It sounds like we would need to log in, switch the destination to one of our workplaces, and then ask questions (honestly kind of a PITA)  I am assuming this also only works with a single prime account, and not separate prime accounts, right?   Looks wonderful except for the fruits and vegetables. This is 'Murica. We don't eat foods that can't give diabetes.    If you like it, try to track down episodes of "Heston's Great British Food". There is a lot of similarities. Heston owns several restaurants including the Fatted Duck which has several times been crowned the "best restaurant on Earth".  The show has him choosing a dish or style of dish, analyzing its history and cultural importance to the UK, and then completely reinterpreting the dish in amazing ways. It's a super cool show!   This reminded me of a time when I was in college. I was finishing a law internship and had come back home before I went to my biology class to take an exam.  I railed about .75g and felt absolutely 100% confident that I was going to rock the test's world. I answered every question with awesome responses. I handed it in and awaited my A.  Most disappointing failing grade I ever got.  Cocaine makes you feel like you can do anything, and are amazing at everything you do. Other than that, it doesn't make you feel much. And then when it wears off you have to deal with the consequences of coming down and realizing that half the stuff you tried you failed horribly at.  It started with going to a buddy's house and trying a line. Other than feeling a little reassured it wouldn't kill me, I was very underwhelmed. So I did another line. I was still underwhelmed. So I did another line... and so on. I never found it nearly as rewarding as say, mushrooms, ecstasy, or pot. I also saw it turn some folks I cared about into monsters of people. Stealing from me, having hallucinations, punching holes in walls, literally acting like they were schizophrenic, dropping their panties for anyone who happened to be around at the right time. It was bad.  College was a hell of a time.   SOUR DIESEL DANK MELTS TRUCKERS   Honestly, if they set off something that went boom outside the building, I'd think you could very likely damage the disks anyway (write arms aren't the toughest thing while they are reading  a rotating platter, and a percussion wave wouldn't be too friendly to them).  I'm actually kinda curious if that has been tested.   That looks wonderful, and I'm jealous! Every time I've tried to make brisket flat I've had some weird issue pop up. The first time, I couldn't get my smoker to temp properly (it kept spiking). The second, my probe thermometer's probe malfunctioned and kept giving readings about 20 degrees below where temp actually was. Needless to say, the brisket was cardboard. Lessons learned :) Great work! Especially for your first time out!   Drop a piece of meat into hot oil and watch the oil temp. A fall of anywhere from 10 to 50 degrees can and will happen. The cast iron heat retention absolutely helps minimize that.   This. A Dutch oven and a candy thermometer is all you need, and its a fraction of the price of a normal fryer. It doesn't necessarily have to be ceramic/enamel coated either.   They don't have any oil.   Classical guitarist. Can confirm.   Sadly there is no legal benchmark for the burden of proof that has been set. And you can bet that bank will send a ton of witnesses to represent their side at a bankruptcy hearing with the express goal of proving you can afford to pay off their loan. That's why getting student loans removed never happens.   Depends who signed the loan. If it was signed by his parents only it technically isn't his responsibility. If his folks died, it would have to be paid off by the estate. The bank may try to trick him into thinking it is his issue but it legally wouldn't be.  If he signed the loan as well, the loan is his too. If his parents die, it goes to him. And depending on the terms of the loan it could be due in its entirety immediately.    First, don't use quotes. It's not hyperbole.   She did have it backed up. On an external drive. Which was stolen by the burglar, along with a $24,000 custom saxophone, a laptop with a ton of her compositions, an ipad, a guitar, and several other items.  If you read the TOS, you are purchasing a license to the music, not the file itself. Which means there was nothing blocking Amazon from providing a second copy. They simply refused to do so, despite our attorney pointing this out to them when he presented them with a copy of the police report.  At the time, all other music services of the same ilk allowed for re-downloading of lost music. Amazon was several years behind the competition in this way, and only within the last 2 years provided the ability to re-download purchased music.  Their product and their customer service simply sucked at the worst possible time, and it was absolutely the last thing we needed to deal with after having our lives flipped upside down.   Sorry OP, I perfer guitars from Fenver.   I wish my wife did this. Every damn day: "where is my phone!?" "Oh shit I can't find my wallet!" "I really hope my keys are in your car!"  I just don't get it.   One is training to become an architect, the second is training to become a film director. She's actually fairly well known internationally thanks to some short film she's done   You should do yourself a favor and google "[bread and circuses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread_and_circuses)". Basically as empires pass their prime, lower socioeconomic class people become far more interested in selfish things - "What can I do to make sure I eat and am entertained?" The ruling classes appease the people with those things, and public participation in politics wanes. They don't have a vested interest in government because they're essentially left out of it, and their needs are met. So why vote, right? This walks hand-in-hand with financialization (the movement toward income inequality as money is concentrated more and more in the wealthiest socioeconomic classes). It's also a very good reason why the citizens united decision was absolutely idiotic and shows that, despite their intellogence, the supreme court justices apparently aren't very good at history.  Folks basically stop caring. It happened in Greece, it happened in Rome, and it is happening now in the US. Its easy to see in action too: Ask your average American who their representatives and senators are and see what response you get. Ask them who the players are on their favorite sports team and compare the results.   I agree. Other than prime I dont use the amazon ecosystem. Amazon's fault too... my wife is a music teacher, and had spend several thousand dollars on the amazon music store for mp3s. Her laptop got stolen when our house was robbed and Amazon basically told her to piss off and couldn't provide the downloads a second time (this has since changed,  but sadly she had to rebuy a lot of her music until amazon got its head out of its ass). I've tried to avoid many of their services ever since.  I'd also prefer google's ecosystem.   I have a gas card that my wife and I both use to pay for gas and occasional expenses. The limit is $1200, and most months we take it up to about $1000.   We pay the statement balance every month. Does utilizing that much of the credit line hurt my credit score? I have several other cards but this is the only one that is used heavily.   On the upside, every Moldovan woman I have ever met is gorgeous, so your country has that going for it, which is nice.  Then again my friends in Moldova are all well off enough to take yearly trips to the US.   This reminds me of the worst date I ever went on. Things were going awesome with this REALLY pretty girl. We went hiking in the morning/afternoon, ended up playing games with some handicapped kids, etc. It was a great start.  Then we went out for drinks. Holy hell it was like I went on to a minefield.   Me: "So you moved back here from California?"   Her: "Yeah, I had to give up my dream to help out my family."   Me: "Oh my god, I'm so sorry! Are you at least close to your family??"   Her: "Yeah, you get close when your house burns down."   Me: "Uh, wow, that's a really shitty stream of luck. At least you guys have eachother right?"   Her: "Well we did. My dad just died a few days ago."  Me: "Well... fuck. Hey bartender, can you make that bourbon a neat triple please?"  At the end of the date I walked myself home and couldn't stop laughing because of how absurdly bad the date went. I kept asking polite questions to learn more and every single one led to something negative. I wasn't even mad, just amused. Sometimes the world just takes a turn toward the negative and the best you can do is relax and laugh off how unlikely it was.   Usually that would require the contract to be unconscionable, or otherwise violate law, and often that only invalidates specific clauses.   There has to be a meeting of the minds and consideration. Cash exchanged hands already, as did the trade in, so there's your consideration. Deal's done.   Looks kinda like a jack of some type? No idea if that is what it is though. It wouldn't make sense since I doubt it could support that much weight.   counting is why god invented drummers.   Terry Frisk requires reasonable suspicion.   I am not 100% sure about how the police became aware of Gray (it has been hell to find real details through all of the fallout), so I'm not sure what the reasoning was. If it was just a chance encounter there is very little reason to have frisked him. If the police got a report that someone who looked like Gray was causing a problem, then there is a totally legit reason to have frisked him.  Does anyoene have meatier details about the whole encounter and why the police got involved in the first place?   151 still doesn't hold a candle to 195 proof everclear.   So they essentially use the same support system Bungie used for Destiny. Oi vey.   OT but I wish I could have stuck with ni no kuni. I loved it until I got past the trials and had another human to control. Suddenly the game went from fun combat to a wall of micromanaging that really turned me off.  I wish they had added a turn-based approach as well as an active approach. .. it would have probably made it more enjoyable for me.   I bought a ps3 at the end of the last year and I am having a high old time.  The only games that interest me so far on PS4 are kingdom Hearts 3, final fantasy 15, and witcher 3. I really hope they make more ps3 titles compatible too.   I always thought that that was caused by bolting?   The problem is that old guy has spent years indoctrinating kids to fill his place, and there are plenty willing to do so.   I'd never heard of dandelion ice cream - brilliant idea!   Make dandelion wine and dandelion salad. Karma + dinner!   EEP!   This is totally correct - we do have one rub to add in. My FIL is extremely well off, and usually if we require a home loan we can borrow privately from him. DTI isn't much of an issue because of that. The downside of this is that we will usually drop everything off to pay him back ASAP (debt between family is... uncomfortable).  	145

 The picture doesn't do it much justice. Its the roof of a parking garage that is caving downward in multiple areas.    Around 730-8! I was looking at it and realized that it would be perfect for this subreddit.   Thank you!   Yes   Correct!   It is the Galleria! And yes, the picture really doesn't do it justice.   Not complaining, just very, "WTF."          I just bought a new 200C 2WD and I love it as well. I really don't see the problem with this. If anything it removes clutter from the climate control and arm rest area. Honestly, if you have a problem with it then you're just not paying attention. I've never had an issue distinguishing the difference between this new knob and the climate control. Great car overall so far!  Edit: problem with the parking knob, not the electronic brake, I realized I sounded kind of like an asshole to you without addressing what I was really talking about. Sorry! Directed towards the picture not you!   That's an awesome comment. It is definitely much appreciated, those are the exact feelings that were derived from that exact place and time. I am glad some one received so much enjoyment from a photo that I was able to take!   	11

 I'm watching the game here  thinking - Damn, Wade looks like he's playing with Shaq again.  Reminding me of back in 05-06.   I can imagine Riley requesting the presence of Whiteside in his office. ...Whiteside walks in. ..Riley sitting in a too cool ambient corner of his office overlooking the city. ..so I heard you want to win. ...clanking his rings on the table. ...the story continues    http://i.imgur.com/II85BMr.gifv   I used to change the oil on my jeep because I could get under it.  I'm worried about doing the same to my corolla because I'm afraid if I jack it or won't drain completely because it's uneven.  Is this a rational concern?

 I want to see more dialogue from other characters. I really liked that MTV special of Pratt and Howard. I don't really want to be spoiled with more dinosaur footage. I want to see more humans. The cast in this film is so ace.      I would hope that he did that. All Day goes hard and all, but it feels stiff. Didn't I read somewhere that Kanye recorded a lot of versions of that song and eventually picked the most safe one to use as a single?   that's awesome! good work   The tequila banter was awesome. Gave me a sensible chuckle. Really excited to see some playfulness in the dialogue!   got that same vibe   I get what you're saying. But I feel like JP3 is just a monster movie. There's something missing.   Haven't read TLW yet.   Exactly.   Spielberg: "You know what would make this dinosaur movie kick even more ass? Bring the T-rex to San Diego, motherfucker$"   I gotta go with The Lost World, man. People are hard on it, but I loved it so much when I was a kid. The Lost World is an absolutely badass movie. To me, it's like the *Aliens* of the Alien franchise.   I remember going to the theaters to see JP3 when I was 7 and thinking it just wasn't as good as the first and second. I was really young, but I knew. I felt it in my heart. It didn't have the magic that Spielberg brought to the table.   Dang!! Are copies of Operation Genesis that rare? Do you think my copy is worth a lot of money or something? Not that I'm trying to sell it, too fond of memories.   You need to get JP on bluray!

The trainer being further out above the water is my favorite change.   +1 for Jaws 3 comparison.    He's someone who takes himself very seriously. He is a very talented artist. I think his overconfidence has caused him to say a lot of things that have gotten him into trouble. But it also causes him to create a product and a message that he truly believes is God-like. The loyal consumer appreciates how seriously he takes himself because it means he ALWAYS presents a good product. I think he feels like he has something to prove because he is one of the most hated men in the world, while simultaneously being one of the most admired and influential artists. He's kind of a weirdo. He's always saying stupid shit(you know it's true...) But it's a hell of an interesting story to see this eccentric family (Kanye   the Kardashians) trying to live normal lives in a a world where they a preyed on by the media. I personally think Kanye is so awesome and I admire his story.  I love how Kanye has had such a tough time with the media.  It's like he's in a constant war with the media over the status of his reputation. He's a fighter. I like that. And his music is fucking awesome and genre-defining. And I think he has good taste. I think some of the Adidas line is awesome. He's a real artist. And he has a crippling ego. But I don't blame him; I bet it's way more fun to live that way. I'd choose to live like a God, too. Wouldn't you?   The T-Rex paddock scene and where that 100-foot drop off came from.   Ha, right? He's just a kid!! Leave him alone and let him be. Want to see a *real* douche? Join a fraternity. The only difference is the media doesn't profit off of frat boys' douchey-ness.    Also, it's been circulating in the news that Bieber is the fifth most hated person in the world right now. They just filmed his roast and I heard he took it as constructive criticism. Now don't tell me that doesn't sound a little bit like Kanye after the Swift VMA's.  I can imagine that Kanye and Justin are actually pretty similar.    Haaa I snorted out my water.   http://four-pins.com/style/adidas-kane-west-adidas-yeezy-season-1-lookbook/  	27

I am getting oooooooold! Help me! :O   Analogies aside. Sue was unhappy the way people were being treated and resigned. Later The head mod demodded all the mods shut the subreddit down. She wrote the administrators telling them she was doing this. This has been confirmed by the administrators. It was her that did it, not sue. This guilt by association thing is pretty weak tea.   Everything!  Well Luann crying was annoying and I could have done without the Manger Babies, but other than that the show was genius!   Paper route  (yes I am old)   #awesome   I don't believe anyone else donated but I could be wrong. But I make mistakes. I will never again endorse anyone here.    I found out I was wrong. I am sometimes. I was trying to help the guy. I get scammed too. We ended up banning him and removing the post.    Thank you Lunar. :D  Great to hear from you.   I did my best to find out what happened once I returned from vacation. What was said came straight from the administrators. But regardless there has been nothing else said by anyone here that is more than hearsay.   We know for a fact now that the head mod there demodded everyone and wrote that letter to the administrators. And this occurred well after sue left there. How else can we prove that something that was not said, was not said?  And even  regardless of all of that, even it was the case, the head mod performed the action. If any mod closed down a sub because one person talked them into it, they should have never been a mod in the first place. It's like committing a murder and then claiming that someone told me to. That makes zero sense.   Thank you so much. We will do all we can to promote the new food bank subreddit once the drama settles down. It is a big hole that really needed to be filled. Let us know how we can help.   Awesome to hear from you. And thank you for speaking up. :D   Thank you sir.    Nowhere in that statement does it say that sue talked her into shutting the subreddit down. She simply gave an opinion on why she thought it was shut down. At the time she wrote that, she didn't know what happened either. She just answered that question the best that she could with the knowledge she had. Sure she could have worded it better but not all of us here on reddit are poets.   Because it became an attack post. It wasn't promoting anything. All it was doing is causing drama. I wrote to the mod there explaining why and she understood. But I have told her I would do all I can to promote her and help her achieve success there. She is filling a hole here that very much needs to be filled. I am very much in favor of what she is doing and will fill requests there myself.  When the drama dies down, I will ask her to post once again.   Yea baby!   You are the best. You do me honor. :D   I so will.  Thank you so much. :D   You are so nice for saying that. It really helps to hear that every now and then. :D   Very sweet. Thank you. :D   Thanks Davey. Hope all is well with you up there in the Northern Country. :D   Thank you so much. Good to hear from you. :D   Bless you. I wish each year we got younger. But at least I feel younger hearing sweet comments like that. :D   Love the hat. I want one. :D   HIFW it's my birthday:  http://cdn.someecards.com/someecards/usercards/MjAxMy0zMGUwN2U3MTI3Nzg2ZWY3.png   Did I get it right?    No the evidence came from the administrators. No one seemed to know the actual events so I asked the administrators. As you can see,  the head mod demodded everyone and wrote a letter to the administrators. This occurred long after sue had left the subreddit. The evidence presented came from the administrators.   That is the only evidence provided by anyone here. Everything else was just people repeating speculation by an anonymous person no one seems to know the identity of.   I remember vouching for people long ago. It was a huge mistake. I was right hundreds of times but the few times I was wrong cancelled that out. So we never do that anymore.    #Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery. Today is a gift; that's why it's called "the present.  *submitted by /u/Glinda_Da_Good_Witch*    You would think so huh? It is unfortunate that all the people she has helped are not speaking up right now.   Thank you for doing so. :D   Actually everyone in this whole thing didn't know jack shit. I went and investigated it and found out what happened. Not from just one side. I asked the administrators what happened. They told me. And I posted their comment here.  Everything, everyone said here was pure speculation and based on hearsay. I am the only one who presented actual sound evidence.   As for mods asking for anything, they would have less chance to get help here than a known scammer. None of them would dare even try. I don't recall vouching for anyone for a very long time. I  saw the shit storm it could cause so I ceased to do that anymore. We even now have a stated policy in our sidebar that does not allow us to vouch for anyone:  * MODS ARE NOT JUDGES - WE DO NOT JUDGE WHICH REQUESTS ARE WORTHY  That has been in effect for some time now. Mistakes were made in the distant past but we definitely learned from them. It is unfair to equate that with the current situation.     You can want to know all you want. But when it comes to banning people here, I am the one responsible. I am the one that makes the final decisions.    Could you do me? I want to look sexy again.   If I shut this place down right now, sue could have "knowledge" of why I did it. But it would be speculation. She knows me well and might even be right. But regardless, it would just be an opinion. And all responsibility would be mine. No matter what she said to me beforehand.  And just to let you know, Sue has been the reason I haven't quit here a long time ago. Many times I was on the brink but sue got me to see clearly. Sue is the reason this place has not gone by the way side long ago.   #AWESOME!   I have more than hearsay. I have the actual quote from the mod telling the administrator shutting the subreddit down. And the administrator stating the head mod demoted everyone before doing so.   It is very difficult to prove something that did not happen, did not happen. But I have presented evidence of the actual event closing as it took place.   I would love to glinda.   Thank you.   You are claiming that sue said she told the head mod over there to shut it down? That sounds highly unlikely.   So all of this is predicated on a suspicion. How is one supposed to disprove a suspicion. The actions taken were that of one person. If i shut this place down, I would take responsibility, regardless of what any said to me.   Excuse me saying this and I mean no disrespect to redditnoobie. But if one person could make me shut down my subreddit, then I have no business running the thing in the first place. If I were to shut this place down, blame me and only me.   Thank you dudciles, I appreciate your input.   She thought she knew why, you thought you knew why. No one knew what the head mod had done until now. The question about why it happened was asked in our subreddit. She answered the question as best as she could with what knowledge she had.  And I kind of agree that there is zero proof either way, except that we know the head mod demoted everyone and sent that letter. We know that was not sue who did that.  So you say it is okay to call her guilty with no real evidence. But it is not okay to claim innocence on the same basis.   This whole thing is predicated on an imaginary conversation that an anonymous person claims was made. That is what I call zero evidence.    She answered the post as best she could. Don't get all technical with semantics.   I didn't say that was the reason all the mods left. I gave the other reason too:    Others leave because they do not like that I don't allow harassment of users in the posts, I will not impose account age limits again and that i remove comments that are in a harassing nature. Some were very frustrated with me for that. But I stand by my policy that people will not get trolled here. Instead they can report any suspicions to the mods. Some mods did not like that policy at all.  As far as I now that is why the others left. There were no hard feelings, only a difference of opinion.  As for glinda being banned or when it comes to anyone being banned, I take all the responsibility for those actions. And we was after a discussion with the other mods. But I take final responsibility for any actions. I honestly do not see why that is an issue relevant to this conversation.   None of these things are the issue here. You claim it was sue that got it shut down. That is not the case. Of course she wasn't happy there. That is why she left. But instead of blaming the person who shut it down, you blame sue.  This is based on a supposed conversation that no one has heard or even knows occurred. Some one please tell me, who was the original person that made the claim this conversation occurred? I mean the only thing used to claim sue had a part in this, is this one imaginary conversation. Who is the person that is claiming that conversation occurred? And why is it being assumed as true. The only basis for blaming sue is an imaginary conversation from an anonymous person.  We too here want to get back to helping people. That is why we are here. I would love to put this behind us. That is why I made this post.   So you admit it was redditnoobie that closed the sub? Why are you blaming sue for doing it? You base that all on a conversation no one heard. How can you possibly use that as your soul evidence here?   The anger in SRD was fabricated by a few people who have been harassing us for months. We deal with this every few weeks.  And they always do it while I am away on a backpack trip. That way I am not there to present a defense.   I am quite amazed that you all will not accept real evidence and then turn around use hearsay of one imaginary conversation to deny the truth given. That is amazing.   She said why she thought it had been shut down. She did not know, neither did the other mods. It is only now that we know the real reason.   If I gave you a screenshot of that conversation, would that satisfy you?   You do have access to it. It was a response to a question I asked of the administrators. You made an accusation so I wanted the truth. I asked the people that would know. I asked them.   How do you have evidence of a conversation that never took place? After all you are predicated the guilt on Sue all on the basis of this imaginary conversation no one has heard or even knows exists. And even if it did, Sue did not take the action. It's like blaming sue for a murder someone else committed based on someone claiming there was an imaginary conversation beforehand.    Number one, we are not a charity. We do not take in donations and distribute them to others except in very rare cases. Glinda is not banned. But she was briefly because she was spreading untrue things about us and trying to take down our subreddit. That kind of person has no business in our subreddit. But after thinking about we changed our mind.  Why do moderators leave here? Some leave because of witch hunts like this that scare them away. It's not worth the trouble. Others leave because they do not like that I don't allow harassment of users in the posts, I will not impose account age limits again and that i remove comments that are in a harassing nature. Some were very frustrated with me for that. But I stand by my policy that people will not get trolled here. Instead they can report any suspicions to the mods. Some mods did not like that policy at all.  We are currently working on a revamp  of the sidebar. I agree it is atrocious. Our rules are not made clear. The new one will have bots that hit people over the head with the rules. That part is my responsibility and I have been working on it. I have some tech people creating a new format now.  There is not a new rule that prevents mods from asking for help. But any mod here would be crazy to make such a post. None has in quite awhile. We are people  and have crisises too. I have asked my mods long ago to run them by me first and that they never distinguish a request. We do have posts stickied every now and then, that are part of a campaign to help others. Not the mod personally.   There is no evidence she did reach out either. How do you present evidence that a conversation did not take place? It is impossible. Whatever the head mod's motivation was, she is the one responsible. She is the one that took the action.   So you assume the conversation took place. Her entire involvement in this event is predicated on the assumption a conversation took place?  That has to be most flimsiest evidence ever. You are willing to ignore facts presented by the administration, yet willing to accept without question a conversation that no one heard or even took place for that matter.  Regardless, the actions were taken by the head mod of that subreddit. They alone are responsible, even if that imaginary conversation had taken place. And for the record, it did not.   It shows she did not do anything they said she did. The head mod did it all. So if you have anyone to blame, it is the head mod. The head mod there demoted all the other mods and then shut it down. Sue had long since left.  It is absurd to put the blame on someone else because they were a friend of the person responsible. Why has no one even mentioned the person that shut it down? Instead they blame it on a friend of theirs? The logic of that is absurd.   A recent post here claimed that /u/sueolsen was responsible for shutting down r/food_pantry. I was away on vacation and did not get a chance to properly address it.  The truth:  Uttered bull crap  I did some inquiring to find proof since I was not associated with it but here is what the administration said:  -------------   [A] to /r/Assistance/ sent 5 hours ago   Wanted to reach out and see if things have calmed down a bit. Since there seems to be some confusion, the head moderator at food_pantry demodded the others and shut the subreddit down. He or she sent the following modmail, which nobody saw since they were all demodded a few minutes later:   Hi guys. It is with a hollow heart that I wish to announce that I will be closing /r/food_pantry down for good. The last 4 years has been one hell of an adventure. There have been so many people helped through this subreddit, but I can't in good conscience, sit around and wait for it to be corrupted by the admins. I watched /u/kickme444 [+1] grow an amazing community only for reddit to hijack it and turn it into the monstrosity it is now. What was once a wonderful community about giving to others within the community has turned into a circle jerk about bringing in money through the Reddit marketplace or promoting reddit through the world records. And it's not just redditgifts, reddit is not the site it was 4 years ago when I created this sub. All the censoring and shadiness... I would rather remember the sub that I created while it's still what I created, than what it could be if the admins decide to wedge their grubby hands on it and find some way of squeezing money out of her, while squeezing us out. I appreciate you all so much. I will forever look back on this time fondly 3 I hope you all understand my decision.   The TL;DR is that there isn't any indication that you or anyone else had anything undue going on. The other mods there are probably just confused since all they know is they got demodded and the sub got closed.  ------  The truth is Sue was tired of the people getting bashed there so she quit  as a mod. That was the end of her association there. The subreddit closed months later, long after her association with it. She had nothing to do with it.   I am here to field your questions as long as they are done in a civil manner. We are tired of the drama but felt you deserved to know the truth and for Sue be exonerated.   It's not until tomorrow but thank you Sue. :D  Love ya!   It's like taking a poll at Fox News. It's total bullshit.   That would be okay  I think. But it is has gone so much more reddit-wide. I kind of want to reach a huge audience, so more than just the people with the pitchforks and torches have a chance to reply. I very much appreciate your input though.   That has 27 users. I don't think that is going to reach anyone.   Hopefully it will grow. Looks like something for the future though.   I am asking for a forum for this. This is not it. Could you please allow people to actually answer the question asked here. You will have your chance to continue your witch hunt then.   Oh. I am going between many questions on many posts.   I have an issue that is current. It has nothing to do with past mistakes. Sure i have made some but that is not what I am asking to address. You guys have crucified one of my mods. I have proof that shows you were wrong. I want the ability to present that evidence in a fair forum. Not with crazy people like jenz screaming out of control. I want to talk with sane people who are willing to listen. That is what this post is asking for.     Woo Hoo! Great news for democrats.   So you are not willing to look at the evidence?   I unbanned you. Now will you look at the evidence?    I am asking for a forum here to have this discussion. You will have your chance to ask your questions and continue your witch hunt once I do. So I will kindly ask you cease having the debate here.   When you spread lies and try to destroy us, that is what happens.   We now have proof from the administrators sue had nothing to do with shutting down food pantry. Will you view that evidence and admit sue had nothing to do with it? I will unban you if you at least read it.   In fact I will unban you anyway. I didn't do it in the first place. Now will you read the proof and actually admit you may have been wrong if the proof shows that. The proof comes from the administrators:     And this is an example of one of the witch hunters. I am trying to find a forum to answer it under fair conditions. Not from the above witch hunter.     That is not a question relevant to this discussion. You claim Sue shut down food pantry and scammed money. That is what this post is about. If you want to ask moderators why they left, go for it. But do it elsewhere.  But the short is answer is because people like you badger them and intimidate them until they feel it is not worth it.  Now answer my question:  I have provided proof that sue did not shut down food pantry. Do you deny that? It came straight from the administrators mouth.   #So do you admit you were wrong about sue shutting down food pantry?      You constantly bring up irrelevant things in an endless effort not to admit you were wrong.  #You were wrong  Why won't you admit it. You started another one of your witch hunts. I have provided proof you were wrong and won't admit it.   #YOU WERE WRONG!  Stop asking irrelevant questions and admitL:  #YOU WERE WRONG     I don't know ask sue. Why do you refuse to see she had nothing to do with it even after proof has been presented. When will you ever admit you were wrong?  I have proof. I presented it. And all you do is ask silly questions. You were wrong. I proved it.    Well obviously you two are not here to find out the truth. Just here to spread lies.   When I answer your questions you refuse to see anything. Instead you make fun of our bots.   If you have any other serious questions, let me know, although I know your quest is not for the truth because as we have seen here, you that when proof is presented you are wrong, you will not admit it.  Proof has been presented sue had nothing to do with foodpantry shutdown. But you go ahead and make fun of our bots if that makes you happy.   I have no idea of it being preferential or not. I asked a question and got an answer.    But why is that now that you see the truth, that this is the only question you seem to want answered? Can't you see that the accusations against Sue were false. Why are you now not addressing that instead of making accusation of preferential treatment. Seems quite odd to me. It seems to me that you are not interested in the truth. Only to continue the falsehoods that had previously been presented.   I returned from a 4th of July vacation late Monday night. I had no idea what was going on. So i wrote and asked for the information. I just received an answer a short time ago.  That is all there is to it.   Yes_it_is_weird is a mod here who does no modding. He creates our bots. He needs access to our page to do the work he does. This guy did the same thing. At the time we did know he was a scum bag. We removed him and Sue's daughter no longer has  contact with. Coincidentally, their divorce is officially final today.   Yes. We needed some technical help. I am shitty with that. Sue said he could help us with it. He did it but he never did any modding. He was removed later.   He was added to some technical work on the sidebar and our Christmas video. He never did any modding.    Let us continue it now:  Here is how foodpantry closed. This is right out of the mouths of the administrators:  --------------------  [A] to /r/Assistance/ sent an hour ago  Wanted to reach out and see if things have calmed down a bit. Since there seems to be some confusion, the head moderator at food_pantry demodded the others and shut the subreddit down. He or she sent the following modmail, which nobody saw since they were all demodded a few minutes later:   Hi guys. It is with a hollow heart that I wish to announce that I will be closing /r/food_pantry down for good. The last 4 years has been one hell of an adventure.

The TL;DR is that there isn't any indication that you or anyone else had anything undue going on. The other mods there are probably just confused since all they know is they got demodded and the sub got closed.  -----------------------   These are the words of the administrators. There accounting of how it was closed. Sue had long since quit because she didn't like how people were being bashed. She has nothing to do with it.   There was no shady behavior. Sue daughter's slimy husband left her and her kids in a horrible situation. They had no money for food or heat in a cold ass winter. There was nothing shady about the request at all.  No one slinked in the shadows. Is is all out in the open to see.   I never claimed I funded all of it. But mods have asked me to post for a long time now. They are scared to death of the mob out there. I don't blame them   No it is not. I am train_subject8344. One reddit account now for six years.  Frogzilla is an awesome person.    What horse shit.    I was the one who gave her kid the money. And yes she needed it. This whole thing is a witch hunt.  So before jumping on the internet witch burning wagon, it might be wise to get the facts from the person who actually gave the money.   * Could we please get you to register here before the automated bot removes your post?   https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QyEkcwAzbOS9CxfNKbNABaE0wRSnRueYHwMcW68WETI/viewform]     Just to let you know, you have been shadow banned by the administrators.

But then I saw a post about some guys north of me (400 miles) going on a trip. I responded and have been backpacking with them for like four years now.   If you ever get out to the western part of the US, hit me up, we always have a trip coming up and welcome new folks to go with us. We have an absolute blast.

       When a man is tired of Reddit, he is tired of The Internet.

As they approached the bear enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where Pavel and his son Pavel Jr. were standing. The large bear stared at Pavel, lifted its paws off the ground, and played with a plastic chair. The bear did that several times then roared loudly, all the while staring at the man.   Remembering the his dear friend from 2011, Pavel couldn't help wondering if this was the same bear. Pavel summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. He walked right up to the bear and stared back in wonder. The bear roared again, wrapped its arms around Pavel's chest and crushed his ribcage, killing him instantly. Probably wasn't the same bear.      But there [is hope](http://www.amazingribs.com/tips_and_technique/offset_smokers.html).      I'm using a standard Char-broil offset smoker, and I'm monitoring the temperature, keeping it between 230 and 250 for 7, or even 8 hours.  I've also got a water pan in there to keep things moist.  But the ribs and boston butt are never done, and the fat isn't completely rendered, so I have to finish them in a 350 degree oven for half an hour to an hour.  How can they not be done after 8 hours?   The only other clue I have is that I'm monitoring the temperature with a redi-check remote thermometer, which is an internal-temperature thermometer; is it possible that this is giving me an incorrect reading?  This is driving me insane.  I'd appreciate any advice, Pitmasters.  EDIT: OK, thanks for the advice.  It sounds like I need a new thermometer, and to learn about this newfangled "3-2-1 Method".  Depending on how that works, I'll look into heat loss.  BTW, I'm not using the thermometer for internal meat temperature, I'm using it for the ambient internal temperature of the smoker.

Hey all.  I've had a standard Char-broil offset smoker for a few years, and the firebox is getting pretty rusty on the top and sides, I assume from the heat.

I need to focus on the character's point of view, rather than a bystander's (so to speak). So it's kind of like a form of Role Playing, or acting.

I'm currently working on a little project for an "origin story" for a race in the universe I'm building.  While I am only a hobbyist (I work full time, and study when not working or writing), I'd love some brutally honest feedback, to know where I can/should improve. I have recieved good feedback on the entire story so far, but I feel like my friends were being nice in order to not hurt my feelings. I never went to University, and only did one year of college (I'm from the UK)  **Be brutally honest as you can!** I promise I can take it! :P Not looking for anything on plot, as what I've included doesn't really include much plot. I'm looking for more feedback on the writing style and a general impression of the piece.  I'm not really _aiming_ for publication. It's more of a little personal project I have going on. But I may look at publishing onto a digital format, depending on costs.

Stand over the sink or over a plate so you don't make too much of a mess.   It was a pretty grim night, by all standards. Rain and hail was bouncing off the window making a rather dull drumming reverberate through the bar.  I mean, the weather in winter on Ratine was pretty bad, but this was just taking the cake. Feln, Canir and Humans were all darting between shelter, making their way to the huge bar planted dead center of the market.  Rein brought the alcoholic beverage to his mouth and took a rather large swig. He'd been hiding here for a few weeks. It was nice and busy, he'd go mostly unnoticed here. That was, of course, until Warren Shaile turned up. That nosy bastard was out looking for him. He'd heard the stories, but he could totally avoid him. He had to. There was no way he was going back to Limitless.   He'd endured centuries of pain, testing, surgery. All illegally. by all accounts, he didn't exist. He was nothing. Fuck that, he'd shake off Shaile and expose those bastards. He doesn't know how yet, but there had to be a way to get the word out without exposing himself in the public eye.  Public terminal? Maybe, but so far, he's stuck on Ratine. Last thing he needed was Warren and his cronies surrounding him. In the only place he can hide for the next few months.   It was an amazing fear he even got to Ratine, really. Getting out of that station was a miracle in itself, never mind getting across the galaxy.  It still baffled Rein, He was brought up in the 21st century, where it took hours to cross the planet, and here he was, about 80,000 light years away from that station mere days later. He liked Ratine, originally. But he arrived in summer. A lovely, vibrant jungle, covered in merchant stalls on the surface, while the rich and powerful lived miles high on their floating city, protected by all sorts of fancy gadgetry that would probably make Rein even more confused that he already was.  The poor were "trapped" on the surface.  A couple of years ago, a company tried to terraform the planet, to make it just a little _less_ hostile for mining operation, but it cocked up something fierce. Operations went ahead, but the winters are so harsh, it rivaled even the old arctic back on earth. Work was always halted on the surface in winter, but people continued to live down here anyway. Have-a-go engineers were trying to make the outdoor conditions somewhat hospitable during the harsh winter, but fires occasionally broke out with loose wires accidentally crossed.   Snow dunes crept across the landscape in the distance, moving ever closer to the small market town. Soon, men in ships would arrive and move the dune over the town, making sure the town isn't buried. It was a sight to see, according to the locals. Rein couldn't wait!   enough of that, he needed to find a way of getting Limitless to fall, guinea pigs of Limitless and their competitors littered the stations of Purseus, abandoned by the corporation after their testing is complete. It was a sickening sight.  A sight Warren knew all too well. His first case was to track down one of these victims, who had gone missing after heading to Purseus for a "routine implant check". Warren found him begging for change. He wasn't as described but it was him alright. He looked like a Picasso painting, a proper mess. It took days for Warren to talk him around and to go home to his wife. Who, despite his new grotesque appearance appeared over the moon to see her husband again. It was a sick business, but the Universal Council weren't even looking into it.   It was a problem everyone knew existed but no-one did anything about.  Warren was committed to ending this godawful practice, even if it meant working for one of them.  (Oh damn, that's a lot.

[This is my Age 20 crash]  (http://30.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_l6wbgoG4mm1qcfe4ro1_500.jpg) There was way more damage, but I only had time to capture the front as the recovery truck came to take it away.  My Age 21 Crash: http://taernfastgrade.tumblr.com/post/10244162781/fucking-hell-that-hurt-burns-and-cuts-on-my-arm   I love telling stories! :D I'll tell all three because I've nothing better to do.  Age 10:  -- It's my sister's 6th Birthday, and my 10th Birthday was mere weeks after, so we (My mum) decided to combine our birthday parties into one. We went to the nearby pool (Indoor, because outdoor pools in England in January?  HAH!) Anyway, I'm pretty much a fish in water, up until a few years ago, I was in a swim team, but I'm diversing.  Lets just say, I dived underwater, because going underwater is awesome, and when I tried to surface, there was a rather... Large kid on one of those spongy floaty things. After bashing the bottom a little bit, the kid finally realised there was something up and jumped off. I nearly passed out and drowned.  Age 20: -- This one was kind of my fault. I had an hour to zip to an exporters, exchange some stuff and get back to work on time.. I had 10 minutes left on the last 3 miles - I got this!  At this pojng, I'm still on the motorway, coming around a rather large sweeping bend at around 60 mph.  My tyre blew out.. I wobbled all over the road, trying to control the car, before another tyre gave way, and I careered off into a motorway lane barriers at 50mph, hit it, span around and completely took out my back end on the barrier again.  At this point, I'm in the fast lane, facing the wrong way. Anyone could come around that corner and completely fuck me and my car over. Luckily, it was pretty quiet and I somehow managed to restart the car and limp it over to the hard shoulder for recovery. No injuries whatsoever, I was a lucky bastard. Just had to pay for the barrier repair, and my insurers covered the car repair.  This one prompted me to have a bit of a meltdown and I shaved off all my hair and closed myself off for weeks, being completely sure I should have been dead.  Age 21 (last year!): -- Another Automobile accident, this time, completely not my fault.  I used to work as a van driver. I used to drive this wee [Purgeot Partner](http://www.nortonwaypeugeot.com/images/new-vans/large/peugeot-partner-van.png) about for stationary deliveries and such.  I was coming around another long sweeping road, with a 30mph limit. I'm tracked in that van, so I was sticking to the speed limit pretty strictly.. As I approached a junction, As I had right of way, I kept going. A guy just exited it without looking. My van came off better, but it was still a mess. The clash of metal, the screeching of my brakes, and the eventual thud of hitting a barrier brought back some pretty harsh memories of the year before. Everything went white - but that's because the Airbag went off, and the white bonnet had popped up. But my chest was on FIRE. I opened the door of the van and staggered out, clutching my chest, the airbag felt getting a solid punch in the chest.  I staggered over to the other driver, despite bystanders shouting "Sit down, your chest! Someone call an ambulance!" to make sure he was fine. He was fine, his car had just span on the spot a little. But I noticed his engine was smoking.. and so was mine. "Dude, your engine. I'm going turning mine off too."   I rang my boss to tell him what had happened, then the police, fire engine and ambulance came.. It wasn't until a bystander said to me "You are lucky, any faster, you would have gone right through that barrier and into the river."  I just sat there, completely out of it until the Paramedic came to check on me. I got Whiplash pretty bad and couldn't walk properly for weeks. Got a decent payout too..  Other driver didn't have insurance (which is illegal here in the UK), so he got a ban, I think.     Scares? Hm.. Had quite a few in the past. Nothing recent though, thankfully!  I have nearly died three times though, scary stuff.   As the Flair suggests, I'm in Bolton, just north of the city. Born, raised and work here. I think at this point, I'm never leaving.  I'm an IT Trainer. :D   Thanks for the help. :) I'll let you know what they say when they get back to me.   I have an e-mail set and ready to go - could you possibly give it a look over for me before I hit the send button?  Hi there,  Over the past few months, I've been borrowing from Wonga - and while happy with the service, I fear I may have dug myself in a little too deep.  I am contacting you to attempt to set up a repayment plan, I can pay around 200 pcm, which means the outstanding debt can be paid off within 4 months.  If you could contact me back ASAP, that'd be fantastic.  Thank you,  Nathan.    You could do that?  I owe it to Wonga. I didn't think they'd even give me the time of day for something like that.   Jammy bastard. Never won anything on a scratchcard, and you go and win on all your lines! :(   Cheers man, anything helps at the moment.  I'm gonna give my bank another try, see if I can pursuade them to let me borrow.. Anything's better than paying back to borrow right away again.   Long story short, I fucked up and now I owe a Payday Loan company 800..  It's been months and they refuse to help me pay them off slowly over time, and I'm in that vicious cycle where I pay it off, then have to borrow more to pay off the last round.  If anyone could lend me the cash, I would be so damn grateful. I can pay back 200 per month, plus interest. I fell off the boat months ago, now trying to make myself stable again.  I would be so grateful if anyone could help, I'm desperate. My credit rating as been dropped so bad over the last few months and bank loans are turning me down.  British based, obviously, Manchester. But I can pay anyone who is willing to help, including fees if it came to transferring.

I've not needed to top up, but if you are driving heavily, ITB generally isn't a good one to go for. Good for city dwellers such as myself.   Yes! Finally!

It is tempting, but the cops with those NPR cameras will catch you if you drive in front of a copper for more than a few minutes.  And I've seen first hand what happens to guys with no insurance. Was coming round a corner and the guy pulled out without looking. Driving without insurance. His was a writeoff, so it just got crushed and 6 points on his license, and find a few grand.  The premiums are so damn stupid nowadays though... What's helped me is going for a tracker in my car for insurance purposes.   First started out with with my current insurers at 2k p/a.  I'm in that age range where it's "He's a boy racer, charge him shit tons"  In a year, I've knocked my yearly price down from 2k to 1k, and that was with an-almost-writeoff a while back because of a blowout on the motorway.  I know being tracked is all Privacy concerns, yadayadayada, but I see it as a price reducer, and an extra security device. If on the chance my car gets robbed, insurers can track it.   Let them keep him, I say. I think he'd be too scared to come back anyway, after Leveson and all that.   Hm, as my fellow briton mentioned, it's rather hard for me to "Big meself up" without feeling a bit bigheaded, BUT TO HELL WITH IT  [](/twicrazy)  Primarily, I'm an IT Trainer, but I like to think my overactive imagination will pay off one day. I reckon I'll end up finishing this Game Design course (Home Learning is a double edged sword, folks!) and I'll write and design a game that's totally bitchin' and will get top marks everywhere.  That's wishful thinking, like.. But I like to think I write some damn good fiction. I've 2 novel projects I'm going on-off with because work and studies are clashing.  Also, I reckon I'm easily forgiving and try to be as generous as possible - once or twice I have run myself to the ground because god damnit, it's a friend's birthday, and I'm not getting them _nothing!_  Although I am a lazy fucker at best and it takes a lot to get me out of bed.  I guess that's the con to being me.  [](/dhsleep)   I'm too boring for this place.  Work t-shirt and jeans. I clocked off work 3 hours ago, so eh.  As for what I normally wear, well..

Maintenance is key, though I am failing to heed my own advice. :D   I'm CisMale, and I've got long hair. I keep it down all the time, unless I'm working - where I tie it up into a ponytail. No-one really gives me a second glance.  I mean, I might be going in the wrong direction here, but as you transition longer hair might be a blessing to help you feel more feminine.    To Redeem the FF Series (for me, anyway) would be going back to the old game-types, like FF9 or FF7.  My favourite final fantasy has to be FF9. The story is quite engaging - and with the previous two protagonists being someone Strong, Silent and "emotionally sensitive", Zidane was a breath of fresh air, as was FF10's Tidus.  With the Old PS1/SNES/NES Final Fantasies, the presence of a World Map gave the player a bigger feeling of an open world - you could just jump on the airship, chocobo or boat and pilot it around yourself - none of this "Fast Travel"  I might just be a nostalgic git, but I've recently replayed FF7 and I'm playing FF9 again, and they just seem like better *games* than the recent offerings. I couldn't find myself getting into FF13 at all. I tried, I tried so damn hard, but the linear corridor runs made me feel a little (metaphorically) claustrophobic. With the old titles, you could have different entry points on each "map" to find hidden items each map had 1 (or 2) "Camera" points, which made it a little easier to orient yourself in the surrounding areas.  As far as I went in FF13 - to find chests, all I had to do was run off the "corridor" a little. Also, the combat system bugged me a little - but if there's one thing Square did, it was change the combat system with each iteration of FF. FF7 had Materia, FF8 had Drawing and Junctioning (Which I dislike and couldn't really play it properly), FF9 had AP - etc.  FF13 has a sphere-grid -esque system, but it's locked to one "class". Switching "jobs" mid battle got confusing at best, especially when it affected all characters rather than just the one. the old FF's pulled the job system quite well - and so did FF10-2 (Which I enjoyed, despite the shit that got too)  In short, I feel with FF13, the game has gotten _too_ linear. A little open-ness wouldn't hurt!   Despite the shit it got, I found BRINK quite fun in short bursts. The single player and Multiplayer are practically identical, single player is bots on your team/enemy team, and multiplayer is actual people.   You're in ELIC - Explain it like Calvin's dad, who routinely winds Calvin up with utter shite. A perfect example of Trolldad   There's a fantastic pie shop near where I work. Burden Park pies. They were brilliant for match days when the Wanderers were still playing at Burnden park.. Now I just go there for lunch every now and again.  Curry pies are bloomin' fantastic.   They're not that bad. Just keep them at bay with pies - if you feel like letting them go.   Or he took his phone to the lav, saw his cat trying to get out, used his camera phone and took a picture.   [Ever been to Mario's in Westhoughton?](http://www.thisislancashire.co.uk/news/4390037.Bolton_s_10_egg__big_breakfast_challenge_become_top_attraction/) (Bolton)  So good, never finished it though, toast is a killer    I used them just now - still good!   When I go jogging, I definitely bring him with me, though he is pull-y if I have him on the lead, so I let him loose - He's good and always stays in line of sight.   Sometimes, on narrow paths, he works as my pace setter, running a set distance in front of me so I don't run too fast.   Not only will it have a military use - think of all those sci-fi gadgets you read about.  Computers built into your clothes, all your tracking apps on your phone you use to monitor where you run, how fast, etc.. Instead of relying on your phone keeping a GPS, your clothes could have that functionality built in.   On a somewhat related topic, all those AR games like Ingress could use sensors in your clothes, powered by this tech let you know when there's a place of interest nearby, maybe like a little vibrating motor on the back of your neck or on your shoulder    "Those things that one guy did once"  [](/ppwatching)   Aaaand I had to go check it out anyway.

 Congrats!   Danny knew he had made a mistake in coming, but he took a seat nonetheless.  All of the Alcoholics Anonymous meeting on his side of town seemed warm and welcoming. All of the people were friendly and knew him by name. There were hugs, handshakes, slaps on the back. The rooms were well lit with comfortable chairs. There were always freshly baked cookies or donuts.  A recent falling out with his sponsor, Ralph, had caused Danny to choose to avoid some of his normal meetings, though. He had already been down to two meetings a week, which Ralph had so poignantly called him to the carpet on, so he didnt want to cut those out completely. He had been feeling antsy lately and probably needed to go to a few more. Never the type to ask for help, he was unwilling to admit it, though. Instead, he decided to try a few meetings on the other side of the tracks. Whitehall. The seedy part of town.  Fucking Ralph. Youre only as sick as your secrets, he said. Danny had made a list of all those he had harmed, and went about making amends to them all. Some accepted his apologies, some didnt. All he could do was clean his own side of the street. There were fa few amends that were impossible to make, but he had admitted all of his sins to either his sponsor, his therapist, or his priest. All but The One Thing, that is. Thats what Ralph kept harping on. Danny had stayed sober for fifteen years. He deserved to keep The One Thing to himself, didnt he? Fucking Ralph.  Danny chose a group with the innocuous name of New Hope that met in the basement of Saint Petes Episcopal Church. While groups sometimes did actually meet in church basements, they were rarely as depicted on television or in the movies. Thats just not the way things worked. Hollywood had gotten the coffee and donuts part down to a tee, but missed the mark on most of the rest. Sadly, there werent even any donuts at the New Hope group. Danny wished that he had known. He would have sprung for some. AA had given him his life back, and brought a good bit of financial security with it, so he didnt mind giving back now and again.  He made his way over to the coffee urn, making eye contact with a few people on the way. He didnt even bother to smile. The most he got were some grunts and shrugs as he walked by. He had already decided that he wouldnt ever be coming back to this group, so why bother. He wasnt about to walk out, though. Giving up was for losers. He grabbed a Styrofoam cup from the top of the stack, which already had some black smudged fingerprints on the outside, and filled it with a sludge that they called coffee here at Saint Petes.  Danny threw a buck into a basket on the table and plopped into a chair that seemed to be farthest away from everyone else. This was nothing like the usual meetings he hit. The churchs basement room was about forty by forty feet square. There were eight rectangular folding tables set up in a makeshift circle with wooden chairs set along the outside. Unfortunately, there would be no speaker. This was a discussion meeting. They would most likely read something out of some bit of AA approved literature  the Big Book, Twelve and Twelve, or some meditation book  and then go around the room weighing in on their own personal experience, strength, and hope. Danny didnt feel like talking, but the one bit of his sponsors advice that he had latched onto early was to always say something. Always be part of.  Even though the ceiling held banks of fluorescent lights, the room still seemed cold. Perhaps it was the type of bulb they used. (Were there different types?) Or perhaps it was the way the light reflected off the sickly yellow linoleum floor and institution-green walls. It smelled funny, too. Oh well, thought Danny, its only for an hour. He had spent twice that amount of time scraping together change for another bottle while fighting off the shakes in the past. In comparison, this would surely be more pleasurable than that.  Thats what it came down to, wasnt it? For him, to drink is to die. There were times that he had done the most disgraceful things in order to get drunk. Things that would have sickened him if he had been sober and not fiending for the next drink. So if sitting through a boring meeting in a crappy place meant not drinking, even for only an hour, then so be it. Not a difficult choice.  He was not a snob, but the thought that the people here seemed to be a little lower class than what he was used to. He was by no means rich, but now that he had gotten his life together, he was back in the upper-middle class demographic. The meetings that he attended were regularly frequented by businessmen, doctors, realtors, and other professionals. Frankly, even the blue-collar people at his normal meetings seemed to be upper class compared to these people. These people were and he had to remind himself that he was being honest and not uncaring the dregs of society. Unshaven, unkempt, tattooed, greasy, foul smelling.  AA had taught him not to judge. There, but for the grace of God, go I. Still, it was hard.  Just before the meeting was called to order, a man plopped down into the chair next to him. Oh, come on, buddy, thought Danny. Ten empty chairs, plenty to keep enough distance between all of us, and you have to sit right next to me. He sighed. At least this guy seemed friendly.  Short, stout (PC for obese), with a red, round face, he introduced himself. Hi there! Names Mike! How bout you?  Danny, he said as he extended his hand.  At least Mike was dressed well. Button down shirt, slacks, dress shoes. He was even wearing cologne. Or was it the smell of booze? No, Danny decided, it was cologne. The guys breath smelled bad though. Not smelled as in drinking smelled, but just reeked. His teeth seemed white enough, but it was as if he hadnt brushed in ages.  Mike tried to make small talk. I havent seen you before. So how long have you been coming to these meetings?  About sixteen years, replied Danny. I came in for a year, and then decided that I wasnt ready to stop. I went back out for a while, and have been sober ever since. Fifteen years, one month, one week, and two days.  Wow! Mike seemed truly amazed, How many minutes?  Danny just smiled.  Me? Mike continued, Me? Ive only been coming for about a month now. Ill have thirty days on Wednesday.  Well, congratulations. For some people, those first thirty are the hardest. Real white knuckle time.  Mike was definitely pink clouding it. Thats the term for AAs in early sobriety who think that life has suddenly become wonderful and carefree. After a good period of sobriety, it kicks in that drunk or not, life still has challenges. Theres just no more alcohol to make the bad feelings go away.  Ill be getting my chip.  Mike was of course referring to the colored aluminum medallion that  although not universally used - has become almost synonymous with AA. Sobriety coins themselves do not help people stay sober as such. It's the meaning behind them that is important. When a person receives a coin for one month, three months, or a longer period of time, the coins give a sense of pride for staying sober as long as they have, and to motivate them to continue. If a person should feel the desire to drink again, they might finger the coin in their pocket to remind them of all the headway they have made up to that point. It makes them ask themselves if they truly want to throw away all that progress. Danny never liked the chips. He would occasionally step back and remember exactly how much sober time he had  remember that last drunk vividly  but he didnt want a constant reminder. He felt it would make it easier to ask the question Has it been long enough? Am I cured now?  The conversation was surprisingly pleasant enough, but Danny was happy when the meeting began all the same. Same old, same old. Business first, then reading, then around the table sharing. When eight oclock rolled around, the chairperson indicated that it was time to close, and they joined hands for the Lords Prayer. AA is not a religious organization, but saying the Lords Prayer at the end is sort of a tradition in most  but not all  groups. Its a sign of unity, if nothing else. Danny really didnt plan to stick around for fellowship afterwards, but he always stayed long enough to help clean up. However, before he got to the door, Mike cornered him.  Hey Danny, am I going to see you around here again?  Eh, Danny creased his brow, Probably not. I live on the other side of town. I just stopped in here tonight because well, it was just convenient. Danny guessed that had not technically been a lie. AAs had to be careful. Practice these principals in all of our affairs. Lies paved a slippery slope.  Oh, Mike seemed dejected, Its just that they say to get phone numbers  you know, to call for when you feel like drinking  and I was wondering if I could get yours.  Dannys shoulders relaxed a little. Of course, Mike. Thats never a problem. Never feel like you cant use it. Mike wouldnt use it. Most of the newbies never did. Danny pulled out a pen and jotted it down in the back of Mikes meeting pamphlet anyway. There you go.  Thanks, Danny Mike shook the pamphlet. I will definitely use this. Youre a lifesaver. You guys are great.  Mike bounced away. Danny made his way out into the parking lot and slid behind the wheel of his 2012 KIA. He said a little prayer for Mike. Hope he makes it. Who knew? Maybe being at that meeting was Gods way of putting him in the right place at the right time.  Danny rolled through the Burger King drive-thru on the way home to pick up an artery clogging dinner. He just wanted to flick on the television, eat, shower, and get into bed. It had been an exhausting day. He had barely pulled into his garage when his cell phone began to jingle. Danny finished parking, unbuckled his seatbelt, and answered the phone right there in the front seat. It was an old habit  probably not a healthy one  but he just had to pick up the phone when it rang. He could not bear the thought of someone leaving a message. He had heard stories of AAs who were never able to get through to someone, and things didnt turn out well. Once their faith in the system was broken, especially the newcomers, they didnt trust it anymore.  Hullo.  Danno! Its Mike!  Uh, Danny shifted the phone to his right ear, Whats up, Mike?  Oh, no no no. Dont worry, Dan. Im not thinking of drinking. Just wanted to test out the number. Practice call, you know? They say to get used to calling when you dont need to, and that way itll be easier to call when you do need to. Right?  Um, yeah Mike. That is a good idea.  So whats up?  Um, well, not a whole lot since I saw you. I just drove home. Thats about it, Danny said with a smirk on his face. Im about to have some dinner and then its off to bed.  Oh, okay, Mike replied. You go have your dinner and have a great night! Maybe Ill talk to you tomorrow?  Sure, Mike. Tomorrow.  Danny showered, toweled off, and padded into his bedroom. He slid into a pair of silk boxers and fell into bed. He didnt imagine that hed have any problem sleeping  he was physically exhausted  but as usual, his mind raced a mile a minute. He was never able to fall asleep without the radio turned on, even when about ready to pass out. His head would hit the pillow and the stinkin thinkin would kick in. Thats how Danny discovered the wonders of talk radio.  Dialed in to a pundit recapping the days news in a soothing voice, Danny pulled the chain on his bedside lamp and plunged the room into darkness. The pillow was cool. His stomach was full. His mind had calmed. Sleep began to  Danny phone jingled. He propped himself up on one elbow, used the remote to turn the radio off, and grabbed the phone from the nightstand. Its screen had lit up with the number of the incoming call, but he didnt recognize it. It wasnt a name that had been programmed into his phone. Danny briefly considered putting the phone back down and letting it go to voicemail, but he knew that he would not be able to sleep until he heard the message and, more than likely, called whomever it was back.  Mmm, Danny sighed, Hello?  Danny. Mike sounded grave this time. Sorry to call so late. I mean, I know you said that you were going to hit the hay, and I didnt want to bother you, but  Sokay, Mike. Go ahead.  Remember how I said that Id be getting my chip in a couple of days? Yeah. I cant believe itll have been a month already. You know, the day I took my last drink was a special day.  Every day is special when its your last day drunk, Mike.  Yeah, yeah. But, I mean special. It was the anniversary of Well Mike began to get flustered. See, my wife and I, my ex-wife that is, and I lost our daughter that day.  Danny swung his legs out from under the covers and sat up. Oh, Im sorry.  Oh, dont be, Danny. It happened a long time ago. Long time ago. It would have been her twenty-first birthday, Mike trailed off. So long ago. The denial, the depression, the sadness, the anger. I started drinking afterward and just never thought to stop. Until now, that is.  Thats a long time to be stewing in it, Mike. Do you want to talk about it?  Nah, Danny. No sense dredging up the past. Not when Im doing so well.  Youre only as sick as your secrets, Mike. God, Danny hated it when his sponsor was right.  Yeah, yeah. Maybe when Im feeling a little more stable, Danny. Maybe Ill talk about it then. Im just not doing so well right now.  Danny spoke with Mike for about half an hour and, when he was convinced that Mike was over the urge to drink, let him off the phone and promised to meet him the following day. He lay down his phone and swung back under the covers, a smile on his face. What was it they say? Even if Mike went out and drank that night, at least Danny stayed sober. Help yourself by helping others. Danny forgot to turn the radio back on, and that night, he dreamt about The One Thing.  Danny awoke to the sound of his phone. It wasnt the alarm tone, but the ringtone. Another phone call. He had come to recognize Mikes number by now. This was getting a little annoying, but sometimes thats the way it went. Mike would either fall off the wagon soon, or he would start to make new contacts. In the meantime, Danny would just have to deal with it.  Good morning, Mike.  Dan, my man! Good to hear your voice.  Yeah, said Danny, scratching at the back of his head, Its been like six or seven hours now, huh?  Oh, yeah. Im not bothering you, am I?  No, no. Yes, yes, though Danny. So how did last night go? Didnt drink, did you?  Nope, and I owe it all to you Dan.  Well, Mike, you picked up the phone and made the call. So you can give yourself a little pat on the back. That phone can seem real heavy when it stands between you and a drink.  Aint that the truth? So, are you hitting a meeting this morning, Danny?  Um, no, Mike. I have a job, Danny tried not to sound ticked off. I have to work today. I promise that well get to one tonight. You pick it out, and call me back around six. Okay?  Got it, Danno. Six! Talk to you then.  Dannys worst fear came true. Three more calls during the day. Mike had picked a group called As Bill Sees It, on Dannys side of town. Danny decided that he would need to have a talk with Mike that evening. Calling when in need, or even for occasional friendly support, was fine, but there was such a thing as abusing the system. You know, the boy who cried wolf sort of thing. Danny was about ready to throw his always-answer-the-phone policy out the door.  Danny didnt look forward to the conversation, and had a rough time forcing his dinner down that evening. He wasnt hungry but, as usual, he tried to keep his stomach full. HALT Hungry, angry, lonely, tired. Four things an alcoholic never wanted to be. Any of those could be a setup for another drink. As he was finishing his second hot dog, wrapped in white bread with ketchup  just as he liked them  his phone rang again. He checked the screen. Fucking Mike. Again. He decided that he wouldnt answer it, and let it go to voicemail.  Seconds later, it rang again. Didnt that guy get the message? Danny let it go to voicemail again. Another few minutes passed, and it rang again. Danny wondered if Mike had changed his mind. Maybe he couldnt make it to the meeting after all. Still, he let it go to voicemail. Thankfully, more minutes passed and Mike did not call back. Danny felt like a heel, but he just couldnt deal with it anymore.  At around a quarter of seven, Danny tied his shoes and gathered his wallet and car keys. As he headed toward the door, his phone jingled. Mike. This time, he answered.  Hey, Mike. Im headed out the door right now.  Oh thank God, Dan! exclaimed Mike. I couldnt get a hold of you, and then I started to worry I wondered if maybe you went out drinking again, I I  Mike! Slow down, buddy. Danny was beginning to let his temper get the best of him. Would you...? Oh, look. Just wait for me at the meeting. Outside! We need to talk.  Mike was breathing more regularly now. Oh, Danny. You really had me going there. Well, anyway, you can ride with me.  What?  Danny strode out of the back door and pressed the button to lift the garage door. As the door rolled up, it gradually revealed a battered, green Honda sitting in the drive. Mike sat behind the wheel with the engine idling. Danny was taken aback. He walked briskly up to the drivers side door and motioned for Mike to lower the window. After a moment, and with a confused look on his face, Mike hit the button and the window glided down.  Whats wrong, Dan? Hop in. I thought that maybe we could ride to the meeting together. Then, maybe grab a cup of coffee after, huh?  Danny was fed up. No! No, Mike! No meeting, no coffee after. I dont have time for this. I dont know what to do with you. You cannot keep calling me. How the hell did you even find out where I live?  Oh, uh, Mike looked shamefacedly, I guess maybe I, uh, followed you home last night.  What the hell?!  Sorry, Dan. Im new at this. I really dont know how it works.  How it works. Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of these steps, we tried to carry this message to alcoholics, and to practice these principles in all our affairs. Danny thought it over and softened.  Okay, Mike. Heres how it works, he said calmly. Ill come to the meeting, but I drive there myself. We talk a little. After the meeting, I come home. Alone. No coffee. No more calling, unless you really need to  like I am going to drink need to. Are we clear?  Mike looked a little hurt, but replied, Okay. Clear, Danno.  Danny got into his KIA and followed Mike to the meeting. They sat next to each other, but Mike was uncharacteristically quiet. Afterward, they separated in the parking lot with nary a word.  See you tomorrow, Danny?  Maybe.  Oh, hey, said Mike, Theres a candlelight meeting called Nite Owls tonight at the Oh, right. Sorry.  Tomorrow, Mike. Danny stressed.  Danny thought that Mike may have gotten the message, but just in case, he turned his phone off for the evening for what was probably the first time in years. That night, Danny had a nightmare about The One Thing.  Danny pulled himself from bed and showered in the morning, and had almost forgotten his phone. Still wrapped in a towel and with damp hair, he walked over to the nightstand and turned it on. He returned to the bathroom as it went through its boot up process, and then he heard a message tone from the next room. Hmm. Wonder who that could be.  Six missed calls from Mike. One two voicemails, four texts. Thanks for coming, Dan, Sure you dont want to go to the meeting?, Great meeting  shoulda been there! and Need 2 talk. Danny didnt want any confrontation today. He turned his phone back off, dressed and left home. He knew  just knew  that Mike would show up at his door after not receiving answers for long enough. He planned to not be there. Even though it was a Saturday, he would hang out at his office. There was a couch there. He could take a nap if need be. (And he did need it after the previous night.)  He felt silly and demoralized. It was his own house, damn it. He was being chased away from his own home by well, a stalker. Should he talk to the police? No, he decided. He would talk to his sponsor first. Not daring to turn his cell back on for fear that it might ring in his hand; upon arriving at his office, he picked up his desk phone and dialed in Ralphs number. Ralph was no help. At least, he didnt tell Danny what he wanted to hear.  Just suck it up, Danny. Ive had my share of pigeons who either tried too hard or didnt try hard enough. My guess is that this Mike guy will turn out to be one or the other. Why dont you bring him along to tonights meeting? Ill meet you guys at the Acceptance Group tonight. Maybe I can have a talk with him.  Yeah, I suppose.  Danny turned his cell back on in order to call Mike and invite him to the Acceptance Group that evening. Six missed calls, and it was barely noon. He sighed and began to scroll to Mikes number when the phone jingled. Danny didnt even need to look at the number to know who it was.  Hi Mike.  Danny! I tried to  Yeah, I know Mike. Ive been at work. I just turned my phone on and saw that you had called. An icy thought ran down Dannys spine. Did Mike know where he worked, too? Anyway, my sponsor suggested that I introduce you to him tonight. Were going to Saint Andrews to a meeting called the Acceptance Group. Want to come?  Are you kidding? Do you even need to ask? I would never pass on the chance to meet my sponsors sponsor. Hes like, what, my grand-sponsor?  Whoa. Danny thought about it, and never had the talk of him being Mikes sponsor come up. A sponsor is a recovering alcoholic who has successfully made some personal progress in the AA recovery program. He or she is asked by another AA member to take on the individual responsibility of sponsorship. A sponsor shares their experiences on an individual and personal basis with another alcoholic who is trying to achieve or maintain their own sobriety through the AA program. They help the person focus and navigate through the stages of the program. The relationship between an AA member and his sponsor is usually a pretty close and intimate one, and not gone into lightly. Not only does an alcoholic need to carefully choose a sponsor, but also the potential sponsor must cautiously decide whether taking on a sponsee is prudent.  Danny gave him the benefit of the doubt, though. Mike was new at this. Hey now, Mike, Im just another alcoholic willing to help you out. Im not really in the right state of mind to sponsor anyone. Not until he rid his conscience of The One Thing, anyway.  Oh, okay.  Dont feel bad, Mike. Youre new. Youll catch on to how this works. Then Danny had a thought, one that might rid him of Mike for good. Ralph has really helped me out. Maybe hed be a good choice for you to consider.  Eh, he wont be the same as you, Dan.  Youd be surprised. Were all the same in one way or another. Promise me that youll keep an open mind.  Okay. Anything for you, Danno.  Danny hung up and texted directions to the meeting. Then he turned his phone back off. He decided on trying to catch a little nap, after all, and so curled up on the couch in the reception area of his office. He drifted off almost immediately, but it didnt last long. He awoke screaming and in a cold sweat just forty-five minutes later. He felt his face and realized that hed been crying, also. He had dreamed of The One Thing. Why had thoughts of it returned, and in such force? Fucking Ralph. He brought it up and started pressing Danny. That would make sense. Although, Danny had a feeling that Mike had something to do with it. Guilt over avoiding him? Constantly having to look over his shoulder and avoid phone calls? Or perhaps the fact that Mike had lost his daughter. Danny pushed The One Thing to the back of his mind once again, and decided to cross the street to McDonalds to get in at least one meal before that evenings meeting.  Danny had to cross a four-lane street in order to reach McDonalds. It was the middle of the afternoon, clear weather, and  being a Saturday  there was only light traffic. He absentmindedly glanced both directions and crossed, not bothering to walk to the corner and wait for a signal. He was about halfway across when, seemingly out of nowhere, a car came racing at him. The driver was noticeably straddling the double striped centerline of the road, and overcorrected when he noticed Danny at the last moment. Danny could hear the tires screech as the driver got back into his own lane and sped off.  A drunk knew the signs when he saw another drunk driving under the influence. This guy was definitely drunk. Probably drinking in his car all morning and then falling asleep at the wheel after finally deciding to go home. Danny had done it himself on many occasions. Even though he could have stayed home and drank contentedly (and safely) in the comfort of his living room, he would choose to sit at the park on some mornings and drink in his car. He thought of how strange the ritual was, and how it was not unique to him. On any given morning, there would be a spattering of cars in each lot  all parked as far away from each other as the lot would allow. Each car with a single occupant, seemingly just sitting there. Every now and then, he could glance over and catch the sight of a bottle being raised to the drivers lips.  Fred, another guy from one of the meetings, would occasionally go down to a local park and work it. Hed walk around the lots and catch drunks, pretending that he had just been walking by and was looking to make conversation. Sometimes, his presence was enough to make the drunk drive away. Sometimes, theyd stay and talk. Sometimes, they would even offer him a drink. Only twice, as far as Danny was aware of, did Fred actually get a drunk to open up about his problem and agree to take Freds advice. It might not have seemed like a lot, but that may have been two lives saved. Plus countless others, if you figured in the innocent lives that a drunk might take along with himself on the highway to Hell.  Danny began to hyperventilate. He ran the rest of the way across the street and sat on the curb, his gorge rising. He tried to calm himself, but could not. Eventually, he vomited into the gutter. It wasnt the first time, but in the past, hed always been drunk or hung over. He realized how pitiful he must have looked. He had never seemed to care in the past.  Eating was out of the question. Danny went back to the parking lot of his office, crossing the street with extra care this time, and got into his car. He drove straight to the church. He would be almost an hour and a half early, but that was okay. Someone was always there early to open up the rooms and make coffee. It was nice to show up and shoot the shit sometimes.  Not surprisingly, Mike was already there when Danny arrived. He was sitting out in the parking lot, but remained in his car. It looked like he was dozing. Danny walked over and rapped on the drivers side window a few times. Mike startled, and he rolled the window down.  Danny! Youre early. Thats great.  Yep. Couldnt wait to get here, Mike, he said sarcastically. Tell you what. Lets go around back and grab a bench.  Danny led Mike behind the church. There was a small outdoor chapel of sorts  just a few benches facing a large, wooden cross, and overlooking a small stream. Danny motioned for Mike to take a seat, and then sat down next to him.  Mike, lets talk. Danny seemed surprisingly calm. I know that youre pretty new to the program, and this may be skipping ahead quite a bit, but let me explain how the fourth and fifth steps of AA go. They are, to me at least, probably the most important steps of all twelve. They are where you begin healing.  Sounds great, Dan.  Not really. I did a really shitty job on my fifth step. Remember how I told you that youre only as sick as your secrets?  Mike nodded, Yeah, Danny.  The fourth and fifth steps ask you to make a searching and fearless moral inventory, and then admit to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.  I can see where that would help. I have so much guilt and remorse, Danny. Sometimes, I think its what makes me drink.  Danny shook his head. No, Mike, you drink because youre an alcoholic. But its a whole lot easier to get sober when you get your head on straight. When you get rid of all of the shit thats deep down inside. The stuff that regrets are made of.  So are we going to do that now?  Not we. Me.  I thought that you already did your steps.  Danny nodded. I did, Mike. I did. But the fourth and fifth steps are carried on throughout the rest. We have to continue to take a moral inventory, and do those steps over and over, because we are human. Just because we get sober doesnt make us saints. We still make mistakes.  Mike nodded slowly and remained quiet. It was as if he knew that Danny was about to say something important and it was time to keep his mouth shut.  You see, Mike, there was something that I never admitted in my fifth step. Something that I couldnt admit. The One Thing that I wasnt ready to give up. I dont know why, but its catching up to me now. Im afraid that if I dont let it go, Im either going to drink or kill myself. Or both.  What is it, Danno?  This is probably a mistake. Telling a newcomer. Especially about The One Thing. In fact, this would be better left with a priest, but at this point it doesnt matter because Im going to have to own up to it. The One Thing is something that everyone will find out about sooner or later. Probably sooner, now.  You can tell me, Danny, your secret is safe with me.  Suddenly, it was as if Mike had become the old-timer. His demeanor changed. He surely didnt seem like a newbie anymore. The whole way he was acting He had gone from being an annoying, overexcited, asshole to a quiet, comforting soul  at least in Dannys heart. Danny took a deep breath.  Ive been sober for fifteen years, one month, one week, and four days. I told you that I came into the rooms about sixteen years ago, though. Well, something happened about six months into that. Id been dry, sure, but still an alcoholic. Still exhibiting all of the same behavior. Thats what the program is for, by the way. Not to make us stop drinking, but to make us saner, healthier people. Well, Mike, I Dannys breath hitched in his throat. He was already regretting bringing this up, but he felt like it was too late now.  Go on, Danno. Im listening.  It was late summer. Around seven oclock, dusk. I was driving up Parkside Avenue, you know the place?  Yeah. As a matter of fact, I used to live in a cul-de-sac off Parkside.  Then you know the hill, about midways. Anyway, I was coming up over the crest of the hill, tooling along pink clouding it, stone cold sober, mind you. A girl. A little girl, damn it. She came out from between two parked cars and just just ran right out in front of me.  Oh, God Danny. No.  Yes. I couldnt stop. I fucking ran her down, Mike. A little girl!  Thats horrible, Mike grimaced, But it was an accident Danny. You said so yourself. You were sober. She ran out from between the cars. You couldnt have known.  No, but it was what I did next that was unforgiveable.  What, Dan? Mike rocked back, laced his fingers together, and knitted his brow. He had a clearheaded look about him. One that Danny had never seen on Mikes face before. What was unforgiveable?  Danny took a deep breath. I didnt stop. I just kept on driving. I panicked. It was like I had been drinking. I didnt want to get caught. Afterward, I realized that it was an accident, but at the time At the time, I just panicked. I acted just like a drunk would have. I left her there, Mike. Maybe she was still alive, but I left her there. What if she was just hurt and could have been saved if I had just stopped?!  She wasnt hurt. She was dead the instant you hit her, Dan.  You couldnt know that. I didnt know that, and I was there.  I do know it, Danny. Thats what the EMT said. Dead on impact.  Danny jerked his head up. It was as if his stomach had dropped out from under him. Like the first hill on a roller coaster. What did you say?  When I got there, thats what the EMT told me. Dead on impact. She didnt suffer. She probably had no idea what had happened.  What the hell are you talking about Mike?  She was my daughter, Danny.  Danny was speechless. He sat still for a moment, and then started shaking his head violently. No! Fuck you, Mike. Her father is dead. I followed the story in the papers. He killed himself two months after the accident. Got drunk and drove into a bridge abutment. Why the hell would you even say something like that?  Mike had tears welling up in the corners of his eyes. Because now I know, Danny. Now I know that you are repentant.  Fuck you, Mike. How can you pull this shit on me? How can you even say something like that? Do you think that this is a joke? Well, fuck you.  Danny stormed away, sobbing, and walked toward the church. Ralph had arrived and was walking in himself. He noticed how upset Danny was and stopped him, grabbing his shoulders and turning him around somewhat forcefully.  Danny! Whats wrong? Whats going on?  That asshole. I told him, Ralph. I told him The One Thing, and do you know what he said?  Slow down, Danny, said Ralph. If youre ready, why dont you tell me what The One Thing is first.  His secret no longer a secret, he told Ralph exactly what he had told Mike. And he said that hes her father! That dick!  Who, Danny? Who?  Mike. That idiot whos been harassing me.  Where is he, Danny? Is he here? Ill talk to him.  Danny turned and pointed at the bench. Hes right He was sitting with me right there.  Ralph cocked his head. Danny, are you okay?  No, Im upset, and with good reason. I just told him The One Thing, and he goes and says that?  Ralphs brow wrinkled with concern. Danny, Ive been here for twenty minutes waiting for you to go inside. I saw you sitting there on the bench talking to yourself, and thought that you were praying or needed some time to yourself. You were alone the whole time, Danny.  Danny scanned the parking lot. No battered, green Honda. He started to breath heavily, and pulled out his phone. He scrolled through his call log  all of the calls he had made and received. All of the texts. Nothing. The only call in the last three days was the one he had made to Ralph that same morning. There was one text message waiting in his inbox. It had no number associated with it.  I forgive you Danny."     	3
 For me its circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, circle, R1, L2, L1, triangle, circle, triangle. Spawned tanks until I crashed my PS2.   Ah! Surprised I haven't seen this video yet. Here's the album.   http://suicidegirls.com/albums/site/13576/gallery/   About a mile/20 minute walk from the hotel, but midtown is packed with bars. You have Waterworks, Spaceport, Wine Loft, Mockingbird, Leon Pub, Midtown Filling Station, and Finnegan's Wake, all within a tiny radius of each other.  There is also a neat speakeasy in the area. You'll probably want to call ahead with a reservation and the drinks are pretty pricy, but its a cool experience. http://www.alchemymidtown.com/ Also Level 8 in Hotel Duval, and Midtown Station a little up Monroe are also there. But if you have the time, definitely take check out Fermentation Lounge. It's a really nice place to have a drink with some friends and make new ones. I now realize I look like a drunk.   The sound of buzzing when they released the confetti made me think they just unleashed a horde of bees into the stadium.    I just passed this 2 days ago and was sad that I missed the picture. :(   Yeaaaaaah   I prefer the Sprite/blue Powerade mix to be more accessible, especially in a restaurant since they're both coke products and can be easily combined in any restaurant with a Coca Cola fountain.

Reminds me of the music video for [Big Bad Wolf by Duck Sauce](http://youtu.be/VGRQGm4-A4k) (NSFW)   The amount of detail in the Aquaman's costume was absolutely stunning.

 Apparently there are 13 different proteins in the peanut that contain amino acid sequences to which antibodies attach ("epitopes"). People with peanut allergies usually have a specific immunoglobulin (IgE) that recognizes these epitopes from peanut proteins, and generates a massive immune/inflammatory response...hence, the severe anaphylaxis caused by peanuts in people with a peanut allergy.  It appears there is still some debate as to the major culprit, but you can read more about this topic [here](http://www.hindawi.com/journals/ijfs/2013/909140/). This paper gives a nice (but technical) overview of the different allergens thought to be responsible for peanut allergies.   [PubMed Central](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) is a good place to go. All the papers here are free to everyone. They're not the newest, but usually within the last 18 months. All of us government-funded researchers are now required to deposit our manuscripts there for "public consumption" after the original publication.   Agreed about administration; it's getting absurd the amount of 6-figure salaries being paid to people who tell us to do the exact same thing 5 different ways.  However, as a research scientist, I see very little incentive from the University to teach undergraduates. My grants bring in far more indirect dollars than my students, so most of my time is spent trying to get grants instead. Sometimes it feels like teaching responsibilities are used as punishments for scientists who've fallen on hard times (funding-wise). I think the united state's universities would be well-served to reward and encourage their brightest and best faculty to teach.  Also? No one has EVER taught US how to teach! Education classes should become compulsory during PhD-level graduate education...but perhaps this is a topic for a different discussion...   Two reasons:   * the absorption rate/location of the drug * the metabolism rate/location of the drug.  - I'll use caffeine as the example, per your request. Caffeine is absorbed into the blood stream from your mouth, throat, stomach, and intestines. This absorption happens rapidly as you drink a cup of coffee for example, since caffeine is both water- and lipid-soluble. So, it gets into the blood stream pretty quickly and pretty freely.   Furthermore, The enzymes that metabolize many drugs (caffeine included) are expressed in the highest amounts in the liver, not the digestive tract. Caffeine is thus not "broken down" until after it reaches the liver through the blood stream. In the liver, caffeine is then metabolized at a much slower rate, leading to a half-life of around 5 hours.  - TL;DR: The body doesn't break down caffeine during digestion because it can't.  	4
    IIRC, for about 5 minutes way back in the dawn times, it was the default way reddit worked briefly.   But it was killed by one of the First Ones and made optional cause lots of people were angered by it's existence.  Mainly cause it did weird things and took a long time to get used to when you did try and use it.   It seemed to be effected by a lot of weird things, such as different reddit preferences, browser settings, planetary alignments and whether you were into Star Trek or Star Wars.  And lord....  you don't want to know what happened to people who tried using it but were into Star Search.    They were flung into Stargate haven't been heard from since.                             Not Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up"?  Come on.     The Neo Confederate movement did invent fluoride.   It's a known fact.     California passed this law because the numbers of children being immunized by their parents has already caused the break down in herd immunity in some areas there.   It's high time a state took action on it.  It's time for the Federal government to act too.  End this problem nation wide before it becomes a giant problem.  People don't have a right to harm others through their own stupidity.                                                           I can't believe that somebody would try and say that starvation and feeling a little hungry cause you haven't eaten since lunch are the same thing.   It's like comparing a scratch to decapitation.  Lunatics.                        Obviously he has never enjoyed a [Genny Cream Ale](https://www.beerconnoisseur.com/sites/default/files/articles/style_studies_cream_ale/genessee.jpg).       Lord knows I haven't.                       I have had discussions with him in PM's about various things several times.   We compare notes on moderation and the like.  He really cares about /r/Science and does a lot of unseen work.   His article: [Reddits science forum banned climate deniers. Why dont all newspapers do the same?](http://grist.org/climate-energy/reddits-science-forum-banned-climate-deniers-why-dont-all-newspapers-do-the-same/) should be read by everyone.        I was talking to a feminist activist once who told me about how she got a bunch of complaining mens-rights guys coming to her blog where she was writing about how she worked to set up a woman's shelter.    She took a few of them at their word and decided to try and help them with setting him a men's shelter.    Instead of working with her they just called her names.     A lot of those guys don't want to help men.  They just want to complain that sometimes woman are successful.                    I have no problem with your liking the prequels.    And to be honest, I probably would make peace with George if he would just refund my $10 cause of Jar-Jar.     From what I understand a lot of these kind of cases get appealed to the courts when the IRS tries to fine them.        I've  never really understood the whole "I don't like it so we must disallow it's entire existence" attitude a lot o people have.   I don't like horror movies, but I don't advocate for a ban on them.  I don't like current Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, but I have not petitioned the government to publicly execute him.     Why can't people just be okay with things they don't like?   If you don't like Felicia Day, don't read articles she writes or watch videos she puts on the internet.  The Internet is a big place.    For some reason, that just seems simple.   I guess it's not.   Of course, I will still never forgive George Lucas for the prequels.   One still has to have some standards.    But something about the billions of dollars tells me that George probably doesn't care what I think.   :-)      A former slave responded to a letter from his ex-master after the Civil War.   [See here](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/01/to-my-old-master.html).   The ex-master asked him to come back and work his farm.  The former slave responded with a request for 32 years back pay for himself, and 20 years of back pay for his wife.   And he also politely asked for a guarantee from the ex-master to not rape his daughters.   Figuring those were small things to ask for if the ex-master really wanted to just *let bygones be bygones*.       You can buy my silence with a Hershey's chocolate kiss.     /u/Nallen is basically the chief-of-staff mod at /r/Science and is one of the best mods across all of Reddit.   He knows how to weld the ban hammer and can more than hold his own with the best mods everywhere.     He's the one who setup the AMA with the guys from Monsanto.   From what I understand, it took months of e-mail exchanges with the company to get them to do it.      As with many things in life.....  Look around the debating table; if you can't immediately see who the asshole is, then youre it.     I suddenly have the urge to go to Olive Garden.  Those bread-sticks are amazing.       It does look a little similar to what happened in 2008 when the anyone-but-Hillary crowd all picked Obama early on and fought hard for him.       The one big difference is that Obama was younger, good looking and telegenic.   Sanders, while not a lot older than Hillary Clinton (by six years), definitely appears older than she does.   Maybe that shouldn't matter in politics, but it does.    If the people truly disagree with the Courts decision, they can elect representatives to amend the Constitution.    What that entails is as follows  * 2/3rds of Congress starting the amendment process.   291 of 435 House votes and 67 of 100 Senate votes. * 3/4ths (38 of 50) of the State legislature's to pass resolutions approving the amendment.    Of course, on this issue.... those numbers aren't going to materialize.   Right now it would actually be much easier politically to amend the Constitution to 100% approve the Court's decision for all time rather then repeal it.     My sister ended up renting the whole conference room area at a major hotel for the wedding.  It included a weekends worth of rooms for the her and her now husband, the wedding party (ushers and brides maids) and both sets of parents.  About 10-12 rooms.  Included a stocked bar for the reception after the civil service they had performed.   All for cheaper than the church wanted for one day in mid-October in the North East.    And it was at a Church she is an active member of too.   You would think that they would give a break for people who are really members of the Church.    I'm sorry, but everything about it was crazy.   They got more space, more time, hotel rooms, didn't have to have a cash-bar, etc.   Way more than her own Church could have provided and it was cheaper.   I'm sorry, but that screams greed and nothing else.          *Being There* is one of my favorite movies.   I really recommend it.      Many people have been forgoing church weddings for a while now.  Often just to do with costs.  My sister is very religious, but when she found out how much her own church wanted to charge for the most basic wedding service, she went with a private civil service instead.   Churches can often be down right greedy when  comes to these things.     For a long time it was true.   But as with many things, Reagan didn't like the rule so he appointed judges who disagreed with the idea.   And then in 1994 Gingrich Revolution when the GOP won control of Congress.... the Senate largely only confirms judges who allow Churches a lot of latitude to lobby for candidates.   They get away with saying "We really like Congressman Smith" instead of "We endorse Congressman Smith".    And since they didn't say *endorse*,  they are allowed to all-but-endorse candidates.    As long as they stop just short of saying "Vote for Congressman Smith", then it's not political.   At least according to a lot of judges out there.  So the IRS and other government agencies that might call them on the lobbying efforts have learned to ignore it except in the most egregious cases.           Chauncey Gardner, I presume.                It's an age old  hobby of political groups.   Debating who's in the group and who's not in the group.   Then come the manifesto marathons where the subgroups all read each other out of the party.   And so you end up with the subgroups hating each other more than they dislike their actual political opposition.     See Monty Python's [PFJ scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS-0Az7dgRY) in *Life of Brian*.      If /r/HailCorporate is calling you insane....  well, that's pretty conclusive evidence that you aren't in the mainstream with the rest of society.      Wow, Mel is considered worse than [this guy](http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=192).   That's kind of amazing.    I'm sorry....  we don't invite you to the meetings because nobody likes that hot dog casserole you keep bringing to the pot luck dinners after Temple.   Really, what is up with the potato chips crust?   It's not 1975 anymore.                                               "If [the Civil War] wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".  - Confederate General James Longstreet responding to a question as to the cause of the Civil War.    Coupled with the [Declaration of Causes of Seceding States](http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~ras2777/amgov/secession.html) and things like the [Cornerstone Speech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornerstone_Speech) by  Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens.... the cause of the war was Slavery.     All the ancillary other factors that people like to bring up, be it tax issues, tariffs, states rights, the Southern agrarian economy, etc.  Each of those other contributing factors contain slavery at the core of their being.  They can not be discussed in any logical way without directly discussing slavery.   Slavery can not be decoupled from the causes of the American Civil War any more than violence can be decoupled from war itself.   This means the confederate flag (or the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia if you prefer that name) is all about being a believer in slavery as if it was a good thing.  To say anything else is not just wrong, but willful and maliciously wrong.        If they refuse to leave for voat, can we lite up a pyre and enjoy a roast?     Where it the individual law that says you are a human with rights anyone is bound to respect?    Clearly if you want to claim you possess human rights you must be imagining new law into existence.     Everything I just said is as crazy as what you just claimed.     I'm sorry, but the semantic content of interracial marriage question and the same-sex-couple marriage question are exactly the same.  They are the same question at the end of the day.  Both are 100% moral and ethical, and any other conclusion can only be based on a denial of human rights.     Thomas and you may not want to accept this basic fact, but it does not change the basic fact that only way one can justify being against gay-marriage is to deny that gays possess inalienable human rights.   Anything else you might try and claim is bullshit lying on your part.  Your fully understanding that you are lying is not required.   You are just willfully lying to yourself as well.    The same bullshit arguments were made by people to oppose Loving v. Virginia.   They were willful idiots then, they are willful and malicious idiots now.     There is not one point in all of Scalia's dissent and his claim that same sex couples can't marry that wouldn't also once been made in relation to  interracial couples.   For hundreds and thousands of years that was banned.   But the court in 1967 found that thousands of years of bullshit around that was unconstitutional.  Same applies here.   The ban on same-sex couples getting married was illegal in 1789, the fact that the founders didn't know this just means they were **purposely** blind to their own laws.   They were wrong then, and Scalia is wrong now.   Period.       So, it wasn't left handled, non-religious, blue eyed, tall, polo shirt wearing Jews then.    Good to know nobody suspects me.     Did you know, Hemlock is all natural.   Clearly Socrates did not die.   Therefore he must clearly still be alive.     I'm positive I saw him a the mall the other day.                You won't need to worry about [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeFkrwagYfc) for a while.    You can't melt mental beams with a racist memes.     Like some sort of Gay Illuminati  Now there is a conspiracy I could support.   I would donate them all the Jewish gold the Mossad has paid me over the years.  And I wouldn't even ask for a tax write off for it.   Do these idiots understand that the Nazis put homosexuals to death in the holocaust along with the Jews, Socialists and Roma?      Sadly, either they don't understand that or they think the Nazis were the good guys.     As if there was something wrong with being a JIDF shill.        Probably just telling everyone that he thinks the Klan are a bunch of softies who don't take the racist cause seriously.    According to /r/conspiracy everyone is a government shill.    Even Snuffaluffagus.       Lost Causers were never above lying, cheating and pure fabrication when it came to blaming people who weren't at fault.  They hated Longstreet for his cooperation with reconstruction.          Well, aren't you a special little pumpkin.     It's not just NY City with these astronomical costs if you want to get a taxi medallion either.  I'm far from a libertarian.  But this is one industry where the government regulation has been used to keep competition out of the market place for decades now.    If I want to take a taxi from my home into the metro-downtown area about 25 miles away, the price is over $100.   One way.    That's crazy expensive.      This time, why not the worst?     I assumed it was where you entered in a polygamous marriage but even then none of your husbands or wives want to sleep with you.     Yes, cause racist hate mongers should be provided a platform to spread their bullshit.     Really now.      The middle ground should be in making a self-post mod created thread and then removing all racist comments.   But then, people scream when that happens cause they aren't allowed to be racist shits.    Which is how you know they are only interested in propagating their racist hate.    Then why am I getting tons of PMs from /r/Europe users who lamenting that *the "kill all mudslimes" crowd is in full force and it's too depressing for me to wade through*.   Lots of people who are rightly disappointed that the mods there are now allowing racists to run roughshod over the subreddit now.    It should be possible comment about what happened without calling for mass genocide of North African peoples.   Maybe some of them should try talking about it without direct appeals to hatred.    To call for indiscriminate murder of people who happen to be Muslim just because they are Muslim is to be no better than ISIS or other terrorists they claim to oppose.      Sherman wasn't the only one who thought the war was going to be long.  James Longstreet, when he was resigning his US Army post in Texas before joining the Confederate Army was asked how long he thought the coming war was going to last replied "At least three years, and if it holds out for five years you may begin to look for a dictator".    Of course, he also said after the war when somebody asked him was the cause of the war war: "If it wasn't about slavery, then I don't know what else it was about".        I thought they were steroid abusing [basselope's](http://www.cartoonistgroup.com/properties/bloom/art_images/cg4ff61208b9a2c.jpg).    He was purposely added to the mod team to be the French speaking mod.  So, he's simply doing what his fellow mods asked him to do.     And lets the Postal Service of your country know that your moving and they should forward all future mail to Nowhere Land.     I was willing to fight to the bitter end.   But Sky asked me to leave the mod-list.   Not because he disagreed with me, but he wanted the idiots to stop screaming.    I told him giving into the idiots would just make matter worse, and that seems to have been the result.    That said, Sky is a friend of mine and I don't have to always agree with my friends.    Well, a small point of order.... but this god-person did promise in the bible that he wouldn't flood the entire world again.   Which is always why the bible thumpers have always confused me.   If the god-person was to flood the entire world again, he would be making himself a liar.    And asking him to make himself a liar.... doesn't that have to be very, very unholy and evil request for a bible believer?    They are a perplexing people.   They want their god to be evil.     Especially if these people finally leave for Voat.     All gold is Jewish gold.      Thank you for making my point for me.         If I was made aware of that tread back then, I would have remove it.    I think the current mods should remove it now.   I will gladly pass that link along to them for removal.         No, what these people want to use the dead bodies of people who happen to be Europeans who visited Tunisia, a country that everyone agrees is not European, as props in their Hate campaign against Islam and Muslims.   They are using dead bodies like to propagate hatred.     This drama is started by the same people who wanted there to be zero mention of the Winter Olympics in Russia because (they believe) Russia isn't in Europe.     But now they are going to say Tunisia is.    They're just angry *idiots* who like to get angry.      And the the New York Manumission Society, which got slavery banned in New York State..... it was disbanded decades after it successfully got slavery banned in NY State, three years before the publication of *Uncle Tom's Cabin*.    For the record, UTC was published in 1852.   NY State banned new slavery in 1799 and all remaining slaves were freed in 1827.   And the NYMS was disband in 1849.       Oh, and in 1799 there were already fewer than 3000 slaves in NY state anyway.   So, it was a long time fading institution there already.    The whole idea that people didn't know slavery was wrong until after 1852 is just incredibly stupid.   I get that maybe it was some kind of half-life date for popular opinion around 50%+ of the population finally seeing it as a moral and social evil.   But there had been people working against slavery for centuries at that point.     Within that is even a hint that States Rights was bullshit from the git go.  The Southern states in no way respected the Northern states rejection of slavery.   Part of the Southern demands when the war started involved the Northern states being required to make slavery 100% legal all the way to the Northern most tip of Minnesota.     80's music:     * https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1XV5_WagxZg     What we need to do is cross breed Mongols with Germans.   Then we'll produce the unstoppable killing machines. You know, Cylons.     Thing is, the tax issue is just the Slavery issue in disguise.   Because what is the tax on?    Goods that are created primarily via slave labor.    All the alternative issues people try to bring up in relation to the Civil War are always, at the heart of the matter, the slavery issue at their core.  Take slavery away, and those alternate issues all evaporate away in a puff of smoke.    Taxes... on goods produced by slave labor.   Tariff issues, again.... on good produced by slave labor.   States rights..... to own human beings as if they were farm animals.   Straight up, there would have been no US Civil War if it wasn't for the problem of slavery.   Every issue that people bring up as possible alternate causes or contributing favors are themselves the slavery issue in disguise.     It's one of those rare issues in history where the simple uncomplicated answer tells the full story.   Question: What's the cause the US Civil War?  Answer:  Slavery.    To give any other answer is to obfuscate the issue.       [Kill the poor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgpa7wEAz7I) is a better song.

 I would head over to FreeNAS and check that out. A small homemade server running FreeNAS could easily meet all your criteria and would be fairly upgradeable. You'd be looking at about $600-1200 depending on how robust the hardware is.  http://www.freenas.org/ http://blog.brianmoses.net/2014/01/diy-nas-2014-edition.html http://www.reddit.com/r/freenas    WAY lower power and shorter distance, but this was demoed at CES this year and had a working model on display. Nothing in this article is ground breaking.   When was this? If this was at iPad launch, that may have been kind of silly, but if the article was written recently... there are TONS of full PC tablets now. Surface Pro much?   Also, if its 3 years old, and he games on it regularly, there's a good chance that the thermal paste is past its prime. But I agree... even removing that fan and dusting it out would be best.   The "remote" feature is something I used constantly with uTorrent. Any recommendations on a different client that also support a remote functionality? Thanks!   I think it was a great choice. It probably does everything she currently wants it to do, and a huge part of PC building is knowing when and how to upgrade, which she is perfectly setup for. I also think people underestimate current generation "budget" CPU's. There are plenty of videos online of people playing CS:GO and other popular games on Atom tablets with onboard graphics. No, they aren't getting 400FPS, but its more than playable!   Why and/or how?   I agree with you. Depending on your router and ISP speed, wireless should be just fine. Yes, with current technology, Ethernet is fast and more reliable, but at a certain point, you're splitting hairs. Its like complaining that your FPS goes for 350 down to 175... It doesn't make a difference.   There's no way that court fees are going to be cheaper than $60 and he's already stated that he's sure he'll lose. Even if he DID win, suing someone is a HUGE hassle, even if small claims. I'm from the US so this may be different in AU, but from reading through the comments, it doesn't seem that different.  Yea... Sure... I would be awesome to stick it to him and force him to accept responsibility like a real human being, but sometimes its just not worth it :/ Pick your battles, win the war.   This. Cracked screens (non-touch) are one of the cheapest and simplest repairs in most cases. They're generally around $60 USD and the entire procedure will take you maybe 15 minutes. You would only really need a small Philips (1,0, or 00) although a plastic pry tool (spudger, guitar pick, etc) could be useful. I would be happy to try to walk you through it if this is an option you'd be interested in. Feel free to PM me.   I doubt it will have as a profound impact as one might think. From my experience in corporate retail, existing business relationships can be difficult (and even expensive) to breakup, and at the end of the day, money talks. If some Lenovo business parter is still able to undercut the competition on cost, Superfish will take a heavy back seat to purchasing decisions.   Also, the way you or I purchase technology is WAY different than a business. It's not the head IT guy that gets to pick out all the fun new toys (that would be AWESOME). Its generally a meeting with the CFO, some higher up (maybe a CEO/COO/President, etc), and the IT guy just to ask questions. The final choice is almost never up to the person who knows what Superfish is, but rather the guy in charge of financials. It may be far from the best practice, but it's definitely the most common :/  EDIT: Regardless, losing Lenovo as a partner would most certainly be a financial detriment, even if minute, to Microsoft.   Why am I getting downvoted?! Everything in that system could easily support a nice OC :(   Whats REALLY awesome, is once you get your computer setup, updated, and your favorite software installed (Java, Office, Steam, etc) use recimg command to create your OWN recovery image, so if you have to re-install, everything is already there!   What Microsoft did was add a universal way to access the OEM's recovery partition. Previously, you only had the option to use the OEM's software to factory reset your device which could be difficult to use or even find. MS simply added a Reset function on all Windows 8/8.1/10 devices that would access it regardless of the brand.  My speculation on why there isn't a "clean" image re-install option available is two-fold. One, I'm sure there are some legal and business reasons as to why you can't easy circumvent the built in bloatware(think of the Adblock Plus litigation). Second, driver issues could be a huge problem. The factory image already has all the needed drivers available to make everything work perfectly. Windows 8 did an AMAZING job of adding 3rd party drivers to Windows Update which makes OS re-installs much easier than previous versions of Windows, and this is mostly because of a universal network drivers built into the Windows 8 image. This solved the Catch-22 of needing internet to get drivers, but not having a driver to access the internet that Windows 7 (and earlier) had. That being said, if a certain NIC didn't work correctly with the universal driver for some reason, the average consumer would be SOL of getting their device up and running again.  Just my two cents!   I misunderstood, sorry!  Even with this however, MS still cares heavily about their OEM partners. There are only about 7 main PC manufacturers: Dell, HP, Asus, Acer/Gateway, Samsung, Toshiba, and Lenovo. Even if Lenovo doesn't account for 1/7th of all Windows PC sales, it's still a HUGE chunk. You can argue that the demand will still stay the same regardless of how many PC manufacturers there are, but having more (especially a company that has a heavy following in the enterprise market..."Thinkpad") can only really help business.  (I'll presumptively add that I know there are a TON more PC manufacturers)    Nothing extra installed. It's basically a clean version of Windows with some of the manufacturers "good" software still on it, such as programs that actually serve a purpose like recovery programs. Other things like default startup programs are reduced to a minimum from what I've noticed, and I'm sure there are other small things.  http://www.microsoftstore.com/store?SiteID=msusa Locale=en_US Action=ContentTheme pbPage=MicrosoftSignature ThemeID=33363200     Lol, I have to :P   Oh, I completely agree. Just saying doctors do have info on there devices.   Yep, that what "Signature Edition" means.   Unfortunately, the Reset function generally uses the onboard recovery partition which has all the bloatware pre-imaged. A Reset simply takes it back to it's initial out-of-box state which includes the bloatware.  This isn't true 100% of the time, but its generally what happens :/   They care a lot. The average consumer isn't going to consider what Lenovo, HP, or Dell installed as "extras", they just chalk it up to a bad experience with Windows. When the main competition on the consumer end is Apple (who obviously doesn't install bloatware), Microsoft doesn't want to look bad just because someone else messed up their perfectly good OS.   All the PC's sold in a Microsoft Store are "Signature Edition", meaning they are a very clean and optimized OS. If you actually look at the boxes, many have a signature edition sticker over the manufacturer seal, because they were already opened and re-imaged with the "clean" OS.  Disclaimer: I work for Microsoft.   As someone who works in IT, and occasionally with healthcare organizations, you would be very surprised. Many of them have full access to patient info on their personal laptop and apparently some even require it now (this is all hearsay through the doctors I've worked with.)  That being said, there is ludicrous security to access it. The one's I've seen use a secure Citrix logon, and once logged in their, the hospital has ANOTHER verification procedure that calls their personal cellphone with a unique code that is only good for like 30 seconds or something. I've had to troubleshoot some of these systems and the whole process takes like 5-10 minutes.   Although I don't disagree with most of your points, it definitely saves room on the board. You look at the new budget computers that have the processor, RAM, and mmcSSD all soldered and the whole thing is the size of an index card... crazy! Specifically, I've seen 8GB of RAM soldered on a Lenovo board that took up about .75"x1.5" of space on the PCB; any single or double riser DIMM slots are going to be substantially larger.  Think of a tablet. No one has any real expectation of replacing internal components, but after all, it is still a computer. When you try to make laptops as thin as a tablet, the smallest things really add up. That being said, there are many manufacturers and models that are fairly small and have replaceable components, although almost all Pentium, Celeron, and Atom processors are now soldered on the board.    This used to be MUCH more prevalent than it is today. Apple has been getting more competitive with pricing. Nowadays, it seems like its easier to compare extra features that the same price PC has over a similar Mac. For example, if we compare a MacBook Air (i5, 4GB, 128GB) to the comparable Surface Pro 3 w/keyboard. The Surface w/keyboard is only $30 more, but gets you a touchscreen, a digitizer, tablet format, faster processor, etc.    A main reason that new PC's die "faster" is due to large hard drive capacities. I'm guessing your Dell from 8 years ago have an hard drive between 40GB and 120GB. Now, even the cheapest laptops are shipping with 500GB hard drives, that are the same physical size at their 40GB counterparts. Internally, that means extra platters and/or increased data density on the disk. The increased data density and more, smaller moving parts = more hard drive failures. Given that hard drives are the single most common hardware failure, most newer laptops will die due to a larger capacity hard drive than the older, smaller models.  As for the screen resolution, my guess would be that the masses didn't understand what resolution really was or meant in a screen. There are three big advantages to this. One, lower resolution means better performance with the same hardware. Two, They started doing this right when HD (720/768 and 1080) TV's started to become popular. "High Definition" and "1080p" became a popular buzz work and someone is more likely to purchase and HD(768p) and Full HD(1080p) than some random numbers. Lastly, its way cheaper! Resolution and panel type contribute more to cost than physical size. So putting a 1366x768 TN display versus the previous 1920x1200 is substantially cheaper, improves 'performance', and is more in line which what consumers knew.   There are many high end laptops now with QHD (2560x1440), UHD/4K screens now, and almost all but budget laptops come with 1080 screens.    Bluetooth mouse.  Add the tracking setup beneath the camera, pop on a case with Teflon feet, open up the "mouse app", and you're good to go! Volume keys could be used as forward and back keys, and the screen could support multiple profiles with customizable buttons. You could even scroll and receive haptic feedback.   This is sadly true. It makes me so mad.   Are you overclocking that thing at all?! The potential in that system is awesome.   They were/are the unicorns of rigs! They are as amazing and appreciable as a gaming rig, but just different enough and rare enough to cause intrigue.      Yep! It goes into an empty PCI slot. Most motherboards have at least one and it's were soundcards, Ethernet/wifi adapters, and other accessories would go.  The reason why this is even prevalent is because the bottleneck speed in most SSDs isn't in the read/write of the drive itself, but the actual transfer of the data. PCI has a substantially higher transfer speed than SATA, making it ideal. The biggest downside to this is the possible effect on GPU performance under load. With the exception of the new Intel X99 chipset, all the PCI "lanes" were connected, so if you had a graphics card plugged in and a PCI SSD plugged in, the graphics cards throughput goes from x16 to x8. X99 can now run multiple PCI at full x16 speed, which is awesome for Crossfire and SLI setups.   Try these :) http://www.sandisk.com/enterprise/ulltradimm-ssd/   It was probably the wind. It like to build little snow walls next to everything.  	32
 Yeah, I didn't use cassettes as often as VHS. But I definitely had a few cassette tapes. One had a song called "15 Ways to Stay Out of Trouble." It was a fun song.   I got a job as a painfully shy 14-year-old at a pizza restaurant. Don't know why they hired me, I mean, I was 14 and quiet and I was even late to the interview.  My favorite place to work was at the front at the cash register, but after about a month of working I was almost always assigned to the backroom where I would spent 5-7 hours washing dishes. Just fucking terrible. But I was too shy and insecure to ask my manager if I could work the front more. Worked there for about six months before I couldn't take another shift washing their gross food off dishes alone in the backroom and I quit.   I got another job at 16, and then again this year where I learned a lot about being confident in your work, being upfront with your managers, and how to make friends with coworkers. It was truly amazing to see how much I had grown since I got that god awful job when I was 14.   Still waiting for it as an 18 year old....   My dog, if he counts as an item.   	4

Not to mention it would explain his bad attitude because his soft body is painfully squished in his carapace.   Consider though that Decapods shed their shells when they get cramped, but Harold is poor as hell, so I doubt he can afford one. It might also explain why he's so unpleasant because he's cramped in an old, deteriorating shell.   Consider though that Decapods shed their shells when they get cramped, but Harold is poor as hell, so I doubt he can afford one. It might also explain why he's so *unpleasant* because he's cramped in an old, deteriorating shell.   Keep in mind what the world goes through during that time though. All the radiation, introduction of alien bacteria, etc. It's possible that those factors altered his species evolution, and that's only if we apply the understanding of evolution on earth. It could be different on Decapod 10.   The exact quote is, "That stench - that heavenly stench."   That would be awesome. Maybe we need to chant for them like Candyman or Bloody Mary.   Holy shit this hits close to home for me.      http://imgur.com/a/RzU2l   He says "That stench - that heavenly stench."  	46
 It makes for raw street skating tho.

 Dibbs on the Broncos...   Oh yeah, I loved 2K5. It was an amazing game. Obviously Madden 15 has its problems, but it is definitely the best Madden game in years. I guess take that for what it's worth.    Madden 15 is a big step up, at least for me, on the PS4. Madden 25's defensive AI was terrible and I hated every second of it.   I'm in and I'd like to put in my vote for fantasy draft. Makes it far more interesting.   He said that, but a chance to return to your old team with one of the most talented rosters in the NFL is a different ball game.   The fact that it happened so quickly leads me to believe it has to be Kubiak as the #1 choice. I would guess they didn't want him to make a decision before they had a chance to offer.   My favorite was supposedly Walt's favorite. The transformation shot from Cinderella.

 Tomorrowland   Watching it now, just curious to hear other people's opinions of it.    The type of movies that are purely entertainment, you don't have to think it's just for enjoyment.    As a college graduate in art, all I want to do is make movies. I love them so much. How would I go about making it in the film industry? Becoming a director or producer of big budget films? How do people do this?    Noooo   Nooooo   Nooooo   Warcraft    Ex Machina because I feel like there was something everyone took away from it that I didn't quite get. What was it? Help.    Do you feel guilty about it? Is it not a big deal?    I thought it wasn't nearly as gross as the 1st or 2nd one, and was toned down a lot. Obviously still very disgusting. The main character was obnoxious, thoughts?    The village    She's a great actress.    I know there's no possible way to do that, but I'm curious what the texture is like of the rings. Anyone have an idea?    What are they?    Just watched it for the first time last night. All I could think was that it was a dark twisted fairytale with tons of effects. Enjoyed it though, thoughts?    I know John Wick is one of them...what are some others?    Just wondering.    The Relic, Lost in Space, The Devils Advocate   Rachel McAdams    Lord of the Rings   What are the best Stephen King movies or made for TV movies?    Peter Jackson and James Cameron    I think we should decide the rules first but is someone working on that?   And yes promote the subreddit to gain more people and then eventually make someone famous. Idk where we would post it or what we would say but yeah link it to overnightcelebrity.    Why doesn't someone create a post talking about this subreddit detailing what we're planning to do. Then have the subscribers support the post by liking it/commenting it to get an ad out about the subreddit. Just an idea.    Never   Just wondering.   	27
 Why not use the slideshow option and use them all? Personally i like these two maybe even better: [Imgur](http://imgur.com/IpGjISP,u1b5pfS#1)      The red light district in Amsterdam.   It is suchs a sad place to walk around. All these girls behind the windows selling their body's and clearly not wanting to be there. All these fucked up lives.. The place just screams sadness. I always get really uncomfortable when I have to be in that area.   Ahw yiss scorpions @ 3am even better!

       Also, 1900 x 1200   For example, I don't think I could ever pickup a hitchhiker without the fear of being brutally murdered and left for dead on the side of the road. Also, zombies.    Arcade Fire. I've played through Neon Bible and The Suburbs multiple times, and there is only about 4-5 songs I can actually listen through to the end.    Cleveland is not lame.    Defendor. Say what you want about Woody Harrelson, but that movie was really good.    Yes. This movie came out of nowhere. Everyone should watch.   Yes it is.    Good times were had.    Same   /r/darksouls would like this   He broke the #1 rule. **Never** like your own status.    Another IT guy. 27 years old. On my own. I like to think of my self as pretty sociable, but instead of driving back to my hometown to go out this the weekend (which I normally do) I decided to get drunk and play Rockband tonight. That usually turns into playing more and more depressing music as the night wears on and waking up with a hangover tomorrow morning.    Upvote for Enslaved.    I actually thought "The Island" was pretty damn good. Haven't seen it mentioned on here yet.    North Dakota?   As a new subscriber, I think it's hilarious how I read the first two comments joking about this huge debate over the final act, only to then spend the next 30 minutes reading comments from a bunch of people arguing over the final act.   Every time I go to Walmart I always check to see if they put any blu-ray movies on sale.       This. Especially the free drinks. It was weird when I walked into a bar I've been going to for a few weeks and the bartender greeted me by my first name.    I was in the passenger seat of a truck that crashed into a tree going about 60 MPH. I did not have a seat belt on. Face smashed off the windshield, but I survived relatively unharmed with no lasting effects (aside from back pain).  [Picture of Truck](http://i.imgur.com/FsfLe.jpg)    http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/htw48/mass_effect_3_on_wii/  just sayin   I usually take St Route 8-77 without too many issues, but I am leaving around 7-7:30 AM.   I also live in the Valley. Hampton Knoll and Pheasant Run are both pretty good apartment complexes that are prices reasonably.   What the hell. One of my favorite games would be Grandia 2. I thought it had a great story and battle mechanics. I would probably buy (in part) Trials 2 with the MS points.    Also, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly   Correct me if I'm wrong, but if what S_W does is spam, isn't every response that isn't a question (or related to one) spam?   C-C-C-Comment.   I'd pay $15, and let them add more advertisements. Just give me some more 1vs100 action!       It's always good to meet a fellow adopter of HD DVD. Such a shame.    She looks like an average college girl that had a picture taken with a really shitty camera.    First pic kinda looks like a horse with purple wings.    I came to ask about PC specs.   As someone who recently got into a fight 3 three assholes at the Valley for not letting one of them cut me at the pisser, I agree wholeheartedly.    Is it just me or does it look like the first two come from Sherlock? They would be Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty.      I am curious as to how this meeting occurred. Any backstory here?   You must have had the Ice and Fire condoms   I guess I am probably one of the only people on here that doesn't find the Pledge of Allegiance creepy at all, and I think it's kind of ridiculous that it's being compared to Fascism and the Nazis.    More specifically, Youngstown.    Quick question before I try this. What about the glass breaking from being on that light for so long? It's probably going to get pretty hot after a while.    Came in looking for 1920x1200 wallpaper. Leave disappointed. :(   Depending on the day/time, sounds like a good idea.   	45
 There is a big difference between liking a girl and liking her boobs   My dad was a stay-at-home dad, and my husband and I have decided that since I earn over double what he does, that he will be one too.  I have nothing but respect for men who make that sacrifice for their family; challenging gender roles and all that   OoooooOooooOoOoooOooOooOooOOOoOooOOOOOoOoOoOOoOO. Fuck yeah.  Bitch, at least try to make it believable   Phew! Just in time to miss the GOT season!   They really do! I thought my friend's tree had herpes or something when I saw them. Turns out, they are really good and totally don't taste like STD   Hi neighbour!   Dude, read the damn post then post criticism! You're playing with fire here!   Telling girls that the only reason boys pick on them is because they like them.  Wrong.  Boys pick on girls because they like their *reactions*.   Make an elephant head (or other cute animal) and sew it in the middle. Snugglers don't need to be flat!   That one did come up in my searches. That sounds so tasty! Is it like a custard apple?   They are. I had one the other day. They are waxy on the outside which leaves an odd feeling in the mouth, but the crunchiness and juiciness makes up for it. I would liken them to a Nash pear in texture and flavour.       I laughed it off, he laughed it off. We avoided eachother for the rest of the evening...         I just booked my American holiday! We plan to cram as much as we can in 3 weeks, but we organised internal flights everywhere, so hopefully we don't have tok much trouble   http://imgur.com/R8EMU5Z      This makes me wonder...you know when you see those parents chasing a laughing toddler all over the place desperately trying to catch them? I wonder if you would be able to train your child to freeze on command by constantly playing that game where you yell FREEZE! and everyone has to stop in their tracks? They would eventually get used to freezing when you yell and would do it when you are trying to catch them.    For flowers, I would suggest finding someone crafty to make you some if you are into that sort of thing, or even just looking into store-bought bouquets. Some quite pretty little bunches can be bought for under $10 each   "This one has purple in it. Purple's a fruit."   I would just ask for someone to bop me on the head, then wake me up when the morphine kicks in   Well...good for you, I guess   Me too. Also married with a healthy social life.   Gotta keep up appearances though!   Are you sure? You aren't a murderer or anything?   I mean, I've *heard* of them.   Jokes aside, I wish Unidan was here to tell me fun biology facts about what this little guy is doin   Hopefully not to the one of Wendy and Tink...   Sorry :(   Did we expect a fabulous, expensive log cabin to look fabulous and expensive on the inside? Yep   Because human interaction confuses and frightens us   ["Dad? Dad wake up!"](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IeHhr1mq064/VSqJuKTbyCI/AAAAAAAAH68/ooj6znB9lZ8/s1600/Simba%2Bcuddling%2BMustafa.png)   I'm lying in bed right now with my two. They are really confused as to why I just pulled them in for a big bear hug.   My husband was at the Dept of Transport (aka DMV) one day when a car pulled into the carpark, swung into a spot and just kept going. The car hit the concrete barrier, went over it and got jammed up on it. The wheels were off the ground, but the driver still chucked it in reverse and floored it. Funnily enough, nothing happened. The guy got out of his car and husband said he was the tiniest, most feeble old man he had ever seen. He stood there scratching his head for a moment then went inside for help.  It turns out he was there for a renewal.  My husband didn't stick around long enough to see if the guy got it. He valued his life too much.   At the time she probably couldn't tell the difference. Fuck broken ankles   Touche.   But then, if by commenting, someone stops commenting "shitpost" then maybe I will have made a difference and maybe it is worthwhile.  Edit: Also, looking at the votes right now, I would humbly like to point out that people do seem to agree with me   Looking at your history OP, you seem to make a habit of reposting, then complaining that you didn't know it was a repost.  Well, either you are new to this game and have much to learn, or you are a dirty rotten liar.  I am going to go with liar, as you just tried to claim that Reese Lightening was just adopted by you. A lie.  So! I will just pick up my pitchfork here ---E and go stand with the gathering mob   I don't understand why people feel the need to comment "shitpost" on stuff they don't like.   Don't like it? Downvote it.   Just coz you call it a shitpost doesn't make it one, and doesn't mean other people agree with you. In fact, given the amount of upvotes, I would say your opinion is in the minority.   My sister has copped a lot of criticism for piercing her daughters' ears but honestly, if pierced ears are the worst thing she has done to her children, then they will still have had a pretty great childhood.  It bothers me how much people object to it in our society when there are larger issues to deal with. My nieces are happy, healthy and loved; people need to quit telling her she is a bad mother.   Somehow mine managed to come together...even after the celebrant had a heart attack 2 days out, my husband crashed his car a week out and my bmaid of honour forgot the ring in the limo.  Mind you, I was drunk for most of it, so not much could phase me   Well, being both married and a woman...not really the issue :/   Seeing as I am a lady and all my tackle is always in the box.....no, it doesn't   Fair game   I got that constantly this weekend. Most of them hadn't seen me since I was a baby and yet they expected me to cry out with joy at the very sight of them.  "Lady, you could have easily walked in off the street for all I know!"   Now he ded   Example: We were staying at my cousins house who I thought I knew pretty well. Turned out he had a son from a previous relationship that I never knew about and people were pissed he wasn't there.  Also, I met my Uncle's first child fr another marriage...who I never knew existed. He knew me though...   Lol, no...Australia. But hey, our family breeds like rabbits, so.I might have family in Maine I don't know about   Ugh, I always have the same job-related questions. I am one of the few to go to uni so I seem to be some kind of mythical unicorn to them that must be studied   Shame   She wanted to be a merman      I like how it says "Australians" as if we all did it as a collective.  We did it Australia!   I sorta see what you want to get across but wanting to maintain a lifestyle because you enjoy it is not the "definition" of childish.   On the flipside, having children and changing your lifestyle does not make you an adult   I understand that the need to fly with children may arise, but for the love of everyone's sanity, be prepared!   These parents had no toys, no snacks, no medicine, nothing. They spent the whole trip just shushing the kid and trying to reason with him. He looked no older than 2   Yeah, but I got to immediately enjoy the wine in the Airport bar during my stopover, while I watched all the parents sit in the McDonald's chairs getting fries thrown at them.   One day I might want kids, but it is not this day!   What is it based on then?   ...nope   I did tell him to open the box, just not what inside. He knew   ...nope   Mmm maybe, but not on-hand. School was 9years ago now         Nice. I love that song/episode.   This was my art, inspired by it:  http://i.imgur.com/6IiBHFD.jpg   He was my normal teacher. He was really weird though. Several times he would gush over my worst work and then completely miss the point of my best. It wasn't until a year with him that I realised I could argue my case for a better grade and he would usually change his mind. Got mostly A's after that.  But thanks. I did work hard and I was really proud of the subtle (and more obvious) symbolism I had put into it. Ohh well...luckily I never wanted to be an artist   I got Elsa. Blue-eyed, white haired Elsa. I have dark hair and green eyes.  So close.   I have just met you and I love you   *You're* not!   You heartless monster! Pick her up and snuggle her at once!   I am a fence-sitter also...but right now, after sitting through a 2 hour flight with someone's screaming child beside me the whole time, I am definitely on the childfree side of the fence.  It's nice here, we get wine.   I did an art project a lot like this in high school. The topic was Power, so I made a male torso out of metal, wood and clay, a female torso made of tissue paper and lace, and a cross. I made a box with a padlock and put it in the male's chest and hung the key around the cross. Inside the box was a bunch of stuff meant to symbolise the strength of women (pictures, quotes, etc).  It was meant to symbolise that men seemed to have power over women, but only through the power of the church.  I was so proud of my sculpture but my art teacher claimed he didn't "get it" and never even bothered opening the box or trying to understand. I got a C+.  He was Catholic.   My sister has 3 kids and 3 step kids, aged 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9 so visits to her house are....noisy. Everyone either hates eachother and won't shut up or love eachother and won't calm down. I was lucky to just be on holiday with the youngest this week. I don't think I would have survived the hoarde.  But she was pretty vocal alone. Any question you asked her was answered with "No" until she realised what you were asking...and then it was a little whinge for not getting the thing she just said No to   But you *like* apple juice   Thank you. I'm glad not everyone has filth on their minds      He is definitely behind the 8 ball when it comes to IT. Dad often says the only thing he knows about computers is how to pay for them. You should have seen his face when we explained MP3s to him  "You mean I can get all my music on this tiny stick."  "Yes Dad."  "*All* of it?!"      You'd be like a walking philosophy lesson   Getting a tatt, huh?   I also posted a pic of a hermit crab...did you see that? I thought it was pretty cool...   Dad is just the same. He gets so excited when he finds a thing that he searches for...as if is surprises him that the internet would have it.   "But it is a really rare bike!"  "The Internet has everything, Dad."   In his words "Why look at tits on a screen when I can't touch them?!"      I prefer it to be preceeded by "U wan sum..."   I'm on holiday right now and not in reception all the time, so when I finally get some and come on to find all this going down...I was confused to say the least   As a Transplant Scientist, I know all too well the kind of desperation that leads to stuff like this. Unfortunately, I also know all too well that it is very unlikely to work   Somehow he looks real pleased with himself   Sorry for potato         I'm so confused. I am on holiday and just checked in for a minute, as much as my limited reception will allow, only to find WW3 going on on the front page. Might just put my phone down and go snorkelling   I work in a lab that does genetic testing for coeliac. It is now the *most* requested pathology test.  I get so mad every time I see the clinical notes and all they say are: Diarrhea, ?coeliac   Best part of my day! 100% recommend it to every couple. We aren't a super romantic couple but we do have that    My husband and I often fall asleep holding hands. I love it   It was very lovely. It was sugarcane country too, so as the sun was setting we got some nice views of the [cane fires](http://imgur.com/mbERXQF)      I have been married 4 years and with my partner for 3 more before that...always used a condom.  Babies are *not* part of our plans right now. I am on the pill too, but it isn't 100% foolproof      They had an empty cage from another parrot, which came in handy      You are all wrong.  It is a pencil with wheels   K   I know! I just imagine this adorable shamozzle of a line up where everyone is playing chasey and sniffing eachothers' butts   K      Thus making them the only two animals in the Monotreme group   There is one character who sounds like Barry Weiss...that douchecanoe from Storage Fisticuffs or whatever show. I can't unhear it       You need a better bouncy-ball related memory   I really don't think it is misleading. I am saying it is uncommon to hear about female vs female domestic violence.  I guess if people are feeling misled, they coild just read all these comments and know the facts   Geniuses, duh   No, I don't think I will. It is still uncommon in my society to hear about a case like this. Like I said, this was the first I had heard of a case like it...in recent news at least.  These are the kind of stats often quoted:  http://www.aic.gov.au/publications/current%20series/rip/1-10/07.html  There seems to be disagreement with numbers tho. Some say it is mostly male vs female, but others say it is about even   I feel it would be less subtle if they had a guy out front who punches you in the face then gives you a flyer   Sorry, I was not aware of those stats. In our news lately, there has been massive coverage of particularly violent domestic abuse cases (a handful of women have died recently). New measures, task groups, charities and workplace allowances seem to be springing up every day to help. To help *women* escaping their abusive *male* partners. I have not once heard mention of a female being an abuser until this article, which is why it struck me as uncommon.   Aand now you are on a list   I need to get a niece  I sure hope you mean "you need your sibling to make you a niece".  You can't just pick up a kid from the street and call them your niece. There are laws   I wouldn't say genius. More like pure mischief   Maybe   Off the side, to go hurtling 2 storeys down and cause pandemondium as they bounced all over the place below.  He *loves* telling me this story.   Here in Australia recently there has been massive talk about domestic abuse, but when they talk about the offenders they always talk about men. It is definitely portrayed as a Men vs Women issue.   Yeah my bad, I forgot it didn't do it for titles. I just wanted to highlight that it was a woman and she was charged with rape. Not trying to cast aspersions or anything, just an interesting piece of information   I would say so, yes. A lot of anger needed for that      Am a wife, so can say that I think honking is crucial in the success of a marriage.  A honkless marriage is a doomed marriage   And I like you...in a totally creepy way   (   )   My husband's favourite memory of his teens (and one he always brings up when he sees a bouncy ball) is when he went to an arcade and got 100+ of em, went to the top of the carpark and let them loose.    Geez, my husband won't leave me alone! I can't get changed in the mornings or afternoons without him leaping out from behind a wall and honking them.  You need to up your honking game. Make your wife *afraid* to get changed. So much so that she has to look over her shoulder every time she takes off her bra.    He knew his time had come and walked into the afterlife with courage, leaving the ones he loved behind to spare them the heartbreak   Man, that cheerleader puts our school's cheerleaders to such utter shame. Our school didn't have a football team, so we didn't need cheerleaders, but that didn't stop all the chubby uncoordinated year 8 girls from grouping together and doing shitty dances to "Blow My Whistle" in front of the whole school.  Maybe if they had of pulled of these sick moves they wouldn't have been booed so loudly   Do you seriously not know the difference between a metaphor and an insult?!   Buddhism is huge in my hometown, Eudlo. It is a tiny speck of a town but it hosts a massive temple. The Dalai Llama has even visited  http://www.chenrezig.com.au/   I don't understand what not talking about the issue would achieve, except maybe closing the door on any people who might *need* to talk about it.   No shit it's a repost. He is trying to find his friend by making the story as visible as possible in as many subs as possible.  You are an asshat   That depends..are you my husband?

 Youre actually not allowed to have your phone out at all in a courtroom       There isn't always a buyer for every seller, it's why penny stocks are essentially useless, because you may not be able to liquidate them. If someone buys an obscene amount of BTC at once and never sells it then it will limit the supply and make it worth more. If people suddenly start dumping BTC then buyers will have the barter advantage and set a lower market price.    It's because it's not used as a currency. Most gold is used to create jewelry which is not normally reintroduced into the market, essentially removing it from the world supply. If people were regularly walking into stores using their jewelry to pay for things then you would see the value of gold begin to drop.   It's a joke that  guys with overly flashy vehicles are compensating for a small dick.   The supply of stocks in a company is fixed but the value fluctuates, the supply of gold is (theoretically) fixed but the value fluctuates. Think of it this way, (for the sake of simplicity were going to assume that people only sell 1 BTC at a time) you've got X number of people trying to buy BTC and Y number of people trying to sell BTC. As long as X=Y the value of BTC remains the same. If XY the value of BTC increases, if XY the value of BTC decreases.   The problem with almost all of those is that it's incredibly risky to keep any significant sum in Bitcoin for more than a couple days at a time. It doesn't matter if you're able to keep your assets unfrozen if you're potentially going to lose half of it overnight due to some dnm bullshit that's completely unforeseeable.   A 10 year old....   You're glossing over the fact that we dropped leaflets in Hiroshima and Nagasaki beforehand telling the civilians that we were going to drop massive bombs on them and the Japanese told the civilians to stay because "it was just a scare tactic"   Tbh if you're from a country where you're gassing and starving your prisoners and you're given three hots and a cot by your enemy when you're captured you gain a little perspective.   Idk the Nazis did some pretty twisted human experimentation too. For example the twin experiments are pretty terrible. They would seperate a set of twins and keep them in separate cells, then they would inject them with various chemicals and inject dyes into their eyes just to see if they would react the same. They would also sewed together twins to try to turn them into conjoined twins... it was some human centipede type shit. They also used jews as lab rats for testing various desalination methods, experiment nerve and bone transplant surgeries, and to test new forms of medicine and first aid they would infect jews with various lethal diseases and then try different ways to cure them or they would inflict phosphorus burns on them so they could try to treat them.  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation   The same things happen to soldiers. It doesn't matter how much training you have, it can't turn you into a superhuman. There is no way to override the symptoms of an adrenaline dump of that magnitude without tons of real world exposure. To expect police officers, most of whom never draw their weapon in the field during their career, to be able to do something that most experienced soldiers can't even do is ridiculous.    It just means that they were using an outdated utility belt layout. Believe it or not, that is not an indicator of a setup.   I don't know much about schizophrenia but can't most schizophrenics lead relatively normal lives and get jobs as long as they take their meds?   Good man.   Idk it depends on where you live. If you're living anywhere in coastal SoCal or in any large city in the northeast then that salary is distinctly middle class/lower middle class with dependants.   One of my best friends in HS had that problem. His mom made literally the smallest possible amount to not qualify for SNAP with 2 kids and his life was pretty tough. Luckily his grandparents stepped in and decided to send them 200-300 a month, but his life was still pretty basic.   Does he have gov't health insurance/get his schizophrenia meds for free? If not then living on 800 a month and having to pay the copay on those drugs must be a bitch. Honestly I don't even know if that's possible where I live. My rent to share a room in a one bedroom apartment is $600, before utilities.   They should also file personal suits against the author and the accuser (if she can even be called that) for everything they can think of. Turn these people into examples. Aside from the damage this did to the fraternity and the brothers who were wrongly accused, this situation also undermines the credibility of real rape victims. This story is exactly the type of thing that perpetuates rape culture.   He's purposefully writing in an extreme to highlight the absurdity of some people's opinions.   Bullshi. The guy has won a very prestigious award and has a perfect GPA. My guess is that his ACT is perfect and his SAT is perfect  or near perfect. Him being black doesn't negate his accomplishments, and absolutely no amount of affirmative action influence is going to get you into every single Ivy school. If you can get into harvard or yale you can get into any school in the country, that's the truth.   Everyone should eventually have a LinkedIn. Best to start now so that you can begin gathering connections.    Snakes (and reptiles in general) do not bond to their owners.  Why is that? It seems like we can bond with most other species (with varying degrees of success, but still). What makes reptiles different?   No he ran for the same reason that teenagers have been running from police for decades. He didn't want his parents to find out. I highly doubt that a dialogue about corruption and injustice was running through his head.   Well we wouldn't want him donning a lab coat because it would hide his physique. We better get him a mesh tank top.   Polyurethane    btw you might want to look into an alternative type of condom as lamb skins do not block STDs. Lifestyles SKYNs are made of polyurethane.   /r/mdma seems to have it together. as does /r/nootropics   As the title says I was an unpaid employee at my high school's school store. Duties included cash handling, marketing, and sales. I'm only in college so my experience level is low so I want to add this to my profile but I don't know where.  edit: *unpaid - I've been travelling all day my brain is mush.   justin verlander   They need to have their lowest donation set at like $5 or $10. $22 is more than most like to donate to charities so they really set themselves up for failure.   Haha   They could always change the name but yeah it sucks for them.   The afghanistan war cost 4-6 trillion. That's .01% of the lowest estimated cost. It's a rounding error.   Lots of people observe and audit lecture classes. The value of a school like Stanford is in A) the diploma and B) the upper division courses which are not usually lectures. An intro class at Stanford is going to be similar to an intro class at ASU.    We're talking about family income though - the parents salaries combined. 125k is 62.5k + 62.5k, or two incredibly average salaries. Six figures is a lot for a single person in their 20s, or even two people in their 20s, but it's not a lot for a family.   How likely are they to fill up soon? I cant submit my application until I finish up this term in may because I'm short a few credits.    Weigh in course difficulty, extra curriculars, and standardized test scores is probably what I would do.   Are they more likely to match me with another sophomore? My biggest thing with the dorms is that my roommate this year is a nightmare so I'm not really feeling another double.    I'm an incoming second year from out of state and I don't know anybody. Not really trying to live in the dorms. Are there any apartments that do roommate matching? Also what area would be best to live in? I like being close to restaurants and things and I don't want to live in a social dead zone.   What's with all the that 70s show references lately? I've been seeing them everywhere.   I've gathered that he's an anime fan and engineering or geology student   Conferences, summits, that type of stuff.    Hydroponics grown in zero grav... then smoked in zero grav o.0   No its not. That's why they receive medals for going above and beyond the call of duty. They're not firefighters. It pains me to know that you are probably at or nearing voting age.   They're not all wise martial arts masters that take pleasure in teaching children life lessons? Because that is what I have been led to believe about elderly Asian people.   Didn't the navy or air force create TOR? How can somebody else be able to blacklist?   You guys are assholes with your voting   Adderall is a mixture of levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine, meth is... methamphetamine. The difference between them is that methamphetamine binds to one more protein than l-amphetamine and d-amphetamine and that extra protein makes meth directly neurotoxic at any dose whereas adderall is not neurotoxic at approved clinical doses.   Yo get a nice dog that you can sleep with while your fam is gone. My lab is the only thing that got me through my depression.   By that scale UCSB girls still win lol. Yeah they party (maybe a bit too hard) but UCSB is an extremely good school. We're talking some 4.0 unweighted GPA, 2000+ SAT, 36% acceptance rate type shit. These girls aren't getting in on their looks alone. So, to recap, theyre hot af, smart af, and fun af.    Here's a video of [a party at UW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceE2ETeqecc). The girls are cute. I'd say mostly solid 7s but not 8-11s lol.   For comparison here's a video of [a party at UC Santa Barbara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMPP-FrAx0k) [Hella NSFW]. UCSB is putting up hotter girls breh   My sense is that most people that are involved enough in the satanic church (or any religion) that they would do something like that don't own a business that is big enough to matter.    No, accreditation is just a baseline. Universities here in California usually audit classes at community colleges to determine if they should accept them. [Here's the course list for SBCC](https://bannerportal.sbcc.edu/pls/prod/pw_pub_sched.p_search) (#1 CC in the US) if you click the CRN # for a course it will tell you if it's transferable to a UC or CSU. Most aren't transferable to UC schools even if they transfer to a CSU.   Well that's true of really any CC. There are very few career fields nowadays where an associates will actually get you a job. Almost every entry level position with potential for lateral movement lists bachelor or higher as a req.   In state at a UC school is like 10k a year before other expenses. It ends up being around 30k with everything factored in.   "Aren't all that respected" lol they're absolutely useless for white collar jobs. No hiring manager is going to hire someone with a finance/accounting/cs/engineering/whatever degree from U of P when they've got kids coming out of schools like UCLA or NYU that are desperate for jobs.   I'm paying 32k in tuition  (before other expenses) to attend a UC school as an out of state student. My parents make 200k combined with one other kid in high school. I get no assistance. Even though my parents fot the bill for upper middle class, my tuition is a significant burden on them. The American higher education system is fucked up. The sticker price for my degree will be $200k.   But you can't look at college athletes as a whole because unless they're delusional, nobody is tossing their eggs in the pro sports bucket unless they're a starter on a top division 1 team. For most people that do college sports they're doing it because they love their sport and they'll probably get a scholarship.   Most sports programs, even successful div one football programs do not make the university any money. Most schools that aren't in the top 10-15 for football revenue are either losing money or bringing in less than 5m a year.  http://sports.usatoday.com/ncaa/finances   It's  ok op I 3 your posts   Jesus christ she was 27 in 1915. Imagine how amazing it would be to be born in a world where most people had never seen a car or a telephone or even a light bulb, and then die ib a world where self driving cars are being invented and people can access the internet from their cell phones.   Some of the people on here have some serious misconceptions about the south   So what's the best way to store my board in my checked bag so that the TSA and the baggage handlers don't fuck it up? Heading home for spring break later this week and would like to bring my board.   This season suuuuuuckeeeed    Bruh the 80s ended 25 years ago. Listen to the classics not a weird ass modern reincarnation of an 80s funk band.   I chose songs from auto tuned albums (although did you listen to Never Let Me Down?)but he has plenty of non auto tune as well. Ex: [The Joy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI0KVUwgE_E), [Through the Wire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QrJK5owl8PU) (He recorded that with his mouth wired shut after a near fatal car accident), and [Gone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oc65hFCls8E)   Because he's innovative. He's a rapper but he makes so much more. I mean, take [Street Lights](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnTFdZSVyO4) for example. What is that? It's not rap, it's not rock, it's not pop, it doesn't really fit into any conventional genre. Same with [Lost in the World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyQpQhrQ5Zs) (NSFW album cover), yeah it's got rap in it but it's not really a rap song. He's also the only artist that has been able to completely change their style for every album and still be successful. Listen to the polarity between [Never Let Me Down from The College Dropout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgtZHXEmvFQ), [Welcome to Heartbreak from 808s and Heartbreak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaSopljm410), [Stronger from Graduation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsO6ZnUZI0g), and [Send it Up from Yeezus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xbLkHhxK-lk). He has an innate ability to successfully change his style and still make good music. When most artists try to change their style they royally fuck up and lose fans.   After "fighting" the munchies a few times I don't get them when I smoke, but whenever I eat after smoking it sort of resets everything and I get the munchies after I smoke. It's kinda weird.   That's  Dr thugmoney to you   Dude you're really young to be messing with this type of stuff. Hold off, enjoy childhood and young adulthood, and then start messing with things again when your brain has less developing to do.    Get a test kit from dance safe   Thanks. I'm just wrapping up my freshman year now, second half of the second semester at my school. I got B's and B+s last semester and it looks like I'll be getting a couple A's and a couple B's this semester. My fear is that I'm not sure I'm going to pass the math class I'm in and it's worth 5 credits. Am I basically fucked for getting into Kelley if I don't pass? I switched it to P/NP grading but I'm still not 100% sure I can pass. I'm taking 18 credits so I'm hoping that they'll take that into account while considering me.   Ayyyy thanks, yeah skateboards. So my cousin is 11 and I'd really like to avoid taking him to a smoke shop so is there another place you can recommend? Or is the smoke shop portion seperated from the skate shop?   I've been eyeing the finance mahor at Kelley as well as the economic consulting major. How difficult is it to gain admittance? I've also been looking at the investment banking workshop and seminar, how difficult are those to  get into? Thanks guys.   I've heard it can make it feel speedy. The main thing is that Wellbutrin lowers your seizure threshold as do amphetamines, so the combination can give you a seizure in medium to high doses of both.   Visiting my cousin pretty soon and I'm supposed to help him pick a longboard. Would rather keep it local than go to muirskate.   How does MDMA and Wellbutrin interact? I'm on Wellbutrin currently and I've been told to avoid MDMA because it will just feel speedy and I won't actually roll.   There are a few non-SSRIs anti-depressants that fuck with mdma too. Wellbutrin being a prime example.   When did we decide as a society that an adults life is more important than that of a child?  We didn't. But an innocent adult shouldn't have to die because a kid stole his parent's gun and decided to take it to the park. I agree that shooting a child should be the absolute last resort but you can't honestly blame a cop for doing it if the kid starts waving a gun in their direction.   if the genders in this case were swapped the sentence would have been the same or longer  Idk about that. Granted this is just for New Jersey but the longest sentence a male teacher has gotten in NJ history is 10 years, 7 for a female teacher.  http://gothamist.com/2013/04/29/male_teachers_get_longer_sentences.php  Also it couldn't have been longer because 15 years is the maximum sentence in a case like this.   For real. I've taken like 20mg at once and never experienced a lucid dream.   Yeah but Salvia is so.... salvia-ey.....   I hope the idiot that keeps slashing their budget gets fired    I don't even use DNMs and I've heard of evo haha   As long as we're speaking of modafinil, I noticed that modafinilcat was added to the reliable vendors list so I went and checked out /r/modafinilcat. For the most part everything seemed like it was on the up and up but I noticed a bit of astroturfing. Since their web design is kind of reminiscent of modup's I thought it seemed kinda fishy.  Specifically these posts (note the OP's post history):  http://www.reddit.com/r/ModafinilCat/comments/2zf682/modafinilcat_is_the_real_deal_18_days_from_order/  http://www.reddit.com/r/ModafinilCat/comments/2yt1zu/8_days_to_australia/  http://www.reddit.com/r/ModafinilCat/comments/2yp9l1/9_days_to_nyc/   Haha you weren't kidding   The problem is that LE in the southern states has a history of sweeping this stuff under the rug. It is better for the FBI to just handle it than for the law enforcement in Mississippi to rule it a suicide and tamper with the evidence.   As of now, none. But if it wasn't suicide then he was hanged and when a black man is hanged in the south it is very reminiscent of a lynching   From the original wiki:  On October 28, 2009 President Obama signed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, attached to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010, which expanded existing United States federal hate crime law to apply to crimes motivated by a victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability, and dropped the prerequisite that the victim be engaging in a federally protected activity.   If he didn't commit suicide he was murdered. If it was in fact a murder, the method in combination with it taking place in Mississippi is very reminiscent of a lynching. Local law enforcement in southern states has a long history of ruling racially motivated killings as suicide. It's just better for the FBI to make the determination of whether this is a suicide because they're not likely to sweep a lynching under the rug.   That act removed the prerequisite that the victim had to be engaging in a federally protected activity at the time of their death for the feds to get involved.   And that is precisely why the FBI is handling this investigation    Casinos don't really dispense this type of justice nowadays. He'd just be blackballed if he was caught card counting.   what's the grounds for federal jurisdiction of any kind?  [The civil rights act of 1964](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_crime_laws_in_the_United_States)  Although state laws vary, current statutes permit federal prosecution of hate crimes committed on the basis of a person's protected characteristics of **race**, religion, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, and disability.  Considering the geographic location of Mississipi and its history of racism if this isn't a suicide then it's a hate crime. Local law enforcement agencies in southern states do not have a good reputation when it comes to investigating and prosecuting hate crimes so it's best that the FBI handles the entirety of the case.     No they shouldn't. This is perfectly legal. The civil rights act of 1964 gave the FBI authority to investigate any racially motivated crime against anyone attempting to perform one of six federally protected activities. A 2009 amendment signed into law by Obama removed the prerequisite that the victim had to be engaging in a federally protected activity for the FBI to get involved. Considering the culture of a place like Mississippi it is better for the FBI to be on scene from the get go before evidence is tampered with.   What'd your doctor prescribe it for?   I'm assuming this is not legally possible but it'd be amazing if you could test modafinil samples from various vendors    What's the song playing in the background when frank and dee walk into the apartment in the beginning?   The problem with that is that there's no way to reliably account for something like that. You can say X% of companies go under due to fraud or other out of market forces but there's no way to say which companies will do that. From an investing standpoint the chances that you'll pick a fraudulent blue chip company are too low to justify the lowered rates of ROI from diversifying beyond 25-30 stocks. It's not possible to invest with meaningful returns without risk. obviously there's no reason to start spending significant amounts of money buying up penny stocks, but within reason higher risk=higher potential returns.   but there comes a point when adding more stocks to your portfolio ceases to make a difference. There is a debate over how many stocks are needed to reduce risk while maintaining a high return. The most conventional view argues that an investor can achieve optimal diversification with only 15 to 20 stocks spread across various industries.  http://www.investopedia.com/articles/02/111502.asp   August Busch the 4th. He was handed the CEO-ship of Anheuser-Busch and arguably ran the company into the ground.  He wasnt just "handed" the company. He had worked in various positions for nearly 20 years (1989-2006) before he was selected by the then president (who was not a member of the busch family) to be his successor. Your idea that he ran the business into the ground is a bit odd. Yes, he was unable to hold onto the business but he sold it for $20/share above wjat the record highest share value of the company was, so it's not like he lost his family or shareholders any money. If anything they turned a significant profit.  Ivy level education:   Cheating is prevalent at any university, whether it's through the use of amphetamines or through collaboration on take home exams. Grade inflation is an interesting topic when you're talking anout Ivy schools and it certainly needs to be addressed, but the fact remains that even getting into an Ivy school is a feat of it's own. Nobody going to harvard can be called lazy or stupid.   MBA programs:   If you're not attending a top 15 MBA program then you shouldnt be paying for an MBA program. Every top ranked MBA program (with the exception of harvard iirc) requires that you have at least 4 years of experience prior to enrollment. Eneolling in any old MBA program because  "that's just what you do" isnt going to help you. The type of people that can get into a good MBA program are destined to be execs of large companies, so attending a program like that essentially gives them 5-10 years of experience worth of management knowledge in 3-4 years. It also lets you network with other future execs. Any old MBA program won't do that for you.   Holding individual stocks is more akin to gambling than investing  Not really. If you have 16 blue chip stocks in various unrelated industries then safety wise your portfolio is as diverse as one that has 50 stocks.   Mdma is a weird drug. It's not a stimulant in the same sense that coke and other amphetamines are stimulants. If you're taking real MDMA and you're not taking anything that'll interact with it then it shouldn't feel speedy or edgy or anything like that. You start out feeling a rush but then that sort of goes away and you start "peaking" which makes you feel euphoric and happy. The come down can be kind of rough but that can be mitigated with various vitamins and supplement. A lot of people get an "after glow" ranging from a few days to a few weeks that can make you feel happier and more empathetic.   The problem with a test kit is that it's not a mass spec. It just tells you what the majority chemical in the substance is so it could've been 50%mdma 25%mda 25%meth. Along the same lines, the most dangerous adulterant in mdma is PMA which has no reaction so you could've taken MDA MDMA OR MDE and PMA.   He'll always be the weird yin yang guy from psych to me   I feel like a lot of people that make comments like the on you're replying to are forgetting that police officers have unions. That alone makes it an astronomical task to fire a bad officer without incredibly solid evidence.   It's weird because he's good enough on modern family that even though I watch both shows pretty regularly I can never picture him playing the other role until I switch over and I'm like ohhhh right   At that level nothing is just handed to you. Yes, some of them may have inherited the job but they still needed to complete an Ivy level education and most likely make it through a decent MBA program. Their dad wouldn't have given them the position if they were a failure. If you're unaware of what exactly a fortune 500 company is, it's a top 500 performing *public or closely held corporation*. No stock broker worth their salt is going to keep their clients money in the stock of a company that just made a coked out retard the CEO. And nobody with stock in a closely held corporation is going to let a coked out retard become the CEO. Blaming nepotism or cronyism for your own professional inadequacies is a cop out. Nobody is going to hire you for being average. If you want to work in the world of high level corporate america then you can't just sit on your ass through college, you need to get a kick ass GPA so you look good to recruiters, and you need to befriend as many people as possible because when you're talking about positions that can make or break a company people hire people that they know and can trust, not just people that look good on paper.  Edit: Yes, down vote me because  I'm not going to pat you on the back and say the only reason they're ahead of you in life is because they cheated.   Do you care if they look bunched around the waist area? If not then get whatever you think will fit your legs and tighten the shit out of the draw string   And all women are cheating backstabbers?   It's called networking. Joining a frat is a great way to get a nice network with minimum effort. Do you think the 15% of fortune 500 execs that aren't greek just sat around and played video games with some burnouts in college or do you think they went out most weekends and befriended a large group of people?   Maybe they'd all be snipped before heading up there.   So what you're saying is that there have only been two accidents since 1990 and none since 2003?   Nah I got the SC because my friend offered me a pretty good price for the LY and I needed something smaller, not because I just wanted something different. I'll be taking the tugboat off my flair as soon as his paycheck comes in    bearings swapped out?  Yep haha I'm coming off of 8 hours of studying for finals so I'm a bit fried. Yeah it might be because the only board I've ever ridden is the tugboat that I think the sc is super carvy   It's the whole set up. Bullet B137 trucks, road rider 68mm 78a wheels, and I want to say a 1/4" riser pad. I definitely prefer the santa cruz. It's way more carvey. My biggest quam with the tugboat is that the kicktail takes up like a quarter of board so if you want to shift your weight during a long ride you need to be sure your foot isn't behind the rear truck. I will say that the trucks that came with the SC weren't that great and I switched them out for some reds.   How do you guys feel about Santa Cruz boards? I got a land shark about a week ago and I love it. Kind of curious why I never see it recommended (as opposed to the Dinghy which seems to be the go to) here when people are asking for a small commuter board?   She's a cheap knockoff of nicki minaj   Chronysim are a huge part of life. Lose that lottery and you're screwed.  *Cronyism isn't part of some lottery. Networking is just as important as school itself. If you're running some fortune 500 company are you going to hire the guy that looks slightly better on paper or are you going to hire the guy that looks good on paper AND that you know personally and can trust? People like you are part of the problem in this country. You didn't get ahead because you didn't play the game and now you're complaining that life is unfair because you weren't automatically rewarded for being average.   There are also plans to reopen the desalination plant in Santa Barbara County.   I've been to Hawaii a few times. You can get around the perimeter of the islands via bus usually but if you want to go anywhere specific you'll need a car. A good deal of Hawaii is still jungle so they don't really need to send buses everywhere. That said, I don't believe that there's any island-island public transpo so save some cash for a ferry if you think you'll want to go to other islands.   I didn't know that was saul until you just said it was saul. Guess I wasn't paying attention.   Nooooo   I recently got a Santa Cruz land shark and I reaaaallyyyy like it. They're 120 off of tactic. Super carvy and super smooth. Not much of a kicktail though. I want to say that they're 278.7 and they weigh in around 6.5lbs.    It's funny just let it be you douche   That's because people who say shit like /r/hailcorporate or /r/thathappened are annoying as fuck.    24 bruh. he hadn't had food for 24 hours.   The finale could end with walt and jesse showing up for the first time I guess, but that's the only thing I can think of.   Eh it's not even worth it. You need a LOT of this stuff to make even one shot of vodka. Like each packet is equivalent to a single shot.   God I hope she doesn't win though. Like real talk, if the US feels that it needs a woman president so bad that it won't take anyone else can we at least get someone besides her to do it?    Now you need to decide if you're going to leverage this information   I think it does work like that in Russia, not quite sure though, but in the US iirc the president, vice president, and base commander all have to input their launch keys simultaneously.   Because in sports betting you don't bet on the team just winning, you bet on the spread. So if the odds are 3:1 or whatever that the team will either lose or win with a 7 point spread then it would benefit him more to keep his team from winning by more than 7 points than actually just winning all out.    In a group yes, in singularity, much less so. People like Putin and Obama get to their positions because they are smart. No matter how corrupt they get, and how many terrible decisions they make, they are smart enough to know not to push the big red button.   No you can tell because the cop is dressed like a school crossing guard   Well the jacket ways "policia" so this was probably in central/south America, so A) I doubt there are many meth labs around to bust, and B) If it is a commercial grow op then it's probably tied to a cartel.   I don't think a lot of people living in LA actually realize they're living in a desert.      Ninkasi or die   Yeah here they just require that you have an offsite advisor  that's an alumni of the organization. Usually it's just a random brother that's sticking around for a year after graduation.   Every sorority does, that's for sure. But none of the frats my friends are in have one. (Alpha Tau, Beta theta, Sigma nu)   It depends. Only one of the frats on my campus has any sort of help. The rest of them allocate cooking and cleaning among the brothers.   What kind of frat has a house mother? No wonder these guys are assholes. They were probably babied their whole life.   I think what's suspicious for a lot of people is that two different SAE chapters that are a decent distance apart have been reported using the same chant. If it was two racist chapters using separate chants it wouldn't be as big a deal, but somebody from SAE nationals is teaching them this chant.   And sprite refers to sipping on that lean   He's not talking about mixing it with booze haha   Nobody I just couldn't think of another way to phonetically differentiate   So a chemist would pronounce it as un-ion-ized. Because in that context they're talking about ions. A plumber would pronounced it as you-neon-ized because they'd  be talking about a workers union.   Thank you!   I'm trying to figure out if I can cut it in half. Drugs.com says that it's 10mg of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine manufactured by aurolife pharma   What I want to know is how they find stuff like this? I mean you'd think someone wouldve thrown it away before an investigator came across it and decided it was worth looking into   ;)   So over the course of my first year of college I've lost about 50 pounds which is amazing! What's even better is that the cute girls have started talking to me! However, while I've downsized my entire wardrobe I haven't bought new boxers because a lot of them still fit due to the elastic waistband. Well last thursday I was in a rush to get to class so I grabbed a random pair of boxers and threw on a pair of shorts and ran out the door. Now, this is key, my dorm is far enough from the main campus that people either ride bikes or take the bus to class. I decided to take the bus on this particular day. I take my seat and at the next stop a 10/10 sorority girl (Alpha Phi, yeah, this is serious business) sits down next to me. I mustered up some courage and decided to start talking to her. Surprisingly enough we hit it off and by the time we get to campus I'm making her laugh. Now this is wear the fuck up happens. When I sat down on the bus my boxers must have slid below my belt because the moment I step off the bus I feel them start slipping. What's even worse is that it turns out this girl is in the lecture I'm going to and we've still got a half a mile to walk. We walk a bit further and these things are going. I'm doing my best to hold on to them through my pocket without looking awkward as hell but it's not going well. We walk a bit further and that's when it happens, I lose control and now my boxers are just resting on the crotch of my shorts. I look down and you can see them hanging through the leg holes of my shorts. I look like some retarded gangster that's doing a reverse sag look. At this point I'm just praying this girl doesn't look down.   This is when I luck out, I see a couple of my friends a ways away and I text both of them "911 need wingman asap." Now these guys are pros, they start walking over without hesitation, and when they get close enought see her aphi shirt they know that this isn't some joke. I gestured at my shorts and they leapt into action. They say what's up to me and introduce themselves to her and then distract her for just long enough for me to step behind her and reach into my pants and pull my boxers up. Now, to anyone else in the area this probably looked weird as fuck, but again this girl IS A MOTHER FUCKING ALPHA PHI, and desperation measures needed to be taken. I mean you show me a campus where aphis aren't the hottest girls. The wingman intervention was a successful and I sat next to her all through the lecture and I've got plans to hang out with her and some of her sisters this weekend.   **TL;DR** boxers fell down so far they were visibly below my shorts while I was talking to a hot as fuck girl, friends intervened with a distraction, and I successfully fixed boxers and got girls number.   I'm partial to the bobby vena remix but to each their own   C'mon dude... I know that we're very liberal about drug use on /r/drugs (go figure,right?) but don't say it's no big deal when you're talking about heroin. Heroin is a very big deal and you need to be very sure about your self control to even consider trying it.   Due to the location of my university I'm friends with a lot of kids from rich areas of Los Angeles. I know for a fact that most of them get their coke and molly in person from dealers. The difference between their dealers and dealers in the poorer neighborhoods is that their dealer is only once or twice removed from the trafficker. Whereas in the poorer neighborhoods the coke may have gone through 10 different dealers before it reaches the street level dealer.   snoo is my guess   I feel you but at the same time there is a line. Take my roommate for example. He's on his PC from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to bed with a small break for school. He neglects taking care of himself, he showers maybe once every week or two, and he hasn't socialized with anyone irl besides me and the friends I bring home since the beginning of the school year. His only form of social interaction is when he's playing steam with his friends from high school. In some ways he's worse than a functional alcoholic. His mouse broke about a month ago and he literally went through withdrawals while he was waiting for a new one. And yet in his twisted little mind he thinks that what he's doing is morally superior and healthier than me going out and getting fucked up with my friends every weekend.  Yes you should respect other people's lifestyles, but at the same time denying that there's such a thing as too much computer time is wrong too.    Is that legal? Doesn't Oklahoma have any laws regarding eviction notice periods?   Well no but they try to rush an amount that wouldn't lead to competition to live in the house. So enough that youve got a sizeable pledge class, but not so many that even if 20% of each class decides to live out you have to raffle out rooms. If you're rushing 20 pledges twice a year and you've only got 25 bedrooms you're going to have issues, even if you have a senior house.    SAE has the most actives. Among other frats they're generally considered a joke because they rush way too many people to live in the house so their sense of brotherhood is diminished.   I'm not sure I believe you.... when a frat loses their chapter they're allowed to stay in the house through the end of the school year. Unless when you say moving their stuff out you mean removing the letters from the house.   I've got a skatetool but I somehow lost the screwdriver that came with it :/   I don't have a screw driver with me in my dorm   Does anyone know if boards from Tactics come assembled?  	165

Once you're actually good at it and can pull off the various moves easily, it becomes quite the cinematic experience and more fun. Plus shooting people from a distance in slow-mo never gets tired. Have fun!    I love this Harold Bloom quote about it:  "The first time I read Blood Meridian, I was so appalled that while I was held, I gave up after about 60 pages. I dont think I was feeling very well then anyway; my health was going through a bad time, and it was more than I could take. But it intrigued me, because there was no question about the quality of the writing, which is stunning. So I went back a second time, and I got, I dont remember 140, 150 pages, and then, I think it was the Judge who got me. He was beginning to give me nightmares just as he gives the kid nightmares."     That book is a joy compared to Blood Meridian.   Say what you want about Lennox Lewis, the man was a great champion. He may not have been the most exciting fighter but he was patient, fought his way to the top, put up with a lot of shit and when he finally got his chance, cleared up the Heavyweight division.

War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent. Even when weapons of war are not actually destroyed, their manufacture is still a convenient way of expending labour power without producing anything that can be consumed. A Floating Fortress, for example, has locked up in it the labour that would build several hundred cargo-ships. Ultimately it is scrapped as obsolete, never having brought any material benefit to anybody, and with further enormous labours another Floating Fortress is built. In principle the war effort is always so planned as to eat up any surplus that might exist after meeting the bare needs of the population."*   Here's  a documentary about his atrocities:  [White King, Red Rubber, Black Death](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUZLtkLA0VE)   I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream!

Antihostile's Law: Orwell is always right.    Hilarious...that's exactly what I started doing. First season was kind of underwhelming to be honest, but the second season has been really good so far.    I think it was something to do with the simplicity of the story: get to the space hospital to cure the radiation. Not exactly the most compelling story. I have to care about the guy in the first place. But I did love the fact that he got beaten by the robot cops and worked in the robot cop factory. That was pretty funny.

I wanna see knife cuttin', slice cuttin' choppin' and blowin' up. Hah-aaah yeah. That's right. A free fuckin' weapons give away program. I see it. Gonna solve all these goddamn problems."   One hell of a slow burner. Just watch it.    I bet Rob Ford knows Trevor.    Been asking myself the same question. Is it because he's a G-Man and shit would really hit the fan if he turned up dead or disappeared? If Nucky finds out, and I think he will, he's definitely dead.    I tell you whut.    Jeff Bridges played Cogburn in the Cohen bros. remake. It's as though he could be related to the Dude in that movie universe. The way this old guy in BE could be related to Butchie in The Wire. I think that's what he means. It's not a great analogy.    I bet a couple more are gonna show up. An army of [field negroes](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znQe9nUKzvQ) taking out the ultimate house negro, Dr. Narcisse.   I love it, it's one of my favorite books, mainly because it's so damn funny. It is absolutely hilarious. There's pretty much a laugh-out-loud moment on almost every page. Very, very funny book.       aka ["You come at the king, you best not miss."](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-lrftLQaQ)   Garrison was a nutjob. Watch [Oswald's Ghost](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/oswald/). Garrison was certifiable and the majority of his "evidence" was useless conjecture. So Clay worked with the CIA? So what? The Kennedy Assassination is a million pieces of string that go nowhere. Fifty years later, still no hard evidence, just "Clay worked with the CIA" or "Oswald went to Russia." Yes, yes, but so what? Now that we know that, what do we know? As for the HSCA, here's an excerpt from an excellent [interview with Gerald Posner](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/oswald/interviews/posner.html):  **Q: Can you explain what the House Select Committee on Assassinations (1978-79) found out in the acoustic evidence, and what happened afterward concerning the issue of the reliability of the evidence?**  *A: "The House Select Committee on Assassinations used sound experts to listen to a Dallas police Dictabelt. They concluded with a 95 percent certainty that there was a fourth shot fired at Dealey Plaza, and it came from the grassy knoll. The National Academy of Sciences reviewed their work and found a multitude of errors and omissions. The most serious of which was that at the time that the Select Committee experts thought the shots were, [it] actually, [was] one minute after the assassination had actually taken place. Dealey Plaza is a veritable echo chamber, and it makes it very difficult sometimes to analyze the acoustic testimony. However, by looking at the statements of a witness who gave an opinion as to the source of the shots, we can see certain trends. Eighty-eight percent of the 179 witnesses who expressed an opinion said there were three shots and three shots only. The largest group that identified a location, 28 percent, said they came from the book depository. Only four witnesses, 2 percent of all the witnesses at Dealey, heard shots coming from more than one location."*   Check out the whole interview, it's quite good. And really, Oswald's Ghost is excellent as well.    Americans love their conspiracy theories, but I have to say, Oswald did it. After fifty years there is no hard evidence of a conspiracy to kill JFK, but a mountain of evidence that says Oswald acted alone.    It's right on the first page of his letter.    Exactly what it's supposed to do:  The essential act of war is destruction, not necessarily of human lives, but of the products of human labour. War is a way of shattering to pieces, or pouring into the stratosphere, or sinking in the depths of the sea, materials which might otherwise be used to make the masses too comfortable, and hence, in the long run, too intelligent.        Seems like a lot of people have trouble getting into it the first time, including [Harold Bloom](http://www.avclub.com/articles/harold-bloom-on-blood-meridian,29214/):  "The first time I read Blood Meridian, I was so appalled that while I was held, I gave up after about 60 pages. I dont think I was feeling very well then anyway; my health was going through a bad time, and it was more than I could take. But it intrigued me, because there was no question about the quality of the writing, which is stunning. So I went back a second time, and I got, I dont remember 140, 150 pages, and then, I think it was the Judge who got me. He was beginning to give me nightmares just as he gives the kid nightmares. And then the third time, it went off like a shot. I went straight through it and was exhilarated. I said, My God! This reminds me of Thomas Pynchon at his best, or Nathanael West. It was the greatest single book since Faulkners As I Lay Dying. In fact, I taught it for several years in a class I gave here at Yaleinterestingly enough, in a sequence starting with Faulkners As I Lay Dying, moving on to Miss Lonelyhearts, then The Crying of Lot 49, and the fourth in the sequence was Blood Meridian."   IMHO, one of the greatest speeches of the twentieth century, rivals anything by MLK, JFK, Gandhi or Churchill. A truly powerful moment.       The Autobiography of Malcolm X.    Not innately, but if that's the goal, it's a step in the right direction.    Well, my online activity is pretty transparent, so it wouldn't bother me that much, but in this case, I'm using a separate youtube account which is linked to my G+ account, it works for me, and I'm seeing a lot more activity recently which has worked for me.       Love it. Increase G+ adoption in a real way and start cleaning up youtube comments at the same time. Good idea.    I've been looking into the Kennedy Assassination for over a year now. In my mind, there's simply no doubt that Oswald did it. Fifty years after the assassination there is absolutely no hard evidence of a conspiracy whatsoever. But there is a mountain of evidence against Oswald.

Now that he's mixed up with gangsters, he's going to have some serious problems. I think they're foreshadowing it with Willy staying in Eddie's room. Now, with the Feds on Eli, Willy is directly mixed up in everything. We know that if Nucky has to kill Willy to save himself, he will. Plus, it would just be so incredibly tragic for Eli, it's the thing he cares about and when Nucky finds out Eli is ratting on him (and he will), Nucky will do whatever it takes to save himself, even if it means killing his brother's son, or letting him die. FWIW, the last episode of the season is called "Farewell Daddy Blues".   Loved that bit. Really well done.   "Hyperbole is the use of exaggeration as a rhetorical device or figure of speech.

 We've been together for two weeks, dating since the beginning of March.    I haven't cheated on her. I want to tell her that because it sounds far better than 'I'm constantly afraid and need your attention.'    My God, I've been sitting here for an hour. Summarizing my four-year story into a few long-sentenced passages is... challenging.   I've never been good with beginnings, and I suppose there're several ways to being this. Option #1, five years ago. A thirteen-year-old fella falling in love with the most beautiful brown-headed girl in Tel Aviv. Some luck has made their paths cross and spend a few weeks together. Best fucking weeks of his youth. Worst fucking breakup.   He's been dreaming about her ever since. Four years of a growing depression, memories, anxiety, burning his goddamn throat, and producing more tears than sperm cells. Life sucks.  This fella is almost a soldier now, and he even has a little beard that reminds everyone of a Spanish pornstar but generally, he's pretty.   Last month he began talking with another girl. That's the second beginning. It wasn't the first time he tried to restore a relationship that would be as the one he had, but this time it developed into something expectational. They talk every day. She laughs, she hears all about his talents, his passions, and eventually they meet.   God, this 3rd person thing is ridiculous.  So we meet. And I probably burned about a thousand calories the night beforehand. I wrote everything I feel about her. Every little thought of my mind, that's abnormally imaginative when I'm on the verge of tears.   I had my doubts, obviously. I just didn't want to fuck this up, goddamn it - I didn't want to be alone again.   We met, she thought it was great, I thought I was pathetic. I thought I fucked up. I sent her what I wrote about her, and stopped talking with her for a week. Eventually, I couldn't be alone anymore. I texted her. She says she loves me. I say I love her. We're together, and goddamn I burn a thousand calories every hour ever since.   I can't sleep. I can't study. I can't speak properly because I'm always anxious. At some point, I can't write anymore. Everything I text her is briefly examined, and the verdict is already obvious: It's the worst thing I could possibly text.   Nonetheless, I continue to be funny. Sometimes I'm still sad, and she knows that. She knows I'm fucking anxious and that I feel pathetic about myself. She knows, and she still fucking loves me. She does, the problem is - I don't trust it. I know I'm pathetic, I know everything I say is wrong and I'm always scared.   THE PROBLEM: I'm always scared. I wanna cry beneath the sheets and never wake up again. I wanna be alone, but in the long-term I know I don't. Actually, I don't know what I want. I know whatever I'm gonna do I'm gonna be anxious. We planned on meeting tomorrow, and I wanna say I can't. I wanna say I cheated on her and be fucking alone. Alone is safer, it's familiar. But It's wrong, isn't it?     **tl;dr**: I'm anxious screwing up, and wanna avoid my GF because of that.   Edit: To make things clear, I haven't cheated on her.    I was feeling the same way. Try observing yourself from a 3rd person view. "If this guy asked me for advice now, considering these circumstances- what would I suggest?"   This is truly inspiring. Well done, pal!       Telling her in person is certainly the better option of the two.   I was surprised to read you wanted to confess her about your depression- which you don't. I must've misunderstood you there.  I used to pretend everything was OK as well while everything was actually fucked up. I can promise you that telling someone about your depression feels SO GOOD, and I think that you're heading towards that. Good luck!    If you decide to her the whole thing, I'd say don't be so bold. Prepare a short text of what you're going to say, but not an entire speech. Work on how you're going to begin this text because she's probably gonna ask you a whole bunch of questions. How much do you really wanna tell her?    Suck it up, goddamn it.   Finish the damn shift and go home. Don't go to your bed, but think. Think outside of your irrational emotions, mute the fucking voices and think. What do you wanna do? Say the first thing that comes to your mind, just an on-the-spot answer. Write it down. No, seriously, WRITE IT DOWN.  Wrote it? No, for God's sake. That's a short-term answer. Think larger. What do you wanna do?   Think about the times you were younger. When you were hoping to become a firefighter, or a painter. Why would you choose something so fucking financially-unrewarding? What kind of things were you hoping to get? To change?  Now, if you don't think this answer is the stupidest fucking thing anyone has ever said to a suicidal man, then I want you to do me a favor. I want you to write things you're gonna do today that involve you getting a step closer towards that long-term goal. If you wanna be a software designer, download Visual Studio. If you wanna be a fucking writer, write the first sentence of your best-seller to be. Tomorrow, I want you to write another sentence. As a matter of fact, write two and trust me, man, you're gonna get so fucking ecstatic you did.   Btw, what's your favorite color?   Writing.  "Collecting inspiration" for writing.    Different numbers, literally the exact same story. Long relationship, breakup, comparing girls to the previous relationship, feeling depressed, feeling anxious, feeling pathetic.   I was lost in the same maze you are, because I always considered myself a sad person but I was afraid of appearing as one. However, I discovered an interesting thing. Women like variety. While you still posses the benefits of a young bond, if you could present your funny charachter, she'd have no problem with your sad charachter. Moreover, she'd probably fucking love it. Meeting a man who's both funny and depressed, and can manage both, is amazingly rare.   About the anxiety of messing up, I'd say do some breathing techniques. Remember she probably feels the same way you do at this stage, even if sometimes she seems less emotionally attached. Women have their damn tactics.   If you do feel anxious, take some time off. Despite its benefits of making her wonder why you took the time off, it really let's you relax. Think. Make decision while your mind isn't fueled by irrational emotions.  I might've gone too far in this reply, but those are some things I used in a smiliar situation and I'm currently comitted.   And, of course, sorry for any silly mistakes in grammer. I live outside the US.   How many of you have once made progress regarding depression, and for a while might've been a bit thrilled with life, and woke up one morning to find yourself depressed again - yet in a different way?  You have these thoughts again, you hear this particular song, or scroll through Facebook seeing something that triggers the monsters- and even thought you already know how to deal with them, you read about it, despite all that, there's something blocking you from being happy again.  Almost as if you need a variety from all the happiness you've been having all week, and perhaps you wanna be yourself once again now. Depressed. It feels familiar, and honestly being this long without depression feels unnatural, and the more you think about it, the greater the fall for depression, and being thrilled and happy with life seems fake.  Nonetheless, you've achieved your variety. In some way, you think, you like this change of mood. I know I do.   Just sharing my thoughts.    Watch Tony Robbins.   I'm 17, and I'm ashamed to admit I read a single book last year.  I've ADD, and I hate using it as an excuse for not enjoying the great world of literature. I listened to The Great Gatsby's audiobook, mostly because I've seen Fitzgerlad's quotes around the web and it was so beautifully written.   Anyways, I would like to start reading. And I'm gonna continue reading the book even if it hurts, but I would like something interesting. Something inspiring, something great that I probably have never read. Nonetheless, something that isn't written in Fitzgerlad's English because that's still rather difficult for me.  Please help!     It's a shame such a thing has been left untreated, however, anxiety is such a major issue these days that fortunately enough there are several treatments for it that don't even require anyone else to know of your condition. I assume you've been searching for such treatments by now, so I'd like to hear what's your experience and what have you already tried.   I've been dealing with the same feelings for the past months, but I'm currently doing better.  The best breathing technique that worked for me was the 4-7-8. It is originally designed to make you fall asleep quickly, but I found it to be reducing anxiety during the day as well.   You simply breathe in through your nose for four seconds, hold your breath for seven seconds, and exhale through your mouth for eight seconds. When you feel stressed or anxious, adrenaline courses through your veins, your heart beats at a rapid rate, and your breathing becomes quick and shallow. [The] effect of the breathing technique feels almost like a sedative drug, because in order to hold your breath for seven seconds and then to exhale for eightwhen your breath is so shallow and shortyour body is forced to slow your heart rate. It has no choice. Holding your breath, and then slowly, deliberately exhaling for eight seconds, causes a chain reaction. It feels like going from a mad-dash sprint to a finish line to a slow, leisurely, calming stroll through the park.  Watch relaxing videos several minutes before bedtime. Just google 'relax', and let YouTube take you through endless cat videos and the sounds of the ocean.   Whenever you feel like you're getting into these thoughts again, take a breath. Use the same 4-7-8 technique, and try to evaluate the situation in 3rd person. Say, "Is whatever's bothering him REALLY that dangerous, or is his mind just not thinking clearly right now?"  I hope you'll be doing better. Keep me updated.    It's known that marijuana may cause anxiety for some people, luckily it's really easy to stop using. I would suggest avoiding 'irregular' treatments and start approaching anxiety through the old-fashioned way. There is a countless amount of articles regarding anxiety, but you may begin with the top posts in this subreddit.   I've recently began a program called 'The Human Approach', you could google that even if you're unsure of your condition at the moment.   1. When I change the skin, the app restarts in an ugly way. 2. I'd like to see the regular iPhone passcode, rather than a complicated one (with a string of text).   Other than that, everything seems to be nice. iPhone 5 - iOS 8.3   I haven't told anyone about my writing. It's one of the few things that keep me passionate in life, that gives purpose to my depression. I like it. Anxiety makes me imagining things turning out wrong, but for some reason it's not like that with writing. I imagine myself turning out as a good author, even though I'm only seventeen and English isn't my native language.  Anyways, I feel better now. Thanks. (:   Assuming you're using Chrome:  1.

I mean, without losing sensation there by morning.   I've been writing for two years, but honestly I don't have the energy anymore. I'm stuck. I'm anxious. .I'm worried about failure because I never myself anymore. I'm a miserable fucking teenager trying to hide his depression from people because no one likes these 'depressed people'. Instead, I try to act carelessly, as if I don't give a fuck while I'm actually a prostitute of feelings, and it's not going well for me, too. I've no control, so I figured that if I'm already destroying myself I might as well do it intentionally.   Nonetheless, self-destruction doesn't feel good, too.    Everything I do makes me anxious. Trying to improve my relationships gets me obsessively anxious and ultimately depressed.  I just lost hope things will get better. It's a fucking lie.     When you don't believe you could get better anymore, when there's no reason to thrive for better things anymore. I believe this has more to do with r/suicidewatch.    While I believe ADHD has a direct connection with creativity, having many ideas bursting simultaneously means nothing if you can't manage them. I usually try to perfect all of them altogether and, therefore, leave them unfinished.   28 on PC.   I'm scared of changes. I'd rather be sad, and lonely, and live with pain because honestly that's what I've been doing for the last couple of years. No, I'm not ready for adulthood.   How should I tell them? Explain the whole thing, or just say I need treatment?    You're gonna be okay. I'd kill to be consulted right now.    The main reason is I would be emberassed. They would treat me differently, and perhaps I'm gonna end up as the fucked up kid in the family. Moreover, I'm generally affraid of changes. I don't know.    My parents are just very old-fashioned. I'm sitting by the computer most of the day and we don't have such a great connection. I would feel very emberassed telling them I've anxiety, and I fear I would be treated diferently as if I'm just crazy.    I live in Israel. I will be drafted in 7 months and I believe I could see a psychologist there even thought it may get me dismissed from the army.   I'm 17 and I've been dealing with serious anxiety for the last couple of months. I wanna get help, but I don't wanna tell my parents that I've anxiety (or anyone else I know, for that matter).   Are there any possibilities for me to get treated without them knowing? I live outside the US.   My name would appear somewhere on the news and my friends would go 'omg but he was so happy', and watching their temporary surprise is probably the only thing worth living for. I'd love to see what they have to say, if any one them would blame themselves and if she would ever know. Perhaps at some point some of my journals and fantasies would be found and she would remember me. That's the other thing worth living for.   	33
 It really, really is. I've been reading through a lot of the classics lately on my YouTube page, and this one specifically has the strongest sense of unfiltered, unadulterated, honest fiction. Timeless.     yes! Very captivating in the hellashish sense          son-of-a-bitch         If only every pokemon from the first 151 would be in Smash bros. That would be the end of all games.

Let's Read!  - I read stories :) Http://www.youtube.com/user/LetsReadOfficial    good point. maybe they should do a cringe face system ranging from "Oh jesus, this guy again" to "hmm...maybe?"      You know MODS, on a less serious subreddit called /r/games they put little things above links that are hearsay, such as "UNSUBSTANTIATED" and "BULLSHIT". Even tho I'm sure the french attacks were some sort of government ploy.   Yeah, San Andreas getting AO on the offshoot that someone "mods" the game. I'm pretty excited for Hatred game. Public outrage just likes to hear itself speak.      Awesome! Love me a good scifi            yeah, just put some ear plugs in or sumtin  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3tiGGR4IS8 feature=youtu.be   I can't believe.   Sure is great how that spilt glass landed on its feet.   Haha no worries, totally understandable    I'm just imaging, for asmr, it could be a role play and the sounds picked up as a the balloons rub together could be popular lol         I was worried it would be a video of the actual "devouring". Glad it wasn't. Feel bad for the kid, but, based on piranha eating habits, the body was most likely previously deceased (maybe drowning?) and eaten post-mortem - as piranha, even within large groups, are primarily scavengers.  **NSFW** http://gfycat.com/DistinctElatedBluebird#?frameNum=210 ***NSFL***     Yorkshire!

I love falling asleep to really boring/interesting vidyas :)         And he posted to the right place   Thank you, friend :) Great Author            Pain insists upon being attended to. God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our consciences, but shouts in our pains. It is his megaphone to rouse a deaf world.    C.S. Lewis   I'm not even sure if I like that answer, but just a quote on short notice.    Thanks a lot, friend. Been trying to branch out with different short stories. If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know :)            [For those who didn't get the reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)   If CISPA was around, this would've never happened...         yes   THe Luv GurU, Starringg mike   thank you   http://i.imgur.com/gYfs709.jpg  http://np.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2qmzzc/this_is_what_i_woke_up_to_on_christmas_after_i/  makes me sick      She wants to date, but like others have said, I don't want to get into anything and back out and hurt her.   I met this really fantastic girl a while ago, we immediately hit it off, as she was boisterous, excitable and able to have a conversation without awkwardness or judgement. We're both Christians with a strong understanding of the message of Christ and both work in the same field, so we get to spend some time together pretty frequently. I felt immediately comfortable around her which is really nice.   I've had people within the same circle of friends come up to me in conversation and borderline bug as to why we aren't dating and how she "screams 'my' girlfriend".   The only issue is, I just don't feel the sensation you would when looking at someone physically beautiful, and I fear that makes me superficial. Is it wrong to have all other aspects of a christian relationship line up perfectly, but turn it down because the physical attraction is not?   I've prayed about it for a while, and I would never want to get into something that I'm not at least all on board for, because I'd never want to end up hurting someone. I've read scripture that "beauty is fleeting and charm is deceptive, but a woman who fears the lord is to be held high", but maybe I'm not mature enough in my life right now to fully accept that. I don't know.    got em            If you don't get in, which, as you've stated, is a possibility - don't give up on life. It may be a doorway to an unhindered sense of freedom you may have never known before if you didn't waste your entire life worrying about what your parents or other people thought about you. Think about all those bankers who TRIED SO HARD their entire lives, to get to the top, and find that there is nothing there for them except for the superficial numerical value next to their name. The second that plummets, they do as well off the 33rd story of their high rise apartment. The point is, fuck this stupid world and its expectations. You have a chance here to not give two shits for once and that is a weight that only the great have had lifted from their overburdened shoulders. Be free, my friend.                   Thank you so much, friend.   haha no worries! What story would you enjoy read? :)         haha some early blunders (esp part 2 lol), but really trying to pick it up. posting a star wars fan fiction in just a bit if you're interested. Darth Maul's in this one.      you bet!                  Thanks friend! Any suggestions or requests are greatly appreciated                     Kill this man! Hand sanitation so highly important that the thought of someone I will never meet not doing it appropriately drives me to the brink of fedora induced nausea.    Yes, makes you ponder intelligent design, God, that sort of thing. Almost too great to be coincidence and chance.     This is a little farfetched but I had an idea I wanted to share -  IF time travel were possible, could it be a possibility that the locations and time frames the individual is travelling to could actually be one of the infinite and varying parallel universes all coexisting within the same conscious reality? This is with the perspective that all time is is one moment, and all those one moments exist all on top of each other but in infinite characteristics, times and variations.  This is somewhat String Theory-esque but I wanted to hear some insightful opinions. Thank you.    "They call me, Loam"   Dank memes   No one will ever understand your difficulty in taking a human life. Being able to articulate the feeling with you, will prove even more difficult. Your commanding officer reaches his hand down, placing it on your shoulder. In your daze, you feel an understanding resonate through his touch. Transmitted through his neural fibers to your own is the momentary revelation that you required from another human. You stand to witness the presence of the man's mother fall and engulf your victims body in a protective hysterical shell. To see the judgement and sadness in her eyes would be the end of your soul. You turn and fall back into line.         At first I thought you were joking because it was the exact argument that was made in the video lol   You're comparing the murder and death of thousands of individuals to not getting 25 cents off of your eggs Benedict...         I had to reset everything in my entire computer after installing Max Payne 3, I remember   I wonder why this guy is so adamant about something so unobtrusive to his own life?             I understand you emotions my friend. Some of your statements I'll chock up to poetry before God. You are trying so hard to be heard by others, loved, but also loved by God, many of the old testament writers shared your exact same pain, but within different context. I struggle with the desire to be accepted by woman, and it seems like a lot of guys experience acceptance on a regular basis, whether from their girl friend or various co-ed friends etc. But, at the end of the day, the only one that will fill the hole in your heart will be Jesus. Seek after him with all your heart. Join a bible study, a men's group, go evangelize and help people with your new found brethren and sisters, serving Christ as a community. God wants you to focus first on Him, because if he gives you a female, there's a possibility, in your passion, you may lose touch with your need for God and place her on a pedestal that will only collapse around. Let God be your strong and mighty foundation, brother! YOU ARE A MAN! A Man of God! A lover of souls and brokenhearted. You love them because you know the brokenness!     napkin was used for naughty thingz.    Purgatory is not overtly mentioned in the bible and is contradictory to the finality of Christ's Sacrifice.    What happens if you're cremated? You come back as an urn?   same actually. it was almost, too obvious haha         http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/2oovwb/i_told_my_mom_i_was_really_sick_today_an_hour/  followed by a thread appealing to how awesome moms are and how you should equate them to mass marketed goods   The Rat hated it but I love it   Thank you!            Waking Life is in my top 5 for shore   Oh wow, thank you friend :)               Maybe I'm struggling with some psychological perspective that my distaste for services that I continue to participate in is what God does not appreciate. Maybe, I need to experience God through a differing manner than your common church service/worship service.    Exactly. My conspiratorial side makes me ponder some strange top-down marketing scheme.    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-kifCYToAU YouTube Link   I like Sufjan   So, its more of an intellectual decision than sensation experienced? or?   Man made tradition of 1.) arrive 2.) greet 3.) announcements 4.) offering 5.) praise music 6.) sermon 7.) praise music 8.) leave.  This isn't inherently a bad thing. It just can become very stagnant and doesn't seem to leave much room for growth, progression or the Holy Spirit.    I think, it would seem, that most praise music played within the church, fits within the paradigm or genre of contemporary bands such as Hillsong and I feel as if though that it is very limiting.   It is becoming as such, yes.    I know, that's kinda what I've been struggling with. /r/videos doesn't seem to care, this subreddit seemed appropriate for the content, /r/ASMR likes tingle voices but only if I speak slow and make p-p-pop noises. My go to's have been /r/history sometimes, /r/creepyreadings for creepypastas and /r/audiobooksonyoutube for short stories. Who knows lol. Figured I'll just keep pumping out content until it builds up slowly or PewDiePie finds me and makes a react video of my creepypastas haha   I've come to find that I'm far more passionate and, what I feel is, closer to God when I'm passionately singing a song that I truly enjoy. Hymnals and contemporary rock music just doesn't seem to raise my spirit like, what it seems for, others around me. It's gone as far as making me not look forward to church, as I know that I'm only going to be faking my way through the worship and praise portion and just end up feeling indifferent and bored by the time we reach the message/sermon portion. Does there really need to be a "set list" of praise songs that each worship band needs to know? Isn't that commercialization, if we're just singing 'Hillsong' every week? Similar to man-made traditions that God seems to disdain, in the bible, we in westernized Christianity, seem to be "religiously" following a set path each week when it comes to something as simple as worshiping God. It almost feels as if there is an insinuation that there are no other options aside from this routine and I feel we are overdue for some much needed deviations.      Thanks :) Will do! Any other suggestions are most welcome   Yeah, they're primarily clips from Ralph Bakshi         Let's not use the word, "Terrorists". Let's use, "Guys that broke the rules that day".    Thank you! I have more if you wanna read it :)         A colossal planetary orb overlooks our home. Nearly at the climax of its kiss with the rock we call Earth. Some of the most amazing shades of blue you'll ever see. Colors you don't find here. Colors artists attempt, and fail to replicate. It only peaks every 68 years, but you can always see it coming months in advance. A new star in the sky at first, then within half a year's time, the harvest moon dawns forth its peak. Some call it our planet's passing lover. Some call it the thief, as it drags our moon with it for a time before gravity can set itself right - which it always does. When it does come, it's always an exciting time here. The world seems to come together in peace for nearly a year in the common endeavor to appreciate what some hold as God's Passing Eye. It pushes the rain away from certain areas, and in others, the clouds gather and the water just won't stop falling. And then comes the twilit days and shadowless nights. By the time the Sun hits noon, the sky is eclipsed, and the blue hues don't miss anything after sun down. Some even believe the vibratory luminescence can evoke an inner potential. It truly is an experience that all should share in at least one lifetime.    Sheol and I lay under the aquatic nightlight, overlooking our village  of which is celebrating Peak Banquet. The festival lights give illusion that the night's excitement is nearly at its apex, paralleling the sapphire that penetrates our sky. The blue bulb emanates such an energy, causing a sense of invigoration through its very presence . Away from all the festival cheer, its song can be heard through energetic vibrations that hum only soft enough for those who listen closely - those who seek to hear. Resting next to one another, hands grasped, I can feel the vastness of the cosmic sphere reverberating through us both, nearly enhancing through our physical connection.   "They say it's getting closer, you know, Sheol gently let out. In my hypnosis, I nearly missed what she'd said.   "Uh... You don't buy into that collision course fear do you?" I rattle off in nearly the same words I've heard from my pop time and time again. She paused for a long while, her eyes reflecting equally beautiful seas of blue back at the monster in the sky.    "I don't know...My father's been doing a lot of work at the observatory lately, and he says...something's different." Her gaze never breaks from the atmosphere, and I have no words to say. "He says at this rate, this might be the last cycle before...The event. Silence fills the air as what she said begins to pass over me.     Fireworks can be seen popping and fading in sparkling reds and yellows near village square. The irony of it all nearly brings a smile to my face. We lay there quietly, looking directly at what some hold in highest form of natural phenomenon and beauty, and by the same means, could very well bring about our end. But the fear, the fear had not overtaken me. I know I am exactly where I'm supposed to be. Sheol clasps my hand even tighter  her vision transfixed towards the endless blue; and all I can hear is that gentle hum.    Fat Scott wiped the primate feces from his second chin, "Worst...Scott...Ever..."   A read through of the history of Shell Shock and a visual presentation of its horrific effects during war. Truly terrifying stuff.                A comfortable read through of the life and accomplishments of Nikola Tesla. What are your thoughts on the legacy left by this man?      Well, then cops in the US must be prepared to kill everyday, because they do it a lot.                   Putin is a bank to the puppeting obamas just like cartel   Why does Reddit love gays so much, Papa?  Because it's full of em', buddy, it's full of em'...   that's gonna be useful soon         I am simply stating that your examination and observation of the world is gonna be biased and contradictory, no matter your stance. You only can be sure of the time in which you were born and died, never being a first hand account, or authority to past or future.    Basically, its the age old internet argument that if you killed your grandfather, you would never be born. Therefore, he believes (most likely based on the Reddit hivemind Sagan-Degrasse Tyson indoctrination) that if Moses would have been killed, the Jews would never have been freed, Jesus would have never been born, christianity would have never developed, science would be praised, and we'd be on Mars right now with robots that would jerk us off on command. But, that's taking into consideration that there would be NO other religions to come into existence during that time (thus forwarding 'progress'), over analyzing that religion is a hindrance in the first place, and that humans could ever, or will ever progress to this hypothetical "stage II" society.   End of the day. The kid most likely hated church growing up, felt some sort of enlightenment by browsing reddit, and now holds science to be the new god (that holds him to no social standard) of whom he puts his faith daily  	199
 Funny coming from him considering what he did to Louisiana.      They will continue coming. We have to learn how to address them.                  If by week you mean for months now and unto the primary and possibly general election, yes you're right.    Warriors and Heat.   Spurs and Cavs can watch from home like the rest of us.    Then add All-Star game MVP to that list for Porzingis.         there have been a lot of positive tests over the years and if they got caught, imagine who many didn't  i'm curious about the georges line though   where in the blue hell did all of those threes come from?   ROTY no doubt. He wont' get MVP simply because the Knicks will still sink. He will surely be a 25-10 double double machine.    Can a rookie play on the all-star team? Is that within the rules?    You're right. He's not nearly as athletic as Thompson.    good link   You know any good places to train UFC in Dublin?    Who's Mauricio Rua anyway? Only in there because of his brother Shogun.  He's too much.    Ronda is looking out for herself, not fellow fighters.    Forget him. He's always hating on the Suns.   Nothing a cycle of steroids and hard work can't do.          He played. He's not a rookie.    He's very athletic but he could improve his shooting.    Conor looks like he has not eaten in a week.   Jewish check. Carpenter check. Looks to help the poor and disadvantaged check.       Think of T like an energy/turbo bar in a video game. Throughout the day you use it up and it gets lower. Or it could be from masking agents.    Isn't his Andro on the high side of normal with his T/E ratio too small? Could that be a sign of a masking agent?      He isnt going to win his partys nomination, but his popularity still matters.   I hope the author Jamelle Bouie is willing to share his time machine with me.    He isnt going to win his partys nomination, but his popularity still matters.   I hope the author Jamelle Bouie is willing to share his time machine with me.                I believe you that he is a great guy. He comes off as a class guy. Nice guys dope too though. I understand/respect your loyalty.    Cain Velasquez. Nick or Nate Diaz (not including marijuana). Benson Henderson. Roy Nelson unless we're counting whoppers. Khabib Nurmagomedov. Rose Namajunas.   Wouldn't surprise me: anyone at jackson's like Jon Jones or Holly Holm or Andrei Arlovski. Also Jacare Souza or RDA.    hahaha   Ok. But what's up with his response? Why doesn't he just admit it instead of half assing it?       yeah   Yes.   He was juicing then though so not really.    Haha! I think he's ever worse than Jon. But Jon could still end up there if the prosecutor isn't a total loser.    I've been a Vitor fan from his first UFC fight on and I am to this day. But I'm also honest.    Weed stays in your system a long time especially if you use a lot. It really depends on how sensitive a test is. I read they are making less sensitive? Yeah, it's not professional but I guess they just  had to light up.   Weed is not a PED so I don't think it's fair to group those fighters with the cheaters.       There's sloppy, and there's Thiago Silva. The guy is scum. He's lucky to not be in prison.    You don't think UFC fighters can be? lol   As he should  be. Gilbert robbed him of his paycheck. Any chance the UFC still gives him his show money if they can't find a replacement opponent?    It was known back in SF Gilbert was using.    Vitor is a mental midget. You can't fix cowardice. That's why he's been a chronic steroids user his entire career. It helps him physically, but it also makes him confident mentally. I'm also a huge Vitor fan.   He's talking about the story in the link he provided and also the pictures of of a broken rib that have been everywhere.    It will lower prices. More users = more buying power. Look at every other country. When a country has more buying power, they say what the price will be and make companies compete.    I think more will get caught. A lot of them will just be more careful by taking larger windows when they cycle. And the fighters who can afford the good stuff will use freely because tests are years behind new synthetic testosterone they come up with every year. What they should do is store their blood for testing in 5/10 years.    You realize that a majority of  UFC fighters use PEDs, right?    It's his fault for being sloppy with his cycling. You don't see fighters at Jackson's or Blackzilians pissing hot.    medicare for everyone would cut prices significantly    yeah that counts   there are other forms of resistance training than just lifting weighs bruh   face is a wreck but that booty    she can't fight cris cyborg though   It has historically been a wedge issue but Sanders is trying to make it something we can come together.   It is obvious, but it is still important because it shows you that he is different. Everyone else on the left doesn't say this because they are afraid of losing votes. Sanders tells it like it is. For that reason, it is something we can appreciate.    Why do you want him to get destroyed in the primaries? Do you love the establishment? Do  you hate Sanders's ideas of every American having a livable wage and health insurance?         Let's get a couple of more goals!    I'm right on point.    Prison lobby gives money to politicians, mostly republicans, they in turn create laws to put more people in prison. They also privatize the prisons system. In my home state, Arizona, the newly elected Republican governor gave 500 million dollars to build a new private prison that has a contract to stay at 100% full capacity while cutting education across the board.    If we spent money on mental health and drug rehab instead of prisons, we'd save billions every year and be better off as a society.    I just want to remind you all that we had a player hurt his hand picking up the phone.    do they have a plaxico stupidity clause in his contract? they should   it's CNN, what do you expect?   it's why I rephrased it, because CNN's title his dishonest and they're scrum   If you don't speed you're probably holding up traffic and creating more danger than anything. I don't see why having background checks and keeping guns away from criminals and other dangerous people should be controversial.   it could   It's not just rhetoric. These would be policies he would attempt to implement. He's not delusional. He knows he can't do everything he's saying without the help of the establishment down the line, but he's going to work to do as much as he can. He's going to fight for the middle class. America needs him.   What you have to understand about Bernie is he doesn't speak that way. He doesn't do damage control. He tells it like it is. Bernie Sanders has been consistent on guns. I don't  expect either extreme to side with Sanders on gun rights, but I do think a vast majority of Americans is in line with Bernie on guns, including gun owners.    Obviously the UFC wants to have their cake and eat it too.  They are a monopoly with a tapped out market. Now that they have squeezed out every single penny of their fanbase with every possible revenue stream, its' their fighters who are the target of their greed.                         That is your evaluation. He's put in the work and beat top fighters. You didn't make a valid argument to why he should't get a shot.   Prices always climb. That is not relevant. The question you should be asking is, what would prices have been without the ACA? The answer is without a doubt higher than without the ACA.    Haters gonna hate and ainters gonna aint.   People said the same thing about a black junior senator too.   I believe in Bernie. He represents me. I'm going to vote for him and do what else I can to help him get every last vote possible no matter what the detractors or anyone else says.    Green would be considered a big? lol         how u know?    We need catchy lines for him like we had riggin for wiggins.    yup   Dana hates Ryan for some reason. Only people who beat him can get title shots. Ryan Bader isn't allowed.    You simplify it. You don't need that many combinations. Or computerize it and do as many combinations as you want.    that's true, but I bet at least one or two more players will have their stocks rise a lot from now until then   1 on 5 though bruh   Ben Simmons is Anthony Davis level though!    I mean, what other options do they have?    you need to read a political ideologies book lol   they make it complicated to not televise it   they can make it a lot more simple if they want    it happens a lot! lol   .500 basketball forever      the NBA has had fixed games before, this is fact  it's not that outrageous for me to suspect they are fixing the draft lottery by doing it in secrecy    Elections have many checks. Sometimes, they're even recounted by people counting ballots. As far as oscars or nickelodean, what? Who cares about that BS.    "in a way"  what way is that?   it has 0 proof it's legit   I'm still waiting for anyone to tell me what is a good reason to do it in secret and not live.   auditors? lol, horse and pony show man   why not do it live in public and get crazy ratings for it? WHY?    We are if we play all of our young guys a lot. I'm sick and tired of 500 ball. We have to get bad to get good.    np   you'd rather have another great season of competing for the 8th seed and a first and done?    let's throw the season! trade Bledose for the sixers first round picks, go all in on getting Ben Simmons!    [every suns fan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ) right now   Occam's Razor bruh. What is a legitimate reason for them to have the draft lottery in secret instead of broadcasting it live for everyone to witness? They hate the ratings?    Tucker is solid but he is already at his ceiling. I'm hoping Warren realizes his potential.    The Knicks got hooked up. The Cavs  got hooked up. Many teams have gotten hooked up.   I think it's realistic to expect things like universal healthcare and free university education. Western European countries does it. Why can't we? Are they better than we are?    So everyone doesn't contact the people who contacted Chad.    In the episode Chad goes to get a new number and in the process shows the people who contacted him on his phone...displaying their  numbers. This is why the episode was taken down.   NBA always does stuff like this. There is a reason why the draft lottery is done in secret. It's for fixin'.   has he ever predicted anything correctly before?    I think the NBA will make amends for screwing LA with the CP3 trade by having them win the lottery next year and getting **Ben Simmons**.   100% biased but TJ Warren   Love has a better chance.   they should call him dj ilek   [Vince Carter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNy8dQNcf2w).   NBA Street yo   [mirror](https://vid.me/9397)  It's private because Chad showed the numbers of many people who contacted him after his phone number was leaked.    A lot of fighters do/will probably have CTE. I love fighting and american football, but you have to be incredibly stupid to go taking concussions for a living, regardless of how many millions you make.

 Good point. But no matter what your intentions behind using drugs are, you are inevitably using drugs as a means for an escape.    Of course. I meant 'drugs' intended for recreational use (a particular interest in shrooms and bupe I guess) and perhaps many and most can be addictive and toxic, but it's inevitable if you chose to use them. I understand the possibility of a natural high, but I have some sort of desire for engaging in a drug induced mind altering trip and then take part in some creative activity. I really want to see the limits in which I can expand my mind. Perhaps a lot of this is ignorant and cliche, but I believe there is some truth to it.    Poverty is a broken cycle that will never be repaired with welfare. This article highlights misogyny and also subtly mentions poverty on a one-person income basis. It is virtually impossible to have a family and break the poverty cycle (which again, I think this article mentions), but it is also very difficult for the individual who if he/she is lucky enough to get a job to find the motivation to work harder than the majority of americans when he/she is alone.    Hi! I'm a student at a pretty well-known private boarding school in New England. I'm looking to submit a research paper (or just an abstract) to any publication willing to take it; however, I'm having trouble finding a publication (it does not have to be peer-reviewed) to accept high school student's work. I conducted social science research and worked with a data analyst for the national headquarters of the Sierra Club. My paper is around 8000 words, and all of it is incredibly legit. Any suggestions    Reddit, I have never done drugs, and I'm very much against them. My mother was an addict, now just a heavy drinker as with my father, so I don't want to screw over my life: simple. My parents have taken on the role of whom not to become, but I want to experience that creative urge; that subconscious realm of reality that is drugs without screwing up.  Any suggestions?  I want to experience everything (that's kind of my life's philosophy) and right now, I'm looking for an escape where I could "find myself".  Thanks! EDIT* Follow up question: Personal experience stories?     I'm reading the Brother's K and this idea popped up. I can see why in terms of poverty but is there anything else I'm missing?    Funny how this popped up. I'm actually listening to the song right now: I know someday you'll have a beautiful life, I know you'll be a star In somebody else's sky, but why? Why? why? Can't it be, can't it be mine We, we, we, we, we belong together! Together This part of the song always gets me; it's so raw and emotional. Perhaps one of the most emotional songs I've ever heard.  Somedays, at this part of the song, I really want a music video.  	7

 What?   No money for parts. Paying for fitness. I'm good with my old friend from 2007 (computer) but thanks for the advice :D   Thanks for all the advice.  I'm currently in EU Ring Of Fire and just a few mins ago I created a Sylvary Guardian - hope I didn't get the name of the race wrong. When I saw the guardian in the shining armour I just said this is the new beginning.  So yeah  	3
 It was more of a joke than anything, It's completely harmless. I just found it funny that the same tiny bug has been in the game for ages.   that little muzzle break glitch :P  it isn't a major deal, but it'd be nice lol      I'm impressed you didn't fall over dead from one of the many random things that can kill you!   I know this trick/tactic, yet sometimes i get too excited to wait. Last winter sale banished went up for 50% off, so i bought a copy for a buddy and me, 20$. Then two days later it goes up for 75% off and i felt this strange *robbed but not robbed* emotion inside of me.    Here is what I noticed, so the map is about 64km^2, and there are 1500 zombies possible. So that means for every 1km area, there is ~23 zombies (1500/64). If you divide 23 by 10(10x100m=1km), that means there are ~2.3 zombies per 100m area. Therefore if you subtract 2 from 2.3, you get .3 of a zombie, which confirms BI is adding crawlers. :D      All kidding aside, if there is a possibility of 2 zombies per 100m area, and you move them to denser/more urban area rather than random nondescript woods, It's a pretty decent size in towns.   A good tip is to open your inventory, and then hit the desired key, works the first time everytime.   Playing on servers with at least 15 people. Found the AUG's in a 30+ population server, please tell me more about how I'm on low pops.   *mobile loot* took me a while.   It's like only a few months into the apocalypse. Pretty sure the stuff would look normal.   Heres my problem. I am ultra friendly and will ALWAYS give someone the benefit of the doubt. However my group, not so much. So when we meet someone, It's 4 of my buddies wanting to kill the guy we met, and me being the voice of reason. Normally I win because I tell my friends I WILL shoot them if they shoot somebody in cold blood. But for the most part my group is friendly, mostly due to me carrying the peace. In any survival game, I try to be as friendly as possible. Hell, I met friendly people in that PvP fest WarZ, while I had full gear and the other people didn't.   	11
   I'll stop: a group of young white 20-somethings sitting around taking drugs talking about how they're going to film themselves robbing a bank.  Well fuck... 4 years working on *Crack The Blog Bank* down the drain.   Rewatching Barton has dulled my view of it.  And writing things about writers who have problems writing is often better suited to the movies   Yeah you tell em!   Cough newspapers cough.  The funny thing is when you see some technowarrior on here laugh at newspapers closing I just shake my head.  I admire wikileaks but it is not going to be able to do what the time or the guardian does.  You complain about tv news being shit - go out and vote with your wallet. Subscribe to X Y and Z. Get an international, one more local, one magazine with commentary. Digital or paper.   Money where mouth is.  These stations have sponsors, loads of money, they pander to the dumb masses.  You want good journalism, pick up a paper.  Otherwise - and this goes to 99% of users on reddit who complain about this - just shut up.         Most people have heard of great white, hammerhead and tiger sharks but there are many other species - and every year a number of new ones are discovered. One enthusiast has, so far, identified 24 types of shark and related fish that were previously unknown.  Old fashioned science brought to you via the new world wide web.      hope he gives it a full on go   Every day it seems there is more and more, from [3d printed houses](http://www.thejournal.ie/houses-3d-printing-1416773-Apr2014/) to [automated trucking](http://business.financialpost.com/news/energy/how-canadas-oilsands-are-paving-the-way-for-driverless-trucks-and-the-threat-of-big-layoffs?__lsa=e66d-f217) to [assembly lines](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2855570/Amazons-new-robot-army-ready-ship.html) and [medicine](http://www.techweb.com/news/229100383/12-advances-in-medical-robotics.html) seems to imbrace it     I thought that too.

Please tell me this is the case    public show it to the player, just rotten behaviour    As bad as some shows are and as critical as I am known to be there is a lot going for the show  But... yeah... it's too slow  Horrible to say but a truth isn't it  Not for me (penny dreadful anyone?) it's too slow for the average viewer  And I have to agree. Should have loaded the show, 5 series formula, moved far quicker  Indulgent, good but indulgent  Why cancel? Is there producer deals in place that stops a new showrunner changing it?  Bizarre, considering the background    You haven't answered the only question of a source yet.  When you do that, and then we ignore all the evidence of the close relationship between man and dog, we can continue the discussion.  Do not try and twist things with me.      Yes dog were work animals.   To early farmers, they were no different from other work animals, such as horses or mules.  Source?   Never once mentioned pets.      they boiled them alive, burn them alive, skin them alive   no, work away   That's a good comparison yeah. I feel that way too. The initial hoorah will die down.   ok   I got a 20 euro bottle wine in tesco 1/2 price  instead of eating it with some nice cheese I am having intant noodles    on the sauce already?   [I rate it 4 Calculons](http://i.imgur.com/r1DXEkd.jpg)   Hyperbole but I understand the point he is trying to make.   And if he did that today he'd probably be criticized for it, the way the Godzilla director was criticized for not showing Godzilla early enough.  If the 2nd half of that Godzilla film was actually good it wouldn't have mattered. People wanted godzilla because they were bored shitless staring at one of the most blank and charmless actors that hollywood has now decided to add to the roster of young talent.   A summer blockbuster isn't going for Oscars? What a fucking shock!  Kinda missed the point there mate     Turn around in the context of it being a summer blockbuster etc.  There has been very little of the usual hyperbole regarding it as a film overall.  Seems to have jumped that and went straight to the 'what you expect it's a (insert plot or concept) movie not Ingmar Bergman, get over yourself'      Some of the worst characterization and dialogue I've seen in a blockbuster with decent expectations since The Phantom Menace.  Fuck you might be fucking right    That sounds really high.   I'm not really sure if you are slow or just drunk or something.  I was agreeing with you. I said yes, 30,000 years is the number, and that 30,000 years is quite an applicable number to use the term ancient since recorded human history itself only spans about 5,000 years.  Bad troll is bad and can't even play the game properly. Jesus wept.    4  4 better   k         Yes, yes it was supposed to make us feel like a dinosaur.   Generally positive but with noticeable negatives    k   I think the turnaround on this film will be swift even on reddit.     No you used a gif.    I just think its pretty hilarious given that JW is breaking a lot of money-making records, so I'm sure the studio is SO SAD when you criticize the movie  Shame on some people for wanting to discuss the movie despite its financial success or what the studio thinks, shame.   Also, you editorialized the headline in this post, which is kind of bad form.  No I didn't, that was a result of the suggest title.      Inoffensive is rather a harsh term in my book.   Some films = entertainment, sure I get it, but when something is so lifeless and slapped together makes you wonder who is at fault here?  People bitching about the lack of original movies don't go see original movies (fuck sake they think mad max and dredd are somehow original)  Movie making by numbers. A computer could write the script, hit the beats, put in the awful dialogue and away you go.   Which is fine when it makes money.  But it is like they sometimes don't think they need to try anymore. Just tie it together and push it out.   Outside of the animation people and the score there was zero artistry in that movie.   Oh reddit comments did. Yeah I dunno if that counts.   Shame on some people for wanting to discuss the movie, shame   I think he makes good points.     Maybe he has particular reasons for it.   Like how I won't pay money to watch the FIFA film etc   what a shit trailer    Yeah 30,000 years is the number. http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/21/dogs-may-have-lived-with-humans-30000-years  http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/05/22/408784216/who-let-the-dogs-in-we-did-about-30-000-years-ago  Which in terms of human history is pretty fucking ancient.  You really are picking the one person to try and one up there sunshine.   Bad troll or genuine idiot? I can't tell which one you are.       I can't tell if this is trolling or genuine. Either way it's not working.         Meet The Spartans is fairly perfect  Southland Tales is a grand failure     A Sport and a Pastime was recommended to me on here. I have it somewhere, just got distracted. Better pull it out so   sad but true   Then the Guardian are saying it is very funny   Oh yes I understand. China is an embarrassment in terms of how it treats animals. The same edgy users on here who think torturing live animals to eat to ward off the summer heat  is culturally acceptable are the same ones who will criticise the very same people who eat rhino horns to get an erection.       I would have to say yes after seeing this   I actually think that is off. I think it is 14-21 now. Average age 17. Has to be.   I am confused, what are you trying to say?     Crazy   6 reds is a lot though   I think it is the reason many fucking hate him. Not that he isn't a good player etc just that the guy dishes it out and yet will throw himself on the floor at any moment   it might have made you feel smarter I dunno     I mentioned the blackout in china which is upcoming for a couple months (chinese only films)  I wonder did this create a kind of push to see this before it came into effect    I must be looking at different eggs   It's the wild west now in digital distribution. A few successful voices are very loud and influential and everyone standing in the shadows echoes it because they think they will be the next in line.   In what context. Food and agriculture? Ok. Exactly. My point.   What was yours?   As expected, because you have nothing.  (inb4 k or think what you want or something to that effect before you run off...)  Snowflakes, when their awesomely unique idea(l)s are challenged, do quickly turn into cowards      Eh,   I never mentioned it, everyone knows this, nothing to do with the reality of musicians earnings  I just explained that point, in the very sentence you pasted. Are you serious? You actually answered your post for me. How everyones knows about the new ways to do those things, but it doesn't change the reality about earnings.  Which was the topic.    The only way musicians are going to have a chance at making real money from their music is if we do away with record companies, which is what the internet is doing.  And again I said it wasn't, all it did was open the gates and allow millions to scramble for the meagres. No *real* money involved. Only the lucky few will get anything, much like the system with labels.  Again, would you like to come back to the topic on hand and address that?    I know the average redditor is pigshit ignorant but christ the comments across the board regarding this issue, from cultural this to animal that, have been fucking sickening.   And when you think most redditors are from developed nations with decent educations it makes you wonder where the planet is going.  Oh and the fucking edge. Don't get me started.    Way to address nothing there.   I say again the internet has changed nothing in practical monetary earning terms, it just opened the pool to everyone.   We are not talking about the new ability to distribute, advertise etc etc, I never mentioned it, everyone knows this, nothing to do with the reality of musicians earnings, but of course you brought it up as some proof how right you are, baffling  I'd ask you to actually argue but I don't think you want to. The fact you really do think you are right is insane to me.    We are talking about the internet changing things, dumping labels and allowing artists to earn money.  You go off on a tangent which is irrelevant to the fact that all it has done it made a level playing field for millions, and so with everyone scrambling for money few earn, the exact same way it is now.  Do you understand?    , so that's somehow a bad thing?   Course it is. Most musicians will fucking tell you this. A saturated market is now just fucked.  Deals, beiber, money - yawn - heard it all before. Nothing you say is new. I can't stress this enough.   Snowflake generation. No doubt in my mind.   Why would there be one?  The ignorance of people baffles me.   And it is the same pathetic 'superior' stance.     I explained it to another user who actually asked instead of just ignorantly preaching off topic as you did.   And deep down you probably still think you are right and I am just a dumbshit. Christ in fuck. Snowflake generation.     Google human dog relationship in history. Simple.    The only thing the internet is doing is making a somewhat open playground for vomit. The chances of making money are probably slimmer considering the sheer numbers who have no gates to cross to get places. No surprise you become famous online or whatever and you still sign with a record company in the end. It's a great online  reddit snowflake generation fantasy but it is not the truth.  Keep in mind the user above didn't even understand his own argument and started going on about organising gigs and all of this.  Nothing to do with it.  And I already know the arguments which are going to come in now. Every time the same ones.   No it isn't. The relationship of dog and human is ancient and far more complex. Do some research.   Every time the same pathetic 'superior' arguments.    No, it really isn't. Everything you will say I have heard before. Comes back to this - no it really isn't.           which is what the internet is doing  It really truly isn't   who is saying it isn't a parody?   eh         [hhhehehe....](http://i.imgur.com/wjANVCD.jpg?fb)   tis indeed !     2.7 billion, big number dude, can't see it, initial buzz will go, film has little to offer in terms of repeat viewings etc and no gimmick    TIL   yet I'd still dip my dick in it again     you are 100% right  but it was a joke mate   wasn't much better than 2   crazy course, enjoyable but crazy   I am too drunk to google that word so I will interpret it as *brilliant*   the way of the future    it's not great at all, disappointing, just generic to be honest     it's at best mediocre   modern tick the boxes move making, the sort that makes chris nolan = genius    most of the people who have upvoted you have no contact with hippies or druids or whatever... kinda hipstery if you think about it   nope, not a hope   cool, am gonna try check it out asap   Think it is over now. Spieth.   edit: kiss death there   can you actually imagine if they had a cam trying to show the view of Day? shaky cam stuff? and I dont mean this as a joke     I have a potato face too         best I get is 'you got the body of fat chris pratt'   sounds a very fine line situation whether they can pull the humour off    Euro-style humor that is funny by not being funny.   #3232;_ #3232;     Interesting, will def watch it at some point.     The film begins with a continuous four-minute take that starts on a television screen showing a Hindi soap opera and pulls out into the street, where armed gangs are furiously searching for a man, gunning down anyone in their path who might be his ally. They bomb his house. When the pressure becomes too much to bear, there is a cut, and with it, an exhale. But there is no loss of tension. The film powers forward, relentless, for the next five hours.  Sounds pretty amazing.   I think he was taking that into account. 4th or 5th paragraph down lists the few meagre funnies in it.          that much money things get mega complicated though  might be a case of nodding heads and looking at the final balance statement    Textbook in some ways, and a scary story considering what went on in Russia at the time. Cheers OP   I find seals terrifying  Saw one last week in the river in my city, big fucker, just hanging out   drugs   http://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/search?q=charles+whitman restrict_sr=on sort=relevance t=all not even a month ago and fairly common knowledge    No, not at all.

 You're right.  Very tramatic moment.   I remember reading about that. When that scene happened I was immediately remembering that article.  It's absolutely horrifying that people would pass the buck onto another person like that but I expect that's only natural.  They even said it in the show "no one exacted to watch someone die before their eyes."   That scene in psycho pass where the man is beating that woman with a hammer.  The sound got me the most.   To be honest I didn't think people hated her.  Maybe mock/parody her image but it's all in good spirit.   I felt the same way man.  Won the war, lost his girl and fuckin rossio is in charge.  I loved the show, wasn't a fan of the ending.   Damn dude.  Aight well if that changes I'll be at the library around 930-10am.   Would anyone like to meet up for a ride?  We can meet at the library?   I just got one of those acouple weeks ago.  I'm in love.   Shock of the lightning is a great song.   It would be cool if they included other tricks for different attacks.     I think a prequel to "the devil is a part-timer"  would be pretty cool.     Or a green lightsaber.   Ohhh ya wasn't R4-D4 or something like that? I remember the scene but ya a small homage would be pretty cool.      Yea, it's called a spank bank.   The orange box.  It might be my 50th play though, never gets old.   Ya sure,  I'm not doing anything better with my time.   Hey I'm jealous of you man.  If I can go back in time to my first motorcycle ride I would in a heart beat.  Good luck out there,  it only gets better and better.   This was a great show, I was passed that it didn't get a second season.      Better to ask for forgiveness than permission.  You should listen to your parents though,  they love you and just don't want you to kill yourself.   I did that for about a year it's risky.   They hate us cause they ain't us!   I work at my mother's sign shop.  I take calls and go out on jobs.  But a lot of my job is just keeping our workspace clean and organized.   Boker kwaiken flipper.  VG-10 steel, looks amazing, sweet and smooth flipping motion.   You just wanted to keep your harem...I think he would have understood.   My curse, end of a heartache, always are all pretty good songs.   You should add some killswitch engaged.     Wasn't this show on netflix? Is it still airing on there?   Get all your paper work together.  Get the money together.  Check out the bike, take it for a test ride, check the oil, check the body work and if you like it give him the money and leave.   God dammit...just take my upvote.   A single banana.   Nice bike man.  Is this your first?   I'm you're near chicago I'll sell you my cb900c.  $1700.   Ya life sometimes seems pretty stale.   I'm suprised no one has mentioned fullmetal alchemist: brotherhood.  What I loved the most about that show is how they give you such a great insight into past tragedies and then you realize that EVERYTHING connects back to the Elric brothers.  I just think that show was beautifully written.   Young Frankenstein.  I love that movie.   I really liked this movie.  I would have really wanted to see a sequel.   I love this!   Besides the dorky hand movements...this isn't a bad song.  	40
 No the current standard in any modernised country are MCB's which are Miniature Circuit Breakers for domestic installations. No idea why you would think otherwise for the UK.   Most old installations have what we call rewireable fuses that have a significantly higher trip time and ampage capacity. So therefore a large amount of current can be flowing for a lot longer before the blow. They don't exactly blow but the wire just melts and this is why we don't use them any more. The new standards in the current 17th edition wiring regs clearly state that those kind of fuses can no longer be used in rewires or new builds. Edit: this post was to indicate I wasn't talking about Cartridge fuses which are of course still legal but never used in a domestic distro board.   The uk has one of the highest Standards of electrical safety in the world. As below says I'll take my electric with a double safety standard any day. No earth to protect your appliances and yourself is the crazy thing. If you want a horror story try looking over at /r/electricians some of the stuff people post from the third world countries are scary as shit.   I will never understand why in new iterations of electrical practices they use U for voltage in equations it was explained to me why but still doesn't make much sense.... what was wrong with V!   Thanks for your reply mate. Yeah I understand these problems are a crux for local electrcians to deal with. Specially with how the housing market is at the moment. I have offered my services for free as well as well under a labourers daily fee and still no luck. My situation is kind of unique as well I'm not qualifying to become an electrician so to speak but to be qualified to do set lighting for the film industry which requires you to be a qualified spark. Just kind of frustrating is all!    Hi guys I'm new to this subreddit so just wanted some basic info and to introduce myself. I live in Wales in the UK and I'm currently studying towards fully qualifying, I am part qualified already to the C G level 2. Soon I will have finished level 3 and will be working towards my NVQ. My biggest question is, are there any Welsh electricians using this sub that could help me in the long run? All my very local companies are highly unhelpful and I'm at wits end trying to get practical experience.  So any tips or leads would be extremely helpful! Thanks in advance guys :) oh and as an edit I would like to add that I live in south wales!   I think you'll find that a lot of homes around the world including america but specially here in the uk still have rewirable fuses on their distribution boards. They are still legal but nowhere near as safe for blowing out in risky high amp situations. And also not legal to put in to new houses or when doing a rewire on an old house.   	7

 Yup.  I first saw her on Supernatural, where she was a demon master thief.  She rocked a posh English accent.  She looked great all washed up, too.  Her Georgian accent is OK but wanting.     It's an Italian thing done to make themselves sound like singing in an American production with nobody speaking any English.  I love.  My brain keeps searching for something but can't find a phrase.  The cheat is that they use "ooh-rah" exactly where "alright" would appear.  It's a catchy tune.  Very well done.  Anyhow.  I'm still scouring this thread for non-English speakers weighing in on American accents.  Few and far between.   https://www.reddit.com/r/HeyCarl/   I lived in London briefly and with a natural SW Virginia accent -- I had a girlfriend at the time, but oh I could sense pheremones in the air.   "Ma!  Where's my Red Sox hat at" was actually pretty good.   SW Virginia checking in.  I always associated him with Alabama, but say a public official who is over the top officious.   Seriously -- they're obsessive about it.   Australia's the same way too.  The UK used to make any animal imported go into quarantine.  Fluffy the cat from NYC who'd never been outside in her life?  3 month quarantine or she's not coming in.  This is why Jonny Depp got into trouble with the Aussie with his lap dogs.   Family law.  Divorce gone seriously bad, I'd bet.    What a nightmare.  The good news is that whoever did it will likely be found very very quickly.   Cat showing dominance x infinity.  Control of food bowl = control of dog.   https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/4545327104/hDEEAB757/   I'm in zone 2 and regularly leave my car in one spot for mulitiple weeks.  I don't drive very often.  OP it depends on your immediate neighborhood.  Street cleaning rarely happens unlike say NYC.  I don't think I've ever been affected by it.  DC lets Mother Nature clean the streets.    How long it takes to find a spot is up to your immediate traffic patterns.  For me, Friday nights is the worst, but I know not to drive on Sunday mornings due to all of the churches in the vicinity.  The absolute worst is when a neighbor throws a party and hires parking attendants to valet park their guests' cars.  Every block within reasonable walking distance gets shut down.  I like having my own car.  You can easily live without one if need be though -- zipcar is quite the rage these days.  Do a cost/benefit calculation.   I... I...   I don't know what to say.  http://www.themarysue.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/athan-fillion-gif-cap-300x172.png   Somehow I think the 420 break is on the other side of the communication.   I heard it was closed to tours, but could be wrong.    There's a US Navy museum nearby that apparently is awesome.  This new bridge annoys me.  But London long ago closed off the Thames to large ships.   I just went digging for it and couldn't find it on WaPo -- share?  This btw sounds like something I would do.  That race was fixed.   There's a sad end to this story though.  Remember [Aldrich Ames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aldrich_Ames#Some_CIA_sources_betrayed)?  The S.O.B. gave him up to the Soviets and he was executed.   England's rabies-free.  But I don't doubt they wanted to double check.   I get it that a debit card would get declined, but not a credit card.  Visa gives you a pre-set spending limit and you can charge up to that no matter what.  Do credit cards work differently in the EU?   I've always regarded Patton as being the finest biographical movie ever made.    Ken Burns' Civil War would be the first documentary that I'd recommend.   I live in DC.  These polls are always crap -- we're a city of 600K crammed into a teensy space.    It'd be like comparing Manhattan or maybe even just the Upper East Side to a state.    Still, the city definitely runs on booze.  But also, I'd say only a third of the people in the federal government live here as opposed to the burbs of Northern Virginia and Maryland.     It's in the game thread under "Umpires confirm foul-ball call" -- that's exactly what I saw.     I didn't see it.  Perhaps an x-post?   There is nothing like a Harper at bat this deep in the game.   I'm so glad he got a curtain call.  He must be thrilled!   Yeah he needs to knock off the interpretive swan dance.     Fun fact on the thumbnail pic: a few hours later, DC got smacked by a rogue midnight T-storm, the worst since 2012, and the scouts had to flee for cover.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/06/30/obama-to-girl-scouts-what-are-you-guys-doing-in-my-yard/?hpid=z3   What is that animal running around the car?  His doggie?  Wildlife?   That was some Harding administration level fixing.   I think they did it voluntarily.   I went to a wedding near Morristown in the Fall once.  I was staggered by how pretty it is.  And I grew up in the Blue Ridge -- I know something about pretty.   Oh is it chrome?  It looked iPod white to me on first glance.     Good looking torch.  It looks like they might've been influenced by Apple stylings.     I dunno about that.  I remember during the Vancouver Winter Olympics, Digg sent a reporter to interview alpine skier Julie Mancuso.  The format was no holds barred as there was no FCC involved, but the interview was announced 48 hours before it began so diggers could submit questions and she had to answer the top ten "digg'd" questions.  It was a wonderful interview -- she had dug in in a chalet, was wearing a cuter Russian fur hat for fun, and happily bit on the more salacious digg'd questions.  She was in her element.  I thought it was one of the single best athlete interviews I've ever seen.    At the time, I thought that I was seeing for the first time what new media was truly capable of.    Then Digg imploded.    No NBC, no BBC, no whatever press operations wanting to get to her, and all they had to do was listen in for content.  IT WAS GREAT.  The single best Mancuso interview I've ever seen.  It wouldn't have been not that hard for reddit to adapt that format to LIVE AMA  Digg was ahead of its times.  Here's pic of Julie in that era:  http://juliamancuso.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/image-6.jpg   I never knew dogs could raise their eyebrows in all "what is this fresh hell?"   I ruthlessly cleared out my DVR last night.  The Buffy marathon is looking tempting.      I think they had a far worse fate planned than an ordinary redrum.   I love this skit!  The body of Pontiac with a door from an Olds 88.    What great attention to detail!   I've got them on my DVR but not watched yet.  Glad to hear you like -- I've heard iffy things and frankly I thought season 1 was over-praised, Harrelson and McConnaughey's performances excepted.  I'm going to watch them and then make the decision.     That's the reference.  Except these cats look like they don't want to play so much a cut somebody.   I've seen the first two eps and while not sold on it, it's OK.  I'm toying with turning off HBO until Game of Thrones comes back though.  I wouldn't miss it.     Is it just me or do they look woefully underdressed for that kind of cold?  This winter was apparently one of the most brutal Europe had ever seen.   You can tell who's more adventurous (girl on the balcony) and who's the attention whore (girl out of pose with her knee over the windowsill), etc.   I think only if the /r/sports mods have had trouble with the reddit front office.  If so, absolutely.    Do you want to get shot by Florida Man?  This is how you get shot by Florida Man.   ELI5 decided not to join the protest in I think a very well-reasoned post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3by1v9/why_isnt_eli5_participating_in_the_default/  I'd think /r/dc would be wise to follow this line of thinking.  Unless of course there have been problems with the admins, but I can't see how they'd want to mess with a city subreddit.     It's metastasizing too -- /r/facepalm is about to go private, too.    I hope /r/nationals doesn't.     I read an article about it -- nope, but they were able to splice and dice enough footage to make a usuable ad.  I always felt bad for the "sophisticated couple" extras across from him.  They had to be thrilled to be acting opposite Orson Welles... and this happens.   I don't know.  I bet they will.  I had a pair of 1K+ link karma links that are now in private r/'s and my total karma didn't take a hit.  This leads me to believe that they're still there, just hidden.     Yes.  I think once a sub goes private, comments disappear.  I'd been talking about the protest on r/videos, it went private while I was out, and they're gone now.     I had no idea the big /r/ mods were this alienated from the admins.  I hope this isn't our Digg 4.0 moment.    Ohanion's not helping things, which makes me really nervous.   chooter got fired today and the mods of many of the default r/'s have set themselves to private in protest.  Lots of bad juju floating around right now.  Here's a pretty good summary:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bxduw/why_was_riama_along_with_a_number_of_other_large/   Great.  Reddit's imploding and now this.     I dunno.  He got the double and later scored.  That doens't totally suck.   I just took a 50 question test and missed only this:  3) Name one American Indian tribe in the United States. A. Metis B. Macedonian C. Arawak D. Maya  Metis never heard of, Macedonian obviously wrong, Arawak are Caribbean, so it must be Maya.  Wrong.  Arawak.    That's not right.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arawak   Either that or this is the end of the road for Ellen Pao.  I hope Alex Ohanian awakes from his slumber.    Until we know more, this could turn out to be a good thing.   Holy crap, this is the first I've heard of this.  What a mess:  https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/3bw39q/why_has_riama_been_set_to_private/   My thoughts exactly on the details.  I grew up in Roanoke and OP included the Star -- the huge neon Mill Mountain Star that overlooks the valley.    http://cdn.meme.am/instances/48505750.jpg   This link was embedded in the description:  http://www.palestineherald.com/news/bushey-shooting-videos-released/article_34b8e3ec-1f82-11e5-9e3c-0bcf0658377a.html  The guy was an alcoholic and presumably drunk.     Whoa, my hometown of Roanoke in the news!  The man with a camper, wife and three teenage girls has courage.     That looks very Georgetown.  I feel like I've walked past it -- very familiar.  Dumbarton Street maybe?  Google dent place washington dc for Dent Place.  It's only two blocks.  I just streetviewed it but whiffed; you may have a better eye.  I'm surprised this address isn't on the web.  I hit IMDb and it turns out this building was also Diana Prince's house in Wonder Woman.     I swear to God that Chris Pratt is the most charming man on the planet right now.   They're re-doing Scream apparently.    I don' want to watch because I know they'll never come close at all to Drew Barrymore's death sequence.  What a forgettable network.  In the 80's and 90's they were all that mattered on cable.   Here is the N W 611 upon being restored recently -- not too far off from this concept.  https://youtu.be/ByYlkrN97aM?t=3m   Patton.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x156uvg_patton-s-opening-speech-to-the-troops-george-c-scott_shortfilms   I live in Georgetown.  This sounds right.  Google streetview Wisconsin and Dent Place and walk yourself west.  I remember they had an ep about forming up a neighborhood watch just about the same time my neighborhood was thinking about setting up a watch.  I was annoyed.    I remember the setting was in the West Village somehow.  The West Village is different from me.  Dent Place is way up there, too.    Anyhow OP post a screenshot and I might recognize it.    DC's a tough nut to crack.  Once it does, it's wonderful.    The single thing worst thing you can do is hole up.    I first moved here in '85 and apparently it's still the same.  I watched a lot of TV in my first few months, then things blossomed.     Blech.  Rain delays + Nationals = nothing good.   That is the scariest fucking thing I have ever seen in my life.  Who on earth would even take possession of such a thing?!  I truly hope I'm being trolled.   Buffarene giveaway?  What's that?   I know.  Giancarlo's injury perhaps giving him pause?   Of House Greybeard.     Upvote.  This thing ain't over.   I would've been torn myself.  Wahoo by birth and degree but I really like Tech.  I would've worn Nats red instead of U.Va. orange.  It seems like a false dichotomy.  Do Terps vs. Wahoos and I'll wear orange and be obnoxious.   OOOOH SO CLOSE!   Huggla!!!  I love how his salary is still being paid by Barves front office.   TIL  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_game   I thought another monsoon was going to strike down there at 11pm -- this game now is now official?     Actually, I'm American but a total Olympics geek.  I'm always mystified as to how the four sub-nations comprising the UK can't get its act together for the Olympics.  They have no problem with Scotsman Andy Murray winning the tennis gold for the UK.   Ooh.  You might be right.  I forgot that it's not England in the Olympics but the full United Kingdom.    Wiki's unclear:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_2016_Summer_Olympics#Women.27s_qualification  Edited to add:  Nope the four home associations couldn't agree.  No U.K. in the Olympics  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_UEFA_Women%27s_Olympic_Qualifying_Tournament   That was my thinking too.  It would've been nice to see say Kawasumi interviewed via translator.   She's got Rio to look forward to next summer, too.   Yeah that's the problem with getting down there for me.  Too close to fly, too far to drive.   My family's got a place in Litchfield.  I love it down there.  Myrtle not so much though.    How's the weather?  Did you all get clobbered by that storm system last night?   I see what you did there.     England just Mets out of the tourney.   Jesus -- 120F on the field?!  That's life threatening.   Quick question: in the mens WC the trainers had that magic spray can that somehow helped the players when they went down.    How come the women don't get it and WTF is it?   I'm sorry I can't hear you over the sound of my air-conditioners.  -- USA  (j/k I was in Paris for a heatwave once and it was hell.  Take a cold bath or if none, hop in the shower start it at lukewarm and lower it to cold.)   Or that freaky bald Emperor Palpatine lookalike.  That guy was great.  The Ed Hochuli of soccer.   I get the distinct impression FIFA's having problems finding WC-class refs who aren't American.     Crap call for Japan, then a make-up for England.  I have no problem with this.   I've both Metro'd and driven out of crowded Nats games.  Via car, once you're out of the vicinity of the stadium, it's fine.    I'd imagine getting across the South Capitol Street bridge would be a snap.     Whoa.  Italy without pasta and tomato sauce.  Must've been a bummer to live there back then.  I wonder why the Italian cuisine went in that direction and the rest of Europe didn't.  Maybe it's easier to grow tomatoes in Italy?   Consider that the tomato is indigenous to South America.    The great Italian recipes with tomato sauce?  They didn't exist until well after Columbus.     Excellent!  The airlines with all their consolidation over the past decade have become an old boys club.  I bet this is just the beginning of something bigger.   They replaced the entire grid in Georgetown in 2001-2002.  It was a massive pain -- the power was intentionally shut off for a night every month or so.  But, the power hasn't gone off since.  Derecho, hurricanes, snowpocalypse -- nothing.        It is SO cool seeing those highlights without the announcers play by play.   Junior High School, perhaps '74.  There was something amajigger that could compute.  It mystified me but I could see was cool.  I didn't have access to a mainframe until college, perhaps '81.  I thought they were cute diversions until I saw a spell check program work on a laptop in '85.  That's when I knew the world had changed.   Relax.  The same thing's been going on since the founding of the Republic.  The news cycle makes it worse and more pronounced, but don't forget that people can only vote every 2 years.    Sometimes, the country gets together but that's not normal.   I was hoping to annoy inter-disciplinary redditors, but   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyfOh2za-po   Holy crap, is that really happening?!  They're in the East Room for the night, I'd bet.   Ah, then I might've slept through the 2012 midnight T-storm.  I just don't remember thunder   lightning like this post-midnight.  No question that this was nowhere close to the dercho.     Whoa.  autowkibot patrols /r/Nationals?    This is something.  What this something is, I dunno.   I was.  Are you referring to the derecho?  That happened much earlier in the night.     Holy crap.  She was at 21 the youngest FLOTUS.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Folsom_Cleveland_Preston  Somehow, I don't think we'll ever see that record beaten.   I've got an 18 pound short-haired orange tabby who is the largest cat I've ever encountered.   Is this a domestic cat or a lynx or something?  Perhaps you are petite?   Well, in the Coolidge administration, yes.  Very odd choices by the Nats with their POTUS's.    They seem to be stocking up on post-Teddy pre-FDR characters, and now we get the great Prohibitionist? Not good for beer sales on South Capitol.   Where the heck did this storm come from?  Normally we get clobbered like this in the hours immediately following sunset.  I don't remember a non-hurricane storm in the middle of the night like this.       thanks to Title IX   That's all anybody needed to read.   A Brit nailing Valley Girl vocal fry?!    Like, very impressive.   I don't think it's fair to tie the Packers to this guy.  It doesn't look like they had any warnings of his behavior.     John Locke is overrated.   Oddly enough, just last week I saw the first sensible defense of that ending.  The reason he became a lumberjack was because as a child in that container, he saw his mother murdered via chainsaw.  So he picked up up a vocation that uses chainsaws to expunge the horror.  It still sucked, but maybe less so now.   Oh yeah, of course the tree canopy changes every decade or so.  But I know there are still trees in that spot on the Capitol grounds -- you'll notice they're slightly north of the Senate wing.  It's pretty green along the sides of the Mall.     Dunno how well this link will work, but it appears the construction site is probably where that pic was taken from, but you'll notice trees just west of it:  https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=zl1XyXXdJ-Yw.kvVMosuox5jw hl=en_US    Not a definitive answer, but I remember reading something maybe two years ago that kale supposedly has more nutrients than other leafy greens such as spinach.  I have hated kale since boyhood and still do.  I can't wait for this fad to die.   Hodor!   I might accept that challenge.  But it'd be a little underwhelming -- I too live in DC and all of the ones I recognized are the same.  That pic of the White House threw me a little bit though.  I think the portion that's got the trees on the roof is actually the East Wing, which is now the First Lady's base of operations and the main actual entrance to get into the White House.  They must've have a promenade on the roof back then.  The West Wing wasn't built until the 30's or so.  The Castle, the Capitol, Treasury, what was then the State   War Department and is now the Eisenhower Building -- they all look exactly the same.  I don't recognize the Printing   Engraving Building or the Pension Office.  They may have been razed since these were taken.     Before tuning out -- OP that was a TERRIFIC play by play up there!   Here is NBC's Leigh Diffey broadcasting F1 from Monaco:  https://i.imgur.com/o1gEC62.jpg   What is that buzzing noise that sounds like an aircraft engine?   That's been in the back of my mind since the soccer halftime.   Dagger for the USA!!!   I am.  This is almost certainly going to decide the championship -- Germany/USA are both considered stronger than England or Japan.    It's not a bad game so far.  They're duelling each other.     Not entirely true.  Royal Navy operations had to be suspended in the North Atlantic, which is what the US was mostly angry about.  Yes the White House got burned, but that was it.  The Brits had to pull out of DC a day later.  Hardly the capital being razed.    It was an unpopular war that resulted in a stalemate.  I've always viewed it as settling remaining contentions from the Revolution.   Give it a better wingspan and it looks very much like Lilienthaler's pioneering gliders.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:More_otho_flying.JPG   John C. Flood got me out of a serious heating problem a few years ago.  I really like that company.     ^^^ This is the OP here, folks.  I saw it a few nights ago in r/pics  https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/3beutv/this_is_what_a_320_bacon_and_egg_roll_from/   Me too.  Nats fan here who has the game on in the kitchen whenever I'm home, half-paying attention to it.     I saw this photo pop up elsewhere.  Is this confirmed to be Gates?  He was born in '55, appears to be ten or so here, which makes this photo in '65.  This photo looks like it's from the 70's -- color, that style of bike, the way he's dressed.     Bingo.  As soon as I saw a trailer for The King's Speech, I thought blatant Oscar bait.  It was a perfectly charming movie though.   How could they possibly be smiling after a day like they'd had?   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyssa_sylvatica   DAE think this is kind of douchey?   I grew up in the 70's and those Schwinn banana seat bikes were a must for any boy of the era.  I get incredibly nostalgic anytime I see one.     You're the redditor running it?  It looks promising.    I love tracking the bids.   I didn't know https://www.reddit.com/r/olympicgamesbids existed.    Subscribed!  Interesting to see Switzerland interested in hosting even a youth games.       Here it is over Washington, DC:  https://i.imgur.com/OBBW4Y8.jpg   Lucky Bar.  It's the go-to soccer bar.   Love it!   I was in my garden and watching the radar loops on the Post so I knew full well it was coming.  When it hit, I dived back into the kitchen and kind of had caveman-level terror.  I have never heard the tree canopy make that kind of sound, not even in a hurricane.    Anyhow, I never get tired of that Jefferson Memorial video linked in the article.     I dunno about that.  I walk past that house once or twice a month and only now noticed that it has a basement level.  Three story house on Olive Street and abutting Rose Park?  $1.1M actually sounds like a steal.  Good luck finding a parking spot nearby though.   50% idiot + 50% too much gin last night.      I've lived in Georgetown for 25 years and don't recognize them.  My bet is that it -- not surprisingly -- came from upstream on the Potomac.         It's more that that issue just now popped up as a leading article on washingtonpost.com.    I wonder if somebody's trying to send a signal or just foster chaos.  It's weird.  I knew PR was having financial difficulties but they have been for years.  *edit: OK now I see that their bonds mature on July 1st every year.  My panties are no longer twisted.*   To my mind, the leading clubs are the Metropolitan and the University clubs.  Cosmos Club is more merit-based.    I've never been attracted to the club culture though.    The City Tavern Club is the only one I truly considered joining.  Don't join National Press unless you're a journalist.  I love that space though.  Many happy evenings spent there.  If you are a journalist, snap it up.   The timing of this makes me wonder if it's a real crisis or somebody trying to scramble the markets before Wall Street opens tomorrow morning.   I love it when the Millenials embrace historic local music.  This vid reminds me of this:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IbsQJBxICN0   Stalin + engineering + possibility of certain death?  Yikes.  Edit b/c I was warned by the bot: at what point do these people go "oh hell no!" and let these systems become obsolete.    And at what point did the Soviets think this was a good idea?  Terrifying their comrades who are simply trying to commute?   "You're coming with me and if you forget the frisbee this time, I will cut you."   Have you ever ticketed somebody for chewing gum?  I spent a night at the Raffles once, pre-modernization.  Ever taken a call there?             You didn't watch it all the way through, did you?  Some of the creepiest stuff on YouTube starts with something innocuous to keep the censors away.  This is a classic example.   "rebuked in Dubuque" -- better than "Banned in Boston"!  Anyhow, this is like Florence Jenkins, a notoriously unaware horrible opera singer:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DjURO9L5fdc      Why do weekdays?  Fun fact that nobody seems to know: parking is free on Sundays in Georgetown.  Come in, walk/bus to Foggy Bottom, and the Metro is yours.  I drive from SW Virginia to DC all the time, which means the full length of I-66.  It's not difficult.   That was the moment I realized Community had gone from smart to sublime.   My favorites were his musical cold openings.     I came to the show late an that took me forever to grasp.  The occasional references to the Soviets still existing threw me for a loop.     Some can, and well.  Max Scherzer of the Nats is doing very well.     FYI this was a joking reference to Nixon's possible return post-Watergate: "He's tanned, rested, and ready."   I live in DC and pretty much grew up without baseball.  When the Nats came to town, I started to really get into it.  I remember that just about the time I understood what an opposite field homerun was that I really began to enjoy it.  Now the Nats are awesome and watch or listen to pretty much every game.     I just finished the Mr. Robot pilot.  Financial market meltdown imminent.  So, basically I'd be living in Athens in real life.   Excellent choice!  Classic moment in TV history.  With all the hype around Survivor that summer, it was basically the show sticking the landing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBSMBfoMVHk   Those of us in DC will never recover from the Nats' NLDS collapse against the Cardinals.  One strike away from winning the series, and...  http://washington.cbslocal.com/2012/10/13/epic-fail-washington-nationals-collapse-vs-st-louis-cardinals-in-game-5-nlds/   I read that it had to do with wanting to avoid Apple's liabilities.  He didn't want to be held responsible for any debt or something.   Aqua 301 is really nice.  I bet they do brunch but look them up.   The poor boat was sunk in Singapore and raised.  Complete agreement with everybody that if she were still sea-worthy, we should be all in on preserving her.  But she already sank.  It's hard for a vessel to come back from that.   Patton.    George C. Scott gets all the press for his rightly-earned accolades, but when you take a step back, it's the absolute best biographical film ever made.  There was some love and effort in getting the script right.  DDL's Lincoln and MLK in Selma should've done the same but screwed things up.  I also think Patton's one of the best war films ever made.   Yup.  They wouldn't let her do the full bikini thing -- her butt would've been much sleeker, like modern beauties.    The corset thing sort of hid it, but when you see her move, it does look like she was wearing a diaper.  The ep I saw had something to do with the rescue of a scientist with a secret potion.  Diana loved kicking a Nazi's ass once as Wonder Woman.  She was actually in danger in this ep.  Roddy McDowall did Wonder Woman?!    George King of Falafel.  28th   M.  They might let you eat al fresco if you ask nicely.   Yup.  She was mad about the padding throughout the filming.  I recently saw an ep on a OTA alternate channel for nostalgia sake where she rescued a crazy scientist or something.  She looked weird with the bikini bottom stuffed like that.  This was the same era of Charlie's Angels so I don't know why she was made to do this.   I do!  DirecTV with an over-the-air add-on and a woefully maxed-out DVR.    Bonus: it's hooked up to a CRT television.  I can't stand watching TV over the internets.  Lower quality, horrible sound, etc.    Mind you the only thing I watch live are sports or the occasional season finale.  Sometimes reality TV eps in order to bitch   moan live online.    Edit: Plus live newscasts -- you can't beat live TV when a hurricane or blizzard is in the mix.      Breaking Bad, easily.  I watched the pilot as it first aired.  It had been getting favorable pre-reviews across the board.  I have DirecTV so it wasn't even in HD at the time, which might have made WW's tightie whities a little easier to take.  Had I seen them in HD I might've bailed.  2nd choice would be Buffy.  I fudge on the rules a little though: the first ep I saw is what turned out to be the S1 finale, however, S1 was a half-season.  They re-ran that half season in order over the summer, I watched or VCR'd each ep and then launched into S2 without missing a beat.  I plead forgiveness for fudging as this was the late 90's.

Pre-nups are fine for second marriages when there are children in the mix.  They're effectively a component of estate planning.  For first marriages they're a crock.

Gotta hand it to England.  They were getting shelled and defended beautifully.     Many thanks!   I can't believe I was right in remember it was Jacoby.    Great sleuthing.    As if anybody needs a new reason to hate the Phillies.   My first thought, too.  I loved how he wound up interviewing the construction crew and dedicating the broadcast to them.  He had absolutely nothing to do with his air time.   I know you can't have them in Nats Park, at least the last time I asked.   I give it 10 more minutes.   There was an ad for I think TV's with one of the Redskins original Hogs -- (Joe Jacoby?) -- who upon being introduced responds with an incredibly flat "and yes."    My google-fu is weak.     Call ahead and let them know what you're doing.  I've never witnessed one myself, but the myth is that they flip over this happening.     I wuz just trying to say he wearing exactly what a white guy collegiate player would wear unless he didn't bite on the elaborate fashion-forward/fashion-disaster route.  If he'd come from a preppy school and been selected by the Jazz especially.    He needed his persona to be credible, nailed it, and funzies began.   There was some sort of a governor on the turret that wouldn't let them fire when the gun was pointed at the tail.    They had an onboard communication link with the pilot though, so they'd tell him to cut one way or another and square off of on the attacking aircraft.  These beasts could outdive anything though.   I know how to adjust volume levels.  I could've nailed it and handed the iPod off to the real musicians.   The Titanic pic made me laugh.  I normally hate this kind of thing, too.   These are all journalistic interns.  They're running to get the copy of the decision to their network's/magazine's/newspaper's legal analysts.    It's a grand tradition.

 Well...if you're constantly sending picture after picture it's annoying.    I lost again   Actually that was the sound of "Please fuck off you're annoying me" about to break up w/you    Awwww look at those cuuuties!!!! They're gonna be best fwiends forever! There just the cutest wittle babies, theyre so fluffy IM GONNA DIEEEE!! Such a baby cutie kitty mrow mrow   /r/FloridaMan   I lost the game   I don't understand. It just looks like you both grew from when you were younger...   But every month has Friday the 13th....      Did the joke go over your head ? lol   420,737   Check your number. You just copied mine. I don't know what your flair means- you wrote it.        420,735   Perfect.    reminds me of that south park episode       OP 0   Reddit 251606   It's different for everyone. There's no magic number that's the same for everyone.    OP Pls   You seem angry.       1   Makes sense to me. Sniper weapons don't ink as much. I don't think they are good for Turf War format. Honestly, anytime I have a teammate with one I just disconnect. I played for a long time and it's just horrible They go like 2-12 with 2-400Pts. Very little ink. They just sit in one spot and try and snipe people. Even if they move around inking they don't ink a lot.   So like I said, I understand your opinion. That's cool. I got no problem with differing opinions. I just disagree.    So   420,611   420,609   So   lmao    Volunteer with his campaign in your area. Or, like for us, we had people come from all over the country to help where I was in Ohio. So you can travel and live in a volunteer home while you're helping.   You can contact his campaign [here](https://go.berniesanders.com/page/s/volunteer)   420,605   420,602   420,600   420,597   So   420,586   enjoying what with your pet?    Oh. Hm. I got 18. I just wish there was something I could do with them.    420,584   Oh I didn't know that. That's pretty dumb. lol.    Wait..team size? lol what why would you take that into account instead of who actually won more games. I don't understand that    Yeah I had lots and lots of disconnects/errors. Had to quit towards the end, was too much.    Oh okay. I disagree.    I didn't play Rock/Pop    Oh. I thought cats won the battle? 51-49   420,582   For me I have a few things.   1. Being able to change weapons while you wait for the game to start instead of going to the lobby.   2. I get annoyed at teammates that use the sniper guns for Turf Wars, they don't splat a lot of ground which is evident by their points, and they don't even get a lot of kills to make up for it. It's a good gun but not for that game type I don't think.   3. Not having Turf Wars be on ranked as well.   4. Being forced to play splatzone or tower control instead of being able to have the choice to play one. I don't want to have to wait 4 hours to play tower control.   5. More maps in rotation than just 2.   6. Teammates that super jump to your area when you're in the middle of mayhem and they die instantly by the enemy just pointing their gun at the circle where they're jumping.      This thread is dedicated to everything in Splatoon you wish could be different or changed- including strategies with teammates, or generally any time you feel annoyed.   This is just discussion so people can let out some frustrations- not intended to be mean towards the game- I love Splatoon.    Unless of course no one is on the tower for an extended amount of time in which case the tower moves with no one on it back to its original starting position.    How did people get 24 Super Sea Snails? I thought it was just 18 for King/Queen   Sometimes you wanna switch weapons because you're tired of playing with the one and you like to switch it up. It's nice to be able to do this while waiting for a game instead of having to get out of the lobby and playing with either a different group of people entirely or having to wait to play with friends. It's pretty dumb   13 Super Sea Snails or 390K   420,580      420,577  Bucky   420,575   Bucky   I'm not judging or anything just an honest question; but will you tell your wife that you cheated on her? And be honest about your feelings..etc?    420,573  When did someone ask that?   Yes. It is a new community. But it's there.    420,571  Bucky   420,569  Bucky....   Yes there is. /r/GiantAnalMonsters    /r/jellybeantoes   It's not meant to educate ignorant people. It's meant to piss them off.        Who the fuck is talking to you?   You are talking to me right now. My brother is also talking to me. My friend Sean is talking to me and my mom just sent me an e-mail so technically she's also talking to me.   You're not my bro.    420,567   Oh okay I waslike wtf   k       **420**,565  420 Count it  Out of curiosity how are we at 420,565 if the comment count is only 554???? I feel like it's been messed up somewhere.    A lot is not one word. I'm sorry but it bothers me. I don't know why people make it all one word.    I'm not your bro, guy   x files dog?   Cats remember.    Yeah ...that's a bit awkward   Nope.    EASTERN    i can      Ok.      Ok.      As in just to get to run correctly     We both were traitors. So we cancelled each other out.    this has been the most difficult game to get started out of dark age of Camelot, and ultima online.    Rachel Dolozal here, part Native American...so Native American. Can confirm.    So my friend and I were on Skype and decided to play some Splatoon. Now whenever we do 'friends' we are only on the same team maybe 10% of the time- dunno why. So today we were against each other 19/24 games (I kept track). We were at the Saltrig so we went to one particular spot stopped and saw each other and just splatted in front of each other the entire game hahaha.   It was so much fun. We gave away our teammates locations to each other if they were jumping in. If my teammates jumped in I would run block if they tried to kill him and he did vice versa.   It was a nice change up and a fun way to do something different. I'm pretty sure the 6 people playing with us hated us, but I don't think they ever figured it out. We get about 1800 each just splatting in front of each other over and over.     Ok.     It was the resolution not the font.     Ok.      Ok.      Ok.      Ok.      Ok.     Hi. Thank you for your response. As a user and a mod of a very small subreddit I want to say thank you for your candor and apology.    I have a question for you. I am not trying to be mean or insulting or anything; however, can you please step down from Reddit? The majority of us do not want you running Reddit. Can you please step down? This is something that would be considered a great action on your part. This is a way to back up your promises. This is a good solution I think. I know you mean well, but you're just not working out well for us. You've had many chances to correct things and you have not. As a result can you please leave?   The way your team handled this situation with mods and the firing of Victoria and everything the past year or so, is reason enough for you to step down. What has been done on here by your team cannot be made up with a simple 'text' based apology.    Yes that is correct. But every vote is not equal. Not every vote is a voice that is heard.     Ok.     No it's not. That is the idea that every vote is equal. Every vote is not equal.    Well what I'm saying is, Victoria did a great job at what she did, why not find someone with those same qualities and things she did so good at- and have that be the job requirement? /r/IAMA mods specifically stated how well she worked with them and how pleased they were with what she did. So...why can't we get someone else exactly like that    Why don't you guys just get another Victoria, it worked pretty well the way she did things with /r/IAMA why not just find someone exactly like that?   Also, does Pao plan to respond to the petition for her to be fired reaching 150K people? This is a reasonably large deal, it's not like it's just a few people that 'hate' her anymore.    Same demeanor as Magikarp too    Ok.     It is self-serving. Collectively many votes are heard- but alone it's not heard except by the person who votes.     Ok.      Ok.     Ok.    No.    It's easy. I don't believe you will remember this. So I disagree. That's I even disagree.    I disagree.    No. Hugs. You have to make strangers hug you in wal-mart.    Why did you threaten instead of actually doing it? He/she won't learn anything from being threatened.    How about if it doesn't. You have to drink a shotglass full of Ranch Dressing mixed with Ketchup, mustard, mayo, cool whip, relish, and grape jelly?    k    Yeah. Murica!    It won't happen.    I'll eat two boxer shorts if Star Wars breaks 2.7 Billion Avatar's record.    What's half-life ?   I did. The issue was resolution.    So the bet is if Star Wars makes Over 2 Billion dollars Worldwide- total sales in theater, I will eat my boxer shorts.    Yes I know, the wiki article I posted explains that.    You don't go by ticket sales though. You go buy money made. boxofficemojo.com all time list accounts for inflation.    What exactly is Half-Life 3?   It won't obliterate Avatar. If Star Wars makes over 2 Billion world wide then I will eat my own boxer shorts.       I hate foods with diaries too. It's like, why would they write about their lives. What do foods have to write about!?!?   That silly game is politics. Politics is a game. Lots of people vote for who they want- and their voice is not heard.    Maybe. There's no real way to know that for sure. He has a shot in the democratic primary. It will either be Hillary or him.   Look, in 2008, I worked on Obama's primary team and no one thought we had a shot over the Clinton machine either....but we won. You can win an election with a very good ground game.   A lot of people assume that candidates win- with how they make sense of what issues people find important. The truth is, in the ground game for campaigns, rarely do you ever talk about issues. It's all about numbers. They say you gain a vote every 3 houses you talk to people. So we knocked on insane amounts of houses. To do that, obviously you have to have a substantial amount of dedicated volunteers and also you need to have a good program to use to print up all of the people who voted which way and what way in the previous primaries and a good software system to input all of the data.   When we won the primary and I worked on the 2008 general election one thing I noticed versus John McCain was he had less volunteers on the ground and they wasted time when they went door to door. (this is just in the area I worked in Ohio). They would argue with someone to vote for McCain at their house for a good 20 minutes. If someone tells you "I'm voting for the opponent no matter what" You don't spend 20 minutes trying to convince him you move on. In those twenty minutes, you can hit 5-6 more houses. It's just a waste of a time to argue. Rarely did I ever speak about the issues with people because I didn't want to waste time- only if I thought was it worth it and I always explained why I was voting for him and for people to make up their own mind. In addition, in my area the McCain volunteers were at odds with the Republican Party volunteers (for local elections- republican party wanted to take many mccain volunteers and use them for local campaigns...) Also, they didn't work on Sundays where I was at. Which is fine- I get the reasoning behind that but while they weren't working we worked 24-7.   Sanders has a good following if he can turn that into thousands of volunteers working for him- he has a shot. Primaries are state by state- it's certainly doable. If he picks up momentum watch out  Republicans have a good shot to win 2016 as well- if they pick a solid candidate. Romney wasn't good and while McCain was a solid candidate his VP hurt him. I think- it would help them if they changed their platform on marriage equality. that likely wont happen though   It is a throw away vote, it will make ya feel good, but you won't win.    Because he would lose. If you don't run in the big two- you lose. If he runs as a independent in the gen election he would lose, and then probably take down the democrats with him.    It's an interesting process. They do lie for votes because people won't vote for them in primaries if they are too moderate. Then come general election a lot of people have to go more 'middle' so opinions change.    Nah. It doesnt.    That makes no sense.    You didn't answer the question sir.

Great film! Very true to the original story and an absolute mindfuck.   The low budget is obvious on occasion but that's a quibble.   It's fairly common behaviour among Australian politicians.    No, but with metcard, you could buy a ticket on the tram AND were left with a physical record of the purchase.   Under that system, buying a ticket was simple and easy.      If they provided a system that allowed people to buy tickets near or on public transport like we had for years before Myki came along, that might be possible.   That's right! I'll just walk over to the ticket machine here on the tram...oh it's gone. That's OK, I'll just get one at the next stop...not there either.   If someone lives nowhere near a 7/11 or a train station, they can not use public transport.   And even if you carry a fully topped up card with you at all times, the machines STILL will often not scan properly and, unless you go to extraordinary measures, you have no way to prove it.  http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/court-in-the-act--how-commuters-are-defeating-myki-fines-20140930-10nz6z.html      I'd have no problem with ticket inspectors handing out fines to fare evaders if they still had a system that made it, you know, possible to buy a fare.  I live near a large hotel, on a train line, that is three kilometres from the nearest 7/11. At least once a week, without fail, I see tourists standing at the tram stop looking worried.

 I love black gesso, but I can't seem to find a white gesso that doesn't turn out crappy. The black is always so much smoother and gel-like, whereas white is gritty and grainy.   Have you had this issue? If not, what brand do you use?   You could take a marker or something and put a dot or highlight the number or something of the highest number on the die, that way it'd be easier to find.  Also, if they are each using their own sets, they could keep them arranged from smallest to largest or something.   Play a game that uses one die exclusively if you want to make it easy on them. There are plenty of games that use d20s or d6s exclusively (actually, come to think of it, all my top favorite games are that way).  Or you could rotate through games that use only one kind of die to teach them each one. Like Dark Heresy or Wild Talents for d10s, Deadzone for d8s (I don't know any rpgs that use d8s exclusively, but Deadzone is awesome), and then d12s are just the ones that aren't d8s or d10s.    He said *unit* of small based models, so probably means more than one small based model in base-to-base contact getting between them.   I think people are just unaware of other options.   Damn, it's been so long I completely forgot about the best part of D20... free online copies of the rules.  And I say that as someone who bought pretty much all the books.   I've done stuff like this. It can go well, but don't count on it. I've had it blow up in my face 3 times, and work amazingly 1 time.  That one time though...   If you like D20 Modern, D20 Future is a good supplement for it.   GURPS probably has something that covers the stuff you are looking for too.   [Risus](http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/risus.htm)   Single models? I think we're all looking for those, buddy.   I've been adapting Savage Worlds (at least I think it's SW) playing cards for initiative for other games. I love that it basically lets the players keep track of their own initiative, and the initiative can change every round without taking forever re-order everything.   It definitely doesn't work for everything (yet, I'm determined to find a way to make it work), at least not without some tweaking, but I defintely like it.   For my IKRPG game, the cards from the [GM kit](http://privateerpress.com/iron-kingdoms/accessories/iron-kingdoms-full-metal-fantasy-game-master-toolkit) work nicely. They are just laminated cards that have spots for names and basic combat stats (or ongoing effects) that can be arranged in a pile, and just draw through them.   I'm seconding the recommendation for Numenera. Numenera has all the requirements: decent set of magic, good bit of future tech (without a focus on space travel), relatively simple.  And as for whether or not it's adaptable, it's only about the most adaptable system in existence. Creating opponents is super easy too.   If I knew more about your setting, I could give you a more specific recommendation between Numenera or The Strange (same base system, but different setting, almost 100% compatible though).    Are you talking about BESM? If so, then I agree with you. It can run this kind of thing beautifully, and I even liked the d20 version (which is what I think you might mean when you say 'D D anime'... maybe), even though I'm not usually interested in d20 games. The non-d20 version is the "tri-stat" system and is pretty simple as far as core rules go. Both have so many customization options that they can be pretty complicated though.   For 5e, there's nothing inherently wrong with it, it's just that it's designed with pseudo-medieval combat in mind, and so will possibly feel a little clunky compared to something designed for modern play.   The trick to using a map with Fate, is use a map, but not a grid. I use minis, and draw stuff out, and people move themselves around, but there is no grid. I borrow Numenera's range estimates when I need to decide if something is reasonably in range (immediate range is anything within 10'[2"], short range is between that and 30'[6"], and long is anything beyond that up to 100'[20"]), but usually it's pretty obvious what you can and can't do by looking at it. If there is an aspect on some area of the map, I just write it right on the map.   If you used a cyanoacrylate based glue (super glue), you can used acetone (nail polish) to get it loose.   Well, if they are wargamers, it doesn't hurt to stick with stuff they're at least a little familiar with. There is WH40k Roleplay, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (I recommend 2e if you can find it), and my personal favorite, [Iron Kingdoms RPG](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf) (based in the same world as Warmachine/Hordes).   If you are looking for more rules light games (games from wargames tend to be rules heavy), my top recommendations would be Numenera/The Strange, or Fate (though don't just play Fate Core, pick a setting book and use that).  They are both easy to learn, and easy to run. The [Fate](http://fate-srd.com/) rules are free to check out. You can get a digital copy of [Numenera](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/114852/Numenera-Players-Guide) or [The Strange Player's Guide](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/129406/The-Strange-Players-Guide?term=the+strange) for about $8 (or a physical copy for about $15), which isn't bad to check it out.   edit: Also going with the basics isn't a bad idea either right now, Dungeons and Dragons 5e is really newbie friendly, and they have [basic rules](https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules) you can check out for free.   D D5e is designed with the option of not using a map in mind, and it does alright. Not the best in that category though.  Numenera/The Strange is a great system that doesn't need a map. They have just 3 ranges (immediate, short, and long), and it's pretty easy to approximate without having a map and still have pretty tactical combat. It's very open to creative ideas during combat.  Fate is also great for not using a map. It uses zones, and they are a decent way to illustrate where people are without using a map. This is at the far end of the theater-of-the-mind style play, and it actually borders on being harder to use with a map than without.   On-rails isn't bad if it's what the players prefer. I had a player freak out and rage-quit because I *wasn't* railroading the group. Different strokes, I guess.  You are right that D D5e might work for you. Combat can be light-ish, and it's not too hard to convert it for what you are talking about (though people will say the result isn't very good, but w/e).  If you don't like crunchy, Fate might be another good option for you. They actual have a Dresden Files supplement you could look at, might be 100% what you are looking for. Fate doesn't always use a map, but there's nothing stopping you. I *always* use a map at least some of the time when I'm running Fate, so it's really just up to you.   I highly recommend you check out [Stars Without Number](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/86467/Stars-Without-Number-Free-Edition). It is a scifi retro-clone of D D. There is a supplement called [Polychrome](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/91490/Polychrome-Cyberpunk-Adventure-for-Stars-Without-Number) that adds a lot of the Shadowrun feel, and you can just ignore the starship stuff.  The core book is free, and the Polychrome supplement is dirt cheap.   [D D combat is boring as shit in comparison.](http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/comments/396mrn/system_advice/cs0su0c)   Yeah, Cephalyx is really even more limited than they are. Until this brand new book they've had only one warnoun, whereas both the Minion contracts have several.  I wouldn't even care if the lists were terrible as long as they keep with this ~50% off retail pricing.  Hell, I have enormous amounts of pirates and dwarves, and if they do more Merc contracts I'm probably going to buy them anyway.   Neocron is probably not worth bothering with. It was terrible back in the day, and probably not any better after all these years. The offline demo was better than the actual game, which is bizarre.  Impostor is really good though, I definitely recommend it.   With CoC and now Cephalyx, that's 7 AiOs for Warmachine, and only 4 for hordes. I'm hoping that means they are going to do AiOs for both minions contracts. Though I'm not going to hold my breath.   If they go through and do other mercs/minions contracts, I'm going to be a very happy, very broke man.   I pre-ordered 4 of the other all-in-ones before they were on the release schedule.   I'm working on my homebrew gritty near-future scifi game. It's not next on my list because it needs a certain kind of group, because it's pretty serious (not all of my friends like serious games).   The focus is how there are large "utopian" cities, but they exist at the cost of the lives of people who aren't allowed in (and the freedoms of those who are).  Inspirational movies/games list: Impostor, Babylon A.D., Minority Report, I Robot, The Island, Johnny Mnemonic, Dredd, Lockdown, Appleseed, Ghost in the Shell, Deus Ex, Neocron.   Oh you....   I didn't really specify, but I could see it both ways.   The game is unrelated to the D video game series.  and now I'm sad.   God. Damn. Cryx.   If he's playing a tinkerer, couldn't *he* be the one who specially worked on his crossbow? Even if he doesn't really focus on crafting that kind of thing, it can sort of be a "special side project" he's been working on, and what it lacks in expertise, it makes up for in ingenuity.   That's if the only problem you have is how, in your setting, he'd have one, which is what it sounds like. Power-wise, like you said, there are guns, which are superior in almost every way except stealthiness.  Not to take sides, but one: I rarely tell my players no, and two: I wanted to do this *exact* thing before, and even was specially trained in crafting crossbows, and my GM said no. He was a jerk though, so don't be like him (funniest thing, he was actually a crossbowman in one of those "not-larp" medieval thingies, yet he always made sure crossbows sucked in his games) .   Some of them. Though they do have "graphic" or "comic" versions that are mostly pretty pictures. The word ones are the best ones though.   You sound like how I was about five years ago, and I have a friend who is the same way. You are definitely a minority, but you aren't alone. One of the things that helped me get back into gaming was working on a hyper-realistic gritty-as-fuck game with my friend, and after that I was ready to play a bit of the mindless stuff again. You just need to find a couple people who you can do that sort of thing with, and then you won't be quite so hard for it all the time.   I'm a big fan of Wild Talents, but I've been playing it since the Godlike days, so I'm probably basing a little of it on nostalgia.   For another rules-intensive game Mutants and Masterminds is pretty good. It's based on D20 stuff, but doesn't have some of the bad parts. Combats are still on the longish side though.  I think the Cypher system (Numenera/The Strange) would work really well for a supers game, but I think it works well for almost anything.   I'll also second Fate for a narrative focused supers game.   Books. I think they're called "books".    If you do a google image search for Iron Kingdoms, you can get a pretty good idea.  They went the route of magic working with technology instead of being antithetical to it, and they have things like Gun Mages.  It's one of the better rules-heavy systems out there, as they manage to keep combats from being long drawn out boring things.   Have you heard about [Iron Kingdoms](http://files.privateerpress.com/ironkingdoms/documents/adventures/IKRPG_Scenario_Fools_Rush_In.pdf)?   Not helpful (sorry man, there just isn't anything out there yet), but I would really like to see Deadzone done as an RPG ruleset.   Maybe check out WH40k roleplay?  Or if you only need it to be a little different from high fantasy, Iron Kingdoms is amazing. It basically plays like Steampunk XCOM.   As much as I dislike D D4e, their version of Gamma World wasn't horrible.    2d20 pick best is almost exactly the same as 1d20+5  [what?](http://anydice.com/program/5f92)  example of how people don't generally understand probability  Well, that's true, just not how you meant it.   I get it. Math is hard, bro. Just keep doin you, though, cause it's great.   [It's both?](http://imgur.com/8khxqOH)   You clearly take this shit way to seriously. It's not real.   But.... since you want to go there...........   Who decided that rule? Oh, that's right, the Sith. There is exactly 0 way of knowing how many of them actually decided to follow this rule. Especially since "Sith" roughly translates to "People who don't give two shits about rules" (translated from Bajoran, of course, the Sith's native language).  Also, should you actually watch the movie, they specifically say it's not cannon (though it could be, since hey, Disney). And since the Empire was defeated by a platypus, "lots of Darths" doesn't seem like the biggest issue.  But hey, good for you for knowing what was said in Episode One, the best Star Wars movie ever made.   	41

Just put the base model at 32GB !   0.2 mm thicker is the difference between the iPhone 6 and 6+... 6.9 and 7.1mm ... It's the same thing!   yeah, and it's not even the full 16GB which is worse !

The betas of iOS 9 show s huge improvement though. Downgrade to anything newer than 6.1.   Just feel the speed. Classic Jeremy   Keep in mind how thin it is!

Maybe in St Kitts, somewhere around there   Puerto Rico is more poor and more dependant on social benefits than Mississippi.

I would just rather find a grad student or professional and double up and have more cashflow and less expenses. Obviously renting with strangers has more potential for clashing with them.

I plan on either buying one of the few "entry" level homes for 130k and living in one bedroom while I rent the other.   I am realizing more and more that people in general have to roll with the economic times and hustle to get by, and I am totally willing to do that.  If you and your wife life in a relatively large home/condo, getting a roomie may be a wise move. Even in a year or two you will have saved a bunch of cash without more hours at work.    Exactly. Even if you get one and it appreciates, unless you get a bunch of roomies and charge through the nose in rent, the taxes/HOA will eat you alive. Unless you sell, in which case you no longer have somewhere to live.   But you might make a handsome profit.    One word.   Bernie Sanders for President.    And consider that they may never be able to buy into the market like boomers did. People in nyc/sf/portland where the prices may grow 3/4 percent yearly mean that their income, even high ranking nationally, may not keep pace with prices.  A lot of people in these cities bought decades ago when homes were relatively inexpensive in comparison to income.    It is like any big industry. Buy up all the market and make the rules so nobody can enter the market and raise barriers to entry.   Blackrock did the same on a national scale, buying up massses of rental properties.    Zoning is what makes people have to buy and rent subpar units. Otherwise there would be more stock available.   	199
 I... don't remember what my GPA was.  I did reasonably well, but failed a couple of classes from not caring. Still graduated on time.   Thanks for the feedback. The hobby beads caught my eye, but I wouldn't want to spend too much money on a less profitable system.   That is included in those prices.  I did a test pattern using a picture I had lying around, the order would have cost $17.95, including shipping, so I'd have to charge at least $20 to make it worth it.  A $15 price point would only be viable if I plan and order for batches of products (occasionally, I wouldn't have to buy new beads because I'd have some left over from other projects).  Basically, would you be willing to pay more for the higher quality images available from PH?   At this point, if the game doesn't include a way for players to make real money by playing, reward the best players with Lamborghinis, and physically reach out of the computer to give you a blow job, then I don't think it can ever live up to the hype.   It reminds me a little of the Buffy theme (which was awesome)   Hell, there are people who never played HL2 making HL3 jokes... why? Because we're all sure it isn't coming.   That's He3.   First rule of Half-Life 3.  You do not talk about Half-Life 3.   Honestly... a guy having sex with children angers me.  A guy jerking off while he rubs himself with piss and noms on shit makes me want to puke... and then I fear that would turn him on more.  Being angry that some illegal things are called fetishes is like being angry that Mormonism is called a religion.   I have experience with the RPG Maker system, but no finished projects... I think I get bored too easily.   A fetish simply means a sexual proclivity towards something.   BDSM is a domination fetish. Bestiality is an animal fetish. Pedophilia is a child fetish.  Out of those, two are illegal. And there are more fetishes out there. There are foot fetishists, and people who are only turned on by cellulite... plush fetishes, exhibition, voyeurism, even people turned on by poop.  Fetishes are a many - varied thing, but some of them are legal, and some aren't  (nor should they be)   In many countries, dog meat is incredibly frowned upon. To the point where eating pets is basically a racial joke.   Well, we know she did it for 2-3 years...   Por que no los dos?  Fetishes don't necessarily imply legality.

Yeah, when your choices are cousins fucking and the cumbox, you don't really find two people having a sexual relationship disgusting.   How do people even remember stuff like that?   Don't worry too much, it was a throwaway line from the very beginning of the series. A funny line, but not one designed to be memorable, and certainly not intended to be used to make a rule on an internet forum over a decade later.   We should only post Owls on Sunday.   I wonder how many of the tattoos are fake.   Pros - More colors, no ironing/misfiring, higher definition  Cons - Higher cost per bead (assuming larger purchasing amounts, $0.35/135 beads vs. $2/1000), boards are not reusable, pattern sizes are less flexible.  Because I have unsteady hands, I find it troublesome to iron pieces, making PH very attractive, but I fear that the higher cost is a turn-off to buyers. What do you think is more appropriate/appealing?  [Example of Pixel Hobby](http://kasiulai.lt/images/801001.png) - 1 panel + 2000 beads for about $15-20 (including time).

She's a leading lady, so there has to be some attractiveness about her.   Superman still looks exactly like Christopher Reeve... But if they were going for "every actor who played the role", they forgot to add in George Reeves.   Weren't there a lot of people that paid well for it?   The reason why they do this is because they get far more from concerts, including the merchandising, than they do from piddly little CD sales.   Oh yeah. That's hot.

I'm sure they would've had no problems swapping.  *Maybe* they would have been okay swapping.  If there are entitled losers, and not people with a legitimate issue, then they'd be pissed off for your asking.   That's clearly a "bored now" face.   It has to, it has change in the name.   Technically, they are. While some consider them a new overall religion, as opposed to a branch of Christianity, their core belief is in the divinity of Jesus, the son of God.  But, if it makes you feel any better, you can replace it in the example with Catholic, Baptist, Methodist, or whichever you prefer.   Invisible sky god who imposes morality on humans that he, himself, doesn't follow generally seems made up to me.  But, I will say this. It is nigh impossible to proof a negative. It falls on the positive claim to prove they are truth. For example, if I told you I flew to the store today, would you believe me without my proof? Should you be forced to give proof that I never left the ground?  Therefore, you are challenged to prove the truth of the Quran, that it is more than simply a book.   Okay, so you're sorry.  Are you resigning yet?   No. According to the Quran, "There is no God but Allah, and Mohammad is his messenger."  Mohammad is simply a prophet, like Jesus and Elijah. It makes perfect sense for him to not write about himself much.  They worship Allah, they venerate Mohammad.   To put it simply, they believe in the historicity of Jesus, not the divinity of Jesus, making them technically an offshoot of Judaism (which also admits that Jesus was probably a real person)   Well, of course it's made up, but if he *actually was* a humble messenger of god (big if, there), then he would be more interested in writing about his predecessors than himself.   Giggity.   I know a way to settle that one... Does anyone know a Mormon we could ask, and see if *they* call themselves Christian?  Edit: A quick search reveals this...  Gordon B. Hinckley, prior President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (1995-2008), said:  We are Christians in a very real sense and that is coming to be more and more widely recognized. Once upon a time people everywhere said we are not Christians. They have come to recognize that we are, and that we have a very vital and dynamic religion based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. We, of course, accept Jesus Christ as our Leader, our King, our Savior...the dominant figure in the history of the world, the only perfect Man who ever walked the earth, the living Son of the living God. He is our Savior and our Redeemer through whose atoning sacrifice has come the opportunity of eternal life. Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints pray and worship in the name of Jesus Christ. He is the center of our faith and the head of our Church. The Book of Mormon is Another Testament of Jesus Christ and witnesses of His divinity, His life, and His Atonement.   It definitely seems like they are trying to confuse the hell out of us on that aspect.   The virus was attacking the infrastructure before the T-X appeared.  Skynet created the virus during a time when it was only being put online for learning, and used it as a way to wreak havoc on human computing systems and force them to put the mainframe online.  At least, that's the wiki's explanation for what happened.  Time travel is so fucked up... But it wasn't the T-X's doing, for sure.   I will neither confirm nor deny this.   It's still an ignorant thing to say.   Yeah, she was so mad that she didn't spell my name right when it was looking her in the face.   They are still considered Christian, because they still believe in Jesus. They just think he did more after he left Israel.   I'm starting to think I'm not cut out for this game.   It's just an asterisk, I don't see anything. Even with the error analysis tool used to analyze the first image.   So, where does "koala" fit in?   [](/colgatenoidea) I'm starting to think I've been lied to all my life, and I'm actually an idiot...   Can I get an explanation for this? Because I don't even understand this.   No, we apparently don't.  I mean, your hints were "the Steg's back" (meaning that he has returned, not to look at the back of the dinosaur) and "the method is hidden in the picture" which is a pretty bad "major hint" because we could have guessed the method was somewhere in the picture.  I get that I'm new here, and still haven't really gotten into this yet, but... we didn't even know you were looking for text until you told us.   Left Right Right Left Down Right Down?   I'm assuming you mean 22 scales on his back.   Is that second hint blank?   -22/35?   -13?   Dumbledore is killed by Snape, Rosebud was his sled, Norman Bates was his mother, Cloud wasn't really in SOLDIER, Bruce Willis was dead all along, and Taylor was on Earth the whole time.   It was the first one of those I saw, so there you go...  I only gave it the first time.   That abysmal team defeated their other opponents handily, including soccer powerhouses in Australia and England.  They earned the spot, but they simply are fighting uphill for the Americans.   That was in terrible taste... take an upvote.   GOALLLLLLLL x2!   A broken clock is right twice a day.      It was an early start, and a proof-of-concept   An important distinction...  Sending someone to prison, the guards are *supposed* to be keeping the prisoners safe from each other. Largely, they have failed in that, but the reform should be to fix the prison system (primarily by fixing the problem of sending too many people into prison), and not by trying to claim that prison is cruel punishment.   But it would still be cruel, and thus against the constitution.  It would have to be fought in the courts, but it would certainly be ruled in violation, because it is needlessly and maliciously violent.   Number 57 will blow your mind!    Usual things do not shock the sensibilities of a normal person.  That's right, so what happens if the average person thinks that disemboweling is appropriate for child rapists?  Does that mean we should equip prisons with gutting stations? No, because such punishment is needlessly cruel, even if the average person is okay with it.   Yeah, I caught it after the refresh.    Okay... some of these are just blowing my mind, and I thought I was smart...  I don't see a question to be answered.   Wrong.  Cruelty, as stated before, requires a malicious intent. So a punishment that might shock the sensibilities of a normal man, but was created unintentionally is unusual, but not cruel.  Most of the time, such infractions are both cruel and unusual, but the amendment covers both.  You would not want it to be otherwise, if the sensibilities of the nation were to change to be okay with torturing prisoners again.   The confusion you are having is not with *my* language, but the language of the Amendment... "cruel and unusual punishment"  While it can be construed as only applying to such acts that are both cruel and unusual, it was obviously intended by the founders to prohibit either and both at once.  Thus, we have to legally define cruelty as well as unusuality in regard to punishment.  Since cruelty is primarily concerned with malicious intent, and incarceration is primarily concerned with protecting the innocent from the guilty, there is no cruelty simply borne from incarceration.  As for unusual punishment, incarceration generally does not shock the sensibilities of people, as it is reasonable to remove such persons from society. Plus, incarceration can be reversed and remedied, something that can not be done with death, dismemberment, or torture.   Blame it on the English language.   Okay, let's go with the italicized definition, instead of the more appropriate explanation.   cruelty - The deliberate and malicious infliction of mental or physical pain upon persons or animals.  The same portion of "cruel and unusual punishment" *was* the part that I copied before. Nice try.  For "cruelty" to apply to judicial punishment, there needs to be deliberate harm and malicious intent.  For that definition, and is exclusive. English is funny that way.  If you cut off my leg with a hacksaw, for no reason but because you hate me, that demonstrates malice (evil intent) and deliberate action. It is assumed that if you have malicious intent, then you are deliberately acting.  However, if you cut off my leg with a hacksaw because we are climbing in the Alps and my leg is hopelessly pinned, then there is no malicious intent... it was a medical necessity.  Going back to the issue of incarceration of criminals, there is deliberate harm in locking a person up for longer than his child is in school, but there is no malicious intent. He is locked up because he needed to be separated from society.    No. Technically I am saying that both guns and drugs are illegal in a school zone.   Is the poem in klingon?   It depends on the bank. But for a scammer, it is better to be safe than sorry.   I can tell that it isn't about the man. The image is edited from a stock photo used on a women's blog.  The poem is unreadable, though, using the limited editing functions on my phone.  I've been able to get the lettering of the poem visible, but it is too mangled to make out more than a few letters, and it seems that it is encoded to boot. (I see capital letters in the middle and end of words.)   He can still overdraw your account, putting you on the hook for a charge and an overdraft fee.   You see, when the show was canceled for the 15th time, Nibbler interfered with the development of Netflix's Futurama development so the seasons would show differently. In so doing, he created millions of Fabled Ones, who lack the Delta Brain Wave.  He called them, "Television Viewers"   Oddly enough, if you hyperoxygenate water, like they did in Abyss, it may be possible to breath it like air, though maybe not. The problem is keeping the fluid oxygenated properly, and the fact that lungs might not work at efficiency with a liquid.  Most certainly, it would not be of great advantage to develop,  as opposed to creating better air-breathing apparatuses.    In terms of actual practicality? Only for *extremely* fine adjustments to a satellite dish, probably.  Ultimately, there will be no real use for it. It's just to see how small he could make it.    What law are you quoting?  I wasn't quoting a particular law. I was stating a fact. You can not bring guns. You can not bring drugs. You can not bring guns and drugs.  The fact is **and** does not always mean *both*, it also means *either or both*, depending on context   Okay, first off to ensure that you are not conflating the definitions...   **cruelty** - As applied to people, cruelty encompasses abusive, outrageous, and inhumane treatment that results in the wanton and unnecessary infliction of suffering upon the body or mind.  By this definition, locking a criminal away (a necessary action) is *not* legal cruelty.  The more appropriate definition...   **cruel and unusual punishment** - Such punishment as would amount to torture or barbarity, any cruel and degrading punishment not known to the Common Law, **or** any fine, penalty, confinement, or treatment that is so disproportionate to the offense as to shock the moral sense of the community.  As you can see here, locking a criminal away for a reasonable length of time is not prohibited, because it is neither cruel (it is not torturous to remove a criminal from society), and it is not unusual if the length of time is reasonable.   It's a pretty common turn of phrase.  It means to be pierced, usually through the torso, by a bladed instrument, in such a manner that the blade has run all the way through the body.   Okay, what I see is a drawing of an extremely dysfunctional couple, holding knives on each other.  The woman holds the knife demurely, the man holds the knife with strength.  In both cases, if they pull away unexpectedly, they will die.  On one hand, it is a misguided sign of trust, they do not think that the other will harm them, and so they do not push away the other knife.  On the other hand, it is a sign of control. Each of them goes behind the back of the other and prevents them from leaving.  The one thing not present in this composition is "true love".   Smoking weed in a small room with children? I'd have called child welfare.   That's "What, What, In The Butt", sir.   If they are willing to fuck over the people that willingly worked their website for free, what do you think they feel about the trogldytes that sit there and mindlessly give others Gold for comments that bash Reddit?   Because we have sooooo much respect for Ellen Pao.   You mean the same documentary that was shown on HBO?   Okay, let me try to put it this way.  You are prohibited from bringing drugs and firearms onto a schoolyard.  Does that mean that one can bring drugs, as long as they don't have a handgun? Or that they can bring a gun, as long as they don't have crack? No.  They are prohibited from bringing both or either.   Is it cruel to do that to a man who stole money from a charity, or killed a man, or kidnapped a child for sexual intent?  I'd say it wouldn't be.   I would classify pot as habit forming, and not addictive.  Yes, you can generally quit any time you want without going through painful withdrawal, but there is still an aspect of pot use that makes it hard for people to walk away from.  Maybe the withdrawal is simply different from what most people consider for drug use, but there are people who are addicted to the way pot makes them feel, and don't want to give up that feeling.   In legal larleyence, "cruel" means that your punishment is unnecessarily harsh.  A life sentence for a small amount of pot is cruel. A life sentence for orchestrating a dozen murders is not.  It can be considered cruel to the average person to keep someone separated from society, but legal cruelty was envisioned as unnecessarily harsh punishment.   That was the way the founding fathers envisioned that protection.  The Rack? Cruel and Unusual. Medieval torture devices are completely out of favor.  Life imprisonment for 3 Oz of weed? Cruel. The punishment should fit the crime, and having an unnecessarily long sentence is just there to make a harsh punishment.  Sentencing a rapist to have his feet licked by puppies for 3 months? Unusual. While it isn't cruel (to the criminal, it's a little cruel to the puppies), it is very unusual, and thus is unconstitutional.     The signed cards are incredibly rare. For the theme decks, I don't know the ratio (I could crack open a case of KLK decks and see if I got a signed card, but I think it's less chance than 1:18)  In general, the signed cards will go $40-80 in the right circles, some unpopular ones will be $10-20, and some older cards will be more.   And here's Cap punching Hitler a lot.   https://youtu.be/DxRKwKJI_uI   It sounds low for sure, but as a 5'11" guy, I simply remember the taller people more than the shorter.

I think that until we find actual silicon or ammonia based life, we can't discount the possibility that such non-carbon life doesn't exist.   Because they are trained monkeys who think of Reddit Gold as a massive upvote, and not as a revenue builder for Reddit.   I'll never forgive Ward for that.   Where is he going to find Sarah Jessica Parker at this time if night?   Comedy central has been really shitty about commercials lately, compressing shows so they don't follow the 30 minute format.  They do this so they can add more commercials, increasing revenue, while showing less actual shows, decreasing cost.  I can see them cutting "inconsequential" lines as part of that.   Many people accidentally create a ponzi scheme without realizing it. They don't realize that their system relies solely on new investors, and can not survive if they promise higher returns without them.  At least with the changes I outlined, they can avoid that trap, by segregating the investors from the projects.   Simple. Unless you have to, don't say you are a soldier.   Well, assuming F Society is real, then they named themselves after the building. Perhaps they (stupidly) feel that no one would be able to track them down using that clue.  But you are correct that it is more likely that the whole group is in his head.   I'll take "Shitty Internet Decisions" for $500, Alex.   Clearly. I don't like to levy such an accusation  (who am I kidding, I do), but without appropriate changes to the platform, this system has Pyramid written all over it.  Now, what can be done is to limit the campaigns to a window of time, and all donations to the system get split among active programs.  Have the length of time be 1 day, plus 1 day for an uploaded video, plus 1 day for promised stretch goals. Up to 3 days at a time.  The system has 99 slots (so each project gets 1 cent per dollar, with 1 cent going to the platform), and when one program expires, the next one on the list comes up.  A 1 year timeframe in that scenario can give funding to 12-36,000 projects without expanding.   T'pao   That would be Backpage   It is private, but it is not shut down.  You have to be invited, generally that happens when you are given gold for an intelligent or enciteful comment, instead of just buying it yourself.    Very possible. She was a very large snake.   I don't want to live on this planet anymore.   And I said, YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!   They could easily create a body tracker that connects using Bluetooth and can be programmed to operate on any part of the body. (Finger, hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, neck, chest, waist, hip, knee, ankle, foot, or toes). The more sensors you have on you, the more accurate the tracking.   Voat.co  They are having a little downtime though, because Reddit's drama is flooding them.   I have the strange feeling that I'll hit 100k comment karma, and reddit will die before I get my invite to the /r/CenturyClub.   /r/reallounge is better than /r/lounge anyway.   Half of the ads are "thank you for not using adblock, here is a silly moose"   That's what troping is.  Mind you, no one thinks Tropes, like Plot Armor, are a bad thing. It is just a way of identifying story elements.   Dude, it's a Trope. Get over it.  Plot Armor is the way you answer questions, such as "How the hell did Indy survive a nuclear blast by hiding in a fridge?"   Okay... so, what happens when new people stop coming into Enchain?  At $1.29/$4, it takes 3 or 4 donations to match your own.  By the time the first project is "funded" ($4), 4 people are in queue waiting for $4 each. A total of $16.  It would take an additional 12 donations to match those 4 projects, requiring $48 to fund everyone.  Eventually, you would get to a point where millions of projects are in the queue, unless you include a time limit to submit a project or include an option to fund without reciprocity.   The difference between it is when the character is put into dangerous scenarios, and survives *simply* because the plot demands it. Like a small team of 4 people blasting their way through a moon-sized space station with millions of guards shooting at them, and them alone... and the only guy that dies is the one that got into a swordfight with The Dragon.    It is a perfect name for a small animal. It is a word meaning something small or petty.   It is a term for when a character other than the main character survives a scenario because the author demands him to appear later.  Jo killed off many important minor characters, but she couldn't allow Hagrid to die, because he had to carry Harry's lifeless body at the end of the series.  The opposite of that trope is "Doomed By Canon", where a character has to die because of the story, like Thomas and Martha Wayne.   That was not an ordinary snake.  Arthur was in the hospital for weeks because the wounds stayed magically open. They even tried stitches.  Because Nagini was a horcrux, her venom was magically magnified, just like the other horcruxes had their powers amplified.  The Cup and Diadem we never see in action.  The Diary gains an intelligence and talks back to the user.  The Locket holds itself shut unless spoken to in Parseltounge.  The Ring, which contained the Resurrection Stone, brought Death to the wearer.  Nagini caused wounds that do not heal quickly enough to survive (Arthur was kept alive long enough for the venom to work its way out).  Harry's connection to Voldemort was strengthened to a form of ESP.   There's nothing dangerous about Blast-Ended Skrewts!  	130

             I want to watch or read anime reviews in which the reviewer is able to pick out what made the show problematic. *Not* a tirade or rant about how terrible it was. Any anime is fine, preferably well-known ones.         Four women are in the middle of town in bikinis, and all the men comment on how cool and strong they are.      Any soundtrack that both:  * Fit the anime so well that without the soundtrack the anime would be terrible * Isn't so obtrusive that it overwhelms the reset of the anime?   Are there any good examples of an anime that has conflict but no evil villain? I don't like how some characters are evil for the sake of being evil.   Are there any good examples of a manga that has conflict but no evil villain? I don't like how some characters are evil for the sake of being evil.      If there can be OP characters, can there also be UP characters?   You love your favorite anime, but is there any part that was cliched? What would the anime be like if it somehow was able to remove that part?   A lot of anime have beach episodes (or pool episodes), hot springs episodes (or public bath episodes), and christmas episodes (or valentine's day episodes). What other staple episodes are there?

  As long as people make decision that affect others based on their belief in a god, there will always be a reason to discuss the matter.  Someone else here said that, too. But I think that OP is kind of just ahead of the discussion with the post: They are maybe saying "It should become *common knowledge* that the jury is out *and will stay out* on this one."  If this were so, and if the people would indeed know so, this would also mean that all actions *based* on either side of the issue are wrong. I mean, people could pray and stuff, but letting people swear on the Bible, putting "In God we trust" on the money, only electing professed Christians as presidents, not giving their kid medicine because prayer, etc. - all that would be out the window, and there would be no doubt about it. Maybe OP is just trying *to get us there*.   So, what caused the quantum vacuum? It's the same question that can be asked at any level: What caused the universe? Or, to theists, what caused God? The quantum vacuum as causer might be a correct concept, but it's only a causer of *the rest* of the universe - it would itself already be the universe, just like the very first picoseconds after it would be the universe.  Scientific knowledge can *maybe* be gained here, but how is it really relevant to the discussion?    The idea that the universe came from nothing  No it didn't. They are labeling something that has properties, mechanisms, etc. "nothing" while it is in truth "something". While it might be impossible to give a proper definition of "nothing", I am certain that whatever they cooked up is not it.  I wish people would stop screaming click-bait language into the world to make the heads turn. Just make statements of facts, and we're good. I'm not doubting Krauss' intelligence or even if he's right or wrong, but I have very good reason to doubt his honesty.   These three comments in a row sound like a joke or like a parody.   I think he's saying (what I believe, too) that the beginning of the universe was a singularity of cause effect, of even logic itself. Meaning itself breaks down at this point and can not be investigated.  That's why I believe that once (If ever.) something like a "world formula" will be found, it will just like the quantum-uncertainty-due-to-wave-math make an uncertainty statement: It will say that we can't ever find an all-governing equation.   A secondary but quite dominant theorem of religion would be:  -I can more or less freely make up stuff about God, so in consequence I can make up a lot more stuff about reality.  -Then I can tell people "This is how God is and what he wants." to make them obey *me*. I don't see how this is blasphemy, though.   Are you saying that if human history wouldn't have allowed Christianity to gather a lot of people and make itself known in the world, the world wouldn't be worse of, and a lot less people would go to Hell?    The Sacraments [...] This is why it is important to *know* God. [...]  Thanks for a detailed answer.   It is the Truth that  But how would anyone discern this story-which-can't-be-verified-in-reality (other than by mind-games that can't be distinguished from fantasy or even from schizophrenia) from any other such stories? Why is what the Muslims did (Believing the Quran.) wrong, while what the Christians did (Believing the Bible.) correct? Epistemology-wise, it's completely identical. One could as well become a Mormon, or why not make up a new religion that has the actual !T!ruth about God? I mean, even *more* capitalized, as if "truth" wouldn't plain and simply already convey the meaning.   What majority is this? Are you referring to those who lived before Christ?  7.2 billion are alive, 2.2 billion of them are Christians. - The majority of 5 billion doesn't believe in the divinity of Jesus or even that he didn't exist.   and the scientific method originated from Christianity.  That is not true. It originated from people who wanted to know about the world, aka it originated in Evolution, the mechanism that made us into inquiring beings for the sake of maximizing our survival. Just because the society in power at the time happened to be Christian does not make science a product of Christianity. Just because only Christians had enough money to construct/buy a telescope doesn't mean that Jesus caused the computer. Believing in a story without any good reason did not make people into rigorous investigators of reality, quite the opposite. The darkness was clearly perpetuated by religion, not lifted faster than it would have happened without it.  EDIT: xD! This is a good demonstration for why the claim "Christianity created science" just doesn't make sense. (The first two paragraphs are sufficient.)  https://np.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/3d2anx/my_mother_died_last_week_of_religious_fanaticism/   Why wouldn't they give details about the resurrections, e.g. about what the resurrected persons have experienced? Anybody would do this in any story they tell about others, even if they didn't feel a need to convince others. And most people would know that a profound claim like this leaves the minds of the people listening with doubts or at least questions, and they would hence detail it a little.  The fact that they didn't suggests that people were used to outrageous claims like that without caring much. - It's just stories. Or "resurrections" were just comatose or unconscious people returning to being awake, so such a claim didn't faze anyone.    A few decades feels like a long time to us because our lifespans are a few decades.  I'm a bit older than 40 and I think that about 80 years is quite a short time span. I'm curious - how old are you? From your statement, I would guess that you are somewhat younger than 40.   In fact one could even argue that time may not even exist in heaven/hell in the traditional way we understand it.  That depends on the nature of the experience. Most people know that time flies while you're doing what you like, while it's crawling when you, for example, suffer in Hell.   I would say that "good Christians" is obviously tied to the fact that the post text speaks to people who would go to Heaven, not to people who could end up either way or who would certainly go to Hell.   That whole concept shows a serious lack of understanding of how the mind works.  If people would be born without body into a vacuum, they would only drift dreamingly for lack of any reality other than their existence.  So, after a finite time-span of this, would God judge their character? No, because everything is arbitrary, and the only truth is that the person *exists* and can dream. Their character is made-up and can be dreamed away like anything else.  Born into reality, you can be in the wrong place, wrong time, wrong body, with the wrong people. That is not the person's fault. This would inform the way they "dream up" their character. While this could lead to a solidly evil person, they are still just a mind in a situation. If that mind were left alone in a vacuum for some time, the mind would change its tune.  Punishment can not be eternal. That is all.   People can change. E.g. once you realize "I'm in the place with all the bad people! I didn't expect to be *this* bad. I don't want to be here!", you might want to change. The problem isn't so much eternal fire etc. - which you say wouldn't be the case - the problem is that the negative decision is eternal.  Dad came into mum in the wrong part of town, so I must live with the shit-people for eternity? That is not fair, period.   There's another problem with this, too: Time dilation in the universe means that a person's experience is not changed at all even though their time is flowing slower than the frame of reference relative to which their time is dilated.  So, if time in Heaven would be a lot slower than on Earth (which would experience the lack of intervention - "Tried to put out the fire, but by the time I had made the decision, they had invented sprinkler systems."), then this wouldn't mean any change at all.  I guess you're saying that time does pass in Heaven, but the emotional experience of it will be a lot different. That's basically a non-statement, because that experience will be different in Heaven than on Earth is known by everybody. And it took unnecessarily long to arrive there.   So, we will not be the process that consciousness is once in heaven. We'll not be aware at all. We'll practically be dead. Ok, got it.  We'll certainly not interact with others. Nothing will have consequence. How meaningless.   That's what the wings are for. Once the sun does that, all angels flap their wings furiously for a million years to keep the heat away.   People who really believe that are pitiful, and people who make others believe that are extremely guilty and will hopefully find their comeuppance.   So, what is it that actually spares from hell? Is it "accept Jeshua of Nazareth as your Lord and Savior"? Metaphor-alert: What if the green that I focus on in my mind is the wrong shade of green? What would it actually mean to believe in *the* Jesus? What if I e.g. have an image in mind of a white guy with flowing hair and such, while he was rather a brown dude? https://feltco.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/img_0503.png  But while the above problem certainly makes sense, the actual problem is this: Why would anyone decide to believe that? What about the Muslims, the prime example for why Christianity is probably wrong (because they do all the same things to arrive at their belief, and their belief is quite a *different* one)?  And what about the majority of mankind, who does not believe that Jesus existed or was divine?  Why are you using a tool of the devil (A computer.) to tell the world these things? I mean, we would not have computers (Certainly not.) if we wouldn't exercise the proper critical thinking that is required for science to advance this far.   /r/bad_cop_no_donut    Is it moral to punish someone who repents?   Define "repent". Is it just the true will to accept the guilt and to not do it again? Because, while that's a good step in the right direction, the next steps would lead ultimately into prison.  Accordingly, a just punishment for anyone would be if they had to suffer through having to generate all the positive energy that they stole from others, which could be a hell-fire-like purgatory. However, once this debt has been repaid, the person would have been cleansed from all wrong-doings of the past.  So yes, it is just to punish someone who repents.  Someone who repents is no different from someone who decides to actually pay back the monetary debt they have, instead of waiting for the powers-that-be to force the consequences on them. That is how *proper* justice works.    Your point is that something seems unfair to you, but without knowing what would be fair how can you judge that?  "I don't know the proper answer to this math question, but I know it's not 'positive infinity'."  "I don't know who committed the crime, but I know it was not the victim."  Logical deduction. You can exclude answers, you know.   The response to this would be really interesting. It would have to justify that whatever the knowledge of Christianity brings is worth risking ~~an eternity of~~ eternity in hell. And *nothing* can ever have that kind of value.    our own consciousness is basically an illusion  I've heard that stance before from various sides, and since so far I have not yet seen a proper explanation as to how that could possibly make sense - an explanation that is very obviously necessary - for the time being I deem the intellect of people who actually believe that to be completely absent.  In case it's really not clear how that belief can not possibly make sense, here's a hint: Who is having the illusion, or rather what is it that allows them to experiencing this illusion?   How do you account for other religious beliefs then? Do you really think "Yes, they might have done the same exercise that I did, but I happen to have the *correct* belief, while they arrived at a wrong one."?  A person can't arrive at belief in Jesus with proper critical thinking.   So, you want to know why you yourself desire to know the truth, and you hope for OP to tell you, because either you yourself don't know, or you want an additional opinion. Ok, got it.   Evidently, Taqwacore is currently not around.     I want to believe as many true things and as few false things as humanly possible.    Why?  Ask yourself why you asked "Why?", then you should find the answer.    It just seems like justification you could use for anything.  Theists are doing that 2500 hours a day. The moment you can make up things about the set that contains all other sets (which in a theistic world is "God"), you can make up *anything*. Such discussions are literally (As in: The meaning is just the way it is phrased.) *below* the level of rigor of vampire saga fan-fiction. Such discussions are hence certainly *more* laughable, and people who take them seriously are pitiful.    God could do everything instantaneously,   So, you believe that "omnipotence" means "anything ever, no limits"? That's quite contrary to what theists have accepted it to mean for centuries.  But in case you *do* adhere to the version that means "Only what's logically possible.", how can you make a statement about God's abilities if you have no idea what the situation was that God was working with when he created the universe?   Such a time will not come. The word "atheist" is not like the word "hipster" or "furniture", it is a word whose meaning is very clearly communicated by the word itself. "a-theist" = "without theism" = does not have a belief in a god(s), or even believes that those don't exist.  Whatever the faithtards will try to rape into the minds of mankind, this word will either stand, or all of the English language will fall.   A bazillion problems with Noah's ark is killer evidence against the flood itself. To make the ark problems go away, God's omnipotence has to be invoked. Once that is being done, the discussion is over anyway. "Just somehow." can't be used as a reasonable argument.  A bazillion pieces of evidence supporting an old Earth. So, how can the thing you mention be? It can't. Only in the wishful thinking (aka imagination) of the faithtards can it be.  Nothing to see here. Life goes on.   Tried to buy a phone from our own company. A colleague suggested I should rather buy a Samsung, which I ended up doing. Yep, that's it. No explosion at the end. Just sane people doing sane stuff.   I'll pass: A large part of the video image is missing. You can see it right at the beginning, where the text/logo is at the right border instead of in the middle.   But you *do* know that 1) a lot of what the Bible says is open to interpretation, 2) the interpretations vary, even among larger groups (not just fringe groups), and 3) there are other interpretations of *God*, too (e.g. Islam), right? So, while the facts, if they were facts directly from God, might be absolute, the way they arrive at people makes them to a much too large part *a decision of the people*.  What is your stance regarding that problem? Do you not fear that the truths of right and wrong you believe in and feel justified to affect other people with are really *man-made*, or even just from you personally? I mean, GOD sayeth "This shall be and that shall not be.", but YOU choose which God to obey and which interpretation to use. Basically, YOU are God, effectively in this scenario, no? Not just in authority, but also in innocence. And do you not think that the people who live by such a conviction are possibly hazardous and/or dangerously deluded, or maybe even plain simply blaspheming against (the actual (will of)) God?   xD  Excuse me, but I've got better things to do.

You're out of luck: God himself strolls these forums these days, and he's firmly on the side of the atheists, because he's the most fervent anti-theist. (Which makes it clear how improper that term really is.) Religion not only drove mankind insane, it also slanders and blasphemes God all the fucking time, it's impossible for me to get a word in, I can't write on the blackboard because everybody is smearing their bottom-feeding truthless loveless egoistic bullshit on it. Religion also is somewhat an enemy of science, while I personally fucking love computers, for example. Of all the people who will be slaughtered during the beginning judgment time, the majority will be religious, because they are "those who don't want to hear".  So, I indeed have all the knowledge of the universe. Not every detail, I don't know every language, I'm not even good at math (mainly because most of my mind is busy with preparing the "official" part of the apocalypse). Just know all about the thing that all these details are derived from. Wanna hear them?  Of course the first thing I did when I saw your post-text was to indeed downvote you, but you expected that, because you're 90% troll. And what you stated was just a poorly phrased God-of-the-gaps argument. The people here just want someone to present evidence or a new interesting argument. If you don't have that, fuck off.   Any decision/action that causes even the very slightest amount of suffering in another being (meaning that even their feeling of having their freedom of will reduced would count) is potentially evil and hence needs to be evaluated and justified. Without proper justification, the decision/action must not take place. All this concerns evil or the lack thereof.  Evil is the unjustified "reduction of another being's existence", it makes it be less, so to speak. Good, which is not required at all but of course appreciated, is the opposite of that: It is decisions/actions that contribute to another being's existence, e.g. holding the door for someone who isn't directly behind you, but is also not so far behind you that your action would suggest that they should walk a little faster.  Those who doubt that this text describes truth should realize that I basically just restated the Golden Rule, and the problem always is the concrete implementation.

Try to accept and love reality unconditionally, and you'll see. It's not just a psychological trick.   Actually, my plan is to conquer it with mankind once judgment time is over and once we have cleaned up Earth. No colonizing before we haven't made Earth into a shining example.  The reason that I haven't shown up yet is that mankind's freedom is my unconditional and unchangeable will, and since mankind can't be bothered to accept the burden of the coming change, I obey mankind's wish that I, the agent of this change, shall stay hidden. This is slowly shifting, but we're not at the tipping point yet. Once we are, cascading change is to be expected. It's gonna be quite stormy.

It's really the prime example to kick anyone who dares to besmirch the image of science in the balls.  I guess the reason is that the connectedness of the world and the precise nature of the connectedness escapes most people, and those who might study things like socio-economics could be proficient in that kind of connectedness, but they might still be completely blind to all the others. It takes a big mind to understand a big world.  It's just that I believe that with the right kinds of abstractions taught to kids in school, we could make their minds ready to build a big map much more easily, in a more stable manner, and as a much more self-evidently necessary process.

Off topic: My personal feeling regarding 1) 2) 3) and a) b) c) is that the former is ordered by something and/or gives preference to the items with the lower numbers, while the latter lists options of equal values and it's just because of reality's properties that one is forced to present them with spatial/temporal separation and hence apparent preference.

Here's a page that lists a few: http://www.creativebloq.com/colour/tools-colour-schemes-12121430    Does your friend understand how peer reviewed science works?  Religious beliefs arguing against evolution are like a drop of water complaining that the brick wall is less stable than the drop.   Feels good, man. (What. Do I need more? It's the best basis of moral behavior, assuming that the resulting decisions are indeed moral. At some point in your life, you know that they are.)   I completely disagree with religions and what they say, but here's a working concept:  1) "Don't pull a person out of a car wreck! Wait for the medics to do that."  2) "Get that person out of the car wreck immediately!"  Both can be correct. How can that be? Well, the situation in case 1 is that the person in the car could possibly have damaged bones, even a broken neck. If a layperson moves the patient, they could seriously harm or even kill them. (Hence in almost all cases: Don't touch the person. Don't believe Hollywood movies, they even still tell you that defibrillators are used to start hearts while in truth they are used to return the heart's muscle to a proper rhythm.)  In situation 2, the car is on fire or about to be destroyed in other ways (e.g. approaching train).  If we don't know the situation in the background, we have to trust what the person with oversight is shouting at us to do right now, even if it doesn't seem to make sense to us.  In other words: The morality would be the same in both cases, except that the immediate rule would emerge from an "eternal" rule on a higher abstraction level, and which immediate rule is to be followed would depend on the local or global situation.    If free will is truly free, the individual is still in a machine of probability.   That's what I tried to contradict with my comment, but it's hard to convey what "truly free will" is supposed to mean. What I certainly mean is that it's not a probabilistic thing. That's why I said "spiritual" and "higher than physical reality". I don't know if such a concept even makes sense (let alone is possible), but the idea here is that the decisions of this will would be entirely unpredictable.  Think of it like this: It would be like the will of God - a prime mover will. If there were no universe and other existing situation but just this being, what would its first decision be? The problem of answering this question reflects the problem of coming up with an understandable definition of "true free will" (which is "libertarian free will", I think).  If God exists, then I think it makes sense to assume that our will works just like his.   Whether or not your concept would solve the problem depends on what nature that free will would really have. If it's some kind of spiritual "higher than physical reality"-will that is just able to come up with *new* stuff, then God would not be able to predict it. So, I guess you're assuming compatibilist free will, aka on some level a machine. You can assume that Christians, who believe in a soul and all that jazz, are not compatibilists.   But I think that it not being fast enough and there not being any direction that leads out is *the same thing*.   "Why?" - If mankind happens to choose unwisely, we might experience a deteriorating evolution, for example maybe if we enable genetically unfit individuals to procreate. With old frozen sperm, we could do a rollback, so to speak.   I did not confirm your point, because your point wasn't just that atheists wouldn't believe, it also was "And that is bad.", which I clearly disproved, and I would like you to react to that counter-argument instead of doing a "Gotcha!"-routine.  So, again: Do you think that it is bad or good that people of today are more skeptical and know more about how easy it is for the human mind to be mistaken and how counter-intuitive events and mechanisms in nature can sometimes be?   A photon aimed away from the BH could still escape from 1 mm outside the event horizon, but not once it's inside the event horizon.  Is that because spacetime itself is moving towards the singularity at the speed of light at the EH? Is it faster than light closer to the singularity? In case your answer is "no", could you explain this a little?   If weird out-of-the-ordinary events would take place which can't be explained based on all the things we know now about reality, then we would file them under "unsolved" and would investigate them as far as possible/reasonable.  The thing is that the quality of life that science has brought us wouldn't be here if all involved scientists would have been as gullible as you seem to wish the people would be. Because a key part of science is about *rigor*. How many things wouldn't we know now if after a certain statistical significance, we'd just say: "Welp, that's it. God must have done it."  In other words: *Are you serious?*   Since you didn't flair your post "Christianity" or "Abrahamic", my answer is: Because none of that ever happened. The reason that people believe in God, among all the psychological/emotional ones, is that we can sense God as the fundament of existence with which we're all one, and the religions were ways to put these (Misinterpreted.) findings of profound truth into scripture, rules, and ways to repeat such experiences.  To those who tap into this "sound in the background" that speak that God indeed exists, it is clear that "he" is not interacting with reality but is just upholding it, letting it flow unimpededly. I'd wager that this "sound in the background" will eventually grow in power, though, and its increasing obviousness would change the way mankind decides.   What would it matter *if* the USA were a Christian nation? Truth is what matters, not habits, majority-vote, folklore, or might-makes-right.  But just in general, I think it's best to just throw at *all* these people the fact that there are other religions, equally strong in numbers, who give different answers to the same questions, based on the same evidence (scripture and what-the-people-say), this even happens among *the same* religion. A rational person sees this and realizes: "I must find a different way to determine the facts, because their paths obviously don't work." And that leaves you, basically, with science. Or generally with evidence-based determinations, determinations whose success can be verified.  If those people keep talking even though you have tried the proper arguments and phrased them clearly enough, then just believe yourself "I have done my part." and end the communication.   You can keep claiming that a human can not become God, and I can keep correcting you that I did not become God but caused the universe. If you'd just object to my claim that I am God, I would say "You don't know that, but it's a reasonable assumption.", but you're not doing that. Instead, you're assuming that my claim is that I became God and object that this is not possible, to which I agree.   Even if one doesn't have a cat or other animal and doesn't have any contact with animals at all? Doubtful.

I suggest you consider changing like I did. You might become as happy as I did.   Evolution is so screamingly logical, those who don't get its implications either just haven't thought enough about it, or they wouldn't be able to produce a proper result even with enough thought.  A being that builds itself based on a plan. Then it self-replicates, but in an environment (Universe.) that is always stormy on the nuclear level. Hence the result is often changed because the plan was altered. If the outcome was viable, now we have *two* such fronts on which new beings are drafted. All this over many millions of years all over the planet even on many (spatially) vertical levels, which is a bit overlooked by the deniers ... If anything, we'd need evidence *against* evolution, not at all evidence *for* it.   People keep arguing in the forums that the proper translation from the original would be "murder", so lawful killing wouldn't be affected.   If a murderer tells you not to murder or proposes that it's written down within view of people that murdering is wrong, they might be a hypocrite, but what they are doing is still right. Just saying that it isn't a useful argument.    At the flash point of a particular fuel, its vapour pressure is high enough to produce a fuel-air mixture that can be ignited. However, a lit cigarette doesn't have enough heat to ignite that mixture  Thanks, that completely clarifies it. I don't know why I didn't get it the first time.     Yes, and utilizing the amazing tool that Google has become by searching for `time travel camera movie` would have lead you straight to its [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2669336) page. I won't say the title, because you gave relevant parts of the plot away.   In a similar line of thinking, the development of nuclear weapons would certainly have taken place, anyway, but the horrible examples set by the two bombs exploded in Japan wouldn't exist, which might result in different decisions in situations like e.g. the Cuban missile crisis. So, the population today might even be lower by a billion more.   How do we determine the center of an infinite universe or of an infinite length? We can't, because there is no center. And a value whose numerical representation is infinitely long has *no end* (which is what "infinite" means), so there is no last digit.   By that reasoning, you could also argue that a raincloud can simulate a computer, as long as the computer is turned off. I think that all possible states should be allowed, otherwise it's not a proper simulation.   Rule of thumb: If you are hit by energy, you will be *affected* by it. If the energy level is high enough, the effect will be damaging.  There might be cases in existence where this rule doesn't apply (After all, even entropy can decrease (locally).), but their rarity would justify to live by this rule.   So, the original meaning of "analog" and "digital" was quasi "territory" and "map"?   Finally.   Right, that makes sense. And doesn't allow communication. Thanks.

 I have. And you know what? Looking at their voting records doesn't make everyone reach the same conclusion. Mostly because people find some issues/votes more important than others. I know that Sanders opposed a 2007 immigration reform bill while Hillary Clinton supported it (just edited this because I accidentally deleted the "supported it" here before I posted this)--and I find that a much more important issue than others; and in this case Hillary Clinton voted much more in line with my own views.   They both support improving on the ACA, support a deal with Iran over their nuclear program, support normalizing relations with Cuba, have slammed income inequality, and so on. I support these--as do they. And I did that isidewith thing that people have been posting all over r/politics and the results were identical to the point that the difference was negligible: 95% Sanders and 91% Clinton--a mere four percentage points difference. So, yes I can agree with both and they both seemingly putting out the same thing.  	2

I think Jamie Oliver could be a celebrity/dark-horse candidate who could make the list if it was done today.  Gordon Brown wouldn't be an undeserving inclusion, IMO either.   What with all the hagiography/state funeral etc. after her death I wouldn't be surprised if she placed higher.  Agree that Diana would slide down the poll. Her placing last time was a bit of an anomaly, IMO.   The decision made by Morgan Freeman's character at the end of the second one could be taken to be an anti-NSA statement though.         Im also very worried about drone proliferation, with other countries acquiring these weapons systems. In 1945, only one country possessed a nuclear weapon, and look at the world now. I think the same thing is going to happen with drone proliferation.      A poet sadly felled in the first world war. [As were many others.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Phantomsnake/List_of_Artists_Killed_in_the_First_World_War)   Vicki Janik's introduction to the book I mentioned in my other comment touches on the some of the concerns I had in relation to fooldom:   In ancient Greece the fool-parasites charmed the wealthy into offering them dinner invitations with the promise of entertainment and joking. One step from being beggars, they exploited their own pretended or real infirmities for food and money. Welsford describes the existence of such figures in Greek and Roman society. Nearly two thousand years later in the courts of Europe, natural and artificial fools still were supported and often entirely maintained by the wealthy. Many courts, including that of Peter the Great, the early-eighteenth-century czar of Russia, kept great numbers of natural and artificial fools. In order to maintain the size of this group, his court went so far as to arrange marriages and funerals for naturals such as dwarves who were wed in grotesque mock ceremonies. Thus, like the jokes they told, natural fools seemed spontaneously to generate and to be forever maintained agelessly; where they had been and when they had left were either unanswerable questions or irrelevant ones.    Even very famous fools in society lack clear ties to the real world and seem to be at odds with "normal" existence. Will Sommers was born, according to Robert Armin's verse, "in Shropshire, as some say / Was brought to Greenwich on a holy day, / Presented to the king". His heritage is questionable: meager references to family, like that to an "onckle," may be only fictional, having been recorded by Armin from traditional jokes. Armin also writes that while Sommers dined with the king and Cardinal Wolsey or jested with the king alone, he later "laide him downe among the spaniels to sleepe". Such contradictory, atypical experience is representative of the fool. Modern, real-life fools sometimes live similarly unfocused lives. Douglas Brode contends that Woody Allen's persona has penetrated into his private life and is at odds with the private life he tries to live. Although Allen's experiences have been more acutely painful, they reflect the confusion surrounding the private lives of Groucho and Chico Marx. The necessary peripheral objectivity and isolation of the fool perhaps make the intimately shared life of marriage and family difficult.   *Fools and Jesters in Literature, Art, and History A Bio-Bibliographical Sourcebook* ed. Viki K. Janik pp.8-9.   Thank you very much. I gave those a read. I've also just come across *Fools and Jesters in Literature, Art, and History A Bio-Bibliographical Sourcebook* edited by Vicki K. Janik which looks like it should be a very informative read. I'll give Christopher Moore's *Fool* a look too.   I was struck by the thought on reading *King Lear*. That is set in ancient Britain but anything about jesters/court fools from throughout history would be much appreciated.   Would they have had families? How were they chosen? Are there instances in which they have been portrayed that are particularly accurate/inaccurate? What are the best sources for finding out more?                  Another suggestion that I once read (the source I cannot at the moment find) was that the 'binding' had to do with a gathering together of the wisdom of the ancestors.

One third of winnable seats  those lost by less than 10% at the last election  are being contested by Tory women. This contrasts with Labour where all-women shortlists have been used to shoehorn female candidates into seats from which they can realistically reach Westminster.   Labour women are set to contest three in five of the partys winnable seats and 10 out of 11 safe seats  classed as those won by more than 10% in 2010. Just under half of female Labour candidates have been chosen from all-women shortlists and 65% of those in winnable seats are the products of such lists.

Just over a hundred and sixty years ago in 1853, Charles Dickens strode at haste across the stage of Birmingham's Town Hall to give the first ever public reading of A Christmas Carol; one of many he was to give that season to benefit the New Midland Institute. Being a great supporter of the working man, Dickens agreed to this reading on condition that seat prices were reduced in order to suit the pocket of the working classes of the town, many of whom were glimpsing their hero for the first time. Here the city's newspaper describes the setting.   *And thus the day passed and nightfall came on, more bitter and freezing than ever; the bleak wind whistling through the streets most dolefully. It was just such a night that Mr Dickens came to read his Christmas Carol to a small family circle of some 2,000 people in our vast Town Hall. What a grand, fine looking party it was. The lights were so brilliant and the drawing room so gay, and the holly so tastefully wreathed that there could be no mistake about this being Christmas. Then the host himself arrived and took his place in his big armchair and told us that we may laugh and cry as much as we wanted, as he liked nothing better than a lot of sympathy.*  I think we can safely assume that by the beginning of the 1850's, Charles Dickens was most certainly England's first 'superstar.' His fame as a writer was thundering rapidly across Europe and the United States. And his ever changing appearance was becoming known to millions through paintings, engravings and photographs which would appear almost weekly in a variety of periodicals, though many would never have encountered him in the flesh. Certainly very few of the 2000 eager faces who rose to cheer him that evening in 1853. What they would have seen was a gentleman of average build sporting a Frank Zappa moustache (the beard was to arrive later) and a mop of dark tousled hair brushed fiercely almost tempestuously forward. He was expensively attired in full evening dress, with diamond studs glittering in his shirt, a bright red buttonhole, a purple waistcoat and a simple watch-chain. He looked quite spectacular. While the applause continued to build, Dickens glanced fleetingly at the huge assembly of people, took a quick sip of water, and then with theatrical elegance raised a hand for silence. As the applause faded so grew a sense of excitement as everyone leant forward in anticipation of hearing his voice for the very first time. "Marley was dead: to begin with." And so the evening began and continued to do so for three and a quarter hours.   A Christmas Carol was written in 1843 and published in the same year that Henry Cole brought us the Christmas card; a time for rejoicing and initiating into our homes practices hitherto unheard of at the time, such as good cheer, sharing gifts, much merriment and even Christmas trees. Dickens's sources for the tale appear to be many and varied but are principally the humiliating experiences of his own childhood. But more than anything his distress at the conditions of the poor and the plight of children attending 'Ragged Schools'; organizations run voluntarily and dedicated to the free education of destitute children. It was visiting one such school and seeing the array of bright beaming faces that a seed was planted for a book, a book that he hoped would cheer people's hearts with generous fellowship. As soon as A Christmas Carol was published and the miserable images of Want and Ignorance, whom he describes as being, 'yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, were introduced, people immediately sat up and took notice. Changes were hurriedly made to the Poor Laws, the Factory Acts were repelled and with it came an end to child neglect and slavery. A Christmas Carol has achieved a kind of immortality, born out of the very conditions of the time.   He poured into the story his own personal memories, especially that of Camden Town and the long walk that Bob Cratchit would have had to make to the City; of his sister Fanny's crippled four year old son, who took on the mantle of Tiny Tim. From his own deep self he drew the understanding that a grown man may pity the child he had been, and learn from that pity, as Scrooge does. 'In short I should have liked, I do confess, to have had the slightest license of a child and yet been man enough to know its value.'   Dickens decided to set the tone of Carol through the eyes of one man. A mean, pinched, misanthropic old skinflint of a man, uncaring of others whose face 'wore the signs of care and avarice; a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, covetous old sinner; who carried such a low temperature about with him in the street that even the blind man's dog appeared to know him.' According to Dickens he stumbled upon the name while taking an evening walk through a graveyard in Edinburgh. Apparently the headstone was for the wine merchant Ebenezer Lennox Scroggie, whose claim to fame was that he had won the first contract to supply whiskey to the Royal Navy. The inscription identified Scroggie as a 'meal mad (in other words a corn merchant), but, due to the fading light and Dickens mild dyslexia, he may have misread this as 'mean man.' But either way Ebenezer Scrooge, one of literature's most notorious characters, sprung immediately into life. Unfortunately the headstone was lost during reconstruction in 1932.   It is generally believed that the character of Scrooge was largely based on Gabriel Grub who appeared in Dickens first novel, The Pickwick Papers. Gabriel Grub was a rather misanthropic gravedigger, an 'ill-conditioned, cross-grained, surly fellow, who eyed each merry face as it passed him by, with a deep scowl of malice and ill-humour.' To show his displeasure for the festive season and his keenness for money Gabriel begins to dig a grave on Christmas Eve only to be visited by a gaggle of goblins who drag him down to their goblin kingdom. There he is shown all sorts of misery, even the death of a small, much loved child and awakes a better man.   Dickens began Carol in September 1843, and in keeping with the title of his work, divided the story into staves. (Using the word metaphorically, instead of chapters) Sometimes the emotion was too much and Dickens would have to break away and take long night walks, 'when, all sober folks had gone to bed,' covering anywhere between 15 or 20 miles. Six weeks later he completed it; and 'broke out' as he himself described, 'like a madman. Such dining, such dancing, such conjuring, such blind-man's buffing such theatre going, never took place in these parts before.' Thackeray, not always an admirer of Dickens, called it a 'national benefit,' an American entrepreneur gave his employees an extra days holiday and Thomas Carlyle went straight out and bought himself a turkey. Stoking up all this cheerfulness was the news that the book had sold 6000 copies at five shillings each on its first day; becoming the most successful Christmas book of the season. (Mind you five shillings was nearly a half week's wage for some). Dickens knew instinctively that he had created a modern fairy story and for the first time been able to complete an entire fiction without being compelled to write in serial form.   After the success at Birmingham, Dickens took his readings to every major town and city in the country, across to Ireland and eventually the United States of America, where he was greeted like some iconic movie star. But the strain took its toll on his health and he would insist on his doctor sitting in the wings in case of the possibility he might collapse.   He began with A Christmas Carol and he ended with it. His last reading of the little book took place in London at the St James' Hall, March 15th 1870. At the end of the performance he told his audience that 'from these garish lights I vanish now for evermore, with a heartfelt, grateful, respectful, and affectionate farewell.' There was a stunned silence immediately broken by a tumult of cheering, hat waving and the stamping of feet. With tears streaming down his face, Dickens raised his hands to his lips in an affectionate kiss and departed from the platform for ever; an infinitely sad and broken man. A few days later the Queen, at a private audience, regretted that she had not heard his reading. Dickens expressed his regret but explained he was unable to offer her a private performance, not on the grounds of infirmity, but because, as he told her, a mixed-class audience for him was essential. Etiquette kept him on his feet for the ninety minutes of their conversation, and as a mark of her esteemed respect the Queen did likewise. Charles Dickens was to die three months later at the age of 58.   *Dickens wrote in the preface of A Christmas Carol:*   **I have endeavoured in this Ghostly little book to raise the Ghost of an Idea which shall not put my readers out of humour with themselves, with each other, with the season, or with me. May it haunt their houses pleasantly, and no one wish to lay it.**  *Their faithful Friend and Servant,*  *Charles Dickens*  _______________  From the programme for Clive Francis' performance of 'A Christmas Carol'.    The law states that a car shouldn't be towed (i.e. classed as 'abandoned') until 8 hours after the administering of a ticket. The impounders were breaking the law.   OK   They should not have towed his vehicle when they did. To that extent, he has been vindicated.   People don't overdose from smoking heroin.   They should not have towed his vehicle when they did. To that extent, he has been vindicated.   Thank you. I'll correct this error.    Walter Tull  What an extraordinary man!

A possible lesson in non-attachment perhaps...   Thank you. I shall include those names in due course.   Thank you very much for that submission. It gives me much to sort through. Of those 560 some might fall outside the label 'artist'. I shall endeavor to follow this up further.   This is very much a work in progress. Please feel free to improve it if you can.      I'm looking to create a page that could perhaps become a Wikipedia article (or just remain in its current format). I'm sure that there are many more names that I could add. I also hope that it could potentially serve as a historical resource of value in its own right.

The comments about society at large were stimulating. The details about the farming industry were revelatory.   I feel the articles presentation of this incident and its fallout highlight an important and perhaps troubling aspect of the world today.      He who clings to the Void  And neglects compassion,  Does not reach the highest stage.  But he who practices only compassion  Does not gain release from the toils of existence.

Look at the difference: http://i.imgur.com/6wceTQN.png   Not 'the exact same rings' at all. Look: http://i.imgur.com/6wceTQN.png   Look at my comment about the rings being different. Subtle but undeniable.   Look closer.   The rings are different! Clara's ring in the promo pic has the thicker oval bit run parallel with her finger. The ring in the clip in the episode has the thicker bit run perpendicular to the wearer's finger.  The rings are definitely different.   Painted, not tattooed I imagine.

The conclusion might well be that there is a conspiracy among the London-based Welsh media to avoid presenting Wales as a country that can have diplomatic relations with other countries. The British states greatest fear must be that if Wales starts behaving like an independent country then it may become an independent state  just like Ireland.

 Unless I switch to the Razer Naga Chroma, which I won't, I'll stick with my wired 19 buttons thanks.   And half the time I should be sleeping... I have a reddit problem.   Its a fun game but holy hell I'm glad I got out before the addiction set in. Having a heroin habit is less expensive.   I don't know how this comment has so much support, but I'll plead my case anyways.  Couple years ago I took nutrition, and we had assorted fresh fruit and vegetables brought in, organic and traditional varieties.  All of the organic forms tasted less bitter and looked healthier.  Before any one of you say that organic food is a scam of any sort, go try it. Compare a usual strawberry vs. an organic one. You will immediately notice a difference.  As well, organic food is often comparably priced. Even up here in the Great White North, which is frozen 1/3 of the year, we can get quality organic food for barely more than the usual. Most of the cost of non-organics is shipping. Many common fruits and vegetables come from California.   I don't have a desk (ok its a counter), but when the restaurant is slow the waiters bring us water/fountain drinks when we want it. One of the perks being paid only $13/hour for an entry level job.   OR....! Drink it at a reasonable pace. Get up for more coffee more often. Same idea as the water bottles people are taking about.   I had an applied math teacher in high school that packed the bottom drawer of his desk with Clif bars. Popped one open every hour or two, helped him lose 50 pounds in a semester by keep the metabolism going all day plus exercising.   Which side of the bars he's on.   Eh. Love the movie, hate the actor.   Does no one realize this is an overpriced roundabout??   Canadian too. Didn't realize White Castle is a real thing until much later...   Last winter my car was written off because some stupid bitch in her daughters SUV with 4WD was going 20km over on the iciest road in the city, thought she could start braking with just 10 metres. Put her engine block through the trunk and almost into my backseat.  I had some boards in the trunk, if I was leaning on the centre armrest at all, one of the boards would have broken my arm.  Didn't matter to insurance that my 18 yo car was in mint condition (no scratches, rust, etc) with new tires and small engine upgrades, didn't get near enough payout to get another car. Been stuck using a transit system about as reliable as a crackhead.   Most kitchens are pretty relaxed, but there are some hardass bosses. If youre not working quickly or putting out bad product, the head and sous chefs will call you out on it.  But the shit and abuse Ramsey pulls is all for shock value on camera. Those people working in there most likely sign papers waiving rights to sue for the emotional abuse he deals.  Things were different say 20 years ago, ive heard stories of chefs smacking people around with large ladles or throwing insert pans across the kitchen. That doesnt fly anymore. Thats now included in battery charges.   Why is weather reporting still a thing? Unless a tornado is going to level my house, it doesnt matter if its rain or shine.   Enjoy the hole in the ground, or the waters of Its a Small World at Disney.   I like seeing the issue raised so often. Social problems like gun control aren't a circlejerk, they're a topic that needs to be worked out immediately.   Used to see a Lamborghini at a local church in the pastor's/priest's/trained monkey's spot during summer months. Never sat well with me.   And the most successful scam to be legally protected in very country in the world, save state-enforced athiest nations.   Where I'm from, 45 melts tires eh?   Not even entertainment, just sensationalism.   How is this not higher. Started a new job this week, no clue what my hourly wage is.   Wouldn't surprise me if thats how Ramsey ends his career/free life. As far as celebrity chefs go, his food is unimaginative and basic, his aggression in a real kitchen would violate numerous human rights, and top it all with failing restaurant(s).  Source: work at a french restaurant, and my executive chef feels the same way.   ITT: people are all comedians and needy bastards. I love reddit haha.   I hate that guys guts. I don't find anything he says funny; watched a few episodes, loved George, Kramer is a goof, but then he comes and hits the buzzkill switch.   Eh, maybe yellow. Its an awkward place to scrub while standing one one foot in the shower.  This kinda blew up while I was at work, figures my top comment is about washing damn feet.   Have aspergers. Most of us don't do repetitive behaviours like that.   Gotta have that morning shower. And after work shower (kitchens are hot and messy). But that ice cold post-workout shower is so refreshing too.   Being in the culinary business, its shit like this I hate. Sure its small, its supposed to be. That kind of salad is meant to prepare your palette for the main dish.  I'm going to guess you're used to your drive-thrus and 6 big mac combos, with diet coke because you're watching what you eat.  Food is more than shovelling horrid quantities in a gapping maw. It really is an art. It must taste good, and look good too.  As for the pricing comments I'm seeing, it is pretty common for upscale restaurants to have a flat rate and pick a starter, main, and dessert. It may be $40, that's because 75% of the cost goes to paying people who spend years and tens of thousands of dollars training to do the job.   Unprotected straight sex seems to lead to an increase in females growing parasites for ~9 months, and when its finally removed, have cloth and care for it for another 16+ years.  I don't like kids, can you tell?  Edit: to make my point relevant, there's a lot of shitty straight people doing things to mess up others lives, especially children, so straight relationships aren't gilded in gold and silver. Let people do what they want and be done with it.   So many hotkeys? Haha! The only game I've ever played with less buttons to push was Pokemon, when I was 6.  I've played a lot of games, and nearly all of them had more hotkeys.  Fast forward many years, my Naga has every button and scroll wheel position bound with shift and control modifiers. Now THAT is a lot of hotkeys.   Thinking of moving there from Canada in a few years.  From what I've read, lots of social benefits, 85% athiest population, and 90% of the country speaks English.  Also, Swedish meatballs.   Theres like 4 major chains for guys to shop at without driving to the other side of the city, selection is limited, so stop being a judgy prick.   Was just talking to a friend from Pennsylvania last night about this.  Apparently you Yanks don't have delicious Canadian Hawkins Cheezies. Claims to be made with pure real cheddar with a satisfying crunch.  Its like Cheetos but infinitely better.  Edit: to be fair, I can't get Sprecher root beer in Canada so I have to make trips south for it.   Various online retailers, its the 21st century   Take the preaching elsewhere, i like the music and dont care about their personal lives.   Ah. One is just Bob Marley and the Wailers, the other is Bob with the quote "only ourselves can free our minds"   Only if you get caught.   I came here for an explosion and saw what looks like a big bag of chalk go poof.   Hardly fair, I have a lot of shirts with favourite bands and artists; Van Halen, Led Zepplin, Bob Marley, The Beatles, AC/DC, etc.   Pierre Trudeau wore capes, and a lot of people seemed to like him.   Need a comfy pair of stringless leather shoes. Like walking on a cloud   Can confirm. I enjoy classic Stones. A lot of people seem to get along well with me.   My brother says this as his go-to instead of laughing.   Here in Canada, Bootlegger carries some very fashionable Affliction shirts. I don't get it either.   I do believe its slang for British pound.   Highmaul isn't going to raid itself.   Cache memory was the same but didn't know about the hyper threading. Will have to read about that.  Not that I will ever need an i7, I play WoW and SWTOR and stream netflix.   Its personal choice to spend money how you want, but if you look at the numbers between the current i5 and i7, its a .1 or .2 GHz difference (at least when i built my tower last February). Couldn't justify that difference for the extra $100.  My laptop is pretty old now too, 1.7 GHz i7, first gen from 4 years ago.  	48
 It is wonderful to see such applicability from a simpler scripting language. Thanks for the informative response!   This IDE is attractive. It's simple too which is admirable. I've been considering picking up Python to learn over the summer and your comment reinforced my considerations. What are some applications of Python in the workplace from your experience with it?  	2
 I think it is you being afraid to step out of your comfort zone. You are only doing what you know and are used to. When ever you feel like quitting, think about why you started or how it will make you feel or benefit you when you finish. I suggest stepping out of your comfort zone slowly. Try not to overwhelm yourself. Set attainable goals and build of off that! You got this!   http://imgur.com/hI7gTuB  - Just had my triplets 7 days ago.      Bunch of bull crap !

 We want to use one platform that can handle simple 1-3 page sites, with the capability to be expanded to more like e-commerce.   Yeah, that is what I was thinking, thanks.   Is Django a good tool for developing fairly simple websites for clients? I feel that the admin site is a nice feature for these site. If so, could you recommend a Django hosting option?   My team and I are planning on developing Django based websites for local businesses. We are wondering how to go about hosting these Django sites for clients. Should we have them self manages by clients or should we manage hosting for a monthly fee? If so, what are some good hosts for this?      Great, thanks. I am learning Django right now for freelance web design and I am experienced in Java.    I'm a high school junior looking to gain more experience and validity to my college application. I know it is a little late, but what are some good programs/activities to gain an advantage in the application process? I'm looking into some web development for local businesses or something of the likes.

Not especially sciency but there's a lot of fascinating stuff about inventions in their historical context. Maybe for 8 years old and up.                                                      "Challenge" is a completely normal word in English.  It's just not used in this way -- "try to challenge."                                              And is 'mid drifts' an affectionate Briticism?                       Now rarely, next seldom, then often, eventually usually.  I believe it gets easier when you see the benefits of sharing a vulnerability.  Also there are good opportunities for humor.

 All I see is [this](http://i.imgur.com/WHCexX0.jpg)   This horrible joke again huh?   Care to give us a reason?   Tony Chimmel... [The Rated Rrrrrr Suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuperstarrrrrr!!!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4b4QL0tDQk)   "Every other black man on the roster" - Vince McMahon   You got it dude!   The Authority because if I suck up to them I get anything I want   nope...try again   Somewhere Luke Harper is blushing   Mask salesman with shit eating grin   He is saying "FUCK FIN BALOOOOOOORRRRRR!!!!!"    He is angry there is another Irishman in the WWE   I still don't get the hype over these guys.   And if you're not down with that.... we got two words for ya....!!!   so I take it you edited his page 2 hours ago like the change log says?   Some form of this:  "The jabroni-beating, la-la-la-la pie eating, trailblazing, eyebrow raising step off the break, put your foot on the gas, always ready to whoop some ass, People's Champ, The Rock!"    I honestly talk about him as a person and a wrestler separately.  There's Chris Benoit the wrestler and Chris Benoit the person    I remember how he was a great wrestler which in my opinion should not be tarnished by what he did.  He was a bad person for what he did and for that he should not be remembered.  But to outright dismiss what he accomplished in the ring is dumb.   Money   It was on here long before Cole was using it.   So if you want to complain about it blame this sub   Fucking regular negative Nancy aren't you?   They don't become gay.  They are already gay.  They just come out as gay   "Lie"Ception   Cena vs Orton.  I feel like it would be a fresh match between guys we have rarely seen go at it in the ring.   I swear to god this post has been made half a dozen times today and then gets deleted again.   Either Kid Chameleon or [Gunstar Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunstar_Heroes)   The same things they have been doing, with a few more moves from each.

You're mama's so dumb she thought a quarterback was a refund   still gotta pay for that one time   I would be fine with this if I knew for a fact that it didn't lead to a stupid arm wrestling contest.   Gotta pay for the young talent in Jarrett and Vader somehow   If they are consistently booked well like they should be they will do good.  I just have a hard time seeing how TNA will keep them booked well.  I get this feeling like they just brought them back in to get a boost and to make people ooh and aah for a bit.  Once that wears off I feel they will fall hard, and be gone again.   Morgan and Hernandez started as mid card giants but then toward the ends of their respective times in TNA were rarely on TV because TNA was too busy with other things.  And TNA's track record with giving older guys way too much money to do way too little is horrible so there's no doubt they paid him a ton.   So they bring back two people who they completely fucked over in terms of giving them solid booking (Morgan and Hernandez), some guy that is so old and washed up that always just booked himself to win and people hate (Jarrett) and another old guy that they are probably paying way too much to do too little (Vader) and this show is somehow fucking great again?   One win in NH... the Jeff Hardy ladder match.  One of my absolute favorite matches   Honestly it was cool the first time it was said.  Then Reddit ruined it for me with all the suplex city shirts and artwork.   Two nuns, Sister Mary and Sister Elizabeth are walking through the park when they are jumped by two thugs. Their habits are ripped from them and the men begin to sexually assault them.   Sister Elizabeth casts her eyes heavenward and cries, "Forgive him Lord, for he knows not what he is doing!"   Sister Mary turns and moans, "Oh God, mine does!!!"

Like Cole is just doing this on his own.  Every time they do this it is because they are being told to from the back.   I'd like to see [Ayako Hamada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayako_Hamada) but with the TNA past who knows.  WWE does seem to be lessening the blocking of ex-TNA talent so this could happen.

JR and Regal   He is a tweener...used where he is needed   Well that was dumb on their part.  The F-5 is far more devastating than Rollins' Pedigree and HHH's too   Oh agreed 100%.

                                                             There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare.    Sun Tzu, *The Art of War*                                                   Yes and on May 7, 1915 the Lusitania sank, putting the US on an inextricable path towards war with Germany. I didn't say the US entered the war on May 7, 1915.   The sinking of the Lusitania in and of itself is the conspiracy.                         Blame Gandhi, in 200 years of British colonialism and direct imperialism the subcontinent remained united. In one fell swoop Gandhi, Nehru and Churchill come to the genius conclusion that India needs to partition Punjab to create an Islamic state to stop religious violence (*that sure worked like a charm*) between Hindus and Muslims.    [The Punjab region, the land of 5 rivers, is 137,000 square miles.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_region)   [Compare that to the modern Indian state of Punjab which is just 19,000 square miles.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab,_India)  It seems like Gandhi, Nehru and Muslim leadership in India reached a mutual conclusion to screw over the smallest minority in India, the Sikhs. They gutted Punjab, 19,000 square miles is nothing, to this day we have to share a state capitol with Haryana, in Chandigarh.                            Yes, its about the elephant.       I agree.

It took only 3:30 to encode a 4:45 video (shot in 1080p) to 720p. Used to take about 16 min to encode the same video on the same Mac using the previous version of Compressor.  Apple, I am impressed.

Most of my favorites are listed here, but a sleeper space movie that I thought is worth a mention is Silent Running with Bruce Dern. It presents a strong ecological message and has decent effects for its time (1972).  Loved the personification of and interaction between the drones Huey, Dewey and Louie.            I would say more complex and richer with additional tones.      Samsung produced both chips.

From JPL's Dawn website:   The three principal scientific drivers for the mission are first that it captures the earliest moments in the origin of the solar system enabling us to understand the conditions under which these objects [minor planets] formed. Second, Dawn determines the nature of the building blocks from which the terrestrial planets formed, improving our understanding of this formation. Finally, it contrasts the formation and evolution of two small planets that followed very different evolutionary paths so that we understand what controls that evolution.

 That's some serious tint on those windows. Something's going down in that truck that's making him have to repent so hard.    Raccoon Cat.   [Apparently yes and no.](http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=761122).   They say he's been fined 3 times prior. Apparently you only get 1 game per number of instance. What a joke.   And it's a joke that the NHL takes into account injury. Players get injured in totally legal plays. Why don't those legal plays get suspensions if injuries are reasons to suspend? And plenty of players are incredibly not injured, like in this instance, or others like countless boarding penalties that could have resulted in devastating neck injuries. It's the ACT, not the result that merits the suspension.    He should not be playing hockey right now. The suspension for his crosscheck to the neck should have sidelined him for the season, not 4 games. And Byfuglien only got 2 minutes for that. And no further action after the game. NHL discipline is an absolute joke.    Aggressive   so you just quote that whole thing to people in conversation, huh?

Amid all the deep, philosophical and intellectual texts, it's often just as important to laugh and be silly.    I'd put Tarasenko, Ovie and Ennis in the top 3.       if Fanduel has a player's name in grey font in the lineup, what does that mean? Are they tentative? A subsitute?   You should share your analysis with everyone so we can tell if you're on to something or not. For science.    My work has very strict restrictions on software downloads and I can't get f.lux at the office. Does anyone know of a settings for the monitor colors/brightness that will mimic the f.lux software?   How can I tell if my monitors are "flicker-free" or not?   I would just like to thank you for saying RBI and not RBI's   I'll be heading up for the weekend stand against the Braves. I'm looking at either the 200 infield level, 1st/3rd baseline or behind home plate. Does anyone have preferences for views? Are there any perks with the 200 level; is it considered 'club' or just higher up?   I started DFS earlier this year with NBA and NHL and have been pretty successful. I do a fair amount of research and it's worked out. Through two days of MLB (and I've played regular fantasy baseball for years and follow the sport closely) it's been a disaster. I've scored 14 and 11 points respectively between Monday and Tuesday. How are people consistently successful at MLB DFS? What are people doing to build good lineups day to day?   it looks like Scott is listed as the starter, but from what I've read, it looks like Muscala should get more minutes   With Cousins out and the terrible defense on both ends, how about Payne as a punt at PF? I'm looking at either him or Muscala/Scott. Thoughts on Payne or which one of those guys?   Was going to downvote you until I read your edit. Good point for the illustration...it might work better, and be more reflective of reality, if the money stairs were barricaded by glass walls or something.    Why's it named Puzzles?   Fans of ??? will be very excited.   In my first MLB day ever, I scored 14.5 points on FD. So yea...I guess it's all up from here...   If you're around college age, people rent out rooms in houses to students, or people look to sublet their room that's in a house with their friends. I've been on both sides of the subletting arrangement and it's totally fine. You can go, meet the people first and decide if it'd be worth it. You can easily find some spots under $500/month for that.   Does anyone else have this problem? It happened on my older macbook and on my new one now, no matter the browser. If I go fullscreen in MLB TV, it only fills like 2/3 of the screen. Any fix to this?   I've been refreshing it, I saw one post about an hour ago that had him in the lineup    Is Paul Pierce starting/playing tonight??    I'm not even mad   Holy shit. I was gonna brag about starting fanduel 4 weeks and going from $100 deposit to $191 with NBA/NHL $1-$2 GPP's   H2H's but damn that's some money.    Also...can I borrow some money?   great advice. taking pictures of my bike's serial number when I get home.    No, Murphy thinks he's being pinned against something.    Thaddeus Young or Ilyasova tonight? Vegas has Nets at 10 more points than Bucks tonight.    Thoughts on loading up with Anthony Davis and Cousins?? Big price tags and playing each other, but both teams give up a lot of points to those positions      I can't decide between Parsons and Ariza tonight. Any thoughts?   Any thoughts of C Parsons v T Ariza tonight? I'm torn on them      yea, that's the name   As a Sabres fan, this has me a bit worried. Let's say we lock up last place, then lose the lottery getting 2nd pick and Eichel...I'm worried that Murray throws some insane package out there to trade the 2nd pick, Reinhart other prospects/picks for McDavid. He seems to be one of the few that think the gap between McDavid and Eichel is pretty big. I don't think it's that huge...at least not bigger than what it would take to trade for him.       Is that an actual Arnold quote? Do you know from where?    Or drink the water.    I can't tell if this is a joke or not...   I live in WNY and it's always taken about a week to get to me.   Whenever I take a screen grab with the smart select and share it, if there's any text, the note 4 transcribes all the text from the image into the message. Kind of redundant and can make the message really awkward to send. Is there any way to remove this feature?    Where are those? I'm running NHL mostly. I only see 20 man league entries that pay top 3      I just started The Gunslinger a couple days ago and my only problem with it is I can't put it down and my girlfriend wants me to "talk to her" during dinner.    As a Sabres fan, I'd be offended if I wasn't rooting for them to lose every game   Looks like a Feldian sales day. Too bad the AquaSphere and La Isla sales aren't on the same site.      It's fantastic. I picked it up a month or so ago when it became available on Amazon at $35. Worth every penny.    but seriously...how much do you vary up your lineups when you put in 100 entries? Do you put in 10 each of 10 different ones? Hope a couple of them hit big? try to do as many different ones as possible?    Word. I put in two entries in the $2 tournament and won $12. So, yea...I'm upgrading it to a meal at Subway for lunch today.    all very true. good points. just stands out when they're the first ones I've done.    Yea it's just crazy...the one guy I keep noticing has easily cleared $10k in this week from the entries that I've seen. He's won two tournaments ($3k each) finished 2nd ($2k) and a bunch of other top 10's). I know people play head to heads for big money and what not, so it's not the money that sways me, it's just how someone can consistently do that out of 20,000 people. Especially in something that can be as random as hockey with butt bounces and deflections etc.   I just started on fanduel and, as a big hockey fan, have done some of the tournaments the past week. I've noticed one user has won at least two of them and has had several entries in the top 10 every time. I don't get how this is possible. Up to 20,000 entries per tournament, and this one guy can regularly win the whole thing? How many entries do people put into these tournaments?   This is possibly the most Canadian joke I've ever heard.    Not if you buy $75 of more games :)    [Also available on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Asmodee-LIBT01USASM-Libertalia-Board-Game/dp/2914849877/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1425991169 sr=8-1 keywords=libertalia) for $33.41 with free shipping if you're a prime member (US)          Truly understand their needs  Drugs   alcohol is their needs? Systematic humiliation? Are you kidding me? You know you can actually talk to these people right. You can ask them what they need. Who in here is promoting the humiliation of homeless people? If someone is begging on the street with the sole purpose of extorting money for free booze   drugs, than they're systematically humiliating themselves. If you got off your inane libertarian pedestal you'd see that. if you asked someone what they want, and they said 'cigarettes,' ask why. Chances are if they're that honest, your perfectly picked exception, is probably accurate. If they say food, then you offer to buy it for them, and they say no, then they're lying and want drugs, not something helpful. Your argument isn't controversial. It's short-sighted and lacks any thought of actually engaging the person in conversation. You're just lazy and don't want to be bother finding out what the person needs, you just want to absolve yourself of any responsibility while up on your pedestal of moral disposition.     Yep! And if you live somewhere that gets cold...scarves, hats, gloves, etc. Lots of cities are popping up with scarf trees or poles, where people tie scarves (or hats) to trees so the homeless can anonymously grab whatever they need. Donating these warm items and other daily essentials are some of the most important donations to shelters.   Exactly. Just move on. Dude was just looking for money for drugs/alcohol.    Yes. I'd rather attempt to give sustainable nourishment to someone that is rock bottom than worry about their dignity and just say yes to enabling drugs and alcohol dependence. So would everyone else with a conscience. Please see your downvotes as evidence.    Absolutely this. It doesn't ever have to be a surprise. Ask them if they'd like food and what they would prefer or anything they need to avoid.    Because you're likely enabling a substance dependence/abuse disorder and not actually helping them get nourishment they may need? Because most chronically homeless have some sort of mental disorder; roughly 1/3rd of the homeless have very severe mental disorders. They're often not in a mindset to differentiate between what's good and bad for them. You may not give a shit if someone drinks themself unconscious or uses heroin, but don't act like you're doing it out of some sort of moral principle. You just don't care. Which is the problem.    Use your words. Say hey, I don't have any cash, but is there any food I could get you from the store? If they say no, then all they likely wanted was cash for drugs or alcohol.    Or get off your cynical ass, and do volunteer work or check to make sure you're donating to a worthwhile charity.   This isn't WTF. This is actually helpful information, albeit posed in a very dramatic manner. I've worked for NPO's focused on aid to impoverished and homeless, and done volunteer work for like organizations in my city. Do NOT give cash. The vast majority of the chronically homeless have mental disorders and substance abuse issues. Maybe they do want food, but when they walk into the 7-11 with your $5, you're damn right they'll see those 40's and buy a couple instead. If you want to do something right there for them, go into the nearest convenient store and buy them a hot meal or hot cocoa. Or find a local organization and volunteer or donate to them. and if you want to make sure the charity you're donating to is worthwhile, visit www.charitywatch.com, www.charitynavigator.com or www.givewell.com.   Edit: I'm not sure if a lot of these responses saying 'homeless guy said fuck off or threw my food away when I offered' are trying to prove my point or argue against me. You are allowed to talk to them, and ask if they would like food and if so, what they can eat (being aware of allergies). If they say fuck off or no, then just keep on moving, they were only looking for free drugs/alcohol anyway.   ....   and thanks for the gold anonymous stranger!    Obviously the picture is blurry  *"and I refuse to take a new one"*  Also, that is zero **Splendor**   [Now accepting questions](http://i.imgur.com/Fgsukcg.jpg)   Try.       I don't know...I'm not picking up a newspaper that is 3/4ths info on Rochester, Syracuse and Albany. I just don't care that much about their local goings on.    Have you ever seen a goalie jump?? When the shit has a goalie ever jumped? The crossbar isn't 8 feet high.       Fair enough. I was annoyed at other people saying he was deaf etc. /u/excelius was the last I saw and did offer it as a suggestion.    No. Person was high. It was only the first question he asked. He literally just forgot to speak out loud and then laughed and spoke normally the rest of the time. Reddit fuckin loves jumping to conclusions without any questions.    No, he wasn't deaf (you asshole). It was only the first question. He talked normally after that. He literally just forgot to speak out loud. He also giggled after he realized it and his eyes were bloodshot. I'm not a moron, I know the difference between a deaf person and high person.    I just switched from Galaxy S4 to the Note 4. On my S4, the menu button brought up a settings menu. In the Note 4 it brings up the multitasking pane of all the open apps. Can I switch this to the settings pop up menu option?       Mesothelioma   Yea, those damn asbestos dandelions are getting out of hand.    There are local Patterson reps with offices on Filmore in Tonawanda and in Crosspoint Pkwy in Getzville.    he said "we have two cars."   This current war I know we were matched up in a couple minutes. It's usually pretty quick   You'd think at some point we'd be the overly strong clan at some point by accident or something    My clan of 30 has been getting killed on wars. I don't get how we're being matched up. We are consistently being put against clans with much higher bases than any of us. I don't get it. Why could this be happening?    [Thumbs Up](http://i.imgur.com/sn3Brky.gif)   Hell yea. Keep up the fight! Just [keep reaching for sticks](http://d24w6bsrhbeh9d.cloudfront.net/photo/a2NXEze_700b.jpg)   If you pick the Sabres now no one will call you a bandwagoner! Worst team in the league! But there's oodles of young talent in the pipeline and we're on the inside track for McDavid or Eichel, so we'll have a superstar (hopefully) and contender (hopefully) for years to come.    If that's a draw for you then more power to you. I couldn't think of a more boring team than the Devils for in terms of pure style...the Devils are responsible for ruining pre-lockout hockey with their trap. Made games unbearably boring and clogged up. Give me an open, exciting game every time please.    Needs more explosions, eagles and dinosaurs.    I think Walter's money is just to the right.    Remember kids: if there's one instance of something it's true all the time. Someone has clorox wipes on their desk? Office is always dirty! Someone works everyday? Probably no vacation time!    How about instead of drawing bizarre conclusions from random observations that could have a million different causes, you just ask to see the company's benefits package. That seems reasonable.    *"and that wasn't my penis"*     	125
 Very true. Many people are happy to throw away the first amendment when someone disagrees with them but don't want the same to be done to them. This is very common especially as of lately with the political left. They term everything that they disagree with as hate speech that should be banned, sometimes even arguing for jail time for it. They are the arbiters of what is "hate speech", which is very convenient for them because it could be used as a tool to silence anyone that disagrees with their political agenda.

   Exactly. It's super fucked up that the NY governor did that without even consulting or notifying the NYC mayor. He has got the right idea and I think it's awesome he's riding on the subway and eating in restaurants Spencer was at to prove it is safe. I know nothing about NY politics but he seems like my kind of politician.   Maybe it's the fact that I've given some reliable informed users on the subreddit a higher vote weight on RES.   Hmm it's showing up as -1 to me. Dunno how the system fudging works but I trust you that you would be able to see a more accurate value than me for your own posts.   That's just what I got from your posts. It seems other people agree with me some or your posts wouldn't be in the negative right now. Note: I did not downvote you at all, just wanted to say that.   I agree and they have learned a lot from their mistakes in Dallas. They were too concerned with public image and panic and I believe they simply over estimated the ability of untrained health professionals to properly protect themselves. They were also woefully unprepared, a simple earlier designation of specific and well equipped hospitals in each state to deal with any ebola patients would have made the situation never happen.   The thing is the CDC did fuck up in Dallas but has learned from those mistakes and implemented much better protocols and plans for dealing with new cases. Remember the people working at the CDC on Ebola are some of the greatest fucking minds in their field. I know firsthand, I do research in Atlanta and the lead researcher was hired by the CDC in August to work on Ebola. I actually drank some beers and shot the shit with him tonight. That man is brilliant beyond measure let me tell you.    I wonder if this political mentality will change after the elections. If the republicans do well, I'm concerned this short-sightedness will continue and continue to make things much worse long term.   I'm reasonably certain it will turn out to be true. The question is after this same situation occurs 10-100 more times, will that incredibly low probability of indirect transmission actually occur?    I know right. It's almost like I'm on a /r/filoviralscience and /r/ebola hybrid instead of the /r/ebola of a couple weeks ago.      how the crazy is now making things worse.  Can you elaborate I'm just a little unclear as to what you're saying. Is it that the irrational panic from the general populace is going to put a crazy amount of strain on the process of sorting actual potential ebola cases from something like the flu?   Damn dude there is no reason to get so defensive and almost hostile, that is not conducive to a productive discussion.    This sub has taken quite a refreshing turn for the better recently, or at least it seems that way to me.    Could you provide the source for live whole Ebola virus never being found in sweat? Is it this from the CDC?  In one study involving both the acute and convalescent phases of illness, Ebola virus RNA was detected from patients saliva, skin (swab of the hand), breast milk, stool, tears (conjunctival swab), and seminal fluid, but not urine (5 patients), vomit (1 patient), sputum (1 patient), or sweat (1 patient). In a different study that focused on the convalescent phase of illness, Ebola virus was detected from vaginal, rectal, conjunctival swabs and seminal fluid of 1 or more EVD patients by RT-PCR, but not in urine or saliva.18 In another study involving 28 convalescent EVD patients, all specimens other than semen that were obtained between 12 and 157 days after symptom onset were negative by viral culture and by a viral antigen assay including 85 specimens of tears, 84 of sweat, 79 of feces, 95 of urine, 86 of saliva, and 44 of vaginal secretions. The eight convalescent specimens of semen were also negative by viral culture and by a viral antigen assay, but Ebola virus was detected by RT-PCR in six of these eight semen specimens.   I could do the math but I'm a lazy and its been like 3 years since I took physics I so could you maybe give a exact gravitational force? Ie earth is 9.81 m/s^2 I believe   Not really related but do you ahppen to know what the estimated mass of this comet is? Just wondering how strong the gravity on it is.   Haha typical. Looks just like a standard logistic curve aka a Richards' curve to me. At least before the death phase. I hate the lack of standardization between disciplines for things like this.   As it turns out, he actually followed self-quarantine protocols to a reasonable extent. See http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2k5fjb/patient_in_nyc_tests_positive_for_ebola/cli5639    Yes this seriously concerns me. If Ebola manages to spread into india and south america, it's possible we have tens or even hundreds of millions of cases by then. So far I really don't think any of our efforts in West Africa have had any substantial effects on R0, it even has seemingly increase from 1.5-1.9 at the beginning of september to 1.8-2.18 based on a study I read published a week or two ago. Being as proactive as possible in all respects is paramount.   Just doing my best to put the somewhat esoteric nature of scientific literature regarding Ebola into a form that anyone can understand.   I thought it was exponential too but the CDC source I listed in my post describes it as logarithmic.   I just can't believe the archbishop in Liberia would make such a statement that directly conflicts with Pope Francis' stance on the issue.    Turns out that he seemingly acted reasonably given the circumstances. http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2k5fjb/patient_in_nyc_tests_positive_for_ebola/cli5639   That seems to be almost exactly what he did actually. http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/2k5fjb/patient_in_nyc_tests_positive_for_ebola/cli5639   I just want to add that yes I do think the CDC did a spectacularly poor job handling the dallas case, but you have to look at the politics behind this too. Public health falls under states rights, not federal so the CDC really had no power at all going into this case. The only real thing they could do was advise the TSHD and the hospital on what should be done. Their advice was lackluster as well unfortunately. I believe the Texas State Health Department and Dallas Presbyterian are much more to blame than the CDC for the response quality though. I guess that's to be expected thought, I haven't lived in Texas for a couple years now but I believe Rick Perry has been slashing their budget left and right.   That being said, I think the CDC also put too much faith in the competency of the Texas healthcare system and I don't see why the specialized Ebola team the CDC now plans to send to deal with future cases was not already in place. Same thing with the lack of designated Ebola designated hospitals   It's thought that up to 10% of West African may have innate immunity to ebola. This family of diseases has basically been around for 10 million years in that area and it makes sense as there would be some evolutionary advantage for genes which give ebola immunity. Other than that I'm not really sure, there are a ton of things we just don't understand about Ebola. Prior to this outbreak, it had always burned itself out after killing only 20-400 people so it was thought this would always happen and it really wasn't well studied. Add on top of that the difficulty of dealing with Biosaftey level 4 pathogens and you get a very minimal amount of studies unfortunately.    This is not true at all, Ebola is much more transmittable than HIV. Can you get HIV by sleeping with a blanket that an HIV patient used? You sure as fuck can get Ebola that way.^1 Can you get HIV from just 1-10 virions on a mucosa membrane, like for example if someone sneezed and a little bit of phlegm got on your hand and you later wiped your eye? Nope.  1-http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3035551/   I agree that it is probably much less, but I'd like to see stats from more than a handful of cases before making definitive claims. Right now anyone in the first world with ebola is going to be cared for at somewhere like Emory or NIH where you have some of the foremost experts in the world caring for you... unless of course your name is Thomas Eric Duncan. Hospital staff that are not this specialized may not be able to get such low mortality numbers so I think your claim is a little misleading.   Ah thanks that's good to hear. Should have expected the story to always be more sensational when it first appears and no one really knows whats going on. In a day and age where you can simply edit online articles as information comes in and at whim this is bound to happen.   I agree, the CDC should definitely err on the side of caution and do whatever is necessary to minimize any risks, however slight they are. My post was just really meant to quell any concerns NYC citizens have, especially if they may have been near where this doctor was.   Also my research is in bioinformatics too. Working on using ribosome profiling data to improve gene prediction algorithms sensitivity and specificity, right now better identification of true start codons for ORFs in prokaryotes.    I'm conflicted about this doctor. I am angry with Spencer for this situation but at the sametime he definitely deserves some blame, he put his own life at risk to help save people in an impoverished African nation despite there being no monetary incentives. He was over there doing something I would never dare to do and when shit finally hit the fan, his response, probably unconscious self-denial, was just so human I can't help but empathize with him. It's easy to sit here at my computer and watch this unfold far removed from the actual event and say what an asshole how could he let something like this happen. At the same time I can't help but think this was a good, selfless human being who volunteered his time doing something incredibly noble for people halfway around the world who he had never met and had nothing to offer him at all for his help but their thanks. How could someone do this type of selfless act and also still act the way he did and put the public at risk. He definitely knows a shitload more about the disease than even most educated people in the world, he knew exactly what was at stake but still acted this way. Here we have a seemingly incredibly compassionate and giving person act in way that is at the very least negligent putting the entirety of his home country in danger.    Source? Just would like to take a look at it to get the full story.   Not likely, it already kills quickly enough that is actually is thought to be a limiting factor for the spread of the virus. Previous to this outbreak, it was thought that because it killed so quickly, it would always burn itself out by killing all its hosts before they can infect other people. From a biological standpoint, a successful virus is one that is best at reproducing. The most successful viruses are ones that don't kill their host at all, a living host can continue to spread the virus while a dead host means any virus in the body simple becomes "dead" or inert and the ability of the virus to infect new hosts is greatly reduced.   If anything, I would be more worried about it becoming less lethal, that would allow it to spread much easier.    Fair enough, that's what I get for putting very unscientific probabilities I basically just made up in a otherwise fairly scientific analysis of the situation.   I think [this article](http://scienceblogs.com/aetiology/2014/10/21/the-hot-zone-and-the-mythos-of-ebola/) covers it pretty well. I bet it is the same article you are talking about though, so basically I agree with it.    Yes, the general rule of thumb is that someone becomes contagious when symptoms appear. This is not definite as the someone without symptoms does not suddenly develop them instantaneously but over the course of hours or days. The viral levels are increase throughout the progression of the disease, and generally higher viral levels mean more contagious so the worse your symptoms, the more infectious you are. This is all a general rule of thumb somewhat simplified for clarity's sake and there are exceptions and unknowns that come into play here.  Basically ebola builds up in certian immune cells and eventually causes these infected cells to lyse, or explode. When this happens, the virus leaves these cells in large quantities enters the blood stream spreading throughout the body. I believe this is also around the time you become symptomatic.      Name one confirmed case resulting from exposure as indirect as this and I'll give you something more than a rough estimate I used for clarity and emphasis. The only thing I can think of that is even close is one lady had no direct contact with anyone with ebola but did sleep using the same blanket and Ebola patient had used earlier and she came down with Ebola   I mean I guess you could put as an amateur expert although I don't like saying that because I really don't feel comfortable calling myself an expert. My work isn't directly related to Ebola and I have been following it as more of a hobby so I would say I'm a fairly knowledgeable regular person. I can't hold a candle to those brilliant people working day and night with incredible drive and passion at the CDC.   Probably depending on the stage of the disease and the virus levels in the body. In later stages, the virus begins to show much higher levels in your bodily fluids, and thus it is easier for those 1-10 virions to find a way bypass your innate immune system by entering though your eyes, nose, or mouth. I believe saliva has some built in innate immunity properties so entering through the mouth is less likely. but could be wrong so   I couldn't find any specifics regarding virus presence in sweat this early after the onset of symptoms but here is what we know about presence in various bodily fluids over 12 days after symptoms appear.    In one study involving both the acute and convalescent phases of illness, Ebola virus RNA was detected from patients saliva, skin (swab of the hand), breast milk, stool, tears (conjunctival swab), and seminal fluid, but not urine (5 patients), vomit (1 patient), sputum (1 patient), or sweat (1 patient).16 In a different study that focused on the convalescent phase of illness, Ebola virus was detected from vaginal, rectal, conjunctival swabs and seminal fluid of 1 or more EVD patients by RT-PCR, but not in urine or saliva.18 In another study involving 28 convalescent EVD patients, all specimens other than semen that were obtained between 12 and 157 days after symptom onset were negative by viral culture and by a viral antigen assay including 85 specimens of tears, 84 of sweat, 79 of feces, 95 of urine, 86 of saliva, and 44 of vaginal secretions.19 The eight convalescent specimens of semen were also negative by viral culture and by a viral antigen assay, but Ebola virus was detected by RT-PCR in six of these eight semen specimens.19   My philosophy is the worrying about possible but probably unlikely hypotheticals and event like that should be left for the people in charge of public health. This includes all hospitals, medical staff, the CDC and the US government in general. Yes it could spread from this event, but all we know about the disease right now says it won't. Plan for the worst while retaining optimism, these are not mutually exclusive.   Gah I wrote a long detailed responsive and pressed cancel instead of save! Basically there is a possibility anyone who touched the bowling ball or shoes within a timeframe of 12-24 hours either had a minor abrasion allowing the virus to enter the bloodstream or wiped a mucosa membrane like thier eye after getting a virion on their hand by touching thes two items.  Here's the current extent of our knowledge of ebola levels in sweat  In one study involving both the acute and convalescent phases of illness, Ebola virus RNA was detected from patients saliva, skin (swab of the hand), breast milk, stool, tears (conjunctival swab), and seminal fluid, but not urine (5 patients), vomit (1 patient), sputum (1 patient), or sweat (1 patient).

I want to be incredibly angry with Spencer for this situation and though he definitely deserves some blame, he put his own life at risk to help save people in an impoverished African nation despite there being no monetary incentives. He was over there doing something I would never dare to do and when shit finally hit  the fan, his response, probably unconscious self-denial, was just so human I can't help but empathize with him. It's easy to sit here at my computer and watch this unfold far removed from the actual event and say what an asshole how could he let something like this happen but then I think this was a good, selfless human being who volunteered his time doing something incredibly noble for people halfway around the world who he had never met and had nothing to offer but their thanks. Not only that  but he knew a shitload more about the disease than I do or any of the public does as well, he knew what was at stake but still acted this way. Here we have a seemingly incredibly compassionate and giving person act in way that is at the very least negligent and unintentionally malicious to the entirety of his home country. Fuck ebola.     Live presser with DeBlasio and Cuomo just said he was on the A train, the 1 train and the L train.  I didn't the press conference but this was edited into the post I orginially replied to.    This story is still very unclear. Based on the NYT article, not this CNN one it is my understanding he started feeling ill on Tuesday and proceeded to ride the NYC subway, take multiple cab rides and go bowling on either Wednesday or today. He had a 103 fever in the ER today, meaning that the disease has progressed much more than either Nina Pham or Amber Vinison. He did not properly follow self-quarantine protocols.   Viral load increases exponentially(actually logrithmically! Oops I'm dumb sorry) throughout the progression of the disease. This means doctors and nurses treating people close to death are encountering virions(virus particles) at levels which are orders of magnitudes higher than someone who was in close proximity to a patient in the early stages of the disease. Since ebola is transferred through bodily fluids, which are encountered in medicine much more often than day to day life, and is HIGHLY infectious, needing only 1-10 virions to make contact with for example your eye, even the best doctors cannot be completely perfect 100% of the time in terms of PPE donning and doffing and patient interacting. One small slip up for half a second could mean you have Ebola.  Despite this with the proper PPE and staff training, it is possible to treat Ebola without putting yourself at risk. Case in point- Emory has not seen a single secondary infection despite treating the majority of US Ebola patients.  We do not know the details about the transmission for this case but something as simple as a tiny misstep for half a second while removing your PPE can result in transmission.    I agree realistic pessimism is the most productive line of thinking if you are in a position where it is your responsibility to ensure public safety. The CDC could have handled the first case better had they adopted this attitude. I think the fiasco of the Dallas case made them reevaluate everything about their response and I believe this situation will unfold in a much more controlled manner and a quality of response which should be a given in a first world nation.   On the otherhand, unnecessary panic could result in something like a public afraid to use NYC public transportation which would have far reaching ramifications. I'm just glad I'm not the person whose job it is to think about this kind of stuff and find the balance between putting into place appropriate precautions and causing unnecessary panic.   Yep, nowadays there is very little incentive to provide just the facts when you can just follow this up with hypotheticals or speculation and make the story a whole lot more interesting to the average audience member. Make them think there is a immediate and definite threat to their well being unfolding in front of their eyes.   Viral load increases exponentially(Edit: Oops I meant logarithmicly) throughout the progression of the disease. This means doctors and nurses treating people close to death are encountering virions(virus particles) at levels which are orders of magnitudes higher than someone who was in close proximity to a patient in the early stages of the disease. Since ebola is transferred through bodily fluids, which are encountered in medicine much more often than day to day life, and is HIGHLY infectious, needing only 1-10 virions to make contact with for example your eye, even the best doctors cannot be completely perfect 100% of the time in terms of PPE donning and doffing and patient interacting.

Case in point- Emory has not seen a single secondary infection despite treating the majority of US Ebola patients.   I have read he started feeling sick on Tuesday and had a 103 fever today. That means pretty high levels of viral shedding.   With what, 7-10 total cases treated in the US I'm a little hesitant to make that claim definitively but it sure seems like it is significantly lower.    You might say I'm a ramblin' wreck from Georgia Tech and a hell of an engineer.   Just trying to help! I encourage everyone to do some research of your own about Ebola, many Ebola articles found on google scholar are not behind a paywall.  It's very reassuring but at the same time oddly terrifying to understand exactly how a relatively simple configuration of proteins and RNA can exploit your cellular processes and cause a body wide breakdown in just 21 days. It seems like this evil, malevolent force bent on the downfall of the human race when it really is just a indifferent self replicating machine   to which human life is of no concern.   Imagine the mental gymnastics you would do to avoid accepting you have a 50-70% of dying within 2-3 weeks.   Now imagine you are a doctor who was probably working with MSF on a 6 week stint and went over 5 weeks without any issues. You are an expert in this ebola, you knew the exact protocols to avoid risk of infection and followed them perfectly everytime... Or did you? Did you possibly incorrectly follow the PPE doffing protocol that one day near the end of trip when you lost focus for that split second? No way, you had no incidents in the other 35+ days doing the exact same thing. You're just overthinking this. Other doctors have done worse and turned out fine. You have an in-depth knowledge of the epidemiology of the disease, you know exactly how you get infected and you have first hand experience with people who were at much greater risk that you ever were who did not contract Ebola. It's nothing to worry about, just like that slight fever 4 weeks ago that scared the shit out of you it will end up being nothing. There is no use in making the same mistake twice and freaking out over nothing again.   I just want to make it clear that I don't agree with this thought process but it is undeniably human.   I agree, pessimism is useless in cases like this where what happened happened and absolutely nothing can change the circumstances. As far as the CDC goes, I hope they err on the side of caution and try and get in contact with as many people on that train as possible. They need to release which subway line this man was on, where he was sitting and at exactly what time right now, while people can remember where they were if they took that same train. Luckily it seems the CDC is getting better in terms of putting public safety above ensuring good PR for their organization and the US government. Let's hope that's the case.  Edit: Just saw they did in fact release this information. I wonder what their stragegy will be for getting in touch with everyone on those trains, I guess asking people to call in is the only real choice they have.   As the old cliche goes, doctors are the worst patients. Honestly no matter how smart you are, no matter how much you know about a disease subconsciously I just don't think anyone can possibly be prepared to accept that you have a disease with a 50-70% mortality rate and very possibly will die within 2-3 weeks. I imagine this doctor did some Olympics level mental gymnastics to convince himself that it was just the flu or something. I also bet you anything he's had scares like this before, maybe not a temperature this high but possibly a minor fever that he ended up getting all worked up about which turned out to be nothing serious. Put all this together and you get a very knowledgeable person behaving in an utterly irrational and even criminally negligent manner.   Here is what I posted in response to someone worried that they had ridden that subway at that time. I am a scientist with a Biomedical Engineering degree and a morbid fascination with ebola. While I'm not an ebola expert, I've been following it since June and am up to date on the current ebola literature. My lab is located in Atlanta and the lead researcher who I see everyday was hired by the CDC in August for Ebola research so I have a a behind the scenes view of that as well. I feel confident in saying I understand Ebola almost as well as anyone else who does not work at the CDC or specializes in epidemiology.    Keep in mind there are multiple confirmed instances of patients in even later stages of this disease traveling on public transportation and having absolutely no transmission occur. Case in point Patrick Sawyer:  On 20 July 2014, Sawyer flew via ASKY Airlines from James Spriggs Payne Airport in Monrovia, Liberia to Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Nigeria's former capital Lagos, with a stopover at Lom in Togo. He was subsequently described as having appeared to be "terribly ill" when he left Monrovia.He collapsed upon arriving at Lagos Murtala Muhammed International Airport.   He was in such a late stage he collapsed  directly after getting out of a confined area with tens or hundreds of people in close proximity to him for hours including a layover. No transmission occurred on that plane.  Here is a CDC breakdown of the 1995 Congo outbreak reinforcing my point:  During an Ebola outbreak in 1995 in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo, 28 (16%) of the 173 household contacts of 27 primary Ebola cases developed EVD. All 28 secondary cases involved direct physical contact with a known EVD patient; overall, 28 of 95 family members who had direct contact with a primary case became infected, whereas none of 78 family members who did not report direct contact became infected. Other studies have reported similar findings, in that all or the large majority of secondary transmissions involved direct physical contact with known EVD patients. Several investigations have also demonstrated that persons residing in confined, shared spaces (e.g., homes), but who had no direct physical contact with these cases did not develop EVD.  One last example, not a single one of Thomas Eric Duncan's family members contracted Ebola. This is 8 people who were living in a small apartment with him for at least 4 days while he was symptomatic. I would not worry if I were you, you will be fine. There is a 99.9999% chance, if not higher that there is no chance of anything coming of this. Even if you did happen to ride in the EXACT same spot as this doctor right after he got off or sat right next him.  Edit to include my sources: http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/human-transmission.html  Edit 2: Thanks for the gold but if anyone else feels so inclined please donate that money to MSF instead. They are doing amazing work on Ebola in West Africa. No other organization can compare to the level of aid they are providing. https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/onetime.cfm      Keep in mind there are multiple confirmed instances of patients in even later stages of this disease traveling on public transportation and having absolutely no transmission occur.

I also bet you anything he's had scares like this before, maybe not a temperature this high but possibly a minor fever that he ended up getting all worked up about which turned out to be nothing serious. It's also strange to catch it at the end of your stint and not show symptoms till you are back in the US. If he is with MSF, he was there for 6 weeks before coming back, if he is presenting symptoms today he probably contracted it 7-10 days ago. That means he was exposed with maybe 4-6 days left in his 56 day trip. You would think the highest risk of exposure would be when you are getting acquainted with the procedure not when you are preparing to leave.          That people living in Liberia know Liberian culture and what would appeal to that culture better than some random dude who lives in Korea? That's not really much of an assumption if you ask me.   I know right. I mean it makes perfect sense when you think about it but for some reason it never even crossed my mind that something like this would exist.   What would you call it? I don't know the intricacies of musical genres very well. Only reason that was there is I posted it to /r/music and that was required in the title   The aim is to make a song that has appeal and use it as a means of spreading educational information. What do you want a super sad song saying Ebola is literally destroying our country?   Who cares what the tone is, sitting at your computer in an air conditioned building you're in no place to say what is disrespectful or not. The people who made this live in the country and see Ebola everyday,  I think they might know better what is appropriate for getting the message out than you do.    How so? Can you elaborate?         Better:http://i.imgur.com/CARGfYO.jpg   Yep, if only it could be that way in the US.         China doesn't have to worry about public opinion or media backlash so yeah they definitely wouldn't hesitate to quarantine entire towns by force. I believe something like 60% of their politicians have engineering or science degrees so they actually know what is it stake and will not fuck around.  India is something I am definitely worried about though.      Maybe, there's really not enough evidence yet to give a definite mortality rate for modern treatment in western hospitals with no holds barred.    Clearly there's a difference between the mortality rate of patients treated in first world hospitals compared to those treated in West Africa.   Can you clarify what enrapement is exactly? I need to know for my notes.   I have been following your posts on this subreddit with interest and really admire what you are doing. Despite this I still do not really know the entire story behind why you are over there, who your employers are, etc. I was just wondering if you or someone else could link me to a previous post which discusses all of this so I can learn a little more. I'm sure others would like to do this as well. Thanks! Keep doing what you're doing!   The world doesn't need saints or martyrs. It needs good people.   I just want to say thank you, you are a good person.   I am not an ebola expert specifically and do not claim to be. I am a scientist, a geneticist and an engineer however. Despite my better judgement and my reservations I am going to post the same thing I did Sunday when it became clear that a nurse was infected with ebola whike treating Mr. Duncan and the transmission occurred in the US I have a biomedical engineering degree with a focus on genetics. I work on genomic sequencing in silica, especially predicting gene coding region of the genome and transcriptome, The lead researcher in my lab(located in Atlanta) is a foremost expert in the world, enough so to have been hired by the CDC in August when this whole Ebola crisis began to become truly apparent. He is now there at least 4 days a week but I still see him almost daily. I have a bit of an inside perspective on this disease and I don't think it is at all out of line for me to say I have a better knowledge about Ebola than the average US citizen.  Biomedical engineering is very broad topic so I have studied topics ranging from biochemistry to anatomy and physiology to genetics and my curriculum included spending time in a hospital observing patients and doctors. I have a high degree of scientific literacy and have had a morbid fascination with Ebola and tried to keep up on all scientific literature since June. Since I posted this a couple days ago, I have been increasingly concerned that it is more towards the side of fear mongering than my original intention of encouraging being proactive, prepared and to err on side the of safety with this disease. Please come to your own conclusions and do not trust anything, including what I or any other scientists has to say without looking into the sources yourself and coming to your conclusions from this information as a whole. I am hesitant to post this again but here goes:  Reddit itself is a cross-section of the a world population consisting mostly of people who are relatively educated, scientifically literate and young. Despite the fact that a transmission of Ebola in the United States is now confirmed, in /r/news replies with speculation like this are still the most upvoted.  [The differences in healthcare, cultural practices,etc.] is why you see the pattern in Africa that you don't, and very likely wont here the US.  This attitude troubles me greatly because the young and scientifically literate Reddit population seemingly agrees with it or else it would not be at the top. Is this not again the same hubris that was displayed with the general public sentiment prior to 9/30 that Ebola would **NEVER** make it to the US? After that was it this same hubris again when many changed their attitude to attitude to OK it got here but there is absolutely **NO RISK** of it spreading to anyone from Mr. Duncan.  For the second time, this kind of thinking can now be seen for the potentially harmful combination of over-confidence and unrealistic and completely irrelevant optimism it is. The whole thought process that we're Americans, our healthcare system is vastly superior to any West African country, it can't spread is not only wrong but is causing inaction and apathy. We can't keep up this overconfidence when up the risk of Ebola is real and saying that it probably will not spread is of absolutely no relevance. The fact remains it **can** spread and America response so far has only demonstrated a significant level of ineptitude and vulnerability when dealing with Ebola.  This arrogance directly resulted in the whole Dallas fiasco and the spectacular mishandling of patient zero on basically every single level possible. The first real evaluation of our healthcare system with regards to Ebola failed literally on every single level. From the initial misdiagnosis, to the negligent handling of potential biohazard, to the miscoordination of government agencies in the quarantine of possible contacts and now finally to improper protection of the hospital staff. I cannot name a single thing that went right.  As a scientist with a morbid fascination in Ebola, I have been following it since June and have taken the time to look at basically every related peer reviewed article and study. I'm sure many of you are the exact same. I have been saying exactly this over and over again since the response to patient 0 was so obviously negligent. My lab is in Atlanta and the head researcher was hired in August by the CDC for work on Ebola. I know first hand that there is a striking and disconcerting difference between the public image they project and the actual feelings of the employees there. I don't understand the attitude the scientific community is using in the media right now downplaying this issue. It's like a parent not telling their child something because they are afraid it is too serious for the child to completely understand that it could bother them. We need to err on the side of caution rather than worry about how this will look to the public.  I think the best thing that the average person who has done their own research and come to the conclusion they agree with this and is as puzzled as I am can be do at this point is to try to change the opinion of anyone and everyone you can. This must be done in a way which is as amicable and non-insulting as possible, as a discussion rather than a lecture, which is kind of hard to do that while getting your point across at the same time. A better way of putting it is that you don't want to change peoples minds at all, you want to provide the means for them to convince themselves their  attitude is incorrect.  **Note:** The above wording implies high profile officials directly stated ebola would definitely not come to the US and that it absolutely would not spread are not entirely correct according to the wording of the press statements.  Obama stated in mid september: 'The chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low.'   Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC in his press conference on 9/30. The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation or case of Ebola so it does not spread widely in this the country.  It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual, a family member or other individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks.  But there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here.'   It was not my intention to make things up for the purposes of my argument and I was more referring to the implications of these statements and how I personally interpreted them along with how I felt the general population did. I didn't look at the exact wording of these statements prior to posting this and was going off memory and should have been more diligent with my claims.  However, the statements are intentionally ambiguous so they don't come back to bite Obama and Frieden in the ass despite a large number of possible scenarios. I feel they also definitely convey a sense of dismissal towards any outbreak possibilities. I believe there is insignificant scientific understanding of ebola in terms of transmission and epidemiology of Ebola to make these claims and this should be made is readily apparent along with any claims. In my opinion press statements about Ebola should be treated with the same levels of scrutiny used in peer review articles. I do not believe any peer review article would have made these exact claims without accompanying them with information about unknowns.   I am **not** saying ebola is an end of days scenario, that is is going to change the world we live or or disrupt civilization. I am **not** saying the opposite either. I am making the point that some of the public sentiment and the attitude of the government towards this disease may be hubris. There are a lot of variables we do not understand about ebola and government and scientific community needs to improve transparency in regards to this fact. I encourage everyone to look at scientific research papers regarding ebola, read as many sources as possible, and listen to what scientists much more knowledgeable than I say. Treat everything with skepticism but you should be able to eliminate any biases by looking in a lot of places. Use this to come to your own concussions and encourage others to do this as well.     I am not an ebola expert specifically and do not claim to be. I am a scientist, a geneticist and an engineer however. I have a biomedical engineering degree with a focus on genetics. I work on genomic sequencing and prediction in silica, especially predicting gene coding region of the genome and transcriptome. If you do not believe me either look through my post history or ask a bit more about specifics and I will be a bit more open. I'm not lying, I'm not making things up and I'm really did not intent to nor do I think I ended up embellishing the truth in this post The lead researcher in my lab(located in Atlanta) is a foremost expert in the world, enough so to have been hired by the CDC in August when this whole Ebola crisis began to become truly apparent.

I didn't look at the exact wording of these statements prior to posting this and was going off memory and should have been more diligent with my claims.  However, the statements are intentionally ambiguous so they don't come back to bite Obama and Frieden in the ass despite a large number of possible scenarios. I feel they also definitely convey a sense of dismissal towards any outbreak possibilities. I believe there is insignificant scientific understanding of ebola in terms of transmission and epidemiology of Ebola to make these claims and this should be made is readily apparent along with any claims. In my opinion press statements about Ebola should be treated with the same levels of scrutiny used in peer review articles. I do not believe any peer review article would have made these exact claims without accompanying them with information about unknowns.   I am **not** saying ebola is an end of days scenario, that is is going to change the world we live or or disrupt civilization. I am **not** saying the opposite either. I am making the point that some of the public sentiment and the attitude of the government towards this disease may be hubris. There are a lot of variables we do not understand about ebola and government and scientific community needs to improve transparency in regards to this fact. I encourage everyone to look at scientific research papers regarding ebola, read as many sources as possible, and listen to what scientists much more knowledgeable than I say. Treat everything with skepticism but you should be able to eliminate any biases by looking in a lot of places. Use this to come to your own concussions and encourage others to do this as well.     I am not an ebola expert specifically and do not claim to be. I am a scientist, a geneticist and an engineer however.. I have a biomedical engineering degree with a focus on genetics. I work on genomic sequencing in silica, especially predicting gene coding region of the genome and transcriptome, The lead researcher in my lab(located in Atlanta) is a foremost expert in the world, enough so to have been hired by the CDC in August when this whole Ebola crisis began to become truly apparent. Biomedical engineering is very broad topic so I have studied topics ranging from biochemistry to anatomy and physiology to genetics and my curriculum included spending time in a hospital observing patients and doctors. I have a high degree of scientific literacy and have had a morbid fascination with Ebola and tried to keep up on all scientific literature since June. Since I posted this a couple days ago, I have been increasingly concerned that it is more towards the side of fear mongering than my original intention of encouraging being proactive, prepared and to err on side the of safety with this disease. Please come to your own conclusions and do not trust anything, including what I or any other scientists has to say without looking into the sources yourself and coming to your conclusions from this information as a whole. I am hesitant to post this again but here goes:  Reddit itself is a cross-section of the a world population consisting mostly of people who are relatively educated, scientifically literate and young. Despite the fact that a transmission of Ebola in the United States is now confirmed, in /r/news replies with speculation like this are still the most upvoted.  [The differences in healthcare, cultural practices,etc.] is why you see the pattern in Africa that you don't, and very likely wont here the US.  This attitude troubles me greatly because the young and scientifically literate Reddit population seemingly agrees with it or else it would not be at the top. Is this not again the same hubris that was displayed with the general public sentiment prior to 9/30 that Ebola would **NEVER**to the US? After that was it this same hubris again when many changed their attitude to attitude to OK it got here but there is absolutely **NO RISK** of it spreading to anyone from Mr. Duncan.  For the second time, this kind of thinking can now be seen for the potentially harmful combination of over-confidence and unrealistic and completely irrelevant optimism it is. The whole thought process that we're Americans, our healthcare system is vastly superior to any West African country, it can't spread is not only wrong but is causing inaction and apathy. We can't keep up this overconfidence when up the risk of Ebola is real and saying that it probably will not spread is of absolutely no relevance. The fact remains it **can** spread and America response so far has only demonstrated a significant level of ineptitude and vulnerability when dealing with Ebola.  This arrogance directly resulted in the whole Dallas fiasco and the spectacular mishandling of patient zero on basically every single level possible. The first real evaluation of our healthcare system with regards to Ebola failed literally on every single level. From the initial misdiagnosis, to the negligent handling of potential biohazard, to the miscoordination of government agencies in the quarantine of possible contacts and now finally to improper protection of the hospital staff. I cannot name a single thing that went right.  As a scientist with a morbid fascination in Ebola, I have been following it since June and have taken the time to look at basically every related peer reviewed article and study. I'm sure many of you are the exact same. I have been saying exactly this over and over again since the response to patient 0 was so obviously negligent. My lab is in Atlanta and the head researcher was hired in August by the CDC for work on Ebola. I know first hand that there is a striking and disconcerting difference between the public image they project and the actual feelings of the employees there. I don't understand the attitude the scientific community is using in the media right now downplaying this issue. It's like a parent not telling their child something because they are afraid it is too serious for the child to completely understand that it could bother them. We need to err on the side of caution rather than worry about how this will look to the public.  I think the best thing that the average person who agrees with this and is as puzzled as I am can be do at this point is to try to change the opinion of anyone and everyone you can. This must be done in a way which is as amicable and non-insulting as possible, as a discussion rather than a lecture, which is kind of hard to do that while getting your point across at the same time. A better way of putting it is that you don't want to change peoples minds at all, you want to provide the means for them to convince themselves their  attitude is incorrect.  **Note:** The above wording implies high profile officials directly stated ebola would definitely not come to the US and that it absolutely would not spread are not entirely correct according to the wording of the press statements.  Obama stated in mid september: 'The chances of an Ebola outbreak here in the United States are extremely low.'   Thomas Frieden, director of the CDC in his press conference on 9/30. The bottom line here is that I have no doubt that we will control this importation or case of Ebola so it does not spread widely in this the country.  It is certainly possible that someone who had contact with this individual, a family member or other individual could develop Ebola in the coming weeks.  But there is no doubt in my mind that we will stop it here.'   It was not my intention to make things up for the purposes of my argument and I was more referring to the implications of these statements and how I personally interpreted them along with how I felt the general population did. I didn't look at the exact wording of these statements prior to posting this and was going off memory and should have been more diligent with my claims.  However, the statements are intentionally ambiguous so they don't come back to bite Obama and Frieden in the ass despite a large number of possible scenarios.

Treat everything with skepticism but you should be able to eliminate any biases by looking in a lot of places. Use this to come to your own concussions and encourage others to do this as well.      Think about it this way. If you don't already have Ebola and it's just malaria or the flu or something,  you sure as hell will get Ebola in quarantine with 50 people with Ebola. I'm not saying it's a reasonable outlook, it's very selfish and a major reason for many new cases, but it is understandable on a human level   I agree I think more detailed categories like this are a good idea as well. You should be able to filter by speculative or non-speculative, and using your example officials or medical sources would be listed as non-speculative unless highly opinionated.   I agree it seems draconian to not offer this in a time when we can literally see the insides of your body as a 3D model or sequence and analyze the fundamental coding of life itself.    The current filters for this subreddit seemed fundamentally flawed at this time. There should be 2 main categories, with current tags becoming subcategories. The VAST majority of posts here are not tagged at all and there should be a requirement for a tag of speculative or non-speculative on all posts at the bare minimum. If this was made a requirement subreddit wide, I sincerely believe it would improve the relevance of this subreddit for both those who are just looking for just analysis and facts and those interested in everything Ebola including speculation. There have been a lot of complaints recently of the quality of this subreddit and this would help to address those. I cannot see any potential downsides, if you do please name it.   I agree but right now it is simply not feasible to get a 7 minute chemical shower facility into the hot zone of a hospital if it is not installed prior to the arrival of an Ebola patient. I believe using something kind of like a pesticide sprayer filled which bleach would be sufficient, this is the impression I got of what was used in The Hot Zone so I'm not sure why something like this isn't already required but this Ebola situation makes has only served to make me realize how fucking little anything I think matters at all.  I'm not sure what is involved in the normal hospital isolation units protocols, but I would imagine up until this point this level of precaution was simply superfluous.   This is why it is so important to have designated hospitals for Ebola for each major metropolitan area or each state.   Haha unless you plan on going to grad school at Georgia Tech, I'm not sure you'd be able to work in one of their labs unfortunately!   I see, interesting that also makes sense. I guess that's why all the modeling for Ebola seems to focus on R0 at the moment, there are too many variables to really predict anything of value outside of that. Unfortunate kind of but what can you do. This seems like it would make any of these models the CDC are giving like 500k-1.4 million infections by the end of the year prone to being fairly inaccurate. Probably why there's such a large range in the first place.  [Here's the statisical model the CDC is using](http://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/24900) for their predictions, which they made public yesterday(actually maybe not yesterday oops). I just thought you might find this of interest.  Not really related but some of the research I do is actually kind of similar, I focus on the software engineering of gene prediction using bioinformatic statistical models.  Edit: Looks like it's actually from 9/22, it may have been made public yesterday or that may have just been when I became aware of it.   Thank you that is very informative. You do you have any information regarding effective R or actual R in West Africa? Are these the same measure? I couldn't tell by your wording.   Thank you I cross posted there.   It seems to be that it would make sense that R0(the average number of individuals each infected person transmit the disease) correlates directly with the total number of individuals infected in a population. With a significant increase in the number of infected persons, contact tracing and quarantine measures will become more difficult to implement. As far as I can tell, current studies do not take this into account at all but I am not an epidemiologist but I may be just may be missing it in the studies.  The calculated R0 in September according to PLOS and based on WHO statistics from Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leon and Nigeria was a 95% confidence interval of 1.5-1.9 with 1.78 being the best fit model. The most recent study I can find was published September 22 by the WHO Ebola Response Team with an estimated an R0 of 2.02 (1.79-2.26) for Sierra Leone from empirical data. They also provide estimates for Guinea, 1.71 (1.44-2.01), and Liberia, 1.83 (1.72-1.94). This study even makes the claim.  After the early phases of exponential growth in case numbers, once infection has become established, the number of people at risk declines, so R0 fall from it's maximum value to a smaller net preoduction number  I believe the R0 has been staying relatively consistent over the course of this epidemic so this seems a dubious. In Liberia right now, people are dying on the streets and being told to stay in their homes rather than seek help because the system simply cannot handle the massive number of current cases. I am wrong in thinking this could have an effect on transmissibility? In the later stages of the disease some get belligerent and disoriented and may be prone to walking out in public when viral shedding is near it maximum level. With no way to restrain them or prevent this from happening be much greater than having these people in an Ebola specific isolation unit? If anyone with a more in-depth understanding of the modelling can answer these questions that'd be appreciated because I cannot find much discussion about this possibility in scientific journals. I only saw it mentioned as a limitation in the Sep 26 CDC report.  The 1976 outbreak had a 1.34 R0. Could this be a reason, along with disease transmission change in the timeframe, for the increased R0 we see now?   Sources:  Meltzer et al.

(http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436514000528)   My concern is R0 may directly correlate with the number of transmissions. As more people are infected, contact tracing or even quarantine isolation is increasingly difficult. I'm wondering if that is responsible for the increase we have seen in the predicted R0 of 1.5 to1.9 in mid-september to what it is now 1.8-2.18. I don't believe this is accounted for in any models but I definitely am not an epidemiologist so I could be wrong.  Note: Those values are pretty close to the actual values of studies but I'm going from memory so they might not be exact. Please correct me if I am wrong.   This looking at SARS is pretty reassuring, I was only 13 then so I never really took an in-depth look at it and barely remember the situation. Do you have information on the exact protocols that took place to contain the outbreak in China? I seem to remember reading that the chinese government took basically quarantined the entire affected region with their military.   What concerns me is that China has a very high number of politicians with scientific degrees. They would know what's at stake in this situation here better than our politicians. On top of that they can take these levels of preventative measured without having to worry about resulting backlash from opposing political parties or the media.  This is not the case in the US.   Another thing is what if someone homeless ends up with ebola here in America I believe that population is a very potent vector for the spread of the virus because a lot of contact tracing capabilities is lost with them. Something similar could be said of restaurant employees who attempt to work through something they believe is just a cold.   	108

 This, with the video in the background of every webpage.  http://postarchives.entensity.net/040805/flash.php?flash=banana.swf   Almost crashed my car several times with others in it, not through my own fault luckily, but close calls nonetheless.  Once accidentally smashed a lightbulb over my friends head.  And almost killed myself three times, once touching a live wire attached to a TV set, once by pulling a full paint can down onto my head from on top of a tall book case, and lastly by falling out of the top of a tree. Believe it or not, it was hitting the branches on the way down that saved me, and stopped me from actually getting any more serious injury than a few bruises!   - Slenderman is a great fun game to muck about with with a friend or friends. - You could try some of the resident evil games (even if only one can control, it's fun to work as a team and try to work through the puzzles, just take turns with the controller)   With money, obviously.

Eragon; I'd SO want to be a dragon rider, especially with a partner dragon as awesome and badass as Saphira   I try to get it published!  I've got two short stories already out and published in anthologies, got another one coming out in an anthology sometime this year (date not confirmed yet).  I'm always writing new stories and submitting them to anthologies. I've written two novels, but nothing I'd show to the world yet. Both of those were to prove to myself that I COULD write to that length, and still maintain relationships/arcs/general story interest.   What do you use them all for?

From as early as I can remember in my first house (until I was 12 years old), I NEVER slept facing my bedroom doorway (It had no door), because I KNEW if I looked that way, I would see what was standing there and it would be able to come into the room and get me.  It's like you KNOW that if you throw a ball, gravity will bring it down.  I KNEW, without needing proof or confirmation, that there WAS something, and I don't know what, standing in my doorway every night. Occasionally I'd hear it walk along the landing from the lower end of our house until it stood outside my bedroom door, and I KNEW if I looked at it, it could come in and it WOULD kill me.

The deadline for applications was the 10th.  I got into university, left home to move to the other side of the country, met an old friend there with whom I am now in a deeply committed, loving relationship, and am currently living in Australia, half a world and four years away from when I made said decision.

Hang off it? Could you elaborate and/or give us a picture example? Because I'm confused.   Floating.  Everyone else seems to be able to do it, and I can only do it when I hold my breath (so that the oxygen in my torso keeps me afloat). If I let my breath out my legs drag me down into the water.

Honourable mention goes out to my best friend; when I broke up with my almost seven years girlfriend, I had spent the entire day walking around the nearby lakes, crying and listening to music.  He came out after he finished work (earlier than he had to, I might add), picked me up, took me back to his, supplied me with alcohol, fish and chips, played some online games with me, watched a film with me, chatted to me, and finally gave me a big hug and told me I did the right thing.  If he was on Reddit, he'd deserve to win this thread.   Can you elaborate? I didn't become a writer until after school ended, though one English teacher did say she loved a short fiction I wrote for a coursework piece one time...it was pretty straightforward so there was no interpretation involved...   24,000 words per hour!   There were many...to name but a few...  - Frisbee-throwing a slice of cheese across the playground at one another, it hit a girl we knew in the face. Result = my friend got slapped  - Car Surfing (I'll let you imagine that one)  - Farting VERY loudly in the middle of a drama class (it was at EXACTLY the right point in someone else's piece) (childish I know, but we were kids)  - Skipping school several times for various reasons (to play trading card games, to play the playstation, to just hang out at a park we knew)  And so many, many injuries that I can barely remember them all.  	42

Have to make the standard "coffee with Cream" joke.   In ELI5 fashion, lightning can definitely blow up more than just your PC.  If lightning hits the power lines coming into your house for instance, it can provide a sudden surge of power over and above what your appliances can handle, thus cooking them good and proper.  Most of the time if you're lucky it will just fry your power supply.  I'll need someone a bit more scientific to clarify, but it wouldn't be so much the voltage that will blow it all up, it would be the amperage.   In Aus, all appliances (generally) are rated for 240v @ 10amp.. Lightning definitely beats both those specs.  A surge protector does what its name says, it would be fused up in there to limit the total voltage and amperage although be a lot more sensitive than a normal house fuse.. Once it goes over its rated amount it will trip.  I'm sure someone will disprove me completely, or hopefully just clarify and clean up my post a little.   I met a 25 year old girl recently that's still a virgin..   I'm a 30 year old with a little boy I'm trying to raise, I ended it.  I knew that she has a whole life ahead of her and doesn't need the life I would provide, and as hard as she was pushing for me to be her first, it's not something I was willing to do.  Apart from the above, being with a virgin is a guaranteed dud root.   So I'm guessing the eyes are fully formed under there?  Hopefully its just a matter of sedating the baby and getting a scalpel ready   I think now that's it's officially here, use your US login account you created and it all should be there.

I don't know, if you compare the first 10 seasons of each show, overall the Simpsons wins it for me and was quite clever.  Problem is that fox has milked the Simpsons 15 years too long.

One thing MWC managed to pull off was the introduction of Jefferson, it was one of the few times on a TV show that the replacement character was better than the original.  	102
 Dude. /r/Tulpas.   Whoa. I read this out of context.   Blood libel (to what OP is referring to here) is a tactic of antisemitic theory. Hundreds of years ago Christians began spreading rumors that rabbis were using the blood of Christian babies in religious rituals. Of course, this was used to denounce Jewish people/culture and to further alienate Jews from Christians. This theory, if it can even be called that, is still alive   well in modern times.. The media is just out there to soil the minds of people willing to absorb these ridiculous things.   Eating out without a single cell phone in the perimeter.   "I didn't know Asia was a country!"

 Incredible form!    Go at your own pace, do not force yourself to do anything that doesn't feel right. Listen to your body.

Find that sweet spot between too much and not enough, a happy medium.  Namaste, friend.   	2
 If your into chicks, you will be crushing on Tomei for sure.   Call it "Lazarus". Focus on one families journey though the war. Older brother fights and serves in the uprising. Younger brother works the wormhole and becomes a pilot in the lazarus missions. A divide is struck in the family over whats a more pressing issue resembling the divide in the world.      The Prestige. The ultimate revenge film   You have probaly heard of the actress but not the movie      My cousin vinny. Marisa Tomei   Remove the comforter. They have been test done to prove while the linen gets washed, rarely do the comforters. They can have as much as 30 different semens on them   Im glad you liked it. I was also thinking this for the oxygen situation but wasnt sure if i should add it. This is based on some documentary i watched that said there are things such as bacteria and viruses far out in space that we might not be aware of. Stating it is plausible an asteroid could carry such in its nooks and crannys.       Before the war, a decent size asteroid containing the blight hits earth. Not one nearly as massive as the one that killed the dinos but big enough to discombobulate the atmosphere. It lands somewhere on land, causing massive dust storms and causing detstruction to the atmosphere and oxygen. Then my theory would come a few years down the line after the blight is discovered. They also mention asteroids in the "Science of Interstellar" a documentary made during the filming, about being a possible reason for humans having to leave earth before the sun cuts out.     Good point, im gonna edit this in   The prestige, and the theory behind the machine. Most are so convinced it works they fail to give the theory a fair shot. The movie is complicated enough but when you add the theory people tend to shut down. They view the theory with prejudged bias on what they have already made their mind up on. Alot of the issues that are brought up against the theory itself are not even related to the machine but with the movie regardless. For ex, people dont catch Caine is showing the Judge the box in the beginning. When he calls tesla a wizard this is during the Trial, and he is under the assumption Angier is dead and the trick is real. This is true regardless of the machine working.     After watching this movie close to 30 times, and knowing the movie better than anyone ever should im convinced this is the best kept secret in film.   The shining is filmed in a way you feel you are literally standing behind the characters. Every shot. Almost like you are another ghost of the hotel followingt he torrance family.    Not exactly what you asked but similar   Spoiler Alert. I think there is a fair amount of evidence to suggest there was a war before the events of the movie take place. It would seem the war was fought over resources that are becoming scarce due to the blight. Although the reason for the war and the starting point are not clear. Ill give my theory as to what i believed happen in this scenario although this is in no way Concrete, and I will end with the evidence in the movie which is.      At some point the blight takes form and starts to slowly do its inevitable damage. Starts to take out crops, lessen the air supply, and the ensuing data is not pretty. The worlds' powers try to respectfully communicate and try to work together for a solution. Intially, trying to save the world and its enviroment, and employing all resources to this solution.     At some point this happy family breaks down. Resistance inside the powers' meetings is small almost futile at first, eventually leading to all out war. Pandamonium is set loose and the common human is now worried about food and life. The war breaks out between the whole world, with the major powers splitting into teams. The fight is over resources and what policy(s) should be followed to protect such. Drones in the Usa are sent to protect and monitor the major crops. Around this time is when the wormhole is spotted, as said in the movie the wormhole was known about for 50 years at the time the movie takes place. Took about 40 years upon discovery to send the Lazarus missions.      As surviving the war became priority number 1, research to earths solution takes a back seat. Resources are not only affected by the blight but the lack of focus on them. Everything within reason is turned into to producing results for the war. Some point during the war the wormhole is discovered, but soon after Usa asks Nasa to drop a massive bomb from space(supported in the movie). Nasa refuses and gets shut down. Except for a small facility working on the wormhole.      Eventually the war and the vastly disappearing resources have wiped out enough people the only option left is for the majority to start producing food, ie farmers. There are not enough people to fight, and the blights' problem over time has become clearer. Food and crops need to be the main focus its our key to immediate survival. Focusing on the Usa, the vast population become farmers. Schools main focus are to lure the brightest minds in this field to have a higher production rate, and find a successful combatant food source to the blight. All the while Nasa knowing the Earth will have to be abandoned. While the vast majority of the public is not fed this idea.      10 years before the movie, the Lazarus mission takes place after 40 or so years of understaffed secretive research has been performed. At this point Dr Brand is fine tuning his Plan A. Eventually realizing this couldnt work but not wanting to deter people keeps Plan A as a possibility but focuses on Plan B. Once receiving data back a few years after the Lazarus missions have been sent, the training for Interstellar begins. Then before the team sets off for their new mission an unexpected visitor shows up with a small child.      A few things that support the idea of a war, but not nessecarily like i proposed it. I was just offering a theory to how. These hints do lye within the movie itself.      1)The drone in the early stages of the movie is treated like common place. They are excited to see it but not perplexed or scared by its presence. One could assume a vast amount of drones were deployed to protect the crops. And with a war that ended due to insanely high casualties and lack of resources the drones were not all properly taken down or accounted for.      2)The school trys to recruit Matthews' son as a farmer. Also the changing of the schools history book about the moon landing. This would suggest some major fall out with Russia and/or More likely part of a smear campain against Nasa, who refused to drop bombs.     3)Matthew takes his kids to a baseball game, offers the comment when i was younger we were too worried about fighting to play baseball.      4)Dr Brand while first visting with Matthew, confesses Nasa's refusal to drop a massive bomb which led to its being shutdown.      5)Matthew makes a comment aboard the space ship, its a crazy thought to think this ship could have been bullets.      6)Matthew refers to TARS in their first meeting as an ex marine robot. Also saying there is no need for robots like him anymore       7)Matthews' character is revered for his flying ability, much like that of a decorated war veteran. He even confirms he has never been out of the stratosphere but is highly regarded as a phonomenal pilot. He also handles himself well under Damons' attack. Also very much like a trained fighter he keeps his composure in intense moments and is willing to leave his family to do greater good.       Will add as i go and am open to suggestions. Lmk what you guys think      EDIT. Wow most sucessful post ive ever had, thanks for all the comments. Edited in 6 and 7 from suggestions made below   Then you should be able to see how being naked adds to the vuneralbilty of the character and intensity of the scene     But i now assume your comment was more comically driven   If you cant get over naked bodies thats quite childish, imo   If you can get over the nakedness, that scene is crazy. If you could put youself in viggos place at that moment its frightening. Every thing that could lend itself against you, does. Mutiple opponents, naked, no solid footing, no clear vision, no clear path to fight in, and all you have is a knife, man thats intense.   Lol. Scene is still badass, and it adds to the intensity, every element that would serve against you in a knife fight has been served to Viggo   I have seen the tool cover video before but I hadn't seen it in a long time. Impressive for seasoned musicians, impressive on another level considering their age    Https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJFfnTkyj-g     Should be able to find the other video, there are sitting right next to each other on a darkened stage, sipping wine. If you can't find that video Lmk. I'm on my xbox can't copy and paste so I have to do it manually but will if you can't find the rodrigo y Gabriella video   Eastern promises. A knife fight between trained killers on a wet surface and nothing on. One of the coolest most intense fights ever imo   Also check out Rodrigo y Gabriella doing a cover of stairway to heaven. Great epic piece of music, vastly different than the original. Just two acoustics. The chick who plays flamingo style also keeps percussion on the side of her guitar. It's quite amazing, and better than the original IMO.      Also if you play music at all or sing there are great backing tracks for your specific instrument where you can jam along and become inspired from.   Idk how to link but check out youtube video named " worlds first wireless midi for acoustic guitar -acpad"    Dude plays an acoustic adding percussion and effects to his song simultaneously from a pad placed over the guitar!!! It's amazing and very inspirational. Only complaint is it is too short, but it leaves a lot of room for imagination.      Lmk if you watch either and what you think   I believe he has always been a student of mma or at least before he got to the UFC. He has a great personality and is a damn good announcer, that's reason enough right there.     Just for a little info on rogan, he is also an amazing stand up comedian.   What's manga?    Well said. I can appreciate your points on the movie   Yea I'm starting to think it's the plot more than anything. I love sci if, especially time travel, love action, and comedy is good but not my fav.    Yea, I can see your points here   It may be, but I think it's worth a try to find out.    Lol. I'm just trying to clarify to those who think I'm trying to change opinion or am making a big deal, I'm not I'm just trying to figure out what the draw of the movie is, that's all.     I don't see clarification as being defensive. Some people get the wrong idea on the purpose of a post, I was just trying to set my intentions straight.    Not you the other guy. The type of poster who trolls post for technicalities and rarely adds anything to the topic at hand    Not all movies just the boring ones. The only reason I went back to it that many times was because a lot of people really like it.    I didn't realize I was making a big deal of it   Sure. Can you not like a movie and want to find out why others do?    I'm not looking for a change just wondering why other people like it.   Wasn't back to back, I either fell asleep or lost interest.   Mohamed has the same significance in Islamic faith as Jesus does in the bible. That's all I'm saying    I don't get it. I've watched it about 5 times but only could finish it once. I like tom cruise but I just can't seem to get into this movie. What am I missing?    Reservoir dogs. The opening scene where they discuss Madonna and the art of tipping. Classic    Spoiler. Braveheart. When William Wallace realizes he's been betrayed by the kings son(I think his dad is the king) and his eyes fill with pain and tears and he cannot get up. He has to be pulled on to a horse and brought away from the ascending danger. To me that scene is very powerful and an extremely well acted scene by Mel Gibson.    You are an idiot.      They do believe in Jesus and Moses but they are not of the same importance as they are in the bible. Mohamed is basically there Jesus.      The Islamic faith has had over 100,000 prophets maybe more, Jesus and Moses were just one of the many. Allah sent prophets to each people throughout history. Allah sent Mohamed as a proheptic messenger for all mankind not just a specific people.     Your original premise might be right, I'm really not sure about that. I just wanted to clarify a bit.   I would bring up the 1000s of gods that have been forgotten over time. The 1000s of gods available to worship today. At some point everyone is atheist about 99.9% of the gods available. Why would your assesment be right? Atheist take just the extra step with the .1%.      I also believe the geographical issue, where you are born will have an overwhelming effect on what religion you are brought into. This I feel is also a very strong point   I'm surprised the patriots are not in this category.    Of course he considers root, but when you add the machine and the mysterious tanks he cannot figure out what's going on. All Angier needs to do is confuse Borden enough to get him backstage, and Borden has no Scarlett to lead him to root this time.      You have to see the similarity in Angier refusing to accept Scarlett telling him Borden is using a double. She produces some of his disguises and tells him she has seen the double. Angier refuses to believe this. Yes it's Borden doesn't use a double but a twin but it's the same principle, Angier refused to admit there were two he was convinced Borden was pulling off the trick somehow solo.    You are an idiot   Im sorry but you are mistaken. Borden and Angier are seen with Tesla together. They both go to Teslas showing of the Ac current months before Angier visits. We know Tesla exist and Borden confirms at the end that he sends Angier on a wild goose chase. Only the scenes narrarated by Angier to Borden are fabricated, there are both attempts to blind Borden. Borden gives Angier the diary and for all purposes sends him to tesla. He tells Angier tesla is the key to my diary but not the key to my trick, which leads Angier to tesla.      Remember Angier gives Borden the diary. Borden gives Angier his diary. Both are tools of deceit. Even if the machine works, Borden doesnt know the tesla can build a machine like that. By sending him to tesla in his mind, he is sending him to a useless bloke. By bordens' own admission he sends Angier there on a wild goose chase. Bordens' diary is also useless, Tesla is the key but it doesnt contain anything useful. Angier gives Borden the diary to have him go to the grave thinking he sent him to the one man that lead to his demise. This also sets up Lord Caldlow a chance to show Borden he has his daughter and tear up his prestige . The diary also proves the man at the jail truly wants Borden secrets to allow the set up of Lord Caldlow appearace, this is narrated in an early scene. It was written for Borden and fabricated.     Two things, you believe Angier gives Borden a diary that could prove his innocence days before his execution? Then show up at the jail? Are we as the audience to believe Borden sends Angier to the one man that can produce a similar result to a twin?      When Caine calls Tesla a wizard, remember he leaves Angier before the Tesla trip, he is showing the Judge how the trick works. This is during the trial of Borden. Caine is still under the impression the "magic" was real and Angier is dead. Its only after these events he finds Lord Caldlow and the Judge leads him there. Only then does Caine figure out Angiers' game, so he is being truthful at this point.I disagree with your nolan narration assesment but Caine for sure would fit there.    There are not alot of scenes im implying are fabricated. The timeline in the movie is quite hard to follow and i believe the heart of some of your misstatements. Caine also narrates over the hat shots twice "Are you watching closely. But you wont see. You want to be fooled. You want it to be real."        That was a bonus for me   I feel I clearly touched on opinion in the thread itself. I can understand if this was a new thread, but my opinion is made quite clear in the discussion.   You are an idiot. Lol    1)No, he is there to identify the body. Why do you assume Caine thinks foul play. He is never let backstage during the new transported man. There is a scene when he gets scolded for trying to pry backstage. He is also fed the tesla story that Borden is, he believes Angier has found real magic. He believes Angier is being transported. He knows Angier didn't come out at the other end, caught Borden red handed and has a body, why would he be suspicious.    This point is there regardless of the machine working or not. Angier and Borden are caines friends, he mentors both. Caine taking in effect of Borden's daughter would never have participated in the trial, had he known what was going on.     2)This is true whether the machine works or not. Once Caine visits lord callow and finds Borden's daughter, he alerts Fallon because of angiers betrayal.      3)again Angier had the money to pay root whatever to keep him happy knowing there was a limited show and he would be dealt with very soon. Again angiers motive is not to have a great magic show here, he only wants revenge on Borden. So hiring root if the magic was the motivation wouldn't make a lot of sense but he is only trying to frame Borden now.     Also I believe Scarlett Johnson is the one who leads Borden to root, Borden didn't find riot unassisted.      4)well leaving roots body is what is risky. Caine had just been to his house and figured out his game. Requiring body's in the time frame the movie takes place is quite easy, medical reasons etc. considering caldlows immense wealth this is very plausible.      Angier knows he has to rid of the tanks and warehouse. He buys root to tie up loose ends. How do you move a body across town? Well in the tanks you have purchased from angiers estate. So that's why he's in a tank.   The smell of a freshly cut lawn    1)Caine quickly looked at a decomposing body. He had no reason to expect foul play at that point. Not to mention he is quite old and looked down for a couple seconds at that. He believed Angier to be dead, no reason to go out of his way to really suspect the body wasn't there. He saw him drown and knew he didn't come out for the prestige that night. He is also Borden's friend and never would have participated in the trial had he known Borden was not guilty. Also the reason Caine leads Borden to Angier to get his revenge.      2)it might have been another double but yes I believe it was root. Roots problem was money, that's what caused his downfall. Angier did not want to pay him a large salary forever as he was a small part of the act. But knowing he was going to kill him in a limited show it can be assumed this was fixed. Not to mention the months he spent with "tesla" and the time it took to build up the theater, quite reasonable to assume the issues were fixed.    Furthermore he only needed him to come out at the top of the balcony, for the whole show he just needed that. He wasn't depended on that much. He had a small role and would be dealt with in a small amount if time. It's also quite genius as everyone knew he used a double years before, but wouldn't suspect it at the trial given the way it ended.       3)I have already adressed why he had to store the tanks. And we only see one clear body on purpose. This was root, who was recently placed in the tank which explains the very clear air bubble in this tank.    Angier has acquired root and plans to burn the whole place down ridding of any evidence. Angier rigs the place to burn not Borden. He simply intervenes kills Angier then finishes the job.    The rock. When cage has to use the needle on himself, edge of the seat every time.   Seven. Especially when I realized the seven sins was completed, I was blown way. Something I did not catch the first time though    Lol maybe......   Lol. Common sense would be knowing asking a question is not the same thing as avoiding a question asked, was not referring to questionolgy. But you would have to have common sense in properly understanding a statement    That would seem like common sense   Asking questions and avoiding answering them are not the same   You like to avoid questions, don't you?   Why is the moon smiling?    Fuck society    300 rise of an empire      Edit. Really, why all the hate on 300? I thought this was a badass movie    Lol. You clearly don't know the difference between an argument and a debate.

Sure a slave could rise up but rise up with the help of a German dentist turned bounty hunter, only in a movie    Gravity, a good movie bad writing     Rounders a bad movie good writing    The prestige and the theory behind the machine    They have been pointed out already, again. Lol    Makes sense. Although it's crazy to think about now as it's clear Bree's has surpassed flutie at a staggering pace    Exactly, contradictions have been pointed out and lye in your statements , it's quite clear to a reasonable person but as you have conceded on one occasion already you most likely will not again but your statements are there contradicting themselves whether you have the courage to adress them or not   Glad to see you agree it's a boring thread   Have you been deleting the messages too.....?   I have named several    But you clearly as a mod have nothing to do in this boring thread lol. Point made    The more you type the more you contradict lol   My commenting has nothing to do with this subbreddit, as we are not talking about anything other than your cleAr unaddressed contradictions. Seriously how old are you?     Furthermore clear evidence you have nothing else to do in this boring ass subbreddit lol   That's what I figured, and that would imply they would have the upper hand. It most likely not have good implications for us    1)it would be a family member who is outside of the household and separate from the accusers    2)like I said a reasonable claim would have to be made. Any one to claim abuse like the spouse, child themselves, teacher, etc or anyone who comes into contact with the child will be taken seriously. But like a person claiming telepathic powers,etc might not. I'm sure once called an investigation takes place.   You have said college and again contradict the side bar lol    I read it before but it's not very clear to what falls under its suitable topics. But seeing the low amount of subscribers and the biggest dick of a mod I've ever come across it's pretty clear this sub is very unclear boring and a subreddit to be ignored    True. Good point, I'm assuming this topic is referring to a recent contact which would basically mean they come here, for now.    I can rip badass "mamajammers" on the guitar   A scenario much like columbus landing on North america would take place except we would be the indians   1)the kid either goes to live with a suitable family member or a temp foster family     2)Sure. But there has to be proof or some reasonable assumption. I cant call child abuse for having a dream it was gonna happen, or to someone living 2 states away i dont know or ever contacted, wtc     3)Yes you can be fined vast sums of money and get jailtime   All right avoid the issues    I figured that you arent making alot of sense or addressing my points specifically   The side bar also state philosophical debates are highly recommended btw   The website the only helpful thing you have said. Is it highschool or college?   Like i said i tried to rephrase it. No reason to be a dick, i made another attempt to be undert he rules not to undermine you       Ohhhhhhhh no a ban!!!!!!!!!!!   Yes the hat scenes are fabricated from angiers diary and the clones scene is narrated and fabricated just like the diary scenes. Its essentially what the whole movie is about. Lying to the audience.     There are not transporting anything, the gun doesnt shoot real bullets, the birds do not disappear and come back, etc. The whole movie is about lying to the audience to mask the real trick.      Take the opening with the hat scene, micheal caine narrarates "Are you watching closely? But you wont see. You want to be fooled. You want it to be real"   I tried to pose the debate a little differently.     How are you distinguishing from me trying to start a debate and you impling im starting an argument?   Read that thread i told you about. Ill elaborate more with you there. It will explain the tanks and how the trick was done.      Im debating morals starting point, not nessicarliy religion. But since that is the common assumption i start there.     Why is this topic not suitable?      I've just posted a detailed explanation in /r/fantheories. You can find it by clicking my name, clck submitted at the top center, and should be the first one there. Let me know what you think   Will start with this, the machine not working is not suppose to be obvious. It is like the magic tricks in the movie, the trick is not easy to spot, it's difficulty leads you to believe its real. The trick is there to fool the audiences into believing the trick is real. The machine not working is the ultimate trick. The film alludes to there being no real magic many times, it's dedication and sacrifice that makes a true magic trick. What shows more dedication and sacrifice then dedicating the movie to actually masking this trick properly and sacrificing the real story of the movie by masking it inside a trick.    The prestige is a great movie. Some of the previous submitted theories miss a few points and a couple just posed questions. I'm going to submit the details behind how the trick was done with a double. There are before and after aspects of the theory but I will leave that to the discussion below, because this thread will be too long. And those aspects can easily be explained below with back and forth dialogue.      Will start the theory with the diaries, specifically angiers diary. Angier gives Borden who is sent to death, and will die in a short amount of time a fabricated diary. As is stated in the last sentence of the diary, which Borden reads aloud as he gets to the end. The tesla visits are fabricated, the whole point of the diary is to prove to Borden Angiers help sent to the prison has indeed bought angiers estate and wants to buy his secret. This set ups angiers visit to Borden as lord callow to torture him one last time by tearing up his prestige and to show he has his daughter. This also gives clear motive for Angier in his dying speech to lie as a dying man as he has lied already been proven to lie to a dying man.      So Borden does have a twin, tesla is real, angiers visits are fabricated from the diary and his ending speech being as such. Upon Angier capturing Fallon and receiving the key to Borden's diary(tesla) is where I will start. Angier visits Tesla finding out there is no answer to Borden's secret( Angiers original motive), and tesla has no "magic". So he begins to come up with away to frame Borden, not just kill him, but ruin his reputation and acquire custody of his daughter. He uses the fact Borden has sent him to tesla, to begin his frame up. He uses a useless tesla machine to add flair to an old trick, and spark interest in Borden. Angier also needs "real magic" to obtain a theater, no simple trick will do, as Borden hs already ruined his reputation. He uses a double to pull off his trick, with the illusion of being transported. He doesn't drown his double every night just the night of the murder. To ensure Borden will be confused he uses the element of mysterious tanks being transported from the theater every night, otherwise Borden will easily see he is using a double but with the mysterious tanks he sparks enough interest from Borden to want to see backstage, as this is vital for the frame up to work.        Angier is the pledge and turn and root(or other double if you prefer) is the prestige, ie on the balcony. Angiers motive at this point is no longer magic or the applause it's simply to frame borden. Borden makes multiple appearances at the show wearing a disguise. Angier needs to spot and identify this disguise in order to carry on with the frame up, which is why he doesn't do the frame up the first night he enters the theater, and eventually Angier does discover Borden. Knowing his routine and the fact he will come again because he hasn't been picked to view the machine or backstage, he sets the frame up. Seeing Borden enter the theater he tells his assistant to pick Borden out of the crowd that night, also telling root he will be the pledge and turn for the transported man ( not the other tricks) on this night. As Borden is being picked from the crowd, Angier and root switch, the frame up plays out Angier flees the theater.      At the end Angier continues his lie because Borden has two elements to critize angreir on. Theses two elements are the most important to Borden and this is what makes him the better magician. Crowd applause and sacrifice. In angiers trick he has none of these elements. So as he is dying he must convince Borden he has these two elements. He lies about killing the clones(sacrifice) and he lies about taking the applause, trying to convince Borden before he dies he is the better magician. This is the jist will elaborate further on the end scene and the like upon the discussion beginning.   Again, leave stuff out but dont write a new story and ending. You can stay true to the key themes and not diveate as much as was done. If you cant figure how to condense the story properly dont call it monte cristo, hence why it was a bad movie that deserves a remake.    You say there are many stories to be told in the book. Exactly my point there is too much material in this book to add your own plot. How does having too much material justify adding your own material?     Take the sword fight i like btw. Edmund doesnt kill him like that he forces him to commit suicide. But being on a time budget this change makes sense. Its not the same but the Result is. I can like and understand changes need to be made liie this but not ones where the result is not the same or ones made to retell the plot     Alot of the changes i mentioned take time away to add fabricated parts instead of using this time to focus on a proper portrayal of the plot.      The movie is decent if it were not called monte cristo. But it is it and does a retelling hatchet job to the story. Its a classic for a reason. Hence this is a poor telling of the classic and needs a proper remake. I think david fincher would be great fort his      BTW, i think the main theme is Dantes learning at the end his revenge was wrong. He should not have acted as providence, the actual count of the mountain of christ(monte cristo). God will judge them and he shouldnt have. Given forgiveness and religious themes the biggest in the story imo, just another tragedy of this terrible intrepertation   I cant tell if thats genuine or sarcastic   The movie changes the pplot doesnt just leave stuff out. And the movie does not have favorable reveiws.   I disagree. All the changes being made they could have changed the characters names and it could have been called a different movie. The only change that was reasonable was the sword fight.    Way more changes btw, edmund never meets napoleon, he doesnt kill the warden, no beach fight, the whole second half of the movie was fabricated.     When i watch a movie about a classic i expect some things to be left out but not a new story   That is a double, root which he sets up. There are no clones. He uses and trains his double for the new transported man while he spends months with "tesla". To explain would take more detail but view the scenes get back to me      Also notice micheal caine narrating the start of the movie over the shot of the hats, he says something like "Are you watching closely? But you wont see. You want to be fooled. You want it to be real."   There is a bunch. Starts really at the beginning when Borden receives the diary. Like the first 10 mins. Also once you realize this, you uncover Angiers motives whitch will come into play later   The scenes you speak of are told through Angiers diary which was written to deceive Borden   So i cant give examples from the bible, without being accused of saying it represents the whole bible?     Im asking you specifically on today understanding Gods will.     I know little of the calvanist but thats hardly answering the question.   When i talk to christians about why god let the holocaust happen or natural diasters or letting the devil live, etc they say well thats gods will and we cannot understand his will. Also have been a christian for many years     This is common place, not only will you hear this from everyday christians, you hear it in the church, you see it in documentaries, film, etc.   I never said anywhere it was the whole word of god.      There is more, im trying to deal with one example at a time, as you clearly said gods word couldnt be understood easily. So i brought up the most obvious example of the word being clearly understood easily    Again please explain his will and your stance   Is the ten commandments not the word of god?     I refer to the bible in the description, thats pretty clear.  	105
 Even adults would be caught unawares.    How could you focus on work when you have that kind of interruption? I always love cats, but it would be unfair to get one when I know I won't have much time to spend playing with it.    I believe there are some window films with various designs that you can use to cover the lower part of your window, so you can keep your privacy which is available in Purlfrost. As for having more of natural light, you can use mirrors or reflective surfaces in your home decor and place them strategically to fill your home with brightness and natural light. If you put mirrors close to your windows, it will bounce light into your space amplifying natural light, and it will make your windows seem bigger and brighter.   And if an experiment works, something has definitely gone wrong.   If we put more consideration to individuals rather than the species, arent we disregarding the fact that all elements of an ecosystem are important to the functioning of that ecosystem. We think only from a human standpoint, but we cannot look at nature only from a human standpoint because ecosystems are so complex that we wont be able tot totally understand all the connections and actions and interactions happening within them.                Maybe to drive away ruffians and evil spirits.   You should be a member of Rick's restoration team with that kind of skill.       I understand, and thank you very much for reminding me of the rule. I will be very cautious on my posts when I do it next time.    I have a can of beer on my desk now as I am writing this comment. (But hey I am not a binge drinker! I sound so defensive here, don't I?) But yes, I think binge drinking is bad especially when people deny it to themselves that they do. Like in another case of being alcoholic without admitting to yourself that you are indeed an alcoholic.      	15
 I guess that is what I would like. Work for a small company with inspiring people. I ground this website http://workinstartups.com/ but I have no chance of getting any of the jobs on there (they are looking for different skills)    I work in procurement. There are loads of jobs for me but it's all the same. I am good in procurement and planning both of which I don't like anymore...   That might be true actually. There was a fence where I was standing to take the picture.       That is exactly what I want to do. The only problem I am facing is that I don't know what job to apply to. If I look on the job sites, there are loads of "really good jobs" that I probably have a realistic shot at. But I'm not interested to just switch the company and do the same/similar stuff somewhere else. I just struggle to find what I want to do. I was hoping to get some ideas here by learning what other people to for a living.    Thanks for your feedback. I guess this is exactly what I am looking to do. I want to completely change. But I don't want to be a paramedic. I need inspiration.    Procurement in oil and gas. I don't want to do this anymore though. I just find it hard to find ideas of potential jobs I might be able to do with my education.      I guess that would be a good idea. However the main problem is that I don't know what kind of job I want to do. At the moment I work in procurement of an oil and gas company and it's so boring.       I have lived in London 4 years. The first year was university and then I started working and at the beginning I liked my corporate job. Money was good and I got to travel loads.   By now I just hate it. Huge pressure on a daily basis and ever increasing levels of burocracy make me want to kill myself every day. Especially because at the end of the day I have nothing to look at and say: Well done, I made this or that or I helped him or her.   If you are or have been at a similar point, do you have any recommendations?  I would like to find a job that is not the usual London corporate crazy.   Prove it!    Are you going this Sunday by any chance?    really?      Sorry, but I am sure it would have been better if the entire ship was in focus rather than part of the ship and some of the rocks on the shore.   You know what: I live in London and I always say the same thing.   Last weekend I went to Bruges in Belgium and you know what? London is not that expensive (apart from rent?mortgage) You can do a lot for free and a lot of good food is available for good money. If you're modest you can have a good life and don't even need that much money for it.    she see0s s6 arr6gant   How many of them did you kill walking through them?   Where did he have them made? They are awesome   1984  I read it just before moving to a different country. I finished the book the first night in my new home. I felt so lonely that night   Will this replace windows or can I do dual boot?   AMIDUOS has root. See 2nd best comment here.      These things are still in use. Taxi Driver in Germany charged me like that. It worked. I was surprised.    Would a banana before the workout always be good?    I only had coffee yesterday and no water. I guess the reason was a mix of not drinking, too much coffee and not breathing.   I'll make sure I breathe    Thanks. I'll try that. Difficult though. I guess I'll have to practice.    Thanks. I am hoping to be able to sort it out by breathing properly and drinking enough. I like to work out in the morning before I eat sometimes.    Hi, I am currently using the strong lifts 5x5 app and I really like it. It keeps me motivated and I have been to the gym 3 times a week for the last two months which is really good for me.   I have been able to increase dead lifts from 70 kg to 100kg. Up until 95kg I found it hard, but not too hard. Last Friday I did 100kg for the first time. I did 5x 60kg and then 5x 80 kg as warm ups. Yesterday I was about to try 102.5 kg. However I had to stop. I did 5x 60kg and 5x 80kg warm up. When I wanted to do 5x 92.5kg warm up I did 2 reps and felt funny. I dropped the weight and almost fainted. In the end I was fine and nothing happened but I was very surprised.   I have lifted that weight before a few times, so what could be the reason. I know that I failed to drink water throughout the day yesterday. Could that be it? Or did I not eat enough? Or is it likely that something else was the reason?  EDIT: Thanks for the feedback. Breathing and water seem to be key.    And they both look really good.    I don't know you and I do not know your background or opinion, so please don't take it personal.  If that is your reasoning then that's fine, but then don't complain later that rents are too high. (I am not saying you do)  I am just saying people have no integrity. They all want things to change but nobody is willing to do anything for it. The only thing people with money understand is if you boycott their BS. And if you want things to change you have to start with the man in the mirror and not just expect others to do the shitty work for you.   Rents are too high in London? Don't move here or move away.  Rent for a certain flat is unacceptable? Don't move in.   But then somebody else will move in there and nothing will change anyway and on top of that you don't have a flat and that other person does? Maybe. But maybe at some point everybody refuses this BS and we actually make a difference. Be the change that you want to see. I know it sounds so silly but it is true.    If people stop renting shit like this, people will stop offering shit like this. We cannot expect change if we are not willing pay a certain price for it.    Is this available in colour?   EDIT: Sorry guys, there is an s missing...    Did it on my commute. I'm really happy I did it. Was pretty easy and seems to work perfectly fine.   Thanks for convincing me    Actually, just found it.   http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/stock-firmware-23-1-0-690-generic-t3056413  I'll probably do it tomorrow during my lunch break. I hope I won't fuck it up.  Good night   Is there one for the z3c yet? I am currently looking on xda, but can't find it yet.   Edit: Sorry, found it  http://forum.xda-developers.com/z3-compact/development/stock-firmware-23-1-0-690-generic-t3056413   Cool, you convinced me. Have you done it yet?   Just saw, that is the file for the Z3. Is there one for the z3c yet?   People never lock their cars    I managed to get into recovery, yes. But I haven't had a chance to flash the rom yet. Not sure if I'm gonna do it. Not really interested to be honest. I am really happy now that I'm rooted and everything works.   I'll let you know if I ever do it    Hey, thanks for taking the time. I really appreciate your post. I found this very helpful and insightful. I'll do some more research for myself and make up my mind what I think.   Thanks again.    So, why would the government do this?  Which party actually wants to do this? And which party wants to prevent it?   I'm not sure I understand what it tells me. I mean I understand what  the figure means, but I have no idea what percentage is good or bad.    Thanks. That is something somebody said about the privatised trains in the UK. Same thing, right? Shit service, high prices because there is basically no competition and they are all profit maximising.   Thanks, I understand that that is a massive problem. Did not think about that.    Could you explain further?   I live in the UK but I am not from here. I am personally very thankful for the NHS because they have supported my SO a lot and without them we would have struggled a lot.   I would like to know why people are concerned with privatisation and also would like to know why people support it.    I have rooted via giefroot and installed dual recovery. So I just put this on my SD card, enter TWRP and flash it, right?  But to be honest, I have no idea how to root in TWRP on my z3c. Do you know?  Edit: Ok, got it. Wait until the LED flashes during startup and then ress volume rocker. Sorry for the stupid question.    Thanks for replying. Can you tell me how to get into recovery? I can't figure it out    Do you hate her?   Hello,  I have successfully rooted my z3 compact yesterday and wanted to install Xposed framework but it comes up with an error message. Please see the screenshots here (2 pictures)  https://imgur.com/NLNC7YE,n4V4XpQ  Not sure what I can do to fix that. I tried to change the installation method, but that didn't work. (also because I can't enter recovery to flash manually)  Did anybody have a similar problem?    Dibs on the girl on the left.   Fair enough. Then I am afraid I have no solution.    Is it possible to use manufacturer specific widgets in Nova at all?  For example I can't use the Sony widgets. (they suck anyway, but just as an example)   Is there a video or gif set of all the sweet stuff that Nova can do?  I read through all that you guys post here but I can only imagine half of it.  I also use Nova and love it, but I hardly see any significant changes for me other than the app search pull down thing.    just swipe up from the app drawer button   Thank you!   I think this is the coolest thing I have seen on here.  Well done.    Sorry if this is a basic question. If I only want root to use exposed and e.g. greenify it is enough to just do the giefroot thing right?   I only need to back up my DRM keys if I want to unlock the bootloader, right?   What you say is right, but it sure looks like he works out.    How much storage do you guys need?    I don't know. I had the yoga tablet 1 8" and that is a very decent tablet. Yes, it's slow, yes the ui looks like shit but the kick stand and battery make up for everything. I use nova so it looks fine. The speed won't be an issue on the new version. I don't see how people are not interested in this. I absolutely love it.    I've been doing stronglifts 5x5. It's a 3 times per week workout and doesn't take very long. Good for beginners.    Whatsapp has a calling feature?    Thank you. I'll try and create my own masterpiece.   What app? With a pen?   Nothing as of yet.   Did you ever realise that Jack always agreed with your morals? But sometimes Jack was able to see that it was a lost cause and instead of demoralising you he took the blame for not doing the morally right thing so that you could stay who you are.    It's horrible but your post was good fun to read. If nobody made these mistakes we would not get to read about them.    I enjoyed seeing that but I can't explain why    It's true. I posted a stupid question got stupid answers. Next day I went to the gym, started the 5x5 strength thing and  2 weeks later I feel like I am on the right track. I got inspired by one of the top posts (the female ) and just did it. I'm still adjusting my diet but at least I've started and I did it by reading other posts    *couldn't  But other than that I agree    Personally I don't mind if things take longer but I don't like when people put off telling people that it's going to take longer until it's obvious it's gonna take longer because you've passed the deadline   I disagree, but whatever works for you man.    The tp is covered in piss though...         Nobody commented. It is pretty obvious nobody cares.    Nobody cares...    iPhones have shit battery life I guess.   Thanks, but I don't want it to be ELI5.   /r/askscience is probably a good idea though.       Why 5?    I said the same to the other guy:  Sorry man, I realise that the information I have provided is BS. I'll do a second post later with better information, pics and goal. Sorry to waste your time.   Sorry man, I realise that the information I have provided is BS. I'll do a second post later with better information, pics and goal.   Sorry to waste your time.

Do you have a link?     Hey, thanks for your answer.   For point 1, this is from the second link in the side bar:  +20% maintenance calories on workout days, -20% maintenance on non-workout days. Varying your caloric amounts is important  If it's wrong, why is it in the sidebar?  And for the second point I was considering to do this all in one day three times a week. I have been doing the same exercises for the past 3 months (however as bodyweight exercises). I do not think it would be a problem. Why do you think it would be pointless?  If I split that over 3 days, I will be in the gym for 30 minutes only.   EDIT: Sorry, I forgot: My goal is to do a recomp as described in the sidebar link. I do not really want to lose weight or bulk. Just want to look fitter and get stronger. I weigh 79kg and I have been doing bodyweightfitness for the last three months.    Edit: Sorry guys, this was a bullshit post. Just ignore please.       So? Am I not allowed to have an opinion that is based on my personal experience?   You guys are impossible to talk to. I have my own experience with something and I will not just be all "My judgement must be 100% wrong then just because I have not researched it". Stoners are slow in the head, that is my experience with every single one of them who smokes on a regular basis (several times a week)   Well I know lots of guys who drank shit loads of alcohol and they seem to be functioning fine today. The few heavy smokers I know are really slow when you talk to them. I think it really did negatively affect them    Very sexual   You're right. However OP asked and the4ndy answered his question. I think we can all be happy    Do you always politely add information by starting with "Woah woah woah watch the phrasing there."?   Thanks for pointing out the obvious mate.    I think you got this wrong, but I am not sure.   There is no grey area. As soon as you download it is illegal. However, when you stream the file is only temporarily on your computer and you have no access to it so that you could copy it. That is why streaming is still ok. Torrenting is not legal anywhere in Europe. This is why you should not use popcorn time in Europe if you are scare of getting caught. Neither the uploading nor the downloading is legal.    Crap. Thanks for replying though. I guess nothing I can do.   Hi,  My SO has an Acer S3 ([this one](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Acer-Aspire-S3-391-53314G52add-Ultrabook.81619.0.html)). We decided to install Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit.   Now the problem is that the laptop won't boot with an HDMI cable attached to it. If you remove the cable it boots fine. If you attach the cable after it booted, it works fine.   We use a HDMI to DVI cable, but it also does not work with an HDMI to HDMI cable or with a different screen.   If anybody has had this before, we would really appreciate if you could share your solution. It is nothing bad, just an inconvenience to always remove the cable before booting.   But I even if it can't be fixed I would like to understand it.  Many thanks in advance.   Thank you very much!   I like this. But why do you think the ring is not his totem?      Slow mo takes away a lot from their performance   I got myself a rice cooker with a steaming tray. Whilst the rice is boiling the salmon broccoli and other veg are steaming.

That is just to suggest it might fall.   What's your point?   I think this is right. I never thought about this.    Ok, I think you are right. I never considered this.    I did not know that   I accept that the joke is no good. And it's fair enough that you don't find it funny.  But please don't speak for others. You have no idea why they downvoted.    Reddit is just too politically correct. Unless you ask for politically incorrect jokes.   I have read that as well, but I don't think so. I would have also gone to see my children first.   Throughout the whole movie he wants nothing more than the truth. I don't think he would change just like that.   I understand your point and appreciate it. I would have just liked if the totem would have dropped from the table and rolled under something so that we and also Leo would never find out.   This way it seems so obvious Leo will find out and we won't   I know there are endless explanations about why people think Leo is still in a dream e.g. the thing with the wedding ring.   I have a very different problem with the film:  For me as a spectator the film ends after the final scene and I am left to wonder whether he is still trapped in a dream or not. That is fair enough and I guess what Nolan wanted.   However, when I watch a film, I try to imagine that the characters are real, right? And that is why the ending is bullshit. For me as a spectator the movie stops right there, but for Leo it doesn't. He will come back into the house eventually and see if his totem is still spinning or not. That means for him there are two scenarios:   1. By the time he comes back into the house the totem stopped spinning and he lives happily with his children 2. He comes back in and the thing is still spinning - He knows he was fooled and is still in a dream. He actually wants to get back into the real world so if this happens, the story is not over for him.  So if Nolan wanted an open ending he should have gotten rid of the totem before anybody (us or Leo) was able to find out if the totem will drop. This way he just fails to tell us the end of the story.    Fair enough, but not at the price of sacrificing Jgers I would have thought    Was it? I don't want to watch again.    Was it the woman chucking it? If so I think it's realistic   Edit: Come one guys. A little sexism doesn't hurt.   Similarly the monsters simply choose not to use their EMP all the time. What's the point saving ammunition if it will cost them their life?    Apparently the Jger has a very powerful sword on board which is not being used during the first fights. The monsters deal considerable damage to the humans which could have been avoided if the sword would have been used instead of a tanker    This is awesome.

 Asylum is a place of refuge. We have far too few inpatient psych beds for long term care. The taxpayers don't want to pay for it.

Down California you've got 101 and 1 on the coast, I-5  down the middle-if you like agriculture there's plenty here, and 395 east of the Sierra. I live in Olympia WA, my sister lives in Santa Cruz CA so I know them all well. Returned yesterday from a trip down the coast to San Luis Obispo, east to 395, then up the interior home again. 2800 miles, took a leisurely 7 days.  One of my favorite stretches is south of Eureka, cut over on 1 on the coast from 101 at Leggett. Very twisty, though forest then you can smell the sea and the ocean is before you.

Now it's mostly templated fluff.   Exactly. Always sifting through the cut and paste to get to the narrative.  APSO format for progress notes is intended to lead with the narrative, but it often merely copies the problem list forward. I might get "Pt X tolerated diet and is working with PT", then the problem list.  I don't think the problem is inherent in the software. It's what the provider chooses to do with it that irks me. I would make one exception to this statement. The defense department's [AHLTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_Health_Longitudinal_Technology_Application). It is in its own world of uselessness.    One cannot help wonder what race relations would be like in America today if both these men were still alive.   Parrots, fuck yeah!   We have an EMR that goes to 2001, and scanned notes (which have consultant notes, study and pathology reports, and so on) so the story's there. Best are previously dictated H P, DC summary.  A physician is a detective, at least for hospital medicine. I cannot imagine how this would be accomplished in 15 minute appointments.   Probably not: these were likely *all male* groups, and also it would violate the sanctity of the right of the pizza peddler not to believe in evolution.   Now it's a real rivalry-so much more interesting. May they both stay strong for a great season!   Don't be superstitious. I'm more worried about Marquez. The longer you ride wild, the more the chance for a serious getoff. Doesn't he already hold the record for the fastest noninjury crash?   . . .  stuck in traffic. . .Heh   I've seen H Ps for pt admiited for elective joint replacement, written by the PA to satisfy hospital documentation requirements. All cut and paste, don't even describe the procedure.  On the other hand one of my cardiologist friends writes exemplary notes like yours. In this case the procedures, most recent ECHO, stress test  c are easy to find. He even provides references regarding the indications for devices or medications. A gold mine-not only are essential patient data provided, there's a bonus tutorial! Now if he'd only answer a page at night (a *very* sound sleeper).   There's the beginnings of a novel there, like Bukowski did for the Post Office   Your notes have far more free text than I usually see.    I've been using computers since the 1970s, and I love EPIC. I find great notes and crummy notes. Cut and paste as a portion of the note is very valuable, but as the whole note it's not.   I've been using Dragon for years, but not every work station has the software loaded. Many of my free texts notes are short and to the point anyhow:  Notified of AFib recurrence, rate 120s, asymptomatic. Systolic 120s. Will check electrolytes, bolus 10 IV dilt and continue to monitor  Hardly worth logging on to dragon for that. As for admit, consult, procedure, discharge, death notes  c I dictate, which uses speech to text, edited by transcription services, then sent to me for final edit.   When a patient has been in the hospital for a week and there is a crisis at night when cross cover needs to figure out what is going on the narrative of their hospital course is not optional. If I can't figure it out from the notes I must reconstruct it, which hardly is an advance in patient care. I'll take a pithy, short surgeon's note over the long empty templated progress note anytime.   I never ignore a page,  although there are times when there are many pages awaiting replies. I can only answer one at a time. Dictating an admit note takes 5 to 10 minutes; the expect page return time is 15 minutes.   Texting is most useful with coworkers, such as "please staff this case with the housestaff', "pager switched to oncoming provider, no patients waiting",  c.   I am an employee of a multihospital nonprofit, and my collegues tell me I'm efficient. I'm quite satisfied with my job, and use texting all the time. To me it is not a net improvement, although it certainly has benefits.   My secret is exposed.    As a nocturnist I do principally admissions, consults and cross cover. I believe my admit note should provide the care team with a comprehensive and concise review of the past medical history. The history usually listed in EPIC and other similar EMRs is usually worthless. "Chronic airway obstruction, not elsewhere classified [496]" cannot replace "Severe steroid and oxygen dependent COPD with continued smoking". Nor can "Coronary atherosclerosis of unspecified type of vessel, native or graft [414.00]" replace "Coronary artery disease with 2-vessel bypass in 1999. Subsequent drug-eluting stents on dual antiplatelet therapy"   A very succinct comparison.   Not one of the 54 inpatient physicians in my department are satisfied by the current text vendor, Tiger Text. It is cumbersome and unreliable. The chief of heme/onc refuses to use one, and relies on a traditional pager. But he's a head of department and may do so. The rest of us put up with it.  I do not type well, and I text even more slowly. It is not  convenient in the least for me, and we have been using texting for seven years.   Most texts are the number to call, but some may describe a patient problem and suggest a remedy. These require a dialog, and it's faster for me to discuss the scenario than text. When busy I am getting multiple texts/dialogs, and so often when dictating, it seems, which is distracting. I will mute the ~~hated~~ helpful and necessary device when dictating.   I find your sources to be very weak support for your statements. My undergraduate work was in the neurosciences; the literature on behavioral health is, by necessity, inferential and firm conclusions are rare. I remain unpersuaded by the efficacy of accupuncture. I have worked in practices which included accupuncture practitioners, and have had an opportunity to listen to the rationale and review the literature.  Most of the early data on neurointerventional salvage therapy was proprietor sponsored and not reproducible. More recent data are more persuasive, but many await more studies.  I find "Simply sticking your fingers in your ears and ignoring new alternatives because they seem different to your tried and true methods" personally insulting and this adds nothing to your arguments. Let us be objective, please.   I am not adept with keying in text, and would rather have a spoken dialog, and these notes are mostly barren of the narrative of a patient's care.   The easy stuff is over.  May it be a labor of love for you as it is for most physicians.   I use electrolyte replacement by protocol routinely for ICU pts, excepting DKA, ESRD. These two I prefer a dialog with the ICU team. Often ICU nurses will write "verbal orders" anyway, which I find a day or two later in my in box. Mixed feelings about that.  When it's busy it can be vexing for the nurses and physicians to take the time for these mandatory phone calls regarding "critical" results that aren't.    After years of trying to groove on Mr. Coltrane's later work I gave up. For me this is the pinnacle.  Nice, long shots of Mr Tyner's hands.

There is no good treatment for the latter, as all agents exhibit tachyphylaxis.  I know of no data to support the assertion that metoclopramide has any effect on LES tone, and I have never seen it used for GERD.   Tardive dyskinesia can be quite unpleasant. One patient said it even disturbed his sleep, and that sometimes he would bite his lip or tongue.   Not the curvature of the planet, but the curvature of the field.

    Every river in America was a bounty of aquatic life until agriculture slited up the rivers. At Mount Vernon they wrote one could almost walk across the Potomac to Maryland on the backs of fish. Colonial agriculture was so bad Washington and Jefferson tried to innovate ways to free the nation from cash crops, but the economics didn't pan out and people continued cutting down forest and plowing the topsoil into erosive gushes. Before the civil war, even, there where 40 foot deep gullies in the middle of farmland in the Carolinas and northern Georgia. You could drive a carriage through them.   Do you need to meet in person?

The rest of the time the new organic matter and surface reservoirs would let more water into the tributary. - just like untouched healthy terrain does naturally.   I shouldn't!   What if someone bought all the land of a watershed above a tributary stream in an American desert or other currently non-arable land?  Mildly re-shape the land to hold the water and plant the native species back (not a statement against non-native species). Check dams, swales, stream calming, berms, planting mounds... maybe even groundwater-recharge wells like in India.  First of all, I can think of few better ways to improve the value of land making this a very exciting investment.  Second, the people downstream will be affected positively and negatively (although the argument might be made that not taking the optimal flow for a watershed into account is not something you could sue for).  Third, would the government have something to say about that?      It hopefully would shine. We're in a lot of trouble right now and the only thing I see holding us back from making things better is politicians - and we should never let idiots like them stop us from living well while they make money off our pain. There are a lot of investment and lifestyle change opportunities but not enough people have the funds they need to take advantage and the people who do have a little money are usually scared to take a risk.

Make sure you get the real stuff, in the paint aisle of a hardware store. This will make sure the soap releases from the cloth once it has attached to the grease and smoke particles.

[Read an article](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/06/thank-you-chinese/395660/?single_page=true) on /r/travel, today.   And then another will announce Gei wo yan!, literally Give me salt!, with no sign of a please or thank you involved... A Chinese linguist, Kaidi Zhan, says that using a please, as in Please pass the salt, actually has the opposite effect of politeness here in China. The Chinese way of being polite to each other with words is to shorten the social distance between you. And saying please serves to insert a kind of buffer or space that says, in effect, that we need some formality between us here.  Reading and seeing scenes like this has always reinforced the idea of closeness. A family huddled around a small fire sharing a sparse meal; a pack of soldiers or workers performing a task with few commands; some friends gesturing to pass the drink along.  Does Social Distance have another name?  What is the most poignant example you can recall?    During development a person develops a female or male brain in gestation but then develops the opposite body.  That is a theory, not necessarily the case.    You can have surgery/hormone treatments to make yourself one sex or the other  A person born one gender can only stay that gender or be neutered. Assuming the appearance of another sex is not the same thing as having the body and soul of another sex. There is heated debate over whether the "reassignment" surgery is even beneficial for *anybody*.   And the Church has historically not advised leaving anything to a government, right?

Make congress enact a detailed plan instead of just ordering a department to do so with little forcing them to. Once the border is secure, find a way for those who are not citizens yet to become legal - but not citizens directly. Eviction is not an option and citizenship is not fair. Bringing them into the legal workforce satisfies all parties... because in that process we can root out the criminals.  The process will not be immediate, and will hopefully coincide with economic growth that will make sure they do not get blamed for taking the jobs from American citizens.  I don't know why some Catholics want open borders; it certainly isn't for the economic reasons that Rand Paul understands the benefits. There can be no open borders right now between us and the dire situations in South America.   And it isn't like we are going to rid the House and Senate of the established old boys club.

The cost to have it saved on the spot is more than if protection was paid for but many services did and still do offer it.  It actually makes a lot of sense, IMO. People also start to build much safer homes and make more responsible decisions when fire protection isn't paid for by the local government.   Having both an area of protection and a subscription payment method doesn't make sense - just like Comcast of Verizon having regional monopolies doesn't today.   Simply this is happening: The NPS owns farmland in or around a historically significant area which it desires to lease as any other farmland would be - except with added covenants to protect the integrity of the site.  People lease farmland all the time - even the government does this in some places. The people who take th elease obviously intend to make money.  The NPS has a resource - arable land. It is going to let a farmer borrow the land for a fee. The farmer will pay the fee in hopes of making profit off the land.   Depends what the park is for. Is it for conserving nature or history?  If history, then farming it helps people connect with and understand the past. Even more important it is a great opportunity for kids and adults to get excited about history and farming at the same time.   To be honest, SW combat makes zero sense given the technology and force sensitivity in canon vs the gameplay and portrayals.  There would be absolute frustration with the rules when you can't do something logical, manage the sheer numbers of troops, or deal with Jedi secret missions.

It would be cool, however, to see the force sensitivity of your generals and agents in the character screen.   National Parks is asking for RFPs on two farms in historical Ohio with 60-year terms.

I thought you meant you were the owner of the actual publication company, who I've met a while ago and operates out of NY.   I would recommend [iSatanist](http://www.isatanist.com), they have a few different designs and high quality work.   We should get together with some mutual friends the next time I'm up in the haunted Hudson area.    I enjoyed it, completed a few runs on the PS4.   I'm just observing that the days of alt.satanism-like bickering around the likes of Aquino (of which there were a few) are far gone. I don't miss it, and I'm proud to see our members are spending their energy on far more productive things. If anyone asks, we inform. We're just not getting a lot of people asking, or once informed, met with a shrug.   I'm going by day to day experience in working with our membership, most of which are not openly active on social media. And no, most of this new generation doesn't know or care much about this stuff. It's not like this is a secret to anyone, we cover it on our website and Blanche Barton is currently working on a revised edition of "The Church of Satan" which will obviously include this. When I last spoke to her she mentioned it was funny how most people she spoke to are uninterested in that whole drama, but much more interested in LaVey's personal history and the early days of the Magic Circle, and what other members are doing now. Hence her focus on completing the revised edition of "Secret Life of a Satanist", plans for the relaunch of the Cloven Hoof, and promotion of real-world events and activities (such as the William Mortensen book signing in LA this weekend, which featured an open discussion with Barton and Moynihan on LaVey and his techniques on applying the Command to Look, with COS members in attendance).    Suicide. Financial ruin. Terminal illness. Sometimes a good old fist to the nose and steel-toe kick to the ribs works too.   Or members who are much more interested in what's going on right now and actually getting things accomplished in the real world than worrying about what's essentially personal drama between LaVey and Aquino that had little to no consequence on the current state of affairs.      And no, we do not sell membership to the Priesthood of Mendes. And we've removed individuals who have tried to financially exploit other members.   Aquino left for various reasons, and yes one of them was because he felt LaVey betrayed the literal Devil by selling memberships. LaVey laughed this off as he never claimed to believe in a literal devil and often spoke highly of materialism, capitalism, and using magic (lesser and greater) to achieve wealth. Aquino was apparently able to live with this as long as he was given power within the CoS to ordain initiatory degrees based on occultnik mumbo jumbo. LaVey rejected this, as he didn't care for wasting time on stuff that had no physical, material payoff (wealth, power, pleasure). Coincidentally Aquino received a message from Satan, appearing as Set and yadda yadda yadda...     Right after this LaVey got fed up with any theists or occultniks in his organization, who he politely tolerated prior to this. Central sent off letters disbanding the grotto system and telling anyone who believed in the need for initiatory occultism to hit the road. So many did, and he was happy to see them GTFO. So what I'm getting at is that the big "schism" as others call it was much more about power politics and LaVeys disdain for armchair occultniks than commercialism.   What happened? The Church of Satan grew stronger and more influential. Most of our current membership and priesthood barely know about Aquino. He's old news.      What do you mean by commercialized? I sometimes hear people make this claim and realize they don't even know the definition of the word. Commercialized means designed principally for financial gain. So then, no, the Church of Satan is not a commercialized organization. Does it shy away from making money? No, but rather than be hypocrites about it we accept the rational need for compensation for time and resources.     Ask any MBA, the Church of Satan has a lousy "business model" if it's intended to be a profit orientated venture. We do not have reoccurring fees, we spend thousands of man hours handling communications, press, legal cases, and appearances. We advertise and support books that we do not profit off, in fact they profit some of our naysayers. We advertise the projects of our members, of which the organization gets zero income.    The Church of Satan does not make any money on the sale of Anton LaVey's writings, including the Satanic Bible. All royalties go to his remaining family, none of which are involved in the CoS.   No worries, I totally get it.      Ah, got it. My bad.      Downvote those comments then. Unfortunately trolling is part and parcel to the reddit system. Complaining about only feeds it, "drinking tears" as they say.   The embodiment of carnality, materialism, and all the natural forces that that keep the universe in existence. He represents the adversary, the balancing force that swings the pendulum in the opposite direction.      Nice to see [Nergal of Behemoth supporting this project](http://instagram.com/p/y0jLWloaqS/).   "Satanism is not a white light religion; it is a religion of the flesh, the mundane, the carnal - all of which are ruled by Satan, the personification of the Left Hand Path."   The whole idea of Black vs. White Magic comes from the basic occult notion that any magic that is selfish or prideful is "black magic". LaVey throws out that whole concept altogether within Satanism, as he points out that all magic is selfish.     "White magic is supposedly utilized only for good or unselfish purposes, and black magic, we are told, is used only for selfish or "evil" reasons. Satanism draws no such dividing line. Magic is magic, be it used to help or hinder. The Satanist, being the magician, should have the ability to decide what is just, and then apply the powers of magic to attain his goals."   This video might be the thing that gets me to start watching pro racing.   Not necessarily, and not all of our members would like to participate, which is fine. Advancing secularism fits within our [Pentagonal Revisionism program](http://churchofsatan.com/pentagonal-revisionism.php).   Meh. The whole point of the Reddit system is to let the users decide what's relevant. So if the large majority of the users here don't find "theism" relevant and downvote, well that's the nature of the system. Post interesting things and the "invisible hand" of Reddit will sort it out. Yes, I like Adam Smith.         So upon hearing this prayer I cringed and thought "this does not sound like LaVey or Gilmore, except for some borrowed phrases. Isn't that a Christian saying?" So I checked... yeah, this doesn't have anything to do with the Church of Satan, in fact it was written by Greaves of The Satanic Temple. Yawn.   What the hell is a father dedli? Nevermind...   There are several Satanists who are involved in politics, and their wide range of party affiliation underscores the reason why there couldn't be "Satanic" political party. We have people involved in Libertarian, Republican, Democract, Socialist, and other political parties, and almost never reveal their Satanic beliefs. I know a few Satanists who are in or running for elected offices throughout the world. Obviously they would all disagree with each other, and many other Satanists would agree or disagree with each.    Who is "they"? Someone who considers themselves a "Spiritual Satanist" probably does, and thinks they're talking to some deity or spirit. I don't support this. I'm a Church of Satan representative, and therefore I identify with and support LaVey's writings, which are atheistic. We *may* pray to Satan in a ritual, but this a symbolic, metaphoric act, where we build up and project our egos and refer to this externalized ego as Satan. In reality we are praying to ourselves.      LaVey was a materialist (or more like naturalist if you want to get into metaphysical ontology). He did not believe in conscious, communicable gods, demons, spirits, beings or in any existence beyond this one carnal life. While he was open to possibilities of "supernatural" events he maintained that these phenomenon are part of the material, natural world that not yet explained by science. He vehemently and repeatedly rejected spirituality and mysticism. All that said, he recognized man's need for mythology, archetypes, ritual, and pageantry, so he formalized an organized religion that best represents man's true nature, and called it Satanism. While some "spiritual" Satanists may say they are influenced by LaVey, they really don't have much common ground beyond aesthetics and symbols. The commonality breaks down as soon as you consider metaphysics and logical arguments.     Obviously the term "satanism" existed prior to LaVey, which he recognized and appreciated, but considered it dysfunctional and inaccurate due to the fact that it was almost always used from a Judeo-Christian perspective, heretical/Gnostic at best, but always chained to Christian cosmology.    Hard to say. If it's Satanis then I don't think it's worth a whole lot. The CoS didn't really attach stickers to materials, so I'm leaning on it being a duplicate, which there were many. If you happen to have some rare recordings of a Black Mass with LaVey then you may have something of a collector's item, but would need some kind of verification.   What you may have is a copy of Satanis, which is a Satanic Mass, not a Black Mass. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXIkJ0NraoY).    There never really was a "Church" of Satan. In the 60's and early 70's LaVey hosted some parties and rituals at his home, often referred to as The Black House, but he never considered it an actual "church". Some attendees called it a church, for lack of a better word, but LaVey didn't really endorse that. After the early 70's LaVey pretty much closed the doors to his home except for close friends and select members of the CoS. He also stopped doing public rituals.    You say "black mass" like it's a regular thing the CoS does, but it's not. LaVey only performed a few of Black Masses, and some were not even really anti-Christian. The purpose of the Black Mass is to mock a particular target. Christianity wasn't particularly interesting to LaVey, he preferred to attack psychiatry, drug culture, extreme liberalism, hippies, etc.    An Old Man once asked, "Where are all the Low Priests?"

I recommend reading [The Devil   Philosophy](http://news.churchofsatan.com/post/93912057937/magus-gilmore-in-the-devil-and-philosophy), High Priest Peter H. Gilmore has several chapters in it where he debates a few philosophers and academics on the Epicurean elements in Satanism, and the academic definition of Satanism as a whole.    Epicurus, Voltaire, Jung, Ben Hecht, Herbert Spencer, Michael Foucault, H. L. Mencken, Thomas Malthus, Macchiavelli, Freud, Gerald B. Lorentz, Benjamin DeCasseres     http://www.churchofsatan.com/sources-book-list.php       Practically any book at Underworld Amusements has a Satanic influence http://shop.underworldamusements.net/     Plenty of book listed in the Compleat Witch Illustrated Bibliography http://compleatwitch.blogspot.com/        The interview was being filmed for a show on BNN-VARA, will probably air in the summer. I'll post a link to it when it's up on their website.   I recently was interviewed by Dutch media about the American interest in exorcism. They were fascinated by how religious Americans were, and somewhat frightened by it.       MRW getting tax advice on this sub http://i.imgur.com/dffICKV.jpg   Great to see so much work on GIFv, and I don't mean that with any Reddit irony! I'm always traveling so I can't imagine using Reddit without this app. Thanks for your hard work!   I will say that suppressing your feelings is un-satanic, and if you naturally feel compelled to interfere in the lives of strangers then I would suggest that individual accept their savior complex and use it to their advantage.   Though I hesitate on saying "whatever you want", I would agree with with /u/devilmachineyea in that each Satanist would need to decided how they feel. Some might feel bad, if they had similar situations in their lives, or some might not care. If you're looking for a blanket uniform answer you're not going to get one.    I will say that in my experience Satanists can be empathetic, and tend to be sensitive to the human animal experience. This is different from wanting to actually interfere or otherwise try to inject ourselves into other people's business.      It's like this movie was produced for maximum gif potential.   Not so much as a joke but an acknowledgment of the feelings it brought up. And anyone who's heard Enochian spoken by a skilled ritualist can attest to the atmosphere it can create. Similar to the power the Latin language has in Catholic mass, but in our case we recognize this as being applied psychology and even hypnotism.   This movie poster from /u/M0o0se is the best thing to come out of all this http://imgur.com/CltUBWC      Sure, why not.    Depends on where you look, and who wants to be seen. And how you want to be seen, and how do you, or someone else, gain from it. I know more than a few Satanists that make Boyd Rice look like a boy scout.   Here's an episode of The Satanic Tradition on the 9sense podcast that goes into some of the history of the rituals of the COS and the Enochian Keys    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5hcGOpLME4 feature=youtu.be t=1h12m6s   The reason LaVey included the Enochian Keys was because, at the time, they were considered sinister and he was warned against it by the occult "community". This implied that they Keys still generated emotional response and caused fear among certain people, so he included them. Nowadays this isn't the case as much, so you may not want to use them. I forget where but LaVey once said if you're having trouble with Enochian just skip it and recite your favorite poem. I've seen Satanic rituals where they use Gaelic, old Indo-European languages, and even Arabic instead of Enochian to fit the needs of that particular working.      If you're talking about symbolism and ritual, then it symbolizes phallic force. I wouldn't carry one around in public.   You say non-earthy. Why? Were single celled organisms non-earthy before their discovery by Leeuwenhoek. Some people thought so, but it turned out to be part of the natural world we had yet to understand.   First of all, if you're talking about Satanism, it's magic, not magick. Magic with a k was popularized by Crowley (who's not a Satanist) as a way of distinguishing between stage magic and illusions (what LaVey calls Lesser Magic) from ritualized ceremonial magic(k). LaVey's observation is that they are all one and the same, and ceremonial magic often uses techniques of Lesser Magic to achieve results. He was also NOT a mystical person, so the idea that magic(k) was something more "holy" or "sacred" was an anathema to him. All magic, lesser or greater, was working within the material world and carnal. Which leads me to the next point.     LaVey certainly believed in having influences over events outside his direct control. He tells stories, and many people who have visited him have odd coincidences before and after. Even the stone cold unbelieving Rolling Stone writer felt like LaVey was able to shift the atmosphere around him. The thing is, LaVey never likened any of this to "spirituality" or "mysticism". All that implies some greater power or greater plane of existence. LaVey rejects this. He believes there are parts of this world, this natural, materialistic world, that we yet do not understand. Since it is not understood, it's "dark", and therefore, being a poetic, dramatic type, he symbolizes these unknowns as dark forces of nature.    Hate to be pedantic but with Satanism you don't spell "magic" with a k under any circumstances. The whole idea of "magic with a k" came from Crowley (not a Satanist) who wanted to distinguish between illusionist/sleight of hand (lesser) magic from ceremonial/greater magic. So even in the appropriate case "lesser magick" doesn't make sense.    Anyway... Great tips, regardless!   http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/brent-rambo      Boyd Rice the mystic Christian who's now friendly with Bob Larson instead of angrily debating him? Ok sure.    Most of the Satanists I know and associate with are not humanists at all. Just depends on where you look.       Create something new. Write a poem or story, record a song, paint a picture, take a photograph.   Nathan Gray is an outstanding musician and gentleman. Got some remixes in the works for him coming soon!   I write for a "Heathen" magazine and communicate/collaborate with several Asatruars (including members of the AFA/Rune Gild) who are also Satanists and members of the Church of Satan.   Solipsism can creep up on you. People are disappointing.   Important essay for people who seem to think LaVey would have supported any level of organized activism. I hear this time and time again, that "things changed" or the CoS "went inactive", as if there was once a time when the COS was marching down the street and patting people on the back. It was never "active" in the sense that these detractors seem to want to believe it was or should have been. That was never the idea, never the application, and we continue in that tradition. I'd answer any questions or rebuttals anyone has on this topic.      Interesting from a religious history and Middle East cultural perspective, that's all.   Edit: The symbolism around the Peacock Angel can be interesting and useful.      Demolition Man   You must drive your tax guy crazy.      [Satanism: The Feared Religion by Peter H.

Magus Gilmore is an incredibly busy man but it I would certainly get in touch with the COS administration and let them know about your achievements and goals. You can use the contact form here: http://www.churchofsatan.com/contact-us.php   I personally find it pretty lame, typical stoner mentality. I don't think it should be "banned".   Here are all the fundamental texts on Satanism: [Church of Satan: Printed Works](http://churchofsatan.com/sources-print.php). These are the core books. This is required reading you're serious about understanding LaVey's philosophy, as well as High Priest Peter H. Gilmore's direction. Anything else is supplementary.    Here's a recommended reading list directly from Anton LaVey. ["This is the list as originally published in Magistra Blanche Bartons The Church of Satan as approved by Magus Anton Szandor LaVey."](http://churchofsatan.com/sources-book-list.php). Here are some of my choice picks:   Carl Jung: Man and His Symbols    Herbert Spencer: The Study of Sociology   Michael Foucault: Madness and Civilization   H. L. Mencken: The American Language   Fyodor Dostoevsky: Notes from Underground   Robert W. Chambers: The King in Yellow   Jack London: The Sea Wolf   John Milton: Paradise Lost    One of the most overlooked books by LaVey is "The Compleat Witch" (aka "The Satanic Witch"). I see a lot of people make assumptions about LaVey's theories on Lesser   Greater Magic without having had read this book, which is *all about that*. LaVey included an extensive bibliography that gives you an crystal clear look at his base materialism and secularism. Here's is an illustrated and annotated collection of the bibliography, maintained by members of the Church of Satan's Priesthood of Mendes: [Compleat Witch Illustrated Bibliography Project](http://compleatwitch.blogspot.com/).    This should give enough reading for quite a long time.      I get your enthusiasm but Satanism is an individualist philosophy, so such a social club might not be the best idea. Though all Satanists share a bedrock philosophy, their applications and independent interests may vary greatly, sometimes leading to conflicts. It's a mistake to think that just because someone else is a Satanist means that you'd get along swimmingly.   Satanism is also anti-proselytizing, meaning you should not try to convince other people that Satanism is right for them. Most people will not (and cannot) accept Satanism, and that's alright. Do not expect people to respect you just because you're a Satanist, instead have them respect you because you're a great writer, mathematician, computer programmer, athlete, musician, artist, photographer, cartoonist, etc.    That said, I wish you luck. Peter H. Gilmore is a close friend of mine and I know he got started with Satanism in high school, where he met High Priestess Peggy Nadramia. He graduated as Valedictorian of his class and his speech had a Satanic spirit.     Satan is the drive for sovereignty, carnal sensuality, wisdom, and to be a master of the material world.      Cult of Youth, King Dude, Bain Wolfkind, Rome, Blood Axis, Sigur Ros, Mum, Phantogram, Lorde, Purity Ring, Little Dragon, Chelsea Wolfe, Cold Cave, Grimes.    Yes.   One of my favorite live experiences was in 2004, watching him perform for 3 hours in a packed warehouse in Brooklyn. It was soon after "Find Candace" came out, part of a larger SICKNESS event, separate ambient room, art gallery, DJ space. Good times.   Like /u/lightning_falls states, prayer is a plea for Divine Intervention with some conscious, communicable being. Satanism rejects all notions of the Divine and of any communicable beings, so that's one major difference.    The other is something that's a common misconception with LaVey's system of Greater Magic. He clearly states that Greater Magic should be a tool to help tip the scales to your favor, not to perform miracles. Whether this phenomenon is a placebo based on psychodramatic shifts or some biochemical expansion of the mind is a area of skeptical inquiry amongst Satanists who are interested in this. LaVey himself didn't care what it was, his approach was pragmatic and all that mattered is what worked.      I'm not, it services little to negative purpose. But if one is aware of what Satanism is (as in what it really is), then it wouldn't take long to figure it out.    Without a doubt, the philosophy within Satanism leans Right. But there are plenty of liberal Satanists who can reconcile that with their own progressive views. But those views are their own, and their own responsibility to balance and defend if they see fit.    I long ago stopped arguing the theological/cosmological issues involved in "theistic Satanism". But I will interject when someone makes a logically and factually incorrect assertion about whether LaVey or the Church of Satan some how supports their theistic views. If you want to refer to other writers, other philosophies or theologies, other occultists and their practices, fine. I won't agree with you, but I won't argue you. But if anyone tries to frame it as something sourced from LaVey, then be prepared to debate it factually.     As for the up/down voting system, that's reddit for you. If the majority of people in this sub are not friendly to theists, then that's the nature of democracy.   There are numerous religions that do not believe in outside forces, that do not address an afterlife. Where do you come to this conclusion? LaVey created Satanism as a new kind of religion that wholeheartedly accepts man as a purely carnal animal but with a need for metaphor, symbols, and rituals. The philosophy within Satanism is important, and crucial, but so are the traditions, the metaphors, the rituals, the culture. It's all part of the Satanic religion that is still in the early years. LaVey picked up the scent, and knew this was coming, that religion would be redefined in the future as secular phenomenon. He points to television, the internet, the entertainment industry as the new religions for the masses. He built Satanism as the alternative religion not just to the spiritual   mystical religions of the past, but of the consumerist religions of the future. "Remember, the first 99 years are always the toughest."      Confucianism does not address an afterlife and is very secular in many ways, but both considers itself and is recognized as a religion.   I disagree with that assessment of LaVey's "religious" stance. In fact it was in his later writings and interviews that LaVey pushed harder on Satanism being a religion over philosophy exactly because of the push back he got from occultists and pagans who questioned his lack of theism. You can see him refer to Satanism as a religion in Satan Speaks and The Devil's Notebook, both written in the 90's. One of his last articles is titled **["THE WORLDS MOST POWERFUL RELIGION"](http://churchofsatan.com/worlds-most-powerful-religion.php)**, in which he specifically makes the case for Satanism as a codified, organized, and post-modern 21st century religion by critiquing and dissecting what makes something a religion or religious.   Very approachable and pleasant to talk to, yet confident and in control of his surroundings. He's very professional about his performances and his clothing business.   /r/goingtohellforthis/   Yes, great person as well. Had the pleasure to spend some time with TJ and consider him a kindred individual.   [Chelsea Wolfe - Feral Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49MYJkEazIg)   [King Dude - Lucifer's The Light Of The World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjvYTPQ25-4)   [Cult of Youth - The Pole Star](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2jkl7DUPSU)   [Pharmakon - Bestial Burden](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DFgZqSDRHFI)   [Scott Walker + Sunn O))) - Soused](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwSveFnWzhI)        Each person can apply Satanism how they want, but LaVey did actively push Satanism as a **religion** over just a philosophy. There is philosophy within Satanism, but there's also Satanic culture, dogma, ritual, iconography, etymology, art, tradition, and literature that's all just as important as the philosophy itself.   Personally, I call them a heretical Christian, Muslim, Jew, or whatever theological cosmology they adhere to. In regards to someone who believes in the Christian Devil/Satan, then in turn they must give Christ significance in order to remain theologically consistent. If not, then they are inconsistent in their theology and therefore just a kook. Once you claim to subscribe to some metaphysical theology then you're bound to its history, unless you want to debate thousands of years of theology "just because it sounds cool".    http://media.giphy.com/media/NnGGHE0muVqpO/giphy.gif  	126

All full buttholes, spreadeagles and other kinky explicit things, but you have to search a while for a classy butt.  The shit is surprisingly easy to find, though.   I dislike very much when people call those people "nice guys" - suddenly "nice" is not a good pleasant quality to find in a human, but a part of a mocking stereotype. I think I am a nice guy, I try to be, but I am not a stereotypical "nice guy".   I absolutely hate that stereotype, it stigmatizes us and many kind and friendly people who happen to have some of the characteristics of the stereotype.   What extension?

I have never played Morrowind, I have to fix that...   Imo videogames can be very enriching experiences. You can learn from them and try things you couldn't in real life, they provide catharsis from stress and much more.   Sometimes I think that I waste my life with videogames, but other times I see that it is not necessarily bad. "Get a life" is a poor argument, because "getting a life" is not very well defined activity - I have a feeling that is mostly mean "be a complete square", because it is often used at gamers, anime fans and other such subcultures.  Of course it is not the real thing you, but you can draw insights and ideas from them, and it can change your view on certain subjects or even life itself. Experiences are not just physical activities, mental experience counts too - reading a book is similar, though not interactive, and most people consider this and that book to be an experience. Thus, I conclude that it can't be said that videogames are not experiences.   Kerbal Space Program:  - total lack of documentation of controls  - as of yet no 64-bit  - waste of educational potential; it is educational in itself, but if there was a in-game wiki friendly explaining the science and mathematics behind the orbital mechanics, it would have been enourmously advantageous - games are the most natural form of learning  - lack of some underlining story - afaik the easter eggs were planned to have been connected and to point to a faraway planet whence Kerbals come from  - I was actually kind of disappointed when I heard that the Kerbol system is actually unrealistically small.

 Damnit...came in here to be pedantic and was thwarted.     Nope...still no clue but you are right.  I'm not into pop culture at all.  Despite that I am still aware of some of it because it is hard to miss sometimes (ala Katy Perry in the Superbowl or Justin Beiber being made fun of on late night TV or PSY's Gangnam Style or Nicki Minaj's epic booty to name a few).  So I guess it is surprising that as popular as you say this guy is (I believe you...saw the link) he manages to fly under the radar of some people (because some of it, see aforementioned examples, is hard to miss).    I think the courts did care to some extent but gerrymandering became an outgrowth of the civil rights movement.  In order to enfranchise minorities weird districts had to be drawn and was deemed "ok" in the name of civil rights.  All well and good but now we see the unintended but entirely predictable outcome of that.    Yeah, I clicked the link like the OP wanted...still no clue who this "internationally famous" guy is.  Seems like a cool guy though.   Certainly bad games have always existed as have short games.  But it remains that the trend is to put less and less in the main game and to sell bits and pieces for extra.  Developers are putting the squeeze on gamers and they will continue as long as they can.    Game average lengths have been shorter and some say that is a good thing and something gamers actually prefer but where does it end?  How little can the developer sell you at a premium price that you'll still buy?  Evolve has $60 of cosmetic DLC on day one.  That is on top of its $60 asking price.  The Order gives you seven hours or so of gameplay seemingly half of which is unskippable cutscenes and not gameplay and there is no multiplayer or replayability.  They are asking $60 for that.  That is just two examples, there are plenty more.  Surely there is a line drawn somewhere where you would say a company has gone too far and provided too little to be worth it.  Where is that line for you for a $60 game?  How short can something be before you deem it too short for the money?    The problem is the developers have been lowering the bar for a long time.  It's akin to having once gotten a fantastic steak perfectly cooked for $60 but now today you get a Big Mac for $60.  Do some people like Big Macs?  Sure but some are pointing out the diminishing quality you are getting for the same price.   This has been tried before.  It *always* fails.  There have been many attempts at this over the years.  Most bogus from the get-go but some few were honest attempts.  Honest attempts from both sides.  The problem is the issues/region is so volatile it takes almost nothing to upset the process...from either side.  It can be a pissed off Israeli, or pissed off Palestinian or any of dozens of countries that have an interest in not seeing peace happen or even a corporation* to toss in an agent provocateur.  Just one fucker with a pistol can fuck it all up.    It is trivially easy for anyone with a bug up their ass or financial/political interests not served by peace, individual or nation or corporation, to throw a spanner in the works.  Also don't forget that even IF you managed to solve the Israeli/Palestinian issue you still have a Shia/Sunni Muslim issue (brewing civil war).  That region of the world if fucked IMO.  I doubt they can get out of this cycle short of a genocidal war leaving one party standing.  *EDIT:  If you think corporations don't operate on this level consider British Petroleum getting the US to overthrow the elected government in Iran and have a dictator re-installed.   "Single true fact"?  Is there a kind of fact that is not true?   It may be worth noting here that Reporters Without Borders recently [ranked the US 46th in press freedoms](http://rsf.org/index2014/en-index2014.php) behind (among others) Botswana, Suriname and Romania.  A drop of 14 points from its previous listing.      Not sure how Holder will be repairing anything.  He is lighting a fire then stepping out leaving the problem for the next AG to solve.  Real decent of him.    Seven years on and only NOW do they think to prosecute people for the financial crisis?  I wonder what the statute of limitations is on these things.      Is there a reason you can't start your own subreddit and apply these ideals?      Remember, [the claim is it is actually a 2.5 hour game](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/2vybg8/order_1886_playtime_details_from_youtubers_play/) with a lot of unskippable cutscenes (presumably unskippable because if you could it'd be all too painfully obvious there is not a lot of game there).  Now, maybe that 2.5 hours of gameplay is pure awesome.  If that is worth a premium AAA cost of $60 to some here that is their call.  It does not seem to be all that fantastic gameplay wise though as you noted.    Personally I find this obnoxious and if enough people buy this at that price it just encourages more of the same from developers.  2.5 hours of game and if you want another 2.5 hours they'll sell it to you in a $30 DLC.  I think the real problem is we are 15 months in since the PS4 release and there is still precious little that is really worth playing.  PS4 owners are so hungry for the next thing, the "next gen" killer game, that they'll buy this cuz it looks great and there's not much else.    To every observer all will seem normal to them.  They will perceive the other person's clocks and rulers to be off in a different reference frame.   The speed of light will *always* be measured at the same speed regardless of reference frame.  In each reference frame all will seem normal, a second is a second, a meter is a meter.  You only see differences when comparing two reference frames (so your meter looks shorter to mine and so on).    It is worth noting any sufficiently large explosion can create a mushroom cloud.  It is not inherent to nuclear weapons.  It is inherent to really big explosions.   Hell, if it is more movie than game watching a Let's Play of it could be sufficient.    It is not and never was meant to be the sole source of money for the retired although the reality is it is for a great many people.  It is meant to be supplemental income.  Always has been.  That said if you are destitute then any money is welcome.  It can be the difference between starving and getting a meal at the least.   Everyone I know complains about high taxes, and what they'd do with their money.  They may well whine but the fact is they are paying less than they have in the last 30 years.   Now comes a rare chance to check the facts. And the fact is that federal tax rates had fallen to the lowest in 30 years when President Barack Obama took office  and fell again in his first year in office.  This news comes from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which just issued the latest update of its invaluable series on Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, this time covering 2008 and 2009. The CBOs statistical series now covers the 30 years since 1979. [SOURCE](http://www.factcheck.org/2012/07/tax-facts-lowest-rates-in-30-years/)   While that dates from 2012 things have not changed substantially one way or another since then tax-wise.    SS was/is a scam by the .gov to get more taxes from us.  Also it is not a scam since we all know how it works.  Also, since it is an entitlement that has to be paid back it isn't a bait and switch.    If China called us on our debt to them we would have to default and the whole US economy would go to shit.  It doesn't work like that.  IF China did such a thing (which they can't because things like T-Bills have a maturity date) they would devalue the value of that debt to practically nothing over night making their trillions worth a few billion. (For instance, imagine you own 50% of all the shares of a company...1 million shares worth $100 each...and dumped it all on the market in one go...the price per share would plummet to mere dollars and you'd lose most of your money.)  In short, even if they could (which they can't) they won't because they'd be shooting themselves in the foot.   Again, that is just not true.  Prior to Social Security there was a huge problem with senior citizens living in abject poverty.  Either you had family to support you or you were in trouble.  These people were not stupid.  They knew the deal and yet a substantial percentage of them ended in poverty.  Again, you need be stupid or squander your money.  A single illness can wipe you out (most bankruptcies are due to medical costs and most of those people declaring bankruptcy had medical insurance).  Maybe a tornado smashes your house.  Maybe the people running your pension go belly-up (not to mention there are fewer and fewer pensions to be had these days).  You can plan all you want but things can and do go wrong.    That's a very simplified situation, but doesn't social security only protect the financially irresponsible? If we never had it, people would be forced to be smart with their money, taxes would be lower, and people would have more money to invest/save in their youth (provided they don't do anything stupid).  Well, we don't need to speculate.  There was a lot of time in the US before Social Security existed.  Your assumption that people would be smart with their money and save it is unfounded.  While some people are dumb with their money there are a myriad of other reasons people might run out of money after retirement.  In 2008, after the big market crash, there were a whole host of senior citizens who had their retirement wiped out financially.  If they did not have Social Security you'd have had a colossal problem on your hands with so many thrown into destitution over night.  In 2010 over 44% of Americans over age 65 would have been living in poverty (by the government's definition that is around $10,500/year for an individual in 2010).  With Social Security that number drops to about 9% of the population.  That is 13.8 million people raised out of poverty for the elderly (and over 20 million overall since it covers more than just the elderly).

RIP Mulder  I want to say more but I have not followed Kevin or Mulder.  I just have been there.  This picture is worth a thousand words.    Truly a best friend.  Sorry for your loss.     Its really a shining monument of RTS history IMO.   Absolutely.  Indeed a shining monument to computer gaming of any sort.  Like some older music there are a few bands, a few songs that stand the test of time and are as good now as the day they were made.  This is akin to that.  Honestly, I would have bought Homeworld in a heartbeat without any spiffy new graphics.  I have been playing PC games since Zork and this is one of only a few that really, really stood out in my mind.  As soon as GOG came on the scene I was regularly checking to see if they had this game.  Maybe it just shone so bright considering the time it was released in.  Kinda like Star Wars.  When I was ten and saw Star Wars I was floored.  Nothing like it had ever been seen.  When I showed it to my niece and nephews they were all kinda "meh".  Perhaps today Homeworld will be viewed similarly by the current generation of gamers.  I hope not though.  I hope it is enjoyed by the current gaming crowd as much as it was by us 15 years ago.  It really is an outstanding game.  Hall of Fame stuff and a true high water mark in gaming.    As the poster above me said it really is a solid as shit RTS.  I just played Grey Goo (latest RTS game) and it was a fun game.  I really enjoyed it.  I would dump it in in a heartbeat for Homeworld.  A bit of apples and oranges there and I do not mean to dump on Grey Goo which really is pretty good.  Just not the same league.  If you haven't noticed I am very excited for this release.  I even took a day off work for it (to be fair a day off for me has been a long time coming).     You may find this video interesting:  [How Much Does a Shadow Weigh?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Do1lm9IevYE)    I hate this.  It's not your fault...it is what most people think.  Thing is drowning does not look like drowning in most cases.  1) Except in rare circumstances, drowning people are physiologically unable to call out for help. The respiratory system was designed for breathing. Speech is the secondary or overlaid function. Breathing must be fulfilled before speech occurs.  2) Drowning peoples mouths alternately sink below and reappear above the surface of the water. The mouths of drowning people are not above the surface of the water long enough for them to exhale, inhale, and call out for help. When the drowning peoples mouths are above the surface, they exhale and inhale quickly as their mouths start to sink below the surface of the water.  3) Drowning people cannot wave for help. Nature instinctively forces them to extend their arms laterally and press down on the waters surface. Pressing down on the surface of the water permits drowning people to leverage their bodies so they can lift their mouths out of the water to breathe.  4) Throughout the Instinctive Drowning Response, drowning people cannot voluntarily control their arm movements. Physiologically, drowning people who are struggling on the surface of the water cannot stop drowning and perform voluntary movements such as waving for help, moving toward a rescuer, or reaching out for a piece of rescue equipment.  5) From beginning to end of the Instinctive Drowning Response peoples bodies remain upright in the water, with no evidence of a supporting kick. Unless rescued by a trained lifeguard, these drowning people can only struggle on the surface of the water from 20 to 60 seconds before submersion occurs.

In Shakespeare the quote was meant to mean that lawyers are a basis for justice and stability in society.  The guy who wanted to kill all the lawyers wanted the lawyers out of the way so they could not impede his buddy from overthrowing the king and usurping the throne.    You can either you Steam to manage mods for you or you can use [Skyrim Nexus.](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/?)  Skyrim Nexus has a broader selection and is more in-depth but Steam is simpler to use (although the [Nexus Mod Manager](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/?) makes most of it really simple too).   It's the rapey vibe that is causing you trouble.   $60 + an expensive looking DLC model + not sure how long the game can stay fresh and fun = I'm waiting  Don't get me wrong...I played one of the beta events and enjoyed it.  I think it is a great idea and has lots of potential.  Their price model though smacks of someone who has no faith in the longevity of their game so are scooping up all the cash up front that they can before people realize there is not much there ala Titanfall (also a neat game that missed the mark).     First many of the rebels are almost certainly Russian military units and the rebels are being supplied with modern weapons (including AA missiles) by Russia.  Second, the people in eastern Ukraine identify with and are sympathetic to Russia more than they are to Ukraine.    I came here to say this.  Simultaneously bummed/gratified to see it is the top comment.   (serious question)  Three weeks?  Have I missed some change in weather prediction?  I thought a week out was about as good as they could do and anything after that is not a lot better than an educated guess.  Not saying it won't happen but how reliable is such a prediction?    It is sawing.   Thing is when it comes to cutlery a plain edge is almost always preferable to a serrated edge knife.  Serrated certainly has its uses (particularly for things with rigid surfaces like the outside of a loaf of bread) but if you could only have one knife in the kitchen a plain edge would be the way to go.    Resolution and "looking back in time" are different things.  All you need to do to look back in time is have a photon from that distant source reach your receiver.  Of course you will need more than one photon to really "see" anything so the Hubble kept its camera aperture open and pointed at the same place for days to collect enough light to see the distant galaxies.  That does not translate into resolution though.  If it did the same thing pointed at the earth it'd just get a washed out image.  We do however have satellites with optics that can resolve down to 10 inches (from space to earth's surface).  Government spy satellites may be even better.  EDIT:  Spelling   I think you a somewhat less than all-or-nothing approach can work.  If there is something truly outstanding then go ahead and buy it.  Afterall, we want to encourage the good stuff getting made.  Other than that though I totally steer away if I see EA is involved.  There are many middling games I might try but not if EA is involved.  That and never, ever, ever, ever pre-order any EA game ever.  Indeed that is true for pretty much all games these days (I will probably pre-order Homeworld re-mastered edition but the way I see it I already played it and know it is a great game).  Just with EA you REALLY need to hold yourself back.  If you feel yourself wavering just repeat "SimCity, SimCity, SimCity" till you back off.    FWIW if we had a .45 ACP bullet that weighs 12 grams here on earth it would have a relativistic mass of ~268 grams at 99.9% the speed of light.    This is a thing?  Since when is this a thing?  Just when you think your fellow citizens can't embarrass the rest of us any more someone has to go to 11 on the stupid meter.    In this case the existing base game is the same as the original and the original is/was outstanding.  Truly one of my favorite games ever and one that has stuck in my memory all these years (I would regularly visit GOG hoping they'd have it before this re-master was announced).  All they have done with this is polish up the graphics and re-master the music (I think) and we can see in the videos what they have done on those counts and it looks great.  So yeah...this is one I will break my no pre-purchase rule on because, technically, I've already played it and loved it.    The Big Bang was not an explosion "in" space (like an explosion in a room).  It was space itself that exploded into existence (like the room itself came into existence).  It is this space that is exploded into existence and is expanding.    To think that an adult couldn't improve on that Shity existence called school is sad as hell.....   It really depends.  Some things are under your control.  Some aren't.  Try losing your job and wondering how you will feed, clothe and house your wife and kids as your next mortgage payment looms and you can't pay it (not to mention other bills).  Nearly [half the people in the US live paycheck to paycheck.](http://time.com/2742/nearly-half-of-america-lives-paycheck-to-paycheck/)  The terror of that can send you into a god forsaken job that you loathe but have to do. Getting up every morning and thinking about it makes you want to slit your wrists but you don't because of your kids.  Not everyone is in that boat of course but a lot are.  So yeah...school ain't so bad.  Is it worse than life after school?  The right answer is, "it depends".     It's called "curtained hair" (I honestly do not know why I know that).   Imagine we magically turned everyone into the world into Kevin O'Leary.  Would it happen then that they would ALL be multimillionaires because they all worked "really hard"?  This also supposes that the poor do not work "really hard" cuz clearly if they did they'd be wealthy right?       I am willing to bet this is almost certainly some form of right-wing astroturfing (not sure what to call it exactly).  Wired's average reader is male, age 39, college educated with a household income of $80,000. [SOURCE](http://www.wired.com/about/press_factsheet/)    This level of dumbfuckery doesn't come from people like that.  Either it is right-wing trolls who love to pounce on "liberal" sites or it is actually a concerted effort by some right-wing groups.  Hard to say.     According to Google, "todays Artificial Intelligence technology can solve even the most difficult variant of distorted text at 99.8% accuracy. Thus distorted text, on its own, is no longer a dependable test." [SOURCE](http://googleonlinesecurity.blogspot.com/2014/12/are-you-robot-introducing-no-captcha.html)       Weather is a system that has a "sensitive dependence on initial conditions", aka [The Butterfly Effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect) aka a chaotic system.  It is impossible to know every little detail of all the parameters that go into predicting weather.  While we can know a lot there are always ever finer details.  As a result, when the simulations are run, they work ok for a little while then get wildly wrong results the longer the simulation is run.  This is why they can predict the weather within the next few hours very accurately but less so the further into the future they look.  Just one little missed parameter can dramatically change the long term outcome hence the term the "Butterfly Effect".  If your simulations knows *everything* about the weather but misses one butterfly flapping its wings somewhere then eventually the simulation will flounder and not predict, say, a hurricane.   With the back door down and letting water in?    It is worth considering the role the Bubonic plague (aka Black Death) played in 14th century Europe.  The plague caused a severe shortage of labor so the ruling class had to compete for labor thus improving the lot in life of laborers.  It also seriously diminished the power of the church (praying didn't help stop the plague and priests died as easily as anyone else).    This would start leading to reforms that would not come to other parts of the world for awhile.  These reforms would help spur economic growth and scientific advancement.   Love it.    Games seem smooth at nearly any frame rate (except *really* slow).     Ok, I'll be the pedant.  Ain't no such thing as "very unique".  It is unique or it isn't (unique is one of a kind so you can't be very one of a kind...you are or you aren't...it's a binary thing).  That said that clock does indeed seem to be unique.  Pretty cool too.  Wish there were more of them.   I think a simpler way to put this is:  - Bet on the chances that a coin flip will produce 10 heads in a row.  This is a real long shot.  - After nine coin flips which all came up heads (assuming a fair coin) bet on the likelihood the next flip is heads.  This one is 50/50.  The difference is betting *before* a coin is flipped or betting *after* nine coin flips.  Each coin flip is 50/50.  As an aside and interestingly I had an argument about this with a friend who likes to gamble.  I pointed out that the casinos putting a "past results" display on their roulette tables was bullshit.  She *insisted* it helped cuz in her mind if the table came up red the last nine times it was "due" for a black.  This is bullshit but she didn't believe me.  What she should believe is the casino is not into losing money.  They put that there to lure suckers like my friend.      I have a 1440p monitor using a GTX980 with a G-SYNC monitor.  Tested it using the Heaven Benchmark with everything turned on and get ~45-50 FPS.  I had a 1200p (yes, 1200, not 1080, the 1200 in my view is far superior...bummed it never caught on) with a Radeon 7970 card and it also did around 45 FPS on the same benchmark.  If that seems weird realize my new monitor has 75+% more pixels which makes the FPS a wash despite the faster card.    Yeah, I should have made that more clear.  Thanks.     The weight difference is small but it is worth noting that we try to fire off rockets into space as close to the equator as possible (give and take other considerations).  The centripetal force at the equator is substantial enough to save on rocket fuel and/or put heavier payloads into orbit.   Supposedly this is a true story.  Unfortunately I have forgotten most of the details but I think it is close enough:   There were two comedians who were life-long rivals.  Each one was always trying to top the other.  One of them was on his death bed and his rival was in the room.  He beckoned his rival over to his bedside, reached out to him and said with his last breath:  "Tag...you're it!"     Let's say you flip the coin 10 times and get all 10 heads. You currently have 100% heads; this is pretty improbable but not at all impossible.  This is one of the reasons humans are bad at listing a random set of numbers.  A real random set will include streaks of the same number repeating.    IIRC in an infinite set you can expect any arbitrarily long string to occur.  So if you flip the coin infinite times you'd expect somewhere in there to have a run of a billion heads in a row.     Stalling at that high of an angle of attack would be very dangerous.  It's not dangerous.  IIRC when you learn to fly they make you stall a plane on purpose so you can learn how to recover from it and that is when you are a mere student.  Not a big deal really as long as you have enough altitude to recover (stalling near the ground is definitely a bad thing...such as right after takeoff).  It would be "bad" in a passenger plane only inasmuch as you'd give the passengers a helluva roller-coaster ride and throw them around a lot but even a passenger jet can recover from a stall without much fuss as long as it has enough altitude to recover.    Huh...that may well be the case but not sure why it matters.  My last monitor was noticeably warmer than this one but honestly I never cared.  Not like it was actually hot or I even noticed since I rarely touched it.   At 27" I think 1440p is necessary else your pixel density (dots per inch) gets too low and image quality suffers.  If you are at 24" or smaller then 1080p is fine.  Just remember that higher resolution means a ~~30+%~~ ~78% jump in the number of pixels your video card needs to push.  Part of the reason the PG278Q is Display Port only.  It needs that extra bandwidth that HDMI/DVI cannot deliver.  EDIT:  Changed percentage thanks to /u/saint-yolo and realized there is a difference between percent increase and percent difference (although I was still way off on percent difference too).   If you can wait till March there is the Acer XB270HU.  It is an IPS panel instead of the TN that Asus is (I have the PG278Q and I can say hands down the worst thing about it is that it is a TN panel...color shifting is noticeable).  There is no price for it yet but I'd expect it to be competitive pricewise with Asus or a bit more expensive for the IPS panel.  http://www.tomshardware.com/news/acer-xb270hu-xg270hu-ips-g-sync,28299.html    Damn...I got a PG278Q a month ago and while mine works fine (a tiny bit of light bleed but only noticeable on an all-black screen so not bad) I have found I REALLY am not a fan of TN panels.  That the PG278Q is a TN panel is by far its biggest drawback.  Sure it is 1ms but a good IPS panel can do just fine.  I notice distinct color shifting.  It is very distracting and very apparent and not cool at this price.  Also, while not a big deal, not happy they opted for an external power supply for the monitor.  Guess they wanted to maintain a thinner or more sleek overall appearance for the monitor but is that a real big deal to anyone?  Who would buy or not buy based on that?   That said G-SYNC is pretty damn cool and really nice.     $47 million in one month.  Yearly the state needs $6.2 billion and has a projected $436 million shortfall.  That is substantial.     Sounds like the [Twin Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_paradox).  The solution is the person who accelerated breaks the symmetry.      Not quite sure what you are asking but remember light, while fast, has a finite speed.  *Everything* you see is how those things were in the past.  For most things, such as stuff you see in the world around you, that time differential is so small as to make no difference.  But when you look into space the distances mean those time differentials are noticeable.  So yeah, if I was two light days from earth then I would see the earth as it was two days ago. If it exploded yesterday I would not know it till another day passed.    Sure.  The expansion you are talking about would only delay or stop a gamma ray burst from reaching us that was formed further than our horizon (about [46.5 billion light years](http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/03/01/how-big-is-our-observable-universe/)...yes that is older than the universe but since it is expanding our horizon is bigger/older than that...read the article).  Any gamma ray burst inside that horizon will eventually reach us.  Imagine Alpha Centauri blew up...we'd get the gamma ray burst big time.  Be glad it won't since such a thing would probably kill all life on earth.    We can see things outside the event horizon of a black hole.  When a black hole pulls material in it tends to heat up...a lot.  As a result a "feeding" black hole can be quite bright.  The most exceptional examples of this are [Quasars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar) which are exceptionally bright (brighter than whole galaxies).  Once material has passed the event horizon of the black hole then you will never see it again.  It is possible to orbit a black hole.  If our sun magically *poofed* into a black hole the earth would continue to orbit it same as it does now.  You can get an orbit for light outside the black hole too called the [photon sphere](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_sphere).  It is a very unstable orbit for the photons though so mostly they will eventually fly away or fall into the black hole.    To add the earth (and all the planets...the whole solar system) formed at the same time.  So the sun and Earth and Venus and Saturn, Etc. all formed at the same time.     Our signals will be (depending on orientation) be red or blue shifted and intrinsically our clocks will differ and accuse the other as slow.  But what does that mean?  Let's say I am flying away from earth at 99.999% the speed of light.  At that speed clocks on earth will run noticeably faster than clocks on my spaceship.  But because I am moving away at that speed the signals to me will be red shifted and data will appear to arrive more slowly.  With no fiddling and watching the raw data stream will I (on the space ship) see the video in fast forward, real time (normal speed) or slow-mo?    I really enjoy his videos. Very well written and produced.  That said I think he could really benefit from an editor.  While I like his deep dives into these games there is room to tighten it up.  A good writer benefits from a good editor.  Noah is no different.  When I wonder why someone as good at this as he is doesn't have more subscribers the only conclusion is he lacks a good editor to tighten it up a bit.  Good editors are worth their weight in gold and most of the best writers any of us can think of have benefited from them.  Here is a quote from an excellent writer about one of the best writers ever that illustrates the point:  Oscar Wilde, and there have been few greater and more complete lords of language in the past thousand years, once included with a manuscript he was delivering to his publisher, a compliments slip in which hed scribbled the injunction, Ill leave you to tidy up the woulds and shoulds, wills and shalls, thats and whichs etc.   ~Stephen Fry  That is not to say Noah's grammar is bad but rather to note that editors were used and valued by some of the best writers of our time.     Public shaming absolutely can work, but it adds bullshit to your own day. It is pointless, often overreached, and it's degree is born more often from the shamers current state of stress rather than the level of injustice.  Maybe, maybe not.  All things in proportion.  We live in a society.  That society exerts pressure on its members to conform to societal norms.  While it is popular to want to march to a different drummer it is also necessary that society has some agreed upon norms.  It must be that way else there is no society.  These rules are more important than ever when we are forced together in close proximity...REALLY close proximity.  You can be a crazy loon in the mountains all by yourself if you want.  You can't do it on a subway train.    Mass transit is about as crammed in with your fellow man as you will find outside of a mosh pit.  For it to work some etiquette need apply.  There is no room for "I just gotta be me" on a crowded subway train.  Society punishing people who stray outside those lines in those circumstances is not inappropriate.  It is necessary.  It is how we manage to co-exist as a social species especially and particularly in circumstances like a crowded train.    It is more effort to place your items the way that he did if he knows that people will always come to take the seat. Assuming he did this with intention, he is banking on nobody being assertive. However, if you are consistently asked to move your stuff, you will likely eventually choose the easier path of putting your items in a spot under you.  Look at the picture again.  The item placement is not happenstance.  It is clearly calculated.  The luggage at the entrance is the dead-giveaway but there is more with the placement of his bags on the seats.  He is 100% telling others to not sit there, this is HIS space.  Space he does not have a claim to but is forcing others who might want to sit there to have to be confrontational to access.  You are being strangely lenient on someone who is going out of their way to inconvenience others.    How is that relevant if there are plenty of empty rows?  It is relevant that it is not your place to block off sections of seating all to yourself.  You get one seat to claim.  That's it.  That is all your ticket entitles you to.  Do you (or anyone) really have problems with people sitting next to you on an empty train?  I would say it almost never happens and if you manage to get the one weirdo in Chicago (where I live too) who sits next to you on an empty train car you can move.  No need to be a dick and block out "your space" which is manifestly not "your space".    If you note in the OP he is taking space across from him as well as next to him.    Well yeah but it is more like this:  There are plenty of empty seats but all of them are next to someone else.  You have to pick who to sit next to.  One person is manspreading to discourage people from sitting next to him.  So, picking that seat is not worse than picking any other seat and has the added bonus of letting that person know I chose to crowd them instead of someone else because they were being a dick.  That said though, looking at the picture in the OP, I might go sit next to that guy cuz blocking out that many seats that overtly and ostentatiously is a supreme dick move.  Also:  ...when the train isn't full YET.  FWIW some seats truly are better than others at least where I am (partiularly now with the new and "improved" subway cars...the city worker that chose these new subway cars should be tarred and feathered but that is another discussion).   While this guy is taking up too much space, until he denies your request for a seat, then he has done nothing to deserve a vitriolic response.  But he has.  While I agree a confrontational first response is not called for or ideal you give the guy taking up the space too much leeway assuming he doesn't have it coming.  This is not someone who accidentally left a personal item next to him.  He is actively blocking multiple seats and doing so in an overt and unambiguous manner.  I too am a big city denizen and have also spent decades riding mass transit.  I encounter people like this with some regularity although never taking up that much room (to be fair I do more subway trains than commuter trains).  Manspreading is common with a close second being women putting a purse/bag next to them.  IF there is plenty of seating then I don't fuss and pick an empty seat.  But considering most of my riding is during rush hour commutes it will be seating that needs to be taken in VERY short order (usually a stop or two).  If I take an empty seat I have abetted the bad behavior and made someone else do the uncomfortable process of confronting the person to ask for a seat they should not have to ask for.  Bottom line is if you live in a city with mass transit you learn real fast that for it to work well there needs to be a modicum of politeness and accommodation for your fellow riders.  A politeness ALL riders need to observe.  It is stressful and not fun for anyone being crammed in mass transit.  No need to add more bullshit to the experience unnecessarily.  We're all in the same boat (or train or bus).  For that reason, assuming this is a train that will fill up, some level of public shaming is not amiss towards this person if only to educate them of proper mass transit etiquette.    Yeah what was it, $99? $75? at some points.  IIRC it was that expensive because they felt putting it out for early access at (say) $40 would have been unfair to the people who Kickstarted the project.  (I may be wrong though)   I agree about the batteries.  The main problem stopping most sci-fi-like tech from being real is limited power.  Batteries are freaking heavy.  I suppose the powered exoskeleton can help there but of course that takes a lot of power to run.  I'd be surprised if they could get even one hour of operation out of all that stuff with a man-portable power supply.  As for the hot helmet and hot armor one would assume the cooling system takes care of that but there you are again needing a lot of power to run it.  Not to mention a cooling system is hot in and of itself.  Camo is wasted on these guys since any dimestore IR detection will make them stand out like flares.    But Nancy is just trying to think of the children here!  Hopefully tomorrow she'll call out swimming pools which kill nearly one child (ages 0-14) a day, every day, in the US (on average).  So far pools have got pot beat by a country mile when it comes to tragedies.  Surely Nancy won't let this scourge go by unnoticed!          Politics mostly.    Google needs to get permission from various state and municipal agencies to build out the infrastructure for their service.  The big cable companies have many of these politicians bought and paid for so they will block attempts by Google to enter the market.          I had Guillan-Barre syndrome. The medicine for me was $13,000/bottle (IV drip thing) and I got one a day for several days.    More Chicago pride than state but yeah.   I guess it is a matter of degree.  Certainly doing things faster than your opponent will generally be helpful in any game (except turn-based).  But as you noted below AoE is not at the insane APM that Starcraft 2 is.  I have seen professional Starcraft players say that there is an upper age limit to being able to play Starcraft 2 competitively and it is around 25 years old.  After that age has literally made you too slow to play.  As someone over 25 I personally want no part of that (wouldn't have under 25 either).  I think a *strategy* game that relies on dexterity to win is missing the point.    Any RTS that gets away from the APM mode of gameplay gets my vote and money.  Obviously a lot of people like Starcraft and its ilk and that's fine.  Personally I do not see how anyone would [find this fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbpCLqryN-Q) but to each their own I guess.  I am thrilled at this return to the "old" style of RTS.  I missed it a lot.   Wouldn't this count as a form of bribery?    The short answer is they blow up.  Which is to say the stuff needed for the reaction is violently pushed apart.  As a result there is only a very narrow time window for the reaction to occur.  There are two types of nuclear weapons:  - Fission (Uranium/Plutonium bombs) - Fusion (Hydrogen bombs)  It is worth noting that a hydrogen bomb has a fission bomb wrapped around the outside.  In both cases the trick is to mash things together at really high densities to make things work.  In the case of a fusion bomb the densities and energies needed are so high that you need a fission bomb around the outside to compress and heat the hydrogen enough to fuse.  Problem is when the reactions occur the forces start pushing out (that is the bomb's "*boom*").  As a result there is only a very small slice of time where the stuff going "*boom*" is in the right conditions to go "*boom*".  I forget the number but the amount of material in a nuclear bomb that actually undergoes fission/fusion is something like a few percent (2-4% of the material).  I am probably wrong on that number but it's close.   [Chinese city says pollution all due to ... bacon](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-city-says-pollution-all-due-to-bacon-2015-01-21) (you just can't make this shit up)    Yes  Actually the answer is: "It depends".  In this case it depends on the size of the black hole.  A "small" (read a few stellar masses) black hole will tear anything apart that even gets close.  However, for supermassive black holes (such as the ones at the center of most galaxies) the gravitational gradient at the event horizon is so low that it is quite possible you could pass the event horizon and not even know it (or at least you could certainly survive crossing the event horizon...just once inside you are doomed).     The sound design is fantastic.  Second that.  If you have headphones that can do surround sound (either the headphones themselves OR a soundcard that can do simulated surround sound which works surprisingly well) then do yourself a favor and play with headphones on.  Can't stress this enough.  Really heightens the atmosphere.  Also turn the lights down in your room when playing.    You aren't calling me wrong.  You are upset I didn't write as complete an essay on the internet as you'd like.  If you want a full lecture on American law go to college.  This is the internet.  If you are upset that I didn't cover every possible twist and turn that's your own lookout.  What I wrote is not misleading as it applies to states too.  It is entirely possible for you to take what I wrote and figure the rest out for yourself with minimal effort.  Stop being a pedant.    Educate yourself.   States have sovereign immunity too.       When I moved to the burbs I couldn't install a dish due to rental agreements or HOA etc.  You may be happy to know they cannot prevent you from installing a satellite dish per FCC regulations.  This may be one of the few instances where you can tell your HOA to fuck off which is always nice.  Section 207 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 required the Federal Communications Commission to issue rules prohibiting restrictions by zoning boards, homeowners' associations, and similar organizations that keep a viewer from getting video programming services with the DIRECTV System and other direct broadcast satellite dishes. [SOURCE](https://support.directv.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/132/~/my-city%2Fhomeowners-association-will-not-allow-me-to-install-a-satellite-dish.)  That said, before you do anything, it is best to check with a local attorney familiar with these kinds of rules.  Don't take legal advice from the internet.   I am pretty sure this would fall under [sovereign immunity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity_in_the_United_States).  In short you cannot sue the United States except in some very particular circumstances.  Furthermore, you have never been able to sue a government official for doing their job.  If you could sue a member of congress for every perceived slight that caused you harm (e.g. raised your taxes) they'd never get anything done.  There is always someone who gets the short end of the stick.            Yes, it is literally curved as was proved in 1919 in an [experiment done by Arthur Eddington.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Eddington#Relativity)  He looked at stars near the sun during a solar eclipse and measured their position was shifted due to the light bending as it curved around the sun.  Since then the idea of [gravitational lensing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens) is well known and documented.   I have had DirecTV for about 7 years now and I will never, ever go back to cable if I can help it.    - I personally think the picture is better which is to say I seem to get more...I dunno...artifacts and weirdness with cable.  The picture from DirecTV is reliably great (note I have a good, unobstructed line-of-sight for my dish).  It is also possible (though rare) to get 1080p shows.  My GFs cable can only do 1080i.  - The on-screen guide is light-years better than cable.  There is no comparison.  It looks better, is devoid of ads and intuitive.  - The service is outrageously good.  When I call I get a human within two minutes (usually faster).  What few problems I have had they resolve on the spot and always remotely (no need for a visit).  In fact, I called a year ago to see about upgrading my service.  I called on a Saturday afternoon.  They agreed to the upgrade which include a new, better DVR and a new dish.  They sent out a guy the next day (Sunday) to install it all.  Took a couple hours to get it all set up.  No charge.  - Superior equipment.  My DVR can now record six shows simultaneously off of one input (IIRC cable does two shows at once).  It also shares its recordings with all the other DVRs in the house (so you can play something recorded on the family room DVR in the bedroom and vice-versa).  The remote can work on RF instead of just IR (does both) so you can hide the unit in a cabinet or behind something and still control it.  Note some will complain that the picture goes out in bad weather.  While this is true it has to be really bad weather.  I live in Chicago which has no shortage or rainy/snowy shitty days and maybe twice a year do I experience the picture dropping out because of weather and only then for 5-10 minutes till the worst is passed.  My only complaint is I bought the gizmo that allows you to access your DVR from other devices via the internet so you can, in theory, watch your recorded shows anywhere.  Turns out the thing is horribly gimped in numerous ways.  Pretty much it is complete shit and a huge waste of money.  That said the thing is completely optional.  Other than that I love the service.   There is a misconception in the US that the rich pay more than their fair share (as a percentage of income).  While we do not have a "flat tax" the reality is something close to it.  Remember that while income tax is progressive many other taxes are regressive and we pay all sorts of taxes.  Consider a sales tax as an example.  Imagine we both pay $10 in sales tax on a purchase.  If you have $1000 to your name you just paid 1% of your money in taxes.  If I have $100 to my name I paid 10% of my money to taxes.  In the end it is a lot more equal than you might think *when all taxes are considered* with only the really poor getting a "good deal" on the tax front.  You can see the distribution [here](http://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/09/total-tax-bill-income.jpg) (from [this article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/09/19/heres-why-the-47-percent-argument-is-an-abuse-of-tax-data/)).  TL;DR: Tax policy is not as unfair as many might have you think it is when *all taxes* are taken into consideration.  One side would have you think they are being ripped off but they are only pointing to one way the government collects money from its citizens.  That is misleading.   What fantasy?  There is a shortage.  The US spends more than it collects in taxes.  That is the definition of a shortage in tax revenue.  We can argue endlessly over how the money is spent and whether it is a good idea or not but it remains that we spend more than we have.    Single player.

It is worth noting that it is against almost all ISP terms of service (TOS) to run a server from your home using their basic home connection packages.    In practice they generally let you get away with it if you have a minor site and hardly anyone visits it (so good for personal use).  They can get pissy about it anytime they want though and if you get, say, a [Reddit Hug](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Reddit+Hug) you may very well find your service suspended.    Also, there is a problem that most home PCs are connected to the internet using an address served by a DHCP server.  Short version is this means your address can change making it hard for people to find you.  One day they can, the next you seem to be gone.  You can get around this though using a dynamic DNS service (DDNS).  Of course the way the ISPs want you to do it to run a server from home is to buy that service from them.  Generally that is more expensive but it does come with the advantage that your upstream bandwidth will be a lot better than it is with a typical home service and that is something you want with a web server.        Gamers just don't learn.  I would be really interested to see the age breakdown of people who bought this game.  I'd like to think the college-age and older gamers read the news and make more careful buying decisions because it's their hard earned and often limited entertainment budget at stake.  High-school and younger (generally) have less pressure to save or be careful with their entertainment money.  They don't (generally) need to make rent or buy food and so on.  Then again maybe gamers as a whole don't learn and there are many older gamers buying this stuff too.  Without data there is no way to say.  Would be interesting to see though.          I am curious though:  Energy has gravity.  If I put the earth in a magic box and converted it to energy the gravitational effect would remain the same (the moon would stay in orbit).  A wound clock will weigh more than an unwound clock due to the energy present in the wound spring.  E=MC^2 says mass and energy are interchangeable.  Mass is energy, energy is mass.  Two sides of the same coin.  This thread on [The Straight Dope](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=668912) talks about it some.     He's got a big grin on his face so keep doing whatever it is you're doing.   I haven't read all the responses here but seriously?  Here's the thing numbskulls...USB is an INTERFACE.  How you connect to a PC.  The tech behind the interface  could be anything.  You could hook-up a supercomputer to a USB port.  In fact they probably have a few.  So one can suppose she made some super dense, super high-tech, world changing info on something that looked like a USB stick BUT was in reality a hyperbigass-buttloadhuge-database-with-a-USB-interface-because-that-is-what-humans-use (might have been e-sata or something too).  Yeah might take years to move the data off but so what?  She had to deal with what we had at the time.  Lots of reasons to hate on that movie but this one is weak.  Edit to add: Before someone assumes a huge database cannot fit on a USB sized stick remember [this was a 5MB hard drive 60 years ago.](http://www.itworld.com/article/2767629/storage/first-hard-drive-anniversary.html)    Nicki Minaj is known for her [wide hips](https://www.google.com/search?q=nicki+minaj biw=2560 bih=1329 tbm=isch tbo=u source=univ sa=X ei=RWKzVKihHoKSyAT7n4LgDA sqi=2 ved=0CI0BEIke#tbm=isch q=nicki+minaj+hips imgdii=_).  The woman in your photo has distinctly narrow hips.  Hips are a structural thing (i.e. not something you diet away) and the woman in your picture has narrow hips.  I doubt they can be the same woman.  It's a skeletal frame thing.  Maaaybe she grew monster hips after that photo but that would seem unlikely.  The woman in that photo is not that young (i.e. pre-pubescent or something).    While the sheer size of these ships is remarkable enough I can get my head around it when they are on the open sea.  To me the really amazing part is how they ever manage to get one of these to a dock in one piece.  Clearly they do and do so a lot every day but still amazing.

There are certain spots which seem to not take much at all to be uncomfortable when hit even lightly.  You can test this yourself easily enough.

You just saw "I'm happy they scored" and that's it.   Read it again, and see what I said.   "I hope this urges Mourinho to change Drogba and mix it up a bit,"   But we have conceded? I don't get your point.    I love how people who have no idea about Chelsea and it's squad talk like they are Mourinho's assistans.   Solanke would've been better 10x times than Drogba, but he's not even on the bench.    Exactly my thinking ...   We would've played like shit through the 2nd half too, hadn't they scored at the end of the 1st one. Better sooner than later.   To be honest, we've been really bad, it's mostly Leicester playing    I'm so happy that they scored, we've been shit whole game, well deserved!   I hope this urges Mourinho to change Drogba and mix it up a bit, this won't end up well if it keeps going like this with the same set up   not really, unless you are willing to overpay, in that case, feel free to add me to discuss   added   Killing Floor 2 STANDARD edition: 10 CSGO colored,  11 TF2 keys  Killing Floor 2 DELUXE edition: 12 CSGO colored  // 14 TF2 keys  ---------------------------------------------------------------  Keep in mind, price may vary depending on the price of keys currently on market.

Sorry for bothering mate, thanks for answering my questions :)   alright, thanks for the insight, so to sum it up, i5 4690k is one of the BEST CPU's on the market currently, based off price/performance ratio?    Are there any  AMD CPU's out there that can compare head-to-head with 4690k?   4690k is 240 in my area, so that's within my price range.   Thanks, I checked my store, and they have Gainward GTX 970 Phantom Edition there as well as normal Gainward GTX 970. (although they probably can order parts and I can get different model of GTX 970 ).  There are different models, would you say (since you put it in your build) that Zotac model is the best?   And that i5 4460 is exact same price as FX-8350 in my store. Would you argue that FX-8350 is better in that build or no?    Sapphire Tri X is 50 cheaper here than Asus MATRIX model.   So CPU is actually alright? There's no need for i7 4790k or something like that?   Would you argue that FX-8350 is better than i5 4690k ? Obviously i5 4690k is better but if I was to buy FX-8350, how much worse would it be and would my CPU bottleneck r9 290x / gtx 970?   This is a c/p from pcpartpicker:   https://pcpartpicker.com/guide/DyKH99/great-gaming-build#comments   Seems like a great build, but since it's around 200 more expensive here in my area, I'm interested if this build ( with maybe switching R9 290x with gtx970 ) would be future proof for around 3-4 years, or even 5, while playing at 1080p, 60+ FPS?   How loud is r9 290x and is it better to purchase GTX 970 or R9 290x?   Thanks guys, I'm really newbie when it comes to these kind of things   THEY still haven't fixed the bug with blank games in invetories. fucking volvo   Also selling UNTRADEABLE copy of CS:GO ( Counter Strike: Global Offensive ) for 5 keys.

 Pretty self explanatory. What are the traditional drinking foods in your country?   I am an avid hunter. I try to be a thoughtful eater. Many folks who criticize hunting partake in supermarket bought meat products farmed on industrial farms where the animals are treated horribly, pumped full of hormones, and killed. I prefer eating humanely raised meat, and hunting wild game when I can. It connects you to your food, and makes the consumption process a more mindful one. I also grew up on a small family farm. We slaughtered our own sheep, hogs, and beef cows. I appreciate the meat on my table, and respect the animal who gave it to me.    Because I sure as hell plan on making higher wages when I am 60 than I do now at 22.   The military. You will learn a trade, learn valuable leadership, professionalism, and stress management skills, and if you do 20 years can get a pension and job offers of 100k plus a year.   Trailer park kid who read too many books joined the Army to see the shitholes of the world and still reads too many books.   Good books, good friends, and activity.      I use a Roth IRA. It takes my taxes out now, so that when I am older and ready to retire (and probably in a higher tax bracket) I won't have to pay taxes upon withdrawal.   Before you start investing though, you need to secure a savings account with approx. 6 months of emergency savings. Major debts first, Savings second, Investment third.     Because our culture is more concerned about seeing a celebrity's tits than seeing the corruption in their government.       Try your local VFW or American Legion. Those organizations are usually good at helping out with these kinds of details.   Because most hospitals were affiliated with universities or religious groups when they were started.      Whoa.. Weird, I know you.   Jash here.   I agree. I am not defending them by any means.   Because they don't commit terrorist acts. Not anymore. The KKK is surprisingly peaceful nowadays, despite their offensive beliefs.      You're welcome!   Yup, I also use goodreads on the side   Nope.   I have pretty high self confidence. I have never had a problem with anxiety. It's actually really hard to worry me.   Ummm... Hot. As. Hell.  Thats how I would feel.   Don't really get talked about a lot, but I was just curious if anyone ever saw some paranormal shit while deployed. When I was in the 'Stan I had a few odd experiences but never talked to anyone about them.       "No, no, no, this is not a suit made out of my mother's skin, it is a visible representation of my ability to get in touch with my feminine side."   I keep a book journal. I write the book name, author, ISBN #, and two paragraphs. The first paragraph is a summary of the book, the second is my reaction to the book.   I have found this has been a useful discipline that keeps me from passively reading. It gives me an avenue to mull over the book as a whole.   I need some advice guys. I was driving my 2014 Corolla last night, and it was very dark as I prepared to pull onto the interstate ramp. There was a very deep pothole which I hit at about 35-40 mph and blew my right front tire out. When I removed the tire to replace it with my spare i noticed that the control arm appeared to be bent. On the drive home there were no real issues other than the car pulling noticably to the right. The rim appears to be undented on the old tire.   Can someone give me some advice before I get tge mechanics to look at it on monday? I am taking it to a dealership mechanic because I do not want to fuck up my warranty. What kinda wallet damage am I looking at?   It is based on being a consistently good soldier, but that entails a lot of self development.   Not anymore.  The only "stripes" that can be given at the unit level are those of Corporal, which is only an appointment not a promotion.   An officer is a leader of soldiers a Warrant officer is a technical expert.   For example, officers in my motorpool unit plan our field exercises, set the standards, oversee the administration of our company etc.   Warrant officers are technical subject matter experts in logistics, mechanical stuff, etc.     It depends on which branch, and whether you are an Officer, Enlisted, or Warrant officer.  I can only speak to the Army's way of doing things because I am in the Army.  **Enlisted**   E-1 to E-4 is automatic, based on time in service. If you don't fuck up (get a dui, drugs, punctual etc) you will get promoted.  E-5 to E-6 is points based. Each MOS (job) in the Army has a certain amount of points one needs to make E-5 or E-6. A soldier has to go to a promotion board, meet certain standards (attend NCO school, certain self development classes), and have the correct number of points (points are awarded for various things, awards, PT, how well you fire a weapon, civilian education etc.)  E-7 and above is board selected. Each MOS has a specific amount of allotted slots for each of these ranks. A board meets every year and looks over all the E-6's and aboves qualifications and determines whether to promote them to one of those slots.  **Officer**  O-1 to O-2 is a pretty much automatic promotion, based on time in service.  O-3 and above is based on board selection, similar to E-7 and above on the enlisted side.  **Warrant**  WO-1 to WO-2 is pretty much automatic based on time in grade/service. The rest are determined by board selection.  **Two closing thoughts**  1. You still have many chances in peacetime to win awards. Catching attention for hard work during a field exercice, winning Soldier/NCO of the month boards, all kinds of things.  2. We (the U.S.) are not at peace and probably never will be in our lifetime. There is always somewhere to deploy to.    As a Southerner I always shake hands with folks I know at the store.   Just keep it up man. Running is all about practice. I am in the Army and we run all the damn time, so I have had lots of practice. But don't overdo it. Here is my personal running schedule for speed improvement.   **Mon**- 2-4 miles at a pace that hurts. (the 7 min mile for me right now)   **Wed**- Sprintd, 61-20's, suicides, and other sprint excercises for 45 mins. Followed by lengthy streching.   **Fri**- Run for 45 mins at a pace you can carry on a conversation in. This is all about building lung capacity, learning to pace yourself well, and correct your form.   Ha!   Do you know what the difference is between a Presbyterian and a Southern Baptist is?  Presbyterians shake each others hands in the liquor store.   He never said he was suffering from depression. He said he fell into a pit of depression early on in his academic career.   For many folks the military would not be good if they suffered from real depression. If you are easily emotionally affected by the world around you, the military sure as hell is not for you.  Others suffer depression stemming from low self esteem and feelings of low worth. The military instills you with a high level of self confidence and puts you in places of high responsibility. Accomplishing your job well only increases your worth and self confidence. This could be just the challenge they need.   The military is not for everyone. It is a rough, stressful, mucky life that not everyone can handle.    Like most big Army programs.    Handling things at the big Army level never works like they hope (SHARP, EO, etc)   Really funny, coming from someone who doesn't know how to use a definite article (**the** military not "military").   Just because you can graduate college does not mean you are smart. I am responsible for millions of dollars of equipment and the lives of my soldiers every single day. I am held to a higher standard than all of my civilian peers. I have real world skills and marketability, leadership skills, knowledge in my field (logistics), and more experience than all your degrees.    Who is the dumbass?   Ran my four mile in 28:25 yesterday.   Grandpa did. Things from Vietnam, awards from his time in Cargill, etc.   I have a tuffbox that I keep important things in. I have a flag that flew over our base in Afghanistan, military coins, framed pictures with a few famous folks I have met, a dummy round from an A-10 warthog that a JTAC gave me and a few other knick knacks.    I cannot speak to the specifics of your questions because I am in the U.S. Army. I am sure the British Army does things a little differently than we do. Your local Army recruiter would be the subject matter expert for your questions. Just because you sit down and have a conversation with them does not mean you have to join.   For me, I signed my papers and was in Basic training four months later.    If you have a degree you should have no problem joining as an officer. I have a limited amount of knowledge on the subject because I am enlisted. I would recommend talking to an Army officer recruiter, they would have all the answers you need.   A lot of guys do enlist with degrees. You come in as an E-4 so pay will be better than your peers for the first two years or so until they catch up to you.    Join the military.   I was in the same place. Failing out of college because I was a dumbass. Now I have a steady and fulfilling job, real world skills, and a future.   You will be fine. Have fun.   With whipped cream on top.   Well now I can never eat American cheese. Thanks.   I would have loved this Army.   This. Intentionally seek out ways he *does* provide around the house and shiw gratitude. Ask him for help (not busy work, but find legitimate requests) and let him feel that he is contributing while he looks for his next job.   Jimmy replied crying, "Because I heard my daddy tell my mommy, 'I am going to eat that p*ssy once Jimmy leaves for school today!'"   "Lemme start this joke with a question nobody would ever ask."   Sure, just call the police and tell them you are a weak body. They will book you overnight.   I hope you come face to face with a salty ass first sergeant with this story.   Because he murdered Miss Piggy in her sleep and fried her up for breakfast?   Kind of.  As a soldier Itend to do more functional fitness. Strecher carries, vest runs, ruck marches for exercise on my personal time. I am not trying to be big, but lean and strong.      *Over the border   You watch lesbian porn but your username is a request for dick pics?    No, but her instincts tell her that you are trying to evolve by learning through reading. As a predator she is threatened by the thought of you evolving faster than she does, so she attempts to distract you with an air of playfullness, thus hindering your evolution.   It becomes Mountain Dew Baja Blast   Because the Earth is not flat.   Unless he has a fedora.   Bitches love fedoras.   You have so much to learn young grasshopper.   Opium helps me fight the war within myself.   For some reason your link is not working?   How did you know I have opium? Are you hacking me? Aye, I am an old school gent and prefer the good old drugs of yesteryear, what's it to ye?   Marx was that guy who taught Hitler right?   That sounds like something an ugly person would say.   I was counting on you to give me a good joke.   Oh come on. We are vets. The darkness of our humor is well known, but we can't take it when a VA manager has some dark fucked up humor.   We joke about IED's, Hadjis, Suicide Bombs and the like all the time. Does this mean we don't have respect for our fallen brothers? Hell no.     Your grasp of history is the joke.   The Marines did not land at D-day. It was the Army. The largest amphibious assault in history was conducted by the Army. Remember that.   -U.S. Army NCO.   I have always thought Cambridge goat skin bibles were very nice. They will last forever.   Yeah, from what I see only 120 something US troops are involved. Seems like an interesting duty though.   That is not about being a military peacekeeper. That is abkut working dirrctly for the UN.   Peacekeepers are attached military members from Armed Forces of UN member nations. They wear their own nation's uniform and remain members of their nation's Armed Forces.  [This site](http://www.un.org/en/peacekeeping/resources/statistics/contributors.shtml) would be more applicable.       How do you get selected for that?   I assume an exclusive relationship from date one. I don't date more than one woman at a time.   If I don't want to continue a dating relationship I will tell her. If I want to date someone else I will discontinue dating the girl I was seeing, even if we only had one date.   Because women are just as capable of answering questions from a male perspective as men, duh.    No, it is a joke.   I agree. But after 239 years we have our own distinct flavor.  Plus, our first Drill Instructor was Prussian not British :). His Blue Book drew on Prussian traditions not British ones.   Ok, just curious.   Its cool learning about other traditions than my own.   If you can't maintain your discipline while you are in, you won't when you get out.  Circumstances/setting do not dictate discipline, willpower dictates discipline.   Spray on the neck and rub it in. One or two light sprays should be plenty.  As you sweat throughout the day the neck will release the scent.   You are not supposed to smell someones cologne until you are in close contact with them. It is an intimate touch not a blaring announcement.   To relax. As a married man I have zero interest in scouting out females. I like juke joints and honkytonks though. Good country music (preferably live) and cold beer helps me soak the stress of the week away.  Places I go everybody knowa everybody. Old guys, young guys, all of us just talk sports, politics and trade tall tales.   Do y'all salute enlisted men?   Really? I did not know that either.   When we present arms with a weapon we have a distinct movement where we hold our weapons in fron of us parallel to our bodies.   Yes.  Which is why I pegged that answer as Hooah bullshit.     RIP to my Brother from the North.  -An American Soldier.   I'm gonna recommend the obvious; *Starship Troopers*.   Awesome! I didn't know that about the Royal Navy. Thanks for schooling me.   Agh... FNGs.   Airborne is not just for infantrymen for one. I don't know what the hell he was aiming at with the CID shit.    Oh well, 3/10 attempt to take down a poser. Nice to see them give a shit though.     Whats the real history behind the open handed salute? Senior NCOs over here always say that the unvisible palm salute was reserved for Armies that never lost a war, which I have always taken as Hooah bullshit. Anyway, it got me curious, what is the real deal behind showing your palm when you salute?   [This](http://www.flamesofwar.com/hobby.aspx?art_id=4155) hobby site has a very helpful rundown.   Guess whos car is going on Craigslist? You provided me with all the details I need. Can I just have your phone number?   Hey, if it works it works.   Folks who condemn all fighting are usually just folks who don't know what it means to fight for something.  Also, we aren't talking about a disagreement over political parties, choice lf president or the like. We are talking about a group of pricks trying to *ban* the presence of a symbol which has cost far more than any of them can fathom.    Banning the presence of this symbol does not equal freedom of speech.   Yes. I never disputed that.    I don't think I would be able to restrain myself from losing my temper in this presence of such asshattery.    Just because its legal does not mean you won't get your ass kicked for doing it.   I never said I was an asshole. I am very kind to women, because my mother raised me right. I have respect for others.      Luckily I don't attend this school because I am too busy fighting for that flag.   Nah, I won't bother. I will just leave a downvote.      Please explain?   Thank you for the helpful answer   I see where you are coming from.  As a free market libertarian I have never met a socialist who agreed with me on market issues   So you are a socialist who believes in letting the free market solve problems?   Through the free market? Yes.   Through the state? No.    Join the Army and have a DS yelling 15 feet up your asshole and you will understand what I am saying.   I am not at all.. I have a leather heart and I don't give two flips about what someone else thinks about me. I am a salty veteran who doesn't fit into the parameters of what modern masculinity movements laud as good and wonderful (sensitivity, political correctness, emotionality etc).    What about y'all?   Edit; I don't mean I don't care, or have emotions, I am saying I don't spend my time caring whether someone likes me or not, or trying to tiptoe around how to say something. I say what I mean and mean what I say, and if someone does not like it they can shove off.   Do you really have to check my TA-50? I promise I packed everything...   I know a lot of guys who pick up their E-5 either try to stay "one of the boys" or they get a big power trip and walk around with a chip on their shoulder, still others just sit around as a buck sgt for 10 years not going anywhere.  So I wanted to ask y'all, what qualities make a good buck sergeant?   Fuck it. I am a soldier. I lost my filter in Afghanistan.   Fuck sensitivity. I have a leather heart.   What advice/anecdote from a SNCO have you recieved that has stuck with you over the years?   No, I am aware of the EOD attrition rate and EOD doesn't appeal to me. I like the traditional Army.   I don't just want to blow shit up (though that is certainly a plus). Engineers have lower points, way more opportunity for career progression, I could feel like I was actually doing something important, I am tired of the dumb bullshit of support units, etc.   Big ones;  WCF advocates baby baptism and a sacramental view of the Lord's Supper. The LBCF is the opposite.   Thats pretty much it.   Judging by his comment history he is an American Airman. So you are right, it is my bad.   I doubt the wristband fits the requirements set forth in AFI 36-2903 (6.3.1.2) due to the clause that states bracelets cannot advocate a cause or philosophy.  Granted, EOD units usually don't give a flying flip about regs anyway.   That wrist band is not authorized IAW AR 670-1 (3-4a).      Hemingway is hard to misunderstand. He is terse, he is short, and to the point. He says what he means and means what he says.  This does not mean his characters lack depth or flavor, but you don't have to wade through pools of flowery language to get there.   He is so Charmin, ultra good at flirting.That dude is smooth, Angel Soft even. He has a Bounty of awesome lines.    Brave Little Toaster ain't so brave when he is served up with hot sauce.    Afghanistan.    On a motorcycle? Never been close to death at all.   Yeah, they do some gear reviews.   It isn't specific to any sort of bike though. You will get cruisers, dualsports, supersports, they review them all. So if you are a hardcore v-twin devotee you might not care about the rest of the content.   I subscribe to *Motorcyclist*. I would say it is the equivilant of *Car and Driver*. Good bike reviews, good articles, interesting editorials.   Haven't even gotten your sideways license yet?  I am from Bama too. It is largely conservative, but certainly no bastion of 100 percent religious participation. Bham is a fairly liberal area. USA is a pretty liberal school. There is enough debauchery in my hometown to counteract all the churches.   Sweet. I would love a pm letting me know whats up after you finish!   Thanks for tje recommendation, but I am currently in an aviation unit and I hate it. I loved my old infantry unit.   Yup. Currently at Fort Drum, been here almost 3 yrs.   Probably better than spending endless hours in a clamshell counting parts.   Thanks, I hope so too. I am done with the support side, I have had enough. I'd like to see if the grass is greener on the other side haha    Because its a lot harder to go EOD than 12b and if I wash out of EOD school I end up right back in my current MOS.   Yup. I realized after I posted. Got it right the second time though.   Pretty much what the title says. My reup window is open, I hate my job, I hate how our points are always maxed. How does the reclass process work with 12b? I know those guys have OSUT, what point would I link up with the IET guys? Are reclass guys treated differently than IET guys? I know Combat Engineers don't really build anything, when I was deployed they mostly blew shit up. What is the day to day life of engineers like? Any other advice would be appreciated.

The NAM is a socialist movement.. Not to conducive to AnarchoCapitalism.   I thought it would be something related to Pooh's search for honeys    Except the ones that are marked "whites only".   This is funny because solar panels and wind turbines cannot speak IRL.   Lol.   People actually comment on imdb?   I found your shit.. in my toilet.. because i reddit on the toilet..    Or he demanded they turn over their forks, which he then pawned for cash.   She "took" it.   And I am a fish with fins.    Following nature's template. Growing things as closely as possible to the way they naturally do.   With regards to animals, replicating a natural environment, diet, and atmosphere for them.   I can testify firsthand to the corruption of the third world nations...  I have seen Afghan soldiers have to be physically restrained from running away.   I am not an anarchist. I support a small and decentralized state for the purposes of national defense and courts.    Whoa... No shit. I am stationed at Fort Drum. Bottle Caps is my local beer store.    Left Hand Brewing's Milk Stout Nitro. The very best stout on the market in my opinion.   A libertarian minarchist.   Ron Paul did. The Republican Liberty caucus does. Justin Amash does. Rand Paul kind of does.   Establishment guys like Jeb Bush and John McCain don't, but fuck those guys.  	135
